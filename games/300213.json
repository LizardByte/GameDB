Solve 2-4 hours worth of puzzles and collect items that will allow you to solve more puzzles. Defeat the witches of the underground to gain the materials needed for a ritual that will let you escape hell.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are simple. You can move in 4 directions, interact with things in front of you, and use items in your bag. The environment and roaming creatures can damage you, and you will die if your HP reaches zero. Some items may require MP to function, specially items used to kill enemies.\n\nThe puzzles are mean and intentionally obscure. It is recommended that you play along with a friend sitting by your side and solve the puzzles together.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harts-toil"}
