Zeus and his pantheon of Greek deities have ruled the Mediterranean, while Ra and his legion of Egyptian lords have held sway over the deserts of antiquity. Powerless, mankind has been at the mercy of their fickle ambitions since the dawn of history. Yet even the gods answer to a higher authority: the sisters of Fate. Silently watching the affairs of the cosmos with unknowable wisdom, these three Fates have intervened and declared an end to the reign of gods. Mortals must now be given a chance to prove themselves worthy of self-rule. \n \nA Tournament \nBut such a reward will not come easy. The gods will not surrender their throne without a fight. By decree of the Fates, a tournament has been set in motion between the divine pantheons and the champions of mankind. Open to mortals of every age, race, and creed, the tournament is a chance for humanity to prove its mettle in combat and triumph over the very gods who would extinguish all hopes of freedom. \n \nThe Stones \nStrategy is paramount. The only path to victory lies in mastering the Stones. These magical relics are weapons forged by the Fates themselves. The Stones bestow on their caster the power to summon mythological creatures from legends past and unleash dazzling spells on an opponent. Charged by a rare element known as \"mytheon,\" this alchemic ingredient allows anyone \u2013 young or old, man or woman \u2013 to harness the underlying forces of the cosmos and channel them into the Stones. A mortal's very survival depends on it, lest they meet their demise at the hands of a deadly bestiary arrayed against them. For the gods rarely play fair \u2013 they have stolen the secrets of forging Stones and now they too possess the secrets of summoning. \n \nChallenge Fate \nAn epic clash looms in this contest of the Stones. The destiny of the world lies in the balance. \nWill a hero rise to the challenge, mastering the trials and tribulation to free humanity? Or will the gods repel the challengers and maintain their iron grip across Earth? \nOnly those champions brave enough to test their courage will find the answer.", "summary": "Mytheon is an online, multiplayer action/RPG with strategic game play where players experience classic mythology come to life and challenge legendary gods to define their own fate.
