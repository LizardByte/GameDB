Well, Galactic Blasters D2 - Brilliant Supernova is the 5th Galactic Blasters game, and as the name suggests, it's a direct sequel to Galactic Blasters D - Future Darkness.\n\nSince that game released, I managed to improve upon Danmaku Fusion (my base for the modern Galactic Blasters games) quite a bit, making Galactic Blasters D2 look much better compared to its predecessor. I've also improved how the game plays, and added some new modes and gameplay elements which can be seen in this trailer.\n\nThe trial version of Galactic Blasters D2 is also available as of today, which means you can play the first four stages of the game (out of a seven stage long Story Mode, although I haven't gotten to the rest of the stages yet...).\n\nItch.io Page: https://rgamesofficial.itch.io/galacticblasters5\n\nRGames Discord Server: https://discord.gg/JVhfDGM6gC", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aAKs_bbocpU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aAKs_bbocpU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aAKs_bbocpU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aAKs_bbocpU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aAKs_bbocpU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Galactic Blasters D2 - Brilliant Supernova ~ Reveal Trailer", "description": "Today is the day that the newest Galactic Blasters game being developed, Galactic Blasters D2 - Brilliant Supernova, is announced.\n\nSo what is this game?
