They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, dwell in small gardens, consume bugs, and excrete tiny gems known as \"doo doo,\" which also serve as currency in this game. The goal of this game is to adopt a livly, place him in a desolate garden, and then transform it into a lush, blossoming paradise. Because livlies have particular abilities, one of which is fertility, simply allowing them to roam around the garden makes it healthier. To enhance the garden, the player purchases seeds from a store and plants a variety of flowers and trees.\n\nEach sort of plant you develop draws in a sort of bug: bugs, caterpillars, grasshoppers and butterflies. By getting and taking care of these bugs to your livly, you can show it new and helpful capacities.", "summary": "A pet simulation based on the browser communication game Livly Island from So-net Entertainment.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/livly-garden", "videos": [{"id": 107894, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "AgersQA1Q6E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgersQA1Q6E", "title": "Livly Garden", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AgersQA1Q6E/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
