The game puts a new twist on music games as you not only have to time button presses but you have to move the analog stick around in a radar circle to follow a line that passes through the center point. You can play up to 4 players using the multitap and choose from a variety of characters, songs, and locales.\n\nAlong with local Ad-Hoc multiplayer and additional difficulty options, the game adds a new Duet mode, in which two players control Gitaroo Man and Kirah in two exclusive new stages, \"Metal Header\" and \"Toda Pasi\u00f3n\". These levels may also be played alone if the handheld's Ad-Hoc is activated.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gitaroo-man-lives", "videos": [{"id": 66180, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tonV2IWTdp4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tonV2IWTdp4", "title": "GITAROO MAN LIVES!
