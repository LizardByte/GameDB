And while you may be alone, you certainly won't be underpowered, with eight different types of weapons, each having six power-up levels for a grand total of 48 firing modes (not counting bomb power-ups) Space Megaforce boasts one of the largest arsenals in 2D shooter history.\n\nGameplay is single-player only with 3 difficulty levels. Also included is a short campaign with different levels that plays mostly like a \"survival\" mode with the objective being to outlast the time limit and rack the most points.\n\nThis international release of Super Aleste features a different story compared to its Japanese counterpart.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-megaforce", "videos": [{"id": 62123, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rJVNw-zIFzo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJVNw-zIFzo", "title": "Space Megaforce (SNES) - No Death Run on Wild Difficulty", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rJVNw-zIFzo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
