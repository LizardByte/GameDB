{"id": "dwXPTLKWMyA", "snippet": {"title": "Doctor Hauzer (3DO) FULL GAME LONGPLAY", "description": "Doctor Hauzer is a 1994 survival horror-adventure video game developed by Riverhillsoft and published in Japan by Panasonic for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The player takes on the role of Adams Adler, a newspaper reporter investigating a mansion for clues to the whereabouts of the eponymous Hauzer, a famed archeologist who has mysteriously disappeared. The game tasks the player with navigating the large mansion by collecting useful items, solving various puzzles, and avoiding deadly traps.\n\nDoctor Hauzer has stark graphical and gameplay similarities with early titles in the Infogrames survival horror series Alone in the Dark, which feature 3D polygonal characters and objects set against fixed, pre-rendered backgrounds. However, Doctor Hauzer is the first of this genre to include fully 3D environments that the player can explore while freely swapping between third-person, first-person, and top-down perspectives. These characteristics were carried over into Riverhillsoft's next game, OverBlood.\n\n#DoctorHauzer #3DO #RaSan69\r\n\r\nSupport me with a donation: https://bit.ly/2kmcpTl\r\nPlaylists: http://bit.ly/2bJixyA\r\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/RaSanBR\r\nWatch me on Dailymotion: http://www.dailymotion.com/RaSan69\r\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rasan69", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwXPTLKWMyA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwXPTLKWMyA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwXPTLKWMyA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwXPTLKWMyA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dwXPTLKWMyA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Doctor Hauzer (3DO) FULL GAME LONGPLAY", "description": "Doctor Hauzer is a 1994 survival horror-adventure video game developed by Riverhillsoft and published in Japan by Panasonic for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer.
