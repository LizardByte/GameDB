Each time you hit one, you will lose 5 chocolates. There's very little grace period between running into one, which means you can lose all your chocolates very quickly if you aren't careful. Points are added depending on how many chocolates are in the basket when you reach the goal, for a maximum of 20 points per round.\n1:59: Rabu\u2764Shaffuru(Love\u2764Shuffle)\nPretty self-explanatory. It's basically shell game, find the hearts without finding any of the Fukoumori. On later levels you will have to find 2 hearts out of 6 dishes, so it does add something extra.\n4:15: Rabu\u2764Peinto(Love\u2764Paint)\nAnother self-explanatory one. Trace the shape without hitting any of the walls. Much easier said than done as on later levels hitting walls will cause the Fukoumori to erase some of your lines, which gets very annoying very fast.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TUES5-nH4ok/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TUES5-nH4ok/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TUES5-nH4ok/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TUES5-nH4ok/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Susumu Plays Fukoumori: Renaifukouri's Games", "description": "Fukoumori: Moririi no Unhappy Project is played on a daily basis.
