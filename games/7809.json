Also, for the first time in franchise history, up to four friends can hunt together online at once (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3). Once the hunt is done, friends can share their scores through online leader boards for bragging rights.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cabelas-north-american-adventures"}
