It is a simple, endless game of avoiding taking hits from obstacles and enemies in a scrolling field. The first level introduces ground spikes, which can be jumped over. The second level introduces a UFO-like object that flies toward Godzilla's head, which can be eaten. The third level introduces a giant bee that heads toward the back of Godzilla's head, and is defeated by using fire breath. Finally, the fourth level introduces a space shuttle-like object that cruises on the ground, which can be jumped over. \n \nGodzilla has 6 lives, and once they're gone the player has to start over. The game awards points for keeping Godzilla alive, however it doesn't keep track of high scores. \n \nThe game itself is completely silent, save for a brief voice sample when the game is started, and a loud, static-filled roar that Godzilla utters whenever he gets hit by an object.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/godzilla--4", "videos": [{"id": 38162, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VnIV60OyWhE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnIV60OyWhE", "title": "GODZILLA (Commodore 16 & Commodore Plus/4) Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VnIV60OyWhE/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3301, "name": "Godzilla"}]}
