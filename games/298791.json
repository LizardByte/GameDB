It could technically take place around the end of Schlo: Final Stand.\n\nThe focus of the game is on the Great Twelve descendants, a special group of humans living with the schlos. With 13 endings and a variety of antics sprinkled into a dating sim setting, the game should be at least a couple hours of fun.\n\nThe music was done by strawberry peeler.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/schlo-pink-and-purple"}
