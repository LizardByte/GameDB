Based on the cult post-apocalyptic film of the same name, the game serves as a bridge between the first film and the sequel which is in the works.\nThe game is inspired by metroidvania/run-and-gun platformer classic like Super Metroid, Mega Man X, and Out of the World, with modern mechanics and storytelling techniques.\n\nThe player will travel through five different zones in the order they see fit, meeting friends and foes along the way. They will have to defeat all the bosses in order to make it to the other side of the wasteland. Narrative elements are included, but are non-invasive, meaning one can skip them by simply not interacting with them making the game extremely repayable and speed-run friendly.", "summary": "Turbo Kid is a BMX-powered pixel-art Metroidvania gore-fest based on the film of the same name.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/turbo-kid", "videos": [{"id": 75068, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "w8fCxEExYa8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8fCxEExYa8", "title": "Comiccon Montr\u00e9al Trailer | Turbo Kid", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w8fCxEExYa8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 107642, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "d6UizZI0v4A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6UizZI0v4A", "title": "Turbo Kid - Official Release Date Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2024", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6UizZI0v4A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 133744, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LEQiUUf2X4g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQiUUf2X4g", "title": "Turbo Kid - Premium Edition Games - Physical Switch Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LEQiUUf2X4g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
