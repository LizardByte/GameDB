Shoot the spaceship for extra points. Choose one of three games. \n \nSpace Fever is a 1979 arcade game by Nintendo R&D2. Some sources claim that Ikegami Tsushinki also did design work on Space Fever. It was released in both monochrome and color versions. The gameplay is similar to Space Invaders, which had been released by Taito in 1978. It was distributed by Far East Video. \n \nThe gameplay of Space Fever is reminiscent of Space Invaders (1978), where the player controls a laser cannon situated at the bottom of the screen and must defeat waves of enemy aliens. The aliens are arranged in rows and slowly move to the edge of the screen, before descending and continuing in the opposite direction. As more aliens are defeated, they increase in speed. A UFO will occasionally appear towards the top of the screen, which can be shot down for bonus points. There are three game modes that change the way the aliens move; the first presents two formations of enemies that move in opposite directions, the second continuously adds additional rows of aliens, and the third is functionally identical to Space Invaders.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-fever", "videos": [{"id": 47471, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VEQpCtUHX6Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEQpCtUHX6Y", "title": "Arcade Game: Space Fever (1979 Nintendo)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VEQpCtUHX6Y/sddefault.jpg"}]}
