There is no writing in the game other than the symbol languages. The game uses visuals and sound to enhance communication with the player.\n\nAll conflicts and obstacles in Eloquence are cleared by using communication instead of violence. Eloquence furthermore has the mission to show that languages differ far less than you might expect, and that language is part of being human.", "summary": "Can you save the villagers living on an active volcano?
