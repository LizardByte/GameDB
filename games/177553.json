In a single player game the aim is to get the highest break (up to a maximum of 147) while the multi player game is simply about getting the highest score. The player starts with a red ball question and the player has to answer by choosing one of three alternatives before time runs out. After that the player can choose between balls of different colours with different subjects. There are six categories of questions: science & nature, pop music, geography, sports & pastimes, art and history. Each player can pass up to three red questions. In a multi player game an \"over pocket\" sign might appear and answering wrong will then lead to a foul shot. Foul shots lead to the opponents being awarded points.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/master-break"}
