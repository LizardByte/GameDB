From the four corners of the world powerful armies started to converge. Each claimed the right to absolute mastery over the new world. However, none of the invaders presumed that Karkhan had long been inhabited by an equally technologically advanced nation. That was how the devastating conflict began, a clash between hundreds of power hungry warriors. Which side you take depends on you, the player. You can either play the part of one of the newcomers and strive to declare yourself \"emperor of Karkhan\" or become a general of the native army and once and for all repel the invaders, together with their beliefs and customs.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clash--2"}
