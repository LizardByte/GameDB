A leaflet about it was included with the Japanese version of Mario Paint.\n\nA prototype (known as Sleep) was found in the Nintendo Gigaleak of 2020. It is a game where you help a sleepwalker traversing obstacles and shooting at projectiles. The game was made to be played using the Super Scope or the SNES Mouse. It has no sound and uses assets similar to those of Super Donkey (another prototype found in the Gigaleak, possibly related to the original Donkey Kong series) and Yoshi's Island.\n\nAs a game under the name of Sleep was never announced nor rumored, even though the game was never shown before and having a different name in the dataleak, Black Out and Sleep they are likely to be the same game given the time frame and the use of the SNES Mouse. Both games are also related to Super Scope 15 (a Super Scope compatible cancelled game) in the dataleak.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 55960, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nny81nnJ5uY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nny81nnJ5uY", "title": "Sleep Test/sleep_rom (SNES Prototype) - Full Walkthrough (read the description)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nny81nnJ5uY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
