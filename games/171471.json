Major projects are being launched around the world to tap into other objects in the solar system to fuel population and technological growth.\n\nOne of the most promising missions in this new space race is in the hands of Octal, an international consortium specialized in fossil fuels. With colossal financial resources and a technological lead, Octal is preparing to land the first human crew on Io, the inner moon of Jupiter, chosen for its relative proximity and abundance of rare metals.\n\nAlthough the company has been working on the preparation of the Io-1 mission for more than two decades, it is no less perilous. Subject to the terrible tidal forces of Jupiter, Io is home to violent volcanism, a tenuous and toxic atmosphere and temperature variations of several thousand degrees. No wonder that in these conditions, everything does not go exactly as the experts had anticipated.", "summary": "The Pioneers: surviving desolation is a survival/simulation game for PC. You play as a crew of specialists isolated in a space station and trying to survive the climatic and geological threats of Io, the first moon of Jupiter.
