You, as Billy, must catch them before the hit they ground. If you get them all, it is off to the next, faster, level. If you miss eight, then you go to a shooting screen.\n\nOn the shooting screen, gremlins are approaching from the distance. You must shoot them before they reach you. If one reaches you, you lose a life. After they are all dead, it is back to the first screen at a faster level. In later levels, puddles of water will divide the gremlins in two.\n\nA different version of the same name was also released for the 5200, Commodore 64 and Apple II.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gremlins--1", "videos": [{"id": 123873, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "aB2zpI7Wd1M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB2zpI7Wd1M", "title": "GREMLINS -ATARI 2600-", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aB2zpI7Wd1M/sddefault.jpg"}]}
