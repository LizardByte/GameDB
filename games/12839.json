One or two players may play but always against the computer. In a two player game, both players play as a doubles team.\n\nThe game starts off looking behind the player as the style of serve is chosen (top spin, curve, etc) and then it switches to a top down view for the rally.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/passing-shot"}
