You play as Chui, who's trying to complete an essay while sleep deprived. The main goal is to explore and collect effects and items. There is also a collectible currency called Muns, which can be used to purchase items in the dream world.\n\nThere are two bars displayed on the top-left corner of the screen: ZZZ's; which act as a life bar for the player character that depletes when the player runs into a hazard in the dream world, and PRG which represents how much of the essays been written and increases each time the player works at the table."}
