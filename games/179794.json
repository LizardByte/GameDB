As a Satellaview title, Nintendo developed the video game and released four versions of it through the satellite download service operated by St.GIGA, each expanding on or replacing the features of the last.\nAudio broadcasting of the game is both advice on the game and voice drama told by characters. Voice actors are the same as that of \"BS Super Mario USA\", but Excitebike adds a new character, Wario (Chikao Ootsuka).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 58692, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ebONnHvs6LI"}]}
