The scant survivors hid in underground shelters and spent near a century in hiding. When the radiation dissipated enough for the ground to be safe, many groups of survivors resurfaced again and began re-colonizing the world, reconstructing civilization.\n\nYou grew up in Shelter 507, living a safe life until a day, not long ago, when your leaders and elders decided to open up the doors finally. That hope was cut short with rusty blades through your family's necks. Later on, you discovered the killers were members of a human trafficking organization who called themselves the 'Black Death'. But at that moment they were just like walking nightmares, coming from the sun-scorched exterior to kill everyone you had known and loved for your whole life.\n\nSomehow, you managed to flee and survive and were nurtured back to health in a nearby settlement. But nothing comes for free in this new world, and you'll have to earn your due\u2026", "summary": "Nuclear war ended human civilization, but it could never uproot the evil within our hearts. Fight, trade, negotiate, raid\u2013 do whatever it takes to survive in the wasteland. You will have to be as clever as ruthless to thrive in a broken world, torn by war, cruelty, hunger and slavery.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dust-to-the-end", "videos": [{"id": 63073, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gGcr5LVZyR0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGcr5LVZyR0", "title": "Dust to the End Full Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gGcr5LVZyR0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
