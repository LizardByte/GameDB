In case anyone is concerned, I'm not just doing movies.  I think its finally time to say that I have a whole collection of stand alone DVD games as well, so if you have any suggetions on what I should record for them let me know.\n\nAlso I should note that I left out the Dress Up Lenny game from the list.  So, for some reason, the game tends to crash my DVD player when I get  a minute or two into it, and I have to stop playing the DVD and play it again to try and fix it.  It doesn't work, meaning my DVD player might not be up for doing games like that.  So this sparked the idea of having some outside help in getting DVD footage.  If anyone is interested in helping me record any games that either I can't seem to complete, or have DVDs that I don't have, consider joining my Discord, and we can work together for content.  The link will be in the bottom of the description\n\nThis coming Tuesday, learn about the food chain of the deep ocean blue with Fish Eat Fish.  (Not Sponsored by Cousteau Society) In this game, you have to make a guess which of two undersea animals eat the one displayed on the chart.  As you go up the food chain, you will learn an interesting fact about the animal you chosen, even if you get a wrong answer.  Finish the game by reaching the top of the undersea food chain, and you'll be treated to a photo gallery where it showcases amazing creatures such as jellyfish, sharks and other animals that weren\u2019t mentioned in the game.  Honestly a nice little reward for playing the game.\n\n0:00 - Intro: Dive Down To The Sea\n0:12 - Instructions\n\nTRANSITIONS\n1:00 - Fishing Waters\n1:05 - Algae - Fishing Waters\n1:10 - Zooplankton - Seaweed Underbrush\n1:21 - Clam - Whale Wash Building\n1:34 - Crab - Sea Cliffs\n1:45 - Reef Fish - Southside Reef\n1:55 - Octopus - Upper Southside Reef\n2:05 - Tuna Fish - Top Of The Reef\n\nCORRECT: FISH EATS FISH\n2:17 - Zooplankton Eats Algae\n2:23 - Clam Eats Zooplankton\n2:29 - Crab Eats Clam\n2:38 - Reef Fish Eats Crab\n2:44 - Octopus Eats Reef Fish\n2:51 - Tuna Fish Eats Octopus\n2:58 - Great White Shark Eats Tuna Fish\n\nINCORRECT: FISH DON\"T EAT FISH\n3:12 - Rocks Don't Eat Algae\n3:17 - Jellyfish Don't Eat Zooplankton\n3:21 - Shrimp Don't Eat Clams\n3:29 - Coral Doesn't Eat Crabs\n3:34 - Starfish Don't Eat Reef Fish\n3:38 - Clownfish Don't Eat Octopi\n3:44 - Baleen Whale Doesn't Eat Tuna Fish\n\nWHO EATS WHO?\n3:52 - Who Eats Algae?\n4:39 - Who Eats Zooplankton?\n5:26 - Who Eats Clams?\n6:13 - Who Eats Crabs?\n7:00 - Who Eats Reef Fish?\n7:47 - Who Eats Octopi?\n8:34 - Who Eats Tuna Fish?\n\nANIMAL FACTS\n9:21 - Algae\n10:07 - Zooplankton\n10:55 - Clams\n11:42 - Crabs\n12:28 - Reef Fish\n13:15 - Octopus\n14:02 - Tuna Fish\n14:49 - Great White Shark\n15:36 - Rocks\n16:23 - Jellyfish\n17:10 - Shrimp\n17:57 - Coral\n18:44 - Sea Star\n19:31 - Clownfish\n20:18 - Baleen Whale\n\n21:05 - Sealife Slideshow - by Cousteau Kids\n22:26 - Ending - Sharks Run The Reef\n22:40 - Cousteau Society Credits\n22:45 - Play Again?\n\n23:32 - Casual Playthrough\n\nJoin My Discord - https://discord.gg/8wGjBtMm\nFollow My Twitter - https://twitter.com/ArbAlec\n\nHave A Great Day.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CFM8Bvjl11o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CFM8Bvjl11o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CFM8Bvjl11o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CFM8Bvjl11o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CFM8Bvjl11o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Shark Tale - DWK Game - Fish Eat Fish", "description": "NEXT - Shark Tale - DWK Game - Place Your Bets\nTHEN - Chill Out Scooby-Doo! - Set Top Game - Shangri-La Showdown\nLATER - Kung-Fu Panda - Special Feature Game - Dragon Warrior Training Academy\n\nBack on the Dreamworks train with Shark Tale.
