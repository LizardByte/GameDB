Kusuhara teams up with his friend, Amamiya Kakeru, in an attempt to steal Mizunashi Sorano's memories from the server where they were stored.\n\nIn the midst of this, the two discover the secret of the Connect Centers, and are suddenly embroiled in the fight taking place behind the scenes.", "summary": "A sci-fi themed visual novel developed by LizArts that takes place in a future where human memories can be saved and record.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
