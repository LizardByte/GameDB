Scavenge the environment to find useful resources, craft items, construct a shelter, and then recruit companions to help defend against hordes of the undead and other hostile survivors. Venture out into dangerous forest areas in search of valuable loot... but be careful as everyone might not make it home in one piece! \n \nA richly engaging and rewarding story full of unforgettable characters and mysteries will take hold of players as they explore the world of Z-Alert, while random elements such as world generation and surprise encounters guarantees each new game is as exciting and as fresh as the last. \n \nPlayable in both online or offline mode, Z-Alert puts player choice front and centre with a number of highly customisable systems \u2013 from difficulty and UI to character skills and perks. While a choice between hands-off automated combat, classic 2D skirmishes or tactical isometric encounters ensure players have complete control of their survival experience.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/z-alert", "videos": [{"id": 17950, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IxjaWJEqwxc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxjaWJEqwxc", "title": "Z-Alert Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IxjaWJEqwxc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
