After finding Victor's time machine, Charlotte tries to use it to return to her time but fails. Victor appears on a monitor and says that all time-displaced characters must be present for them to be returned to their respective times. Victor also asks the detective to help determine where each character came from and gather them all in the dining room so they can return them to the past to keep any time paradoxes from happening.\n\nThe detective locates the other characters:\n\nDr. Goodwell, Lucy the Breaded Lady, and Franco the Excessive from Madame Fate\nBenjamin Wright from Broken Hour\nHenry Sharpe from The Black Veil\nAllison Sterling from Dire Grove\nGranny Goodlittle from Huntsville\nan automaton from Escape from Ravenhearst.\nHooking all the characters to the time machine with time helmets, the detective and Victor activate it, but Charles's soul suddenly emerges from within the time vortexes. The detective is able to stop Charles's return as everyone is sent back to their respective times, with Victor escaping in the time machine.\n\nIn the Bonus Content, Benjamin informs the detective that fragments of Charles' soul are spread throughout time and are causing problems to the time periods.
