The title is actually a play on the Japanese word for Prime Minister, \"Sori\". The game satirizes Tanaka's greed by making the goal of the game acquiring gold bars. This arcade game made it into some of the United States arcades.\n\nThe goal is for the greedy protagonist to collect all the gold bars while jumping over or defeating various enemies and obstacles in each maze-like level. Some of these enemies are: Giant Baba (a Japanese wrestler), a moonwalking Michael Jackson, Madonna, Japanese comedian Tamori, Carl Lewis, moving statues (activated when passed by). Some obstacles include: Gates, \"fire\" hydrants, safes (making it difficult to gain access to the gold), a rolling barrel, conveyor belts, and a swimming pool with platforms ranging in size and strength. When you collect all the gold in a given level, you must cash it into a building (labeled \"out\" when the level begins and \"in\" once you retrieve all the gold) to beat the level. The player can only hold ten bars of gold at once. In later levels there are more than 10 bars of gold, so the player must make multiple deposits.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/im-sorry"}
