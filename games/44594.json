They can even \"drop the hammer\" like Cole Trickle for a boost of extra speed. As players race to the top of the scoreboard, they will unlock car customization options and bonus tracks.Depending on how players place in races, take the lead in laps, and pick up new sponsors, they will win in-game currency necessary to refuel, make pit stops, and upgrade their cars. Players' driving styles will be monitored by an in-game tracking system, allowing players to be approached by like-minded sponsors.\n\nIn Days of Thunder: NASCAR Edition, up to 12 people can race to the finish online, log the fastest times on the leader boards, or push themselves to the limit in single-player. There are four different modes - Quick Race, Time Trial, Career, with circuits of varying difficulty, and Derby Mode, where players are encouraged to deal as much damage as they can.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/days-of-thunder-nascar-edition"}
