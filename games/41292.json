Michael has to catch floating letters in order to spell out English words, while avoiding the incorrect letters. The game has various different backdrops, including space. \n \nThe character of Michael comes from the Japanese serial manga strip \"What's Michael\", created by Makoto Kobayashi which might be considered analogous to Garfield, due to them both being orange cats. It varies between observing goofy pet behavior to more abstract tales of fantasy with anthropomorphized versions of the animal characters.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/michael-english-daibouken"}
