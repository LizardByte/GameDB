In this all-time classic, you'll be running left to right, up and down, and catching wolves of all colors and sizes!\n\nHopefully, the WolfSnatchers will be able to catch those troublemakers Arf, Barf, Zarf, and Reginald; That is, unless something terribly unexpected doesn't happen...\n\nDuring this special event though, something has happened to the usual wolves that inhabit the warehouse.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-werehouse"}
