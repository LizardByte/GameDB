Just create a lobby to play the Faul! game with your friends. You can invite your friends by sharing the link of the lobby with them. Each team can have a maximum of 5 people.\n\nThe red team always starts the game first. In order to reach the set target score, the narrator tries to explain the words before him to his teammates without using the forbidden words. While a team is telling, a person from the other team can check the banned words.\n\nThe first team to reach the target score wins the game. It is easier to reach the target score as the red team is always the first narrator. Therefore, for the Blue team to win the game, it is sufficient to get 2 points less than the target score. To explain this with an example, if the game ends with 20 points, it is enough for the blue team to collect 18 points.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/faul"}
