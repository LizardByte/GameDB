The original version on PC - Windows with no commentary.\n\nYou can support my channel here:\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/c/NoirStation\n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/The_NoirStation\n\u25ba Leave a tip using Super Thanks!\n\nNick Bounty: A Case Of The Crabs! Is a funny, adventure, point and click video game. Developed and published by Pinhead Games in 2004. Initially made as a flash game on the internet, but later remade as a fully fledged title in 2020. (Look for - Nick Bounty: A Case Of The Crabs! Rehash!) Story follows the main protagonist, a goofy detective named Nick Bounty who is investigating the counterfeit crab case. \n\nNoirStation Rating: - 3 Out Of 5 - A very good game and a homage to the classic point and click titles. However, this is a rare instance where I prefer the remake or better known as the rehash version. I just like the simplistic, straight to the point game mechanics of the modern point and click games. Rather than the old school multi optional interface. Also the remake feels more lively with better dialogues, richer world, and so on, you've got the point.\n\nVideo Chapters:\nNick's Office - 00:00:00\nShiny Barnacle - 00:02:54\nNick's Office 2 - 00:05:05\nBlue Crab Cafe - 00:05:45\nThe Boss - 00:09:18\nBlue Crab Cafe And Jim's Shack O' Crabs - 00:10:55\nThe Boss 2 - 00:13:49\n\nThis video is recorded, played in my style, and edited by me.
