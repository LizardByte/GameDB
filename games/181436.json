As alien ships are destroyed, they drop a number of power ups. Some of these power-ups contain maps which fill in the screen in the bottom left, allowing the player to advance to the next level when completely filled. The goal is to return to Earth, and there are 10 levels in total. The player starts with 5 lives, and it's game over when all are lost.\n\n- Naxos: Played from a first person perspective, the player must shoot alien creatures as they appear on the screen. If the aliens are allowed to shoot, the player takes damage. The player has limited ammo, and must continually reload. The player has a health bar, and when all health is depleted, it's game over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
