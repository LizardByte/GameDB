All of that while the warriors try to avoid deadly strikes which can kill them in one or two hits.\n\nBringing back loved characters from the first game, One Strike, and adding four more characters, the game will have a compact but quite unique set of six warriors the player can choose from. Alongside the hand-drawn characters and scenarios, the game will come with a brilliant original soundtrack.", "summary": "Two Strikes is a casual 2D fighting game with beautiful hand-drawn animations.
