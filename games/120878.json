Rebuild civilization back to what it once was by building huts, harvesting potatoes and expanding your reborn society to other continents and eventually other planets. Manage resources, discover ancient tech and create a multi-planet network of colonies to thrive in your solar system.\n\nBut the universe is not always a safe place. Ancient guardians, remnants of your ancestors, will demand your attention and challenge your cities. The planets you inhabit are scarred by the disasters that forced your forebears underground, and those disasters will still plague you if not managed properly. And most of all, watch out for vast planet-eating space whales coming to graze on your planets!\n\nBefore We Leave is a (mostly) non-violent game. There are no weapons, no fighting your neighbours for control of resources and unless you fail to handle an incoming space whale, your people will not die. Play, expand and chill out at your own pace in your own solar system of rehabilitated planets!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "videos": [{"id": 28777, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sFoiJMtNVF4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFoiJMtNVF4", "title": "Before We Leave - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sFoiJMtNVF4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 59635, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Ghu4LkqtjVU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ghu4LkqtjVU", "title": "Before We Leave - Coming to Xbox Game Pass!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ghu4LkqtjVU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 72276, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "Tf5Ny-kdxNI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf5Ny-kdxNI", "title": "Before We Leave | Nintendo Switch Announce Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tf5Ny-kdxNI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
