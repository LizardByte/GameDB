It\u2019s a New NDS Hack ROM and based on Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky!\n\nNew Pokemon from Gen 5 to 8, New Dungeons, New Dialogues, Fairy Type, and other features\u2026 It\u2019s completed in English. And now, Let\u2019s play!\n\nWith Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell, you can expect :\n\u2013 A very high difficulty.\n\u2013 New starters and new Pokemon from generations 5 to 8.\n\u2013 New dungeons, boss battles and items.\n\u2013 New dialogues (lots of memes and humor).\n\u2013 The fairy type added.\n\u2013 And other features.\n\nFEATURES AND NEW MECHANICS\n\nRandom features :\n\n\u2013 You will have access to \u201cfarms\u201d dungeons with the spinda coffee. You will be able to farm the IQ, money, and get some importants items like the Friend Bow.\n\n\u2013 Some pokemon abilities have been changed or added. I won\u2019t spoil everything, but for example, Cranidos gets Rock Head, Ninetales gets Drought, Ponyta and Rapidash get Quick Feet instead of Run Away etc\u2026\n\n\u2013 The puzzles in the Aegis Cave will be much easier to do, the stones will take less time to find, for example the Ice Aegis Cave will only have Unown I, C and E.\n\n\u2013 5 dungeons \u201cThe Hell\u201d, all with different characteristics (For example, The Hell North will be the succession of all the bosses with \u201crest room\u201d between 3 bosses) but an extreme difficulty.\n\n\u2013 Some Pok\u00e9mon will have their shiny forms in the game. The list of Pokemon and their location is further down in the thread.\n\n\u2013 When a legendary Pok\u00e9mon has 999 IQ, he can change his form to shiny. Giratina will be able to freely change between its two forms when he has 360 IQ. Dialga will be able to change his form and become Primal Dialga with 360 IQ as well.\n\n\u2013 The effect of some attacks has been changed. For example, Surf hits the whole room, Knock Off deals damage, Howl affects all allies, and many other changes and adjustments. Speed increasing moves have received a big PP nerf.\n\n\u2013 The speed increase and decrease time has been reduced.\n\n\u2013 After graduating from the guild, you will have access to the futures dungeons.\n\n\u2013 In the basic game, pokemons appear every 36 turns. Here, they will appear every 11 turns.\n\n\u2013 All Pok\u00e9mon in the game will be recruitable, including Purple Kecleon and Arceus.\n\n\u2013 The Oran Berry now gives 250 HP.\n\n\u2013 Intimidator IQ Skill now has a 16% chance to activate instead of 32%.\n\n\u2013 Pok\u00e9mon now have their egg moves as well as their new attacks in their level up moves.\n\n\u2013 The Marowak Dojo will feature 4 very difficult floors and an extremely difficult boss at the end. I recommend you to try it only after finishing the post-game.\n\n\u2013 There are many more features, but I let you discover them by playing the game.\n\nNew gameplay mechanics :\n\n\u2013 After the quiz, you can choose if the starter suits you or not, like in the recent PMD games (thanks to irdkwia).\n\n\u2013 You don\u2019t have a boring tutorial when you start the first dungeon (thanks to End45).\n\n\u2013 Teammates can now activate traps (thanks to Cipnit).\n\n\u2013 All Pok\u00e9mon gain experience points, even those that have not been in the dungeon, as in recent PMD games (thanks to irdkwia)\n\n\u2013 By pressing start, you can change between automatic and manual mode. The manual mode allows you to completely control your team during their turn (thanks to Cipnit).\n\n\u2013 There is the Move Shortcuts system like in the recent PMD games. By pressing L + A/B/X/Y, you can choose a move to use (thanks to End45 and irdkwia).\n\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25baFOLLOW DEMONEYESZERO HERE\u25c4\u25c4\u25c4\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DemonEyesZero\nFollow me on Facebook: http://Facebook.com/DemonEyesZero\nFollow me on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/truedemoneyeszero", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HBJg2Zw7cyU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HBJg2Zw7cyU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HBJg2Zw7cyU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HBJg2Zw7cyU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HBJg2Zw7cyU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell | EP.1 | Expert Difficulty | No Commentary", "description": "\u2605 Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell - Episode 1 \u2605\n\u2193\u2193\u2193 Information below \u2193\u2193\u2193\n\n\u25ba\u25ba\u25baINFO ON VIDEO\u25c4\u25c4\u25c4\nEpisode 1 of Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Hell (No Commentary) is here! \n \n\u25ba\u25ba\u25baINFO ON GAME IN VIDEO\u25c4\u25c4\u25c4\n\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34WARNING\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34 - Game have strong language & Dark humor, please don't watch if you do not like stuff like this!!!!!!\nName: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Hell\nRemake from: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky\nRemake by: babou\nDiscord : https://discord.gg/6QbPHYZDtg\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/babouzzz\nYouTube : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWjtumvKtviLAyRAap8ztw\n\nDescription:\nWe will play Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Hell by Babou!
