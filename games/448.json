Nogova is located a short distance from the Malden Islands, and its natural beauty spots are juxtaposed with built-up areas which still haven't recovered from years of socialist ideology and lifestyle.\n\nHowever, the situation changes when a Soviet force invades the island group and destroys Troska's idyllic dreams.
