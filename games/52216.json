Now, with two little furballs on your hands, you've got an even bigger job. Use up to two PlayStation Move motion controllers (not included) to feed, nurture and entertain your pets, or hand one of them off to a friend or family member for a little help, and earn Pet Tokens for doing a great job. You love to dress up your EyePet, and this time, you can bedazzle him with outfits and toys of your own design as you craft them in the Creativity Center. A whole new toy chest offers plenty of new play options, including a laser pointer your pets will love to chase and a trick stick that will keep playtime fun. Plus, a variety of new games to play, activities to explore and tricks to teach are sure to keep you on your toes for nonstop fun. At the end of the day, you'll want to share all of your fun pet-filled memories, and it's easier than ever now that you can log on to the all-new EyePet community and hang out with other EyePet lovers. If you thought that one pet was fun, get ready for double the trouble as your PlayStation pal brings along some new furry Friends.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eyepet-and-friends--1", "videos": [{"id": 68116, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "J3_6EVEO_Qw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3_6EVEO_Qw", "title": "EyePet and Friends - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J3_6EVEO_Qw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 68117, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XNKnuY8fvOY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNKnuY8fvOY", "title": "EyePet & Friends Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XNKnuY8fvOY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
