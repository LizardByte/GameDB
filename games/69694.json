The third in the row of Farland Story games, this title looks and plays very similarly to the first two games. You navigate your party over the world map in turn-based fashion. After you have assigned commands to your party members, it is the enemies' turn. You can attack physically when enemies are in range of your weapon, or cast spells - each character in your party belongs to a certain class and specializes in different type of combat. You gain experience points directly from hitting an enemy, even while counter-attacking, and can therefore level up in the middle of a battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farland-story-tenshi-no-namida", "videos": [{"id": 67188, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1NzlovewjVs"}, {"id": 67189, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "5CUjOSIrJrg"}]}
