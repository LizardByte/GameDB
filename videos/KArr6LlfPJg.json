{"id": "KArr6LlfPJg", "snippet": {"title": "Skies of Arcadia Official Trailer (2000, Overworks/Eyeworks/Sega)", "description": "I was sooooooo happy when this game was announced for GameCube.\n\nSkies of Arcadia, released in Japan as Eternal Arcadia (\u30a8\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2?), is a role-playing video game developed by Overworks for the Dreamcast and published by Sega in 2000. It was ported to the GameCube in 2002 as Skies of Arcadia Legends, featuring minor enhancements. Legends was in development for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows, but both ports were canceled shortly before the GameCube version's release. The game's story focuses around Vyse, a young air pirate in a Jules Verne-inspired fantasy world, and his friends as they attempt to stop the Valuan Empire from reviving ancient weapons with the potential to destroy the world.\n\n\nThousands of years before the events of Skies of Arcadia, six civilizations coexisted on floating continents in the titular skies of Arcadia, a world with no apparent surface that is orbited by six moons of different colors. The civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, as well as the Moon Crystals that could be used to control them. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, which caused enormous environmental harm and threatened the extinction of all six. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent the Rains from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away.\n\nIn present time, the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire, led by Empress Teodora, seeks the Moon Crystals to awaken the Gigas and take over the world. Valua's will is enforced through the Valuan Armada, a fleet of iron-clad warships led by senior admiral Galcian and vice admiral Ramirez under the authority of the Empress. They are primarily opposed by the Blue Rogues, a faction of air pirates who make it a point to harass the Armada as much as possible. Fina, a girl from the Silver Civilization, is sent to find the Moon Crystals before the Valuans and bring them to a safe place. She is quickly captured by an admiral of the Armada, then rescued by a group of Blue Rogues, among them fellow protagonists Vyse and Aika. Although the shy and withdrawn Fina is initially reluctant to trust Vyse and Aika, she opens up to them after she is recaptured by the Armada, but again rescued. Vyse and Aika agree to join Fina on her mission to gather the Moon Crystals.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KArr6LlfPJg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KArr6LlfPJg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KArr6LlfPJg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KArr6LlfPJg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Skies of Arcadia Official Trailer (2000, Overworks/Eyeworks/Sega)", "description": "I was sooooooo happy when this game was announced for GameCube.\n\nSkies of Arcadia, released in Japan as Eternal Arcadia (\u30a8\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2?), is a role-playing video game developed by Overworks for the Dreamcast and published by Sega in 2000.
