The main character possessed the ability to see and interact with spirits since youth, and was ostracized because of this ability.\n\nThe students of the Will-O-Wisp school are sent away to a summer school by the Valencia seaside despite warnings that several students from other schools had gone missing on the beach in the past. One afternoon, a strange monster called an Enigma appears on the beach, abducting some of the students. The hero must find the missing students and uncover the mysteries of the Enigma and war that occurred in the kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magical-vacation", "videos": [{"id": 57293, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fAL5zmfXHmk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAL5zmfXHmk", "title": "\u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30d0\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fAL5zmfXHmk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
