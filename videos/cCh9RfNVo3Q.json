It\u2019s an experience where every object has been carefully placed to tell a poignant story\u2014a story about childhood, hope, and the miracle of memory. You play as a little girl from a broken home somewhere in the American South. Exploring the lonely countryside reveals clues and vignettes which help the player answer the question of where home is\u2014and how one can get there.\n\nYou can purchase my game on Steam or on Itch.io (DRM-free).\n\nSteam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/355970/\nItch.io: http://whelly.itch.io/home-is-where-one-starts\nHumble Bundle Store: https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/homeiswhereonestarts_storefront\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DavidWehle\nWebsite: https://homeiswhereonestarts.wordpress.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCh9RfNVo3Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCh9RfNVo3Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCh9RfNVo3Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCh9RfNVo3Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCh9RfNVo3Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Home is Where One Starts...
