Why, recruit your mother, brother, and 40 other Citizens of Earth to fight for you, of course!\n\nBeing the Vice President of the World means asking not what you can do for your countrymen, but what your countrymen can do for you!\nThe retro-inspired game begins just after the VP has won a long, drawn-out candidacy and returned to his hometown for some taxpayer-funded rest and relaxation.  But after just one night passes, the VP awakens to find the world gone berserk!  As elected official he has two responsibilities: investigate what's caused people to go crazy... and delegate as much of the dirty work as possible.\n\nCitizens of Earth will be available in North America and Europe later in 2014 as a download-only title for PC, PlayStation\u00ae4 computer entertainment system, PlayStation\u00aeVita handheld entertainment system, Nintendo 3DS\u2122, and Wii U\u2122.
