The game is a role-playing game based on the works of Japanese author, Kenji Miyazawa, and its release was intended to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of his birth. The game is a sequel to the 1993 Hecht game for the SNES, Ihatovo Monogatari, earlier-broadcast for the Satellaview as well. Intended as a family-oriented game for all ages, the game makes reference to many classic works of Japanese children's literature.\n\nBS Ihatovo Monogatari incorporates voice narration at the start of each weekly broadcast to provide dramatic performances of Miyazawa's poetry set in Ihatovo. During gameplay, the Soundlink provides sound effects and gameplay hints for players. The game's voice actors were selected by popular vote by readers of Seiyu Zasshi and included Kikuko Inoue, Kouichi Yamadera, Yuka Imai, and Eiichi Onoda.", "videos": [{"id": 58603, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AfpElYpLH-Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfpElYpLH-Q", "title": "BS\u30a4\u30fc\u30cf\u30c8\u30fc\u30f4\u30a9\u7269\u8a9e\u3000\u7b2c2\u591c", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AfpElYpLH-Q/sddefault.jpg"}]}
