{"id": "H0aOG3g2HMU", "snippet": {"title": "Harley-Davidson & L.A. Riders Arcade", "description": "In Harley-Davidson & L.A. Riders, the player rides one of five Harley-Davidson models through three, four, or five stages, with the number of stages determined by the machine's settings. \nThe objective is to complete a series of checkpoints around Los Angeles under a time limit. The CPU randomly determines the checkpoint location and course route. \nThe player also has to collect many hidden items, such as \"tokens\" that resemble the Harley-Davidson logo, in order to earn bonus points. Tokens are worth 1,000 to 100,000 points, with more valuable tokens being hidden in obscure areas. Occasionally, the player will find special colored tokens floating around, which award 5 or 10 seconds of bonus time.\n\nPlayers choose one of five available Harley-Davidson models and can drive using either automatic or manual transmission. In manual transmission, the player has to shift gears with their left hand grip, with each bike having a 4 to 5 gear manual transmission.\n\nEach motorcycle (and its corresponding rider) features a different ending and failure animations. Depending on the player's progress through the game, the announcer will shout either \"Don't worry!\" or \"Try again!\"\n\nA silver FLSTF Fat Boy driven by Rick from Wisconsin (where Harley-Davidson originated).\nHe is with short blonde hair, sporting a black leather jacket over a white T-shirt and black jeans. The Fat Boy has a five-gear manual transmission with balanced attributes, and is most notable for being driven by the T-800 in the 1991 film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\n\nA yellow FL Panhead 1948 driven by Scott, a cowboy from Texas who wears a western-style natural leather jacket and light blue shirt. \nThe Panhead has a four-gear manual transmission, and is the only motorcycle in the game with less than five gears, thus being the slowest of the five motorcycles in-game.\n\nA blue FXDWG Dyna Wide Glide driven by Dave, an overweight motorcycle gang member from South Dakota, who wears a denim vest, bandana, and aviator sunglasses. The FXDWG and its rider are featured in virtually all the game's official artwork and promotional material.\nThe Dyna Wide Glide has a five-gear manual transmission, and is known for having poor acceleration but great handling, in addition to being the second fastest bike in the game.\n\nA red XL 1200S Sportster 1200 Sport driven by Anne, a blonde-haired woman from Florida who wears a black vest bearing the Sportster logo. \nThe Sportster has a five-gear manual transmission and is notable for having greater acceleration and handling than the rest of the motorcycles in-game.\n\n\nA white FXRP police motorcycle driven by Suzy, a brown-haired police officer. FXRP is a police motorcycle in the Harley-Davidson FXR series and debuted in 1988. It has a five-gear manual transmission and is known for being the fastest motorcycle in the game, reaching speeds over 120 miles per hour, or over 200 kilometers per hour. When pushing start using this bike, it will activate a police siren instead of horns from the other bikes.\n\nDuring gameplay, the player has the ability to choose from three different camera angles, select several different music pieces (some of which were recycled from other AM1-developed games such as Dynamite Baseball and Sega Ski Super G), and honk the bike with the start button. Like in any motorcycle racing game, the player can use Automatic or Manual Transmission. With Manual Transmission the player has to shift gears via his/her left hand-grip.\n\nIt is said that the idea Harley-Davidson & L.A.Riders was further refined by Sega development team AM3 in their 1999 arcade game Crazy Taxi.\n\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H0aOG3g2HMU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H0aOG3g2HMU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H0aOG3g2HMU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H0aOG3g2HMU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H0aOG3g2HMU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Harley-Davidson & L.A.
