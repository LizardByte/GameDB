Based on the Warhammer tabletop universe, and obviously inspired by films like ROAD WARRIOR, this crash-and-bash driving insanity is aggressive good-time fun. You play as one of the Ork survivors of a spaceship crash. You and your fellow Ork Mob members form up into rival gangs and must race in heavily armed vehicles in order to obtain one of the few berths on the left over escape ships. Each car holds a driver and a gunner; you control either position, quickly switching between them as needed while you race along the futuristic, metallic tracks, blasting the other drivers and competing for a first place finish. Not only is Single-Player Battle available, but multiplayer online contests against worldwide opponents are also offered via SegaNet. GORKAMORKA is a fuel-burning, shoot-and swerve affair for Dreamcast warriors everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://dreamcast.ign.com/objects/014/014352.html", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndLhrTw-wgA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndLhrTw-wgA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndLhrTw-wgA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "GorkaMorka [Dreamcast Combat Racing - UNRELEASED PROTO]", "description": "http://www.unseen64.net\r\n\r\n\"If you're a fan of fantasy, sci-fi worlds and car-based combat you'll find much to sink your teeth into in GORKAMORKA from Ripcord.
