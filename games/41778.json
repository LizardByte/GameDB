Your equipped with a machine gun, and with grenades that you can throw. \n \nThe game story starts when a helicopter leaves you in the middle of the action ... You are all alone and have to fight against the enemy soldiers who keep appearing from almost everywhere. \n \nYou will fight through the marshes, the tropical forest & the clearing by the temple to attempt to prevent you from reaching your goal - to reach the base at Khe Sanh and free the soldiers from the enemy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tnt"}
