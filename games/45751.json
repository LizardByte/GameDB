A kicks, C jumps. Pressing C twice causes the player to attack blocks underneath the player. Pressing B while next to a stone block allows the player to pick it up, and then he/she can drop it with the same button.\n\nPressing C + Start causes the level to reset. A + Start allows you to skip the level, though this can only be used three times during the course of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pyramid-magic"}
