The harsh environment on Mars will bring a lot of trouble to your colony. Low air pressure, high radiation, large sandstorms, etc. There is no future in dealing with various natural disasters.\n\nTherefore, you need to research more powerful technologies, build more powerful colonies, and then perform some surgery on Mars to make it more livable and you'll become the real master of Mars.\n\nBesides, there are stories and troubles where there are people. With the increasing colonial population, they have their own joys and sorrows, and they will also have various needs. If you ignore them, you are afraid that one day they will ruin the great future of Mars.\n\nSo, you need to build living and entertainment facilities, promulgate various welfare policies, and provide residents with all-around convenience for food, clothing, housing, transportation. When people have a happy life, the colony has a bright future, and the entire Mars Reshaping will be meaningful.\n\nThe place names in the game are all real Martian landform names, and they land at almost the correct geographical location according to latitude and longitude. For example, the Valles Marineris, the Acidalia Planitia, Tempe Fossae, etc.\nTherefore, even if you run the colony poorly, at least you have learned a lot about the geography of Mars, which may be useful when you go to Mars yourself, right?", "summary": "Reshaping Mars is a colony simulation game on Mars, you will start by gathering resources, storing food, accepting immigrants, and building a better colony together.
