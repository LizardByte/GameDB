At every stop, you first drive a qualification round against your opponent, which is in top-down perspective. Here, you can collect money and several power-ups to use to win against your opponent. After this qualification, you go into a side perspective head to head race, where you have to push left and right continuously. In this view there are all sorts of events, including Car Crush, Mud Race and Drag Race. Before these races, you can (read: must) also buy upgrades for your cars, with the money you collected in the qualify race.\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est 2007 includes gameplay captures from all commercial releases from the US market with a few extras (like famicom releases) just for fun.
