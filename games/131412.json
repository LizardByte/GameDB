The forces of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere attacked each other with everything their destructive arsenal had to offer. Nuclear, chemical and biological weapons wiped out entire countries. The combined effect of the weapons resulted in an unforeseen side effect; a supervirus emerged that mutated all the men on Earth. For unknown reasons the women were unaffected. But they weren't safe either...\n\nThe mutated men, though intelligent, lost touch with reality. From their corrupted minds a new order was formed; 'the Pax Pox'. Its first priority is to rid the world of the \"impure\".\n\nThe women who survived the war united to form an army against the mutant aggressors and called themselves \"the Amazons\".\n\nToday one of the Amazon outposts is attacked and their leader; Amira is taken captured. Her last hope is her loyal friend; Harmony.\n\nWill Harmony be able to rescue her friend and the rest of the human race?", "summary": "Harmony is a 11-level stand-alone total conversion, created by Thomas van der Velden (t.v.) and released after five years of development. In its updated 1.1 version, it is recognized as an IWAD by ZDoom 2.4.0 and newer.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of three songs from Ky\u016b's album \"The Edge\" (2009), specifically track #6 (\"Untitled\", used on MAP02, MAP03, MAP10 and MAP11), #7 (\"Mercury Stripes, Blue Mess\", used on MAP01, MAP04, MAP05, MAP08 and MAP09) and #10 (\"The Edge\", used on MAP06, MAP07, and the intermission, endgame and title screens). James Paddock (Jimmy) later created an optional MIDI pack providing a new, original soundtrack composed specifically for Harmony.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 53576, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2cCXrtUVhM4"}]}
