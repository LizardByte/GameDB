World Union's value system is similar to the society established in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, creating a certain level of societal expectations based on numerical indices pre-defined in the system that only take into account how much a person accumulates. Like Brave New World, the society is also extremely hedonistic, marriage (or \"nuptial contracts\" as they are called by the World Union) are obsolete, and relationships are entirely consistent of sexual interest, with multiple liaisons and even emotionless promiscuity, all of these are regarded as healthy relationships. Elements of Objectivism are included with the concept of pro-selfish attitudes, with citizens rated in numerical terms of skillfulness called an HDI (Human Development Index).\n\nThe story is centered on protagonist World Union Peace Officer Phoenix Wallis, who is investigating the murder of a fellow World Union citizen in a neighboring \"Rogue State\" in Odessa, Russia.\n\nThe game features multiple endings, based on the choices and actions of the player", "summary": "Culpa Innata (Latin: Innate Sin or Innate Fault) is a third person point-and-click adventure game by Istanbul-based developer Momentum AS and published by Strategy First.
