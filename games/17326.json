You have the power to dynamically alter the layout of your environment by interacting with a miniature scale model of the manor, located in its extravagant entryway.\n\nDynamically build the manor around you. Find miniature room models and carry them back to an increasingly elaborate scale model of the manor. Adjusting the model causes rooms to move and appear in real space, awaiting your arrival.\n\nEach new room exposes revelations into the troubling past of William Kraven. Face your fears and see if you have what it takes...the doors of Kraven Manor await you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
