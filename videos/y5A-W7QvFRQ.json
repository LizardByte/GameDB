Full version released on March 2, 2018.\n\n(Things may look different in the full released version of the game.)\n\nShortly before the release of BattleBlock Theater we started working on something new. We schemed up a bunch of concepts and picked our strongest one. From there we fleshed out the lone survivor prototype!!! As it grew stronger and stronger, we polished it, furnished it with delights, and added (gluten free?) sprinkles. Yes, as the chicken dictates, this game is of a genre we haven't covered before and seek to breathe a new flavor into. Maybe you can find a hint in the video about which genre it is??\n\n\n\nVideo Credits:\n\nArt/Animation: Dan Paladin\nVoice: Will Stamper\nEditing: Derek Lieu, Ian Moreno\n\n\nFollow us on the usual:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/thebehemoth\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thebehemoth\nGoogle+: http://www.google.com/+thebehemothgames\nPit People Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pitpeople", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5A-W7QvFRQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5A-W7QvFRQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5A-W7QvFRQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5A-W7QvFRQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5A-W7QvFRQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pit People Debut Teaser (Opening Cinematic)", "description": "Formerly known as \"Game 4\" | http://www.pitpeople.com\nOut now on Xbox One and Steams.
