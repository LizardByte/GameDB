The darkness is palpable, and the wind moans like an echoing wail. Desperate to find help, you venture through a shadowy cemetery that stretches in the direction of the only source of light you glimpse: an ancient mansion shrouded in terrifying legends.\n\nAs you make your way among the graves, killer bats flutter in the sky, emitting bloodcurdling screeches.

You must be quick and cunning to dodge his attacks.\n\nYou use your dodging skills and manage to avoid Death's scythe in a deadly dance. Finally, you find the opportunity to counterattack, and bravely take on Frankenstein. After a fierce fight, you manage to defeat him and the giant falls to the ground, inert.\n\nFinally, you discover an ancient coffin that contains the secrets of the heart of the beast and the way to escape from this world of nightmares.\n\nYou have managed to overcome all the horrors, defeat the monsters and find the solution to escape from the mansion of terror.
