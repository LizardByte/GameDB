Only you can save him now. Down some Pac-Pellets and get ready to battle your way through a totally supersonic side-scrolling adventure. Journey through snowy mountains and forests, collect fireballs and bubbles, crunch Pac-Bats and ghosts, swim like a fish and swing like a monkey... and ultimately get Pac-Man back to the real world! Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear versions were announced at CES 1995, but were ultimately cancelled for unknown reasons. A prototype of the Game Gear version has since been found and released online.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-in-time--3"}
