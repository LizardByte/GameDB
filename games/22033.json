The player starts the story by reaching the only \u201cJan Ken Pon\u201d dojo in the region, in the hope of being chosen by the Master of the dojo and so becoming an \u201capprentice\u201d.\n\nAt that point, the apprentices will be assigned a spirit guardian who will allow them to transcend the combat techniques of \u201cJan Ken Pon\u201d. They will discover that it is then possible to achieve a perfect partnership with their spirit guardians in order to perform special moves called \"Jin\u2019rais\".\n\nUnfortunately, just after their arrival, an apprentice will go to a cursed place in the dojo and release all the evil energy which was confined.\n\nThe balance of the world will then be broken. Who will manage to reestablish it?", "summary": "Ultimate Jan Ken Pon, BAKCORP STUDIO\u2019s first online video game is now available for free for Android users !\n\nAfter more than two years of work, the BAKCORP team has finalized its first mobile game.
