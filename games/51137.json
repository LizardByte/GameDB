Whether you are going for Bighorn Sheep in Alberta, Whitetail deer in the US Northeast, Elk in the Rocky Mountains or any of the other tons of animals and locations in the game, the two constants are speed and danger. Black Bear, Mountain Lions, angry Bison and host of other wild animals are all waiting to take you down. \n \nAnd if that's not scary enough, you can compete with three other hunters at one machine, or the entire world as you post your scores and achievements online. The game also offers a full-on two player cooperative campaign mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/remington-super-slam-hunting-north-america"}
