A personal project that took 2 years and a lot of life getting in the way to complete. During that time, I had almost no time for things like making games. This project is a hybrid between pixel landscapes and scenes I made back in the spring of 2019, and dialogue I wrote in the fall of 2020. Please explore, listen, and if you enjoy ramblings and reflection, you might have a good time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-dream-for-the-future"}
