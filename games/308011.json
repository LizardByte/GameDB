It was runner-up in The 1989 Games Writer Of The Year Award competition which is pretty cool. I've had this on my bucket list for a while because I always admired its 8-bit feel which reminded me of games I played as a youngster back in the early 80s.\n\nThe world is viewed two-dimensionally with a landscape populated by many destructible buildings and whacky vehicles which use the most frustrating mechanics. Our character is a tiny stickman who's on a mission to recover a dodgy nuke dropped behind enemy lines. However, this won't be easy because the baddies are constantly attacking so why not fire off a few heat-seeking missiles before jumping inside something probably stolen from the 1960s? On foot isn't fun, but if you see other stickmen wobbling across your screen then hit fire and gun 'em down!!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yomo", "videos": [{"id": 118912, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QPv1Fd1Sno0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPv1Fd1Sno0", "title": "Yomo for ATARI ST", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPv1Fd1Sno0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118913, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XmOlRKCcRoM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmOlRKCcRoM", "title": "yomo for Atari ST", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XmOlRKCcRoM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
