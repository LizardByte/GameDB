{"id": "pFTQh2vKOeE", "snippet": {"title": "Unfair Rampage: Knightfall - Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Wishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187470\nI have just created a game called Unfair Rampage: Knightfall - it's a fast-paced 2.5D platformer where you play a futuristic hero sent back in time to fix a broken timeline. Battle against knights, archers, flying enemies, siege weapons, and dodge lethal hazards.\n\nThe release is planned for late October after Steam Next Fest. \n\nI made this game for a few  reasons:\n1. I am creating an Indie Dev Program (think extended course!) where I go through everything from coming up with a game idea, prototyping the game, turning it into a proper game, polishing it, releasing it on Steam, and indie marketing. The Indie Dev Program will be announced later on, and every minute of creating this game was recorded so every key moment and decision can be shown in the program.\n\n2. I am making the game as a commercial project as I try to earn a living selling games, game assets, making YouTube videos and creating courses. This game will likely be priced between $5-$10 when released.\n\n3. I recorded the entire process of making this game so I can also make YouTube videos about many features, challenges, and solutions. I am looking forward to sharing that on my channel!\n\n4. I am practicing my skills for Ultranova which is a bigger more ambitious platformer than this game. Ultranova will be an Action _Adventure_ platformer (in contrast to this super fast precision platformer), and the development cycle for Ultranova is longer and requires a lot of story and additional planning and work. I am also learning Unreal Engine for Ultranova, but many of the lessons I have learned while making this game will benefit Ultranova greatly too.\n\nThanks for reading this far :) Wishlisting Unfair Rampage: Knightfall on Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187470) would greatly help my game development journey so thanks if you consider to do so.\nYou can support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/imphenzia\n\nThe palette texture used in this game to colorize every asset is public domain and can be downloaded from https://www.imphenzia.com - look for the ImphenziaPixPal texture in the asset section.\n\nLEARN LOW POLY Character Modeling - Blender 3.5 Full Course: https://youtu.be/PTWV67qUX2k\nWatch this video to learn every step of the way to create your very own characters!\n\nMy website:\nhttps://www.imphenzia.com\n\nUniversal Sound FX: \nhttps://www.imphenzia.com/universal-sound-fx\n\nImphenzia Discord server invite:\nhttps://discord.gg/sR7pZ4B\n\nMy Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/imphenzia/\n\nX\nhttps://x.com/imphenzia\n\nMy Itch.Io page with all my Ludum Dare games:\nhttps://imphenzia.itch.io/\n\nImphenzia Merch:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/imphenzia\n\nMy Twitch Channel:\nhttps://twitch.tv/imphenzia\n\nIn-depth learn how Low Poly Modeling in Blender:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jHUY3qoBu8\n\nI use a Sony FX3 camera with a Sony FE 2.8/24-70mm GM  lens.
