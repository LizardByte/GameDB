In a ocean of millions of apps, you can find games of any type. For those from the 80's and 90's pinball games were always a option for having fun. And we have about 800 pinball games populating the App Store, with some good options, definitely. Then comes this Fat Rat entering pinball games, trying to turn things upside-down in this classic game genre.  \n\nFat Rat Pinball : animal Pinball, from the creators of the critically acclaimed Bad Rats series, brings this unsual combination between animals and pinball. You play using animals as the ball. You\u2019ll have animals flying across the screen, bouncing on bumpers and flying off of flippers. Even pinball veterans will be thrown for a loop, as the animals\u2019 body physics will affect gameplay, resulting in funny and unexpected situations.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a casual or hardcore pinball fanatic, Fat Rat Pinball delivers the goods. \"We perceived the fun the game has from the first steps\", stands Augusto Bulow, Invent4's CEO, \"the body dynamics makes it different from simple pinballs. The gameplay is easy and it's a game for all ages\".\n\nThis app features several pinball tables and characters that take the place of the ball. Fans of Bad Rats will especially be in for a treat when it comes to the character selection, with returning characters from Bad Rats as well as new characters unique to Fat Rat Pinball.\n\nSkilled gameplay will reward you Rubies, which can be used to unlock new characters and pinball tables. Rubies can be obtained through performing well in-game, but can also be obtained by watching ads, or in-app purchase.\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fat-rat-pinball/id1263942468\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invent4.FatRatPinball", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jve_aYhvlXM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jve_aYhvlXM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jve_aYhvlXM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jve_aYhvlXM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jve_aYhvlXM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fat Rat Pinball iOS Preview", "description": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fat-rat-pinball/id1263942468\nSomething new is aboarding the App Store.
