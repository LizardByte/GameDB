The game takes place in the universe of Nier and its sequel Nier: Automata, which are in turn spin-offs and sequels to the Drakengard series.

Players take on a role of a young girl dubbed the Girl in White, who is guided through the Cage by a ghost-like being called Mama, unlocking memories of the past while avoiding a black armoured creature called the Dark Monster.\n\nThe gameplay is split into three parts. The first is the Girl in White exploring different areas of the Cage with Mama. During this exploration, they come across statues dubbed Scarcrows which grant and upgrade weapons used to fight enemies within unlocked memories. In these memories, dubbed Weapon Stories, players experience the memories of those related to a weapon from a side-scrolling painting-like perspective.\n\nBattles play out automatically in real-time within the memories with a party of three characters against waves of enemies, with special attacks activated by tapping icons on-screen when they have charged. While many characters are present in-game from the outset, other characters are obtained through a gacha system.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 34826, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "DqGmbdO3u7o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGmbdO3u7o", "title": "NieR Re[in]carnation \uff08\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ea\u30a3\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09: TEASER TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqGmbdO3u7o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35268, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hwyxUKjzJ1A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwyxUKjzJ1A", "title": "NieR Re[in]carnation \uff08\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ea\u30a3\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09:  \u5b9f\u6a5f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hwyxUKjzJ1A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46267, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "5pYzkg4tgXQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pYzkg4tgXQ", "title": "NieR Re[in]carnation \uff08\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ea\u30a3\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09: Promotion Movie_02\u3000\u4e8b\u524d\u767b\u9332\u958b\u59cb", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5pYzkg4tgXQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46268, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "yxINPpgqjks", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxINPpgqjks", "title": "NieR Re[in]carnation \uff08\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ea\u30a3\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09: Promotion Movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yxINPpgqjks/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46269, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "Q5dy3tI6OfU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5dy3tI6OfU", "title": "NieR Re[in]carnation \uff08\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ea\u30a3\u30f3\u30ab\u30fc\u30cd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09: Opening Movie\u300c\u59cb\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3001\u8f2a\u5efb\u306e\u65c5\u3092\u300d", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q5dy3tI6OfU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49267, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "4tHENz9Kh7Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tHENz9Kh7Q", "title": "Nier Reincarnation - Official English Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4tHENz9Kh7Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
