Each Sleeper can represent a\ntopic, exhibition area, or season of DreamHack. Each dream world has a distinct visual theme and all\nitems and interactions correspond with it. The dreams of the Sleepers form an interconnected\nnetwork that can be freely explored, expanded, and changed over time.\nThe Sleepers exist in a space-like dimension (the Void, the Source, the Singularity). This area\nfunctions as the games hub area and starting point. To enter the dreams of the Sleepers, they have\nto pass the DreamKeeper, a creature that only lets you pass, if you have a companion. Therefore\nplayers have to find their first companion in this hub area to enter (similar to a ticket).\nThis functions as the in-game tutorial. Once the player has entered one of the dreams they are free\nto explore. Players can either be invested in the story and find out more by collecting & connecting\ndream fragments of the Sleeper's dreams (teamwork of the community to understand all of the\nworld's lore should be heavily encouraged). Or one can simply ignore it and discover DreamHack\nOnline free-flowing and at their own pace. All players work together to reach a common goal by\ncheering with their Cheer Gear. This goal needs to be defined, it could be to wake up the Sleepers,\nto fix or shape the dream world, or to ward off a dream-invading corruption - or something entirely\ndifferent. This objective could also change in different seasons of the application to create differently\n\nstories over time.", "summary": "Welcome to DreamHack Beyond, an at-home, all-digital free interactive experience showcasing the best of DreamHack. Players can dive into the story of the mystical Sleepers by creating their own characters, completing the game\u2019s narrative, looking for side quests and building up their XP, farming for items like Cheer Gear, and more!
