This time U.N. general Carson Teal is out to rule the universe by uncovering Ringworld's secrets, and you must stop him.\n\nReturn to Ringworld is the sequel to the Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch. Like its predecessor, it is based on Larry Niven's Known Space series of novels. Once again this game is a puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure. This game is much larger than its predecessor, with hundreds of screens, mazes, etc. The player can control three characters throughout the game, a la Day of the Tentacle.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/return-to-ringworld"}
