You must be crafty if you are to make it alive. There are many dangers to avoid and several skills to acquire as you head for the border. Rungistan is a country of severe climate and topography. Add this to the fact that it is inhabited by snakes, bears, cannibals and guerilla warriors and you'll soon realize that this isn't going to be a picnic.
