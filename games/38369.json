The game was slated to be released in western territories under the name Targa, but this version ended cancelled due to Rainbow Arts being unable to secure a publisher at the time. The game was created by Manfred Trenz, utilizing pre-rendered graphics.\n\nPlayers control the titular Rendering Ranger, a special forces soldier tasked with defending the Earth and its remaining inhabitants from a devastating alien invasion. A high score screen is present and there are many different types of laser guns to acquire throughout the post-apocalyptic adventure. The player can choose from three to seven lives. However, there are no continues so practice is essential to winning the game. The player can take five hits before losing a life but pits automatically make him lose a life. Weapons are found in floating orbs, and each color holds a different kind of gun.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rendering-ranger-r2", "videos": [{"id": 61855, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Tl7D25I6yDc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl7D25I6yDc", "title": "Rendering Ranger R2 Longplay (SNES) [60 FPS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tl7D25I6yDc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
