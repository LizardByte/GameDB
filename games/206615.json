Here, two teams of up to five players each can face off in enormous settings, many of them being recreations of important historic events and battles. At first, you'll only have the classic 'team deathmatch' mode unlocked.\n\nThe controls in World War 2 - Battle Combat are completely customizable. From the options menu, you can adjust each one of the buttons on the interface to adapt them to your personal preferences. That said, by default, you have the virtual joystick on the left side of the screen to move your character and almost all the action buttons are found on the right side. You can jump, crouch (to improve your aim), aim, throw grenades, and pick up weapons from fallen enemies.\n\nWorld War 2 - Battle Combat is an excellent multiplayer game that takes its inspiration from classics like the saga Battlefield and Call of Duty, to offer a game experience that's perfectly adapted for mobile devices. The five-minute battles are perfect for a quick dose of action and shooting, either with friends or any players online", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 70937, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Vzusy6CDIPI"}]}
