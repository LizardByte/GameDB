It\u2019s a dangerous universe out there, and although many helpful creatures will trade or share valuable information with you, many more will attack on sight!\n\nFeatures\n\n-Tactical crew management. Direct crewmen to put out fires, or repair damaged equipment. Posting them to their station boosts your fleets speed and combat abilities.\n-Customize your ship with helpful stations.
