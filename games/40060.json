You must be careful with the slopes too, as they might be dangerous at a high speed. Additionally, the car can jump to avoid the cars and to finish the course, as the finish is after a roadless zone. If you manage to time your jump, press button two to free the parachute and land safely. After you finish the four courses, the game will start again with increased difficulty. \n \nThe game is over when the player runs out of fuel, so be careful not to crash, as every time you go off road you'll lose a bit of fuel."}
