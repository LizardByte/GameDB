Nidoking, on this tour, has kidnapped Shizuka and now Lakitu, along with a new reptilian friend, will venture to save the beautiful Shizuka from Nidoking\u2019s poisonous hands. Lakitu\u2019s Great Adventure is a fairly short hack, however it doesn\u2019t seem to be easy. They are 9 super creative levels themed around something imaginative. Music, sprites, and even some enemies have been changed."}
