It consists of several missions that more or less follow the story of the movie. Po the Panda is a waiter in his dad's noodle restaurant but he secretly dreams of becoming a kung fu fighter. By accident he gets selected as the next 'Dragon Warrior', and he will have to train hard to be able to defend the residents of the Valley of Peace from Tai Lung.\n\nThrough a number of mini-games, this game teaches numbers, puzzles, letters, logic, shapes and categorization. It is aimed at 4-to-6-year-olds. Examples of the mini-games are:\n\n- Building bridges using a number of oddly shaped blocks, players have to choose the block that fits to complete the bridge.\n- Saving villagers by lowering ropes of the correct length. Players have to solve a math question that deals with the concepts of \"more\" and \"less\" to continue.\n- Making dried up rivers flow again by removing rocks. This requires solving logic riddles.\n- Delivering foods to shops. The player has to recognize the correct shop to deliver to from the sign-board. On a more difficult setting, letters are used.\n- Other options in the game include writing \"Chinese\" characters, and \"Kung Fu Training\" in which Po catches food with chop sticks.\n\nRelease Date - October 1, 2008\nGenre - Platformer, Arcade, Puzzle, Adventure\nPlatforms - V.Smile, V.Smile Motion, V.Smile Pocket, V.Smile Cyber Pocket, V.Smile PC Pal\nPublisher - VTech, Dreamworks\nDeveloper - VTech, Dreamworks\n\nMy Xbox gamertag: TGG Yari\nMy PlayStation gamertag: ToughGamingGuyYT\nMy Steam: toughgamingguy2\n\nWanna see more of my fantastic walkthroughs?
