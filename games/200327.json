It's a competition to find the world\u2019s greatest villain.\nThe game is a competitive pass-and-play platforming game best enjoyed by passing a device back and forth between players. Players assume the role of villainous characters, attempting to trap their opponents in devious creations. Players place traps and obstacles then must run through the level without triggering any of the traps. The last player standing wins. The game is like horse but with villains and traps instead of basketball.\nGames can be made with a variety of settings to create your very own game mode.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/malevolence-inc"}
