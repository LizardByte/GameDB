Your primary objective is to energize your rocket and return home, but to do that, you\u2019ll need to make your way through brain-teasing obstacles and collect the necessary resources.\n\nGravity always pulls slowly downward, but by flipping, the little astronaut can control which way id down! Use gravity reversal to navigate platforms and avoid hazards, reach power switches or keep yourself suspended mid-leap.
