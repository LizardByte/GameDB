One day, a meteor crashes into Mount Esthar, the largest volcano in the demon realm, shaking the planet to its core. An alien parasite slithers its way from the meteor infecting all of demonkind. As things seem like they couldn't get worse, Mount Esthar suddenly erupts, spreading corruption over most of the planet killing all UAC personnel on the planet. Your mission is to travel to Elysia, search for any UAC survivors, and terminate the alien parasite.", "summary": "Corruption is a thirty-five level MBF21 mapset created by @NinjaDelphox, @EVILNECK, and @Arsinikk, comprised of detailed and action heavy maps inspired by Back to Saturn X2 and Hell Revealed II, along with other games such as Final Fantasy, Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Metroid, Resident Evil, and Mega Man.\n\nExtensive sprite, sound effect, and dehacked changes have been created and used for Corruption to tie in with its story and provide a much more unique experience than a standard Doom II mapset. A lot of attention to detail has also been paid to various source port extras such as GLDEFS, custom obituaries for monsters, edited menu graphics, additional enemies in the ending cast call, and much more.\n\nEvery Map has been designed to be able to be pistol started, but I highly recommend not doing that on a first playthrough. Normal mode is the intended way to experience the game, but medium and easy difficulties have been implemented, as well as a new harder difficulty called \u201cXtreme\u201d (Ultra-Violence Plus), and on ZDoom ports there is an OHKO mode where both players and demons die instantly to any damage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/corruption--2"}
