Your training in the smitheries of Alluris was just the beginning for you. Clear out your workshop and build the forge of your dreams. Mastering new weapons, materials, gems, and enchantments will make your customers happy and allow you to excel in the mines!\n\nThe Corbots once served as the helpers to the ancient dwarves that lived beneath Port Pleasant. It\u2019s said they were responsible for keeping the eternal forges lit in the Heart of the Mountain. Unfortunately, the knowledge of Corbots was lost to the world of Alluria long ago. Hopefully, someday they will awake to help dwarves once again. For now, they are just a folk tale that few believe.\n\nPort Pleasant is an energetic, albeit quaint, town nestled into a large mountain range. It was once a bustling mining town until the mines ran into metals they couldn\u2019t excavate and the remaining valuable resources were quickly exhausted. It survives as a small trading port for various obscure resources from foreign lands. Although the town belongs to the King of Alluris it is presided over by Martin; the town\u2019s mayor.\n\nThe mines under Port Pleasant offer a challenge for even the most ambitious adventurers. Some of the greatest weapons and tools are made from resources few dare to gather. Clearing out the Ashen Mines and uncovering its resources can be crucial to helping the town grow and thrive.", "summary": "Start the smithing shop of your dreams in Blacksmith Bay.
