Seven in all, each Logos carved out territory of their own from the bones of the fledgling continent, and through their magic, brought order to an untamed land. Their reigns were not to be eternal, however - As time progressed, one among their number came to believe the tyranny of their power had grown too great, and in secret, worked a ritual that cast both himself and his brethren into a sleep of stone from whence they would never awaken, and in one breath, ushered in a new era of freedom...and of chaos.\n\nCenturies passed, and the once unified kingdoms tore one another part in an effort to assert their own dominance over the territories the Logothoi had left behind. And so it went, on and on, until one man rose up from the ruins to once again bring order to the continent.\n\nCaranos of Avashir arose from the south a whirlwind or iron and blood, his armies sweeping over the continent with unparalleled fury. Nations fell before him in droves, and all who stood in opposition to his conquest were one by one forced to bend the knee. Cunning in politic, brilliant in battle, Caranos seemed unstoppable. In the span of the decade, almost the entirety of the continent was united within his empire.\n\nTwo years later, he died. On his deathbed, his assembled commanders and courtiers asked to whom he meant to leave his empire. He spoke only three words:\n\n\u2018To the strongest.\u2019\n\nAnd once again, the land fell to chaos.\n\nNow, amidst the backdrop of a continent in turmoil, the outcast prince of a dispassionate nation chases after the sudden disappearance of a mysterious, long-lived tribe, following hazy fragments of a prophecy that bespeaks an uncertain fate for the now kingless land\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/inheritance-of-ash", "videos": [{"id": 133500, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "CEaNcNLmePY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEaNcNLmePY", "title": "FE: Inheritance of Ash Animation: Oren (Outcast)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CEaNcNLmePY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
