A wide variety of content, customizable hero loadouts, alternative game modes with procedurally generated content, and the ability to create invasions will provide tons of replay-ability and keep you engaged for countless hours. Currently in development at up-and-coming studio Big Moxi Games, Wardens Rising is a fresh take on multiple genres that delivers a novel experience you will have to check out for yourself.\n\nIn Wardens Rising you will play as heroes in an elite fighting force assembled to save humanity from massive invasions by interdimensional enemies. An action-packed coop PvE MOBA-like experience of sorts, Wardens Rising gameplay is a mix of coop pve action hero shooter and base defense, where player heroes must protect energy cores across the realm from 100\u2019s enemies in a single battle by using their special abilities, building and upgrading defense towers, and deploying tactical items on-the-fly. Between invasions heroes can upgrade their abilities and stats as well as unlock and upgrade new content to equip in their technology loadout. The isometric perspective helps you see what\u2019s happening in battle with the invading enemy forces as well as to plan the best location to build defense towers and deploy tactical items like traps, walls, healing, teleporters and more! \n\nEach Warden hero class has a set of special abilities, core ranged attack and an \u201cultimate\u201d + their customizable loadout of technology that includes towers, items, and a SPEC companion \u2013 all of which can be upgraded. Currently 6 classes are planned for initial release including a Soldier, Elemental Master, Shinobi, Engineer, Hunter, and one that is TBA. You can upgrade your hero's core statistics and abilities overtime with victory points that you earn through success in defeating invasions. The game encourages experimentation with various combinations of SPEC, towers, and items configured in your loadout based on the map, invasion, game mode, or your personal preference. In addition to special abilities, all Wardens can dodge, sprint, jump and glide through the air with their personal energy reserve. The jump + glide feature is unique for a game with an isometric camera view, gives heroes a tactical advantage, and is loads of fun to do while blasting enemies from the air! \n\nProtecting the Synthesis Energy Core is the primary goal of most game modes. Each of the 25+ maps have a Core that needs protecting which also give heroes the energy needed to build and upgrade defense towers as well as to deploy their tactical items. If the Synthesis Core is destroyed, the players are defeated. Power-nodes around each map boost Core energy production; however if disabled by enemy invaders, players lose this boost; so they should watch power-node heath carefully and repair them.\n\nDefense Towers\nBuilding and upgrading defense towers on-the-fly is a simple but a highly strategic element of Wardens Rising. Which defense towers you build, where to build towers, and how you upgrade towers can be the difference between victory and defeat. Each defense tower has a unique attack ability and 3 upgrade paths. At any time during battle, provided you have the resources, you can upgrade a tower\u2019s range, armor, or special attack ability. Enemy invaders will attack your precious towers, so it is best to keep a close eye on how their doing and repair them with your SPEC before they are destroyed. \n\n- Variety of co-op PvE content and hero configuration options, progression, metagame, and alternative game modes provide tons of replay-ability and extend player engagement\n- More ways to play! Modes beyond core campaign mode include random invasion (procedurally generated), liberate core, endless invasion, and create invasion (UGC) mode - enabling players to build their own invasions\n- Variety of unlockable and collectible items encourage experimentation with hero-configurations, extending playtime  \n- Dynamic enemy invaders make defeating 100\u2019s of enemies in a single battle a challenging mix of skill + strategy; encouraging players to experiment, share strategies and co-operate to win \n\nAre you ready to join the fight to save humanity? \nWishlist Wardens Rising on Steam Today! https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055560/Wardens_Rising/\n\n// LINKS:\n\u27a1 Wishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055560/Wardens_Rising/ \n\u27a1 Join Wardens Rising community: https://discord.gg/X2dD4jTbvG\n\u27a1 Studio Website: http://www.bigmoxi.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scVTdO1q8Zg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scVTdO1q8Zg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scVTdO1q8Zg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scVTdO1q8Zg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scVTdO1q8Zg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wardens Rising Trailer - PvE Coop Action Hero Shooter + MOBA-like base defense for PC/Console", "description": "Wishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055560/Wardens_Rising/\n\nUpcoming PC/console genre-bending game Wardens Rising, aims to combine fast-paced action and MOBA-style base defense into one uniquely thrilling and often intense, PvE coop action hero shooter package.
