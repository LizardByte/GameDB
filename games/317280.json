It is a letter from his arch-nemisis, Doctor Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik, in which he claims to have created a weapon of mass destruction, capable of burning down the whole planet and the only way for Sonic to 'stop' this weapon was to collect and bring all of the 7 Chaos Emeralds, ancient artifacts of near-infinite power, directly to Robotnik before 3 days pass. If Sonic failed to do so, Robotnik would launch his weapon, destroying the entire planet, and build his empire from the ashes. Thus begins a new adventure for our heroes..", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-and-tails", "videos": [{"id": 127023, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "fX9Px_5beA4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX9Px_5beA4", "title": "Sonic & Tails - SAGE 2018 Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fX9Px_5beA4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
