{"id": "5zGQWrzsRpc", "snippet": {"title": "Shadow Squadron Game Sample - 32X", "description": "Original Air Date: September 05th, 2009\n\nWhere as Tempo is perhaps the best display of the 32X's 2D prowess, Shadow Squadron is perhaps the best display of what the 32X could do with 3D (besides Virtua Fighter and Darxide). The framerate is smooth and the particle effects are neat, and the action is pretty frantic. You can choose between two \"Feather\" crafts with different characteristics. Feather 1 is weaker but more accurate and has a powerful kamikaze ability which you'll rarely (if ever) use because the damage ratio in proportion to how much health you lose for attempting it isn't really rewarding. Feather 2 is stronger and has lots of energy, but you must use it sparingly throughout the course of the game as it can't be refilled. Enjoy.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zGQWrzsRpc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zGQWrzsRpc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zGQWrzsRpc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Shadow Squadron Game Sample - 32X", "description": "Original Air Date: September 05th, 2009\n\nWhere as Tempo is perhaps the best display of the 32X's 2D prowess, Shadow Squadron is perhaps the best display of what the 32X could do with 3D (besides Virtua Fighter and Darxide).
