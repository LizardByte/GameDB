The gun relies on a motion sensor on the front of the gun's barrel, which then communicates with either the console or a sensor which you can stick to the TV. Because of this, the gun is \"wireless\" as its name suggests, and uses four AA batteries held in a cartridge which stows in the back of the gun.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wireless-hunting-video-game-system"}
