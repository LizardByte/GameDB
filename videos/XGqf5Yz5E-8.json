Stauf was a master toymaker, a maker of amazing puzzles and this strange house was his greatest creation. Now the mansion stands empty, rotting ever since the children started dying, ever since the six guests came. Now there are only the eerie lights and the terrible sing-song rhymes of the children.\n\nAnd suddenly, you are in the house. You move from room to room, step-by-terrifying-step, as scenes from that night of horror come to life. Because Stauf's game isn't over. There were six guests the world knew about - and there was one other. Stauf's mad mansion lives again. And only you can end the nightmare and learn the secret of The 7th Guest.\n\nVisit Night Dive Studios!\nwww.nightdivestudios.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NightDiveStudios\n@NightDiveStudio\n\nNight Dive Studios Intro:\nhttp://www.orchidanimation.com/\n@orchidanimation\n\nTrailer:\nhttp://www.lockevincent.com \n@lockevincent", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XGqf5Yz5E-8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XGqf5Yz5E-8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XGqf5Yz5E-8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "The 7th Guest - Night Dive Studios Trailer", "description": "Now Available on Steam!\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/31833/\n\nHenry Stauf's mansion has been abandoned for as long as anyone dare remember.
