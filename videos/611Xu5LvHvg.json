The player controls a sphere rolling on a isometric, tilted plane where several letter tiles are arranged on mixed groups. Tiles touched by the ball are spelled on a tray at the top, where the words have to be completed by passing over all the required letters in the correct order. The tile formations are floating on space, and the orb can fall over the edge and disappear. Levels have a variable number of spare spheres available.\n\nSome stages have special tiles and bonus items. Tiles with arrows throw the ball towards the direction they are pointing, sometimes helping to skip tiles and spell a word, while in certain situations acting as traps and pushing the orb into space. Pairs of colored tiles teleport the sphere to other parts of the field. The bonus items can be found as spinning cubes scattered around the level, adding extra spheres, more time and multiplying points when collected. The introduction screens for each level have a clue at the bottom for a secret bonus word.\n\n", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/611Xu5LvHvg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/611Xu5LvHvg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/611Xu5LvHvg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/611Xu5LvHvg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/611Xu5LvHvg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "AlphaNatix: Urban Legends Edition for PC", "description": "Came also out for:\n\nMacintosh\n\n\nGame description:\n\nAlphaNatix: Urban Legends Edition is a word-construction game with arcade elements, where the main objective is to spell nine words associated with a famous urban myth on each level, within a time limit.
