Ettore will do everything to prevent the victory of his opponent. He will install panels with spikes throughout the climb, which will be certain death upon contact alone and will launch everything to prevent the protagonist from reaching the climate (tree trunks, dressers and even toilets ). There are 5 levels, with increasing difficulty. On the right side of the screen, besides the score, lives and level, there will be 2 counters. The first for energy and the other for the path. The energy will drop by a notch for each screen passed, and will be restored (always by 1 notch), each time the bottle is recovered. The lower the energy, the slower Italo's movements will be. While the second, he will increase as you go up. At the bottom of the latter there is a figure that will tell the hectometers traveled. At the beginning of each level there is an indication, the name of the mountain and the height.", "summary": "The game is divided into 5 levels.

Moreover, he has installed sharp obstacles and just touching them is certain death.\nFatigue will be felt, and to recover the lost energy, during the journey there will be water bottles that will restore it (only one notch at a time).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-bet"}
