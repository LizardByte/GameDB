When long enough, the player character can wrap themselves around stunned enemies - the player can drop bombs that will momentarily stagger any enemy caught in the blast - and valuable food in order to acquire them. Once all the food has been collected, the exit opens somewhere in the level and the player can progress. Progressive stages have different gimmicks and solutions to completing them. \n \nThe game was developed by UPL and released exclusively to the PC Engine in Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
