In this 2D adventure, 006 must prevent a global catastrophe by parachuting into a high-security island to retrieve top-secret superweapon plans from the Diabolical Villain Society (DVS). At every turn, 006 must avoid perilous traps, sleuth his way through dastardly puzzles, and sneak past the DVS.\n\nSecret Agent HD offers updated visuals across all three original episodes, a brand-new original soundtrack, and 16 never-before-played missions in Secret Agent Episode 4, exclusive to this remaster. Challenge friends with custom levels using the built-in level editor and Steam Workshop integration. Claim retro street cred with full leaderboard support.
