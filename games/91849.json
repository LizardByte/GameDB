As your vision recovers, you find yourself in a place only true evil could call home. Fire lashes out of the floor. Spikes dripping with the blood of countless victims line the walls. Bones litter the floor, and tiny beasts you've never seen pick at the remaining flesh. You hear the clanging of armor, the grinding of bones, and the maniacal screams of death approaching. \n \nAs you pull yourself to your feet, you notice that you're standing next to a dismembered corpse. His organs are spewed all over the surrounding area.
