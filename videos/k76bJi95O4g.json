There is a total of 21 turns for each game. Players will start by building a castle or reinforcing an existing one during each turn. Castles can be defeated if the player attacking has a higher strength value to their castle. Equal strength value will put the castle being attacked under siege. Reinforcing the castle will increase the strength of the castle.
