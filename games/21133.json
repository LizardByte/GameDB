There are many types of units to choose from: some specializing in powerful short-range attacks, some wielding far-reaching magicks, and still others equipped with bows, enabling them to bring down aerial foes. Deploy units in strategic locations to take full advantage of their traits. Each time an enemy breaches your defenses and reaches a map's exit, your party will lose crystals. When all your crystals are gone, the game is over. R2 offers several new, challenging maps containing multiple entrances and exits. It also introduces three varieties of Power Crystals, allowing you to enhance the abilities of your units, while new jobs, including Flintlock and Tinker, set the stage for even more complex strategies. Can you defend all the maps without losing a single crystal?", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crystal-defenders-r2", "videos": [{"id": 76236, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4Uvft_Fc6Cg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uvft_Fc6Cg", "title": "Crystal Defenders R2 - WiiWare Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Uvft_Fc6Cg/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2820, "name": "Crystal Defenders"}]}
