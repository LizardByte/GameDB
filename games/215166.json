This hack is a remaster of the original Escape from the Jail, made in 2016. This marks the second hack contributed in remaking a game of the Ztar Attack series, as well as the third game not made by the original creator (the first being Forest Ruins: Rebooted; the second being Ztar Attack Rebooted).\n\nFollowing the story, this game unfolds as a prequel to Ztar Attack under the brand \"Ztar Attack 0.5\". Unlike Ztar Attack Rebooted, the game uses the original level layout but key sections are condensed by quality standards -- visuals and exploration alike. Plus, newer gameplay tech and custom assets are implemented."}
