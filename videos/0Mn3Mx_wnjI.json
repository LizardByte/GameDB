{"id": "0Mn3Mx_wnjI", "snippet": {"title": "Dynasty Warriors 4 Opening [HD]", "description": "(Done with Sony Vegas)\r\n\r\nDynasty Warriors is a video game franchise whose setting is related to Ancient China, particularly tied to the historically significant novel and television series \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", which tells the stories and legends of great warriors and their challenges, including the formation of new rule over the land, following the end of the Han Dynasty.\r\n\r\nDynasty Warriors 4 is generally a fighting-genre game. Throughout the game, you are playing as a character either completely or partially historical, mowing down enemies with your great strength. Each scenario is of at least some historical merit, and in each scenario, the conditions of Victory may be different.\r\n\r\nDynasty Warriors 4 combines Ancient Chinese lore with military strategy and outright One vs. All mayhem, to the sound of stellar, screaming guitar riffs in the background. \r\n\r\nNoted as one of Playstation 2's Best Sellers, this video game has a lot to offer the right person. This description doesn't begin to describe its full experience.\r\n\r\nDespite there being animated violence, there is no blood or gore. Dynasty Warriors is rated T for Teen.\r\n\r\nDynasty Warriors is a trademark of Koei, and produced by Omega Force.\r\nhttp://www.tecmokoeiamerica.com/index.cfm?\r\nThis video is not licensed by the uploader.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you liked this video, please comment and rate.
