In the final battle you face sweety Hunnybunz himself, but, beware, for this treacle bear is no piece of cake!\n\nBoppin is a one or two player game, complete with a full featured, user friendly world/level editor to expand the game beyond your wildest dreams. Over 2,500 tile images are supplied, but not all are used in the supplied worlds, so truly new puzzles can be created.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boppin", "videos": [{"id": 17832, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "7zGjt9tWedk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zGjt9tWedk", "title": "Boppin' - Gameplay video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7zGjt9tWedk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
