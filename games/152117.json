The CIA's rescue mission went faster than predicted, and their satellites are now interfering with Perseus's broadcasts, halting Stitch's grand experiment on the \"test subjects\" in Verdansk.\n\nHe still has an ace up his sleeve, however, as another agent is ready to make Perseus's next check in the global chess game for power.\n\nWe see that agent, a menacing metal-faced assailant, breaching a CIA Ground Station compound in South Africa on June 26, 1984. He reaches the control room, where he takes a satellite specialist alive and phones in Stitch, who guides the hostage into de-orbiting two CIA satellites at specific points in Verdansk and Algeria. As these satellites hurtle down to earth, the masked Perseus agent strangles the life out of his victim on command, leaving no loose ends in Perseus's path to world domination.\n\nThe next day, it appears one of the satellites has been downed deep in an Algerian desert. A CIA-led NATO squadron is on-site to assess the damage, neutralize hostiles, and gather any information from the satellite. Leading that task force is Adler himself, following weeks of recovery.\n\nDespite physical and mental health clearances and numerous tests, something inside Adler seems to snap when he sees the satellite. Ignoring his squadmates, he recklessly charges forward, eliminating any forces in his path to grab a codec from the satellite.\n\nAfter being questioned for his behavior, he grows even more abrasive to his allies.\n\n\u201cYou don't get the war we're fighting, do you?\u201d Adler says, in reply to a recruit from Egypt.\n\n\u201cStitch is capable of anything.\u201d", "summary": "Incoming!
