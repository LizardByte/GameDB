You live in a quiet village that floats high above the ground, unaware of the world that lies beneath it. But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend onto the earth to face the terrible reality: the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction.\n\nThe fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wild-arms-4", "videos": [{"id": 47980, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "TJnFSFKk5ww", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJnFSFKk5ww", "title": "Wild ARMs 4 PlayStation 2 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TJnFSFKk5ww/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47982, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "47h1O77E1xc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47h1O77E1xc", "title": "Wild Arms 4 gameplay classic.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/47h1O77E1xc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47978, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "z-9rFhpng38", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-9rFhpng38", "title": "Wild ARMs 4 PlayStation 2 Trailer - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-9rFhpng38/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47979, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "M_h0d2HH4KI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_h0d2HH4KI", "title": "Wild Arms 4 Opening Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M_h0d2HH4KI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47981, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "cfXzv0vMFA4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfXzv0vMFA4", "title": "Wild Arms 4 Opening anime 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cfXzv0vMFA4/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 332, "name": "Wild Arms"}]}
