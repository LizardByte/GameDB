The previous TOAW games were for many the pinnacle of hex based strategy games development, but as years passed the games were not working on modern PCs anymore. Matrix Games bought the rights to TOAW series from the previous publisher, Take Two, and updated the game to work on modern computers.\n\nTOAW 3 is a mix of new game, add-on and follow-up. Basically it is TOAW 1+2 with all the features of the old games, with highly reworked game engine and huge amount of new content. The game engine now works with all the current PCs and Windows, and it features also long awaited bug fixes, additional features and completely new combat calculations.\n\nThe game includes scenarios ranging from tiny to huge from World War I era to modern and near future, most of them playable from either side as single player game, and all playable as PBEM or hotseat with two players.", "themes": [{"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/norm-kogers-the-operational-art-of-war-iii"}
