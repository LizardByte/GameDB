The warriors are victorious, but Dhaos escapes through time. However, four different heroes await him: they seal the weakened Dhaos away by using the power of two pendants, thus returning peace to the world. The story continues twelves years later with our Hero Cless.", "summary": "The PS1 version of Tales of Phantasia contains new features including an animated opening sequence produced by Japanese studio Production I.G., re-drawn character sprites and backgrounds, a 3D-rendered world map, and re-recorded character audio to better accommodate the compact disc format. The inclusion of animated Skits and a modified version of the battle system resembling that used in Destiny, were added. For the battle system, the team wanted to increase the overall battle speed and combo potential. Suzu Fubayashi, a non-playable supporting character in the original release, was also made playable as an optional party member.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 66377, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "MHR6wdUBSgc"}]}
