For a start, you don't just fire at the bricks - they fire at you. Avalanches of bombs will wing their way toward you, the dreaded Yello will descend from jets flying over, and the red devil tumbles from its cage. All can have a seriously detrimental effect on your life! Then there are the capsules to be caught, some of which can give you a larger bat, or a plank over part of the holy grass, or a free life, or even a wipe screen.\n\n36 screens with a more difficult big bonus version of each and every one - that's the marvel of Mazie.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mazie"}
