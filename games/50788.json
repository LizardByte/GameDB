The player may play against the computer or another human on a strategic game board. In the beginning of the game, the player buys their forces with a predefined number of credits, and may purchase any of the 16 characters along with various kinds of traps and even rings of power to upgrade their creatures. One is chosen to be the \"Orb Keeper\". The Orb Keeper is like the King in chess: the game is over if he dies. Then players set up on a chosen map and start to move turn wise. When one player moves a piece into the same square as an opponent, the action is instantly transferred to another board map that represents the terrain upon which the two pieces occupy. Each player starts with their single piece on this \"melee map\" and must fight using their figures. The fight is simultaneously controlled in real time.\n\nEach figure type has unique abilities and at least two attack types. They can be roughly translated into categories however. This categories facing off against each other is the main focus of strategy. Simply put: Casters are hunted by Undead which are hunted by Fighters that fear the Casters spells. These categories are made up as a description and not an inherent part of the game. Hence some odd figures don't fit in any category.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-legions", "videos": [{"id": 117638, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MuEH8D_dEo0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuEH8D_dEo0", "title": "Dark Legions | Trailer [GOG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MuEH8D_dEo0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
