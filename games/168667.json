In the vein of our Spider-Man games, our goal here is to not only respect the DNA of what makes the character so popular, but also look for opportunities to make it feel fresh and truly reflect the Insomniac spirit. Even though Marvel\u2019s Wolverine is very early in development, from what I\u2019ve seen of its emotional narrative and cutting-edge gameplay (see what I did there?), the team is already creating something truly special.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 54562, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "Zcj9AzHv_l8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcj9AzHv_l8", "title": "Marvel's Wolverine - PlayStation Showcase 2021: Announcement Teaser Trailer | PS5", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zcj9AzHv_l8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
