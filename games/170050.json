She was killed, and the protagonist has inherited her entire estate - with a catch: In order to receive the fortune coming to him, the hero must finish the potions his aunt was working on and solve the mystery of her death.\n\nLast Half of Darkness is an adventure game that takes place entirely in and around a haunted mansion, complete with graveyards, crypts and foreboding swamps. The graphics in the game consist of a collection of still images. The main screen is divided into five major sections: the game world, inventory, list of exits, commands, and a description box at the bottom. The player has to position the mouse on a command (Move, Examine, Take and Operate) and left-click to perform that action. The game is available in both EGA and 256-color VGA mode.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-half-of-darkness--1"}
