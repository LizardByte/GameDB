Alan cannot remember where he was before this moment but knows he must go to the back of the diner, which he forcibly enters. Zane talks to Alan and warns him that he should go no further and that Alan must focus. Zane plays a video of Alan struggling with reality and even tells of events playing out when Alan realises where he is: The Dark Place.", "summary": "The Signal Remastered is a single-player episode included with Alan Wake Remastered (2021). \"The Signal\" was originally an additional Alan Wake episode released via DLC in October 2010.
