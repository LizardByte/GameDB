Your mission: eliminate a target for Ludum-Tek in an \"unconventional way\".\n\nPacking pixelart and a brooding soundtrack, Badass plunges you into a city wracked with desperation. Revel in the apathy of the protagonist as you work through situational puzzles, interspersed with cinematic action scenes and tense shootouts.
