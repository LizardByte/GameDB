The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-underground-2", "videos": [{"id": 13768, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Xl38fecVFzU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl38fecVFzU", "title": "Need For Speed Underground 2 Trailer #1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xl38fecVFzU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
