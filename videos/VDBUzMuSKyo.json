Actual gameplay begins at 2:40.\n\nMARS 3D tells the story of a post-apocalyptic future after a nuclear holocaust had been initiated by a self-aware AI defense system known as Zaker. A dwindling human resistance now battles against an army of machines trying to terminate them! You take the role of some guy who must travel into the distant past, the year 1999, to confront Zaker and prevent the planet's doom. Also, you fight the Predator, boss of Satan World. I don't speak Chinese, so I don't really know what's going on.\n\nNote: I load a saved game to begin directly on the last level, thus showing the final boss and the ending. Spoiler alert!\n\nMany thanks to Player Lin for sharing this game and providing invaluable background information:\nhttp://forums.duke4.net/topic/6753-mars-3d-the-doom-clone-by-taiwanese/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VDBUzMuSKyo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VDBUzMuSKyo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VDBUzMuSKyo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VDBUzMuSKyo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VDBUzMuSKyo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "MARS 3D - Gameplay", "description": "Part of my Obscure First Person Shooters series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2BBA1AB1CF53EEAC\n\nGameplay footage from MARS 3D, a Chinese first person shooter that was never released to the public.
