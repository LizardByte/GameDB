This one was like one of the coolest looking & well-animated flash-game I played when I was a dumb kid, it was like a daily drug for me playing  this over & over again, well in case I'd finish it of course, 'cuz it was somewhat hard for me to handle it at that time. Hehe, anyway, let's talk a bit about the game, shall we? Alright, so, the story of this DOPE flash-game begins with the antagonist of it, who is the Dog from the 1984 light gun shooter video-game developed and published by Nintendo, called : \"Duck Hunt\"! Ok, so, the Dog walks in the scene (which is a grassland) while sniffing for something, then he suddenly stops besides a mushroom house where we find that Princess Peach lives because the Dog will proceed to jump & sneak to it in the long grass & break into it, by blowing it a with a bomb since it's caught on fire & kidnap Peach & flex to us with his capture, laughing at us with his mouth covered by his right paw, while with his left one, he holds Peach by the neck. After this, he'll proceed to leave the crime scene, with Peach tied up in a old & rusty truck's trunk, drove by someone unknown since he stands in the trunk as well, still laughing at us because of what a big capture he has. Now then, you're gonna adventure yourself in the rescue of Princess Peach, along with one of the 3 characters available in this game, these being of course : Mario & Luigi & a new one we haven't seen in any \"Super Mario\" game, due to the fact that it is based off a real person & that is Mr. T, an American actor and professional wrestler. In this game, they won't kill the enemies in their old fashioned way, but with gun since they're gangster & there are 3 types of guns, these being : Zap Red ; Zap Gray & Shotgun. The game has in total 8 levels, the 1st one being : \"The Lake\", which takes place on a beautiful lake & a superb sunset, where the enemies are just like in other levels Koopas that will shoot fire flames at you & Koopas with cannons. The 2nd level is a Sewer where besides, you're gonna deal with a new enemy, a Lakitu who this time will shoot missiles from the plane they drive. The 3rd level takes place in a Grocery Store, where besides enemies, there are also Toad pedestrians, who you can kill as well, but it is pointless since you won't gain anything. The 4th level takes place in a Mountain where along with enemies there are lot of platforms to use & icicles that will fall from up to hurt/kill you. The 5th level takes place in a fantastic forest where new enemies  are introduced, these being Koopas with skateboards. The 6th level is a Beach where pedestrians Toads are present again, swimming in there, while you're fighting the same enemies you did before. The 7th level is the Courtyard, where all enemies are gatherer to kill you & a new enemy appears here, these being Piranha Plants that will shoot at you poisonous spit. Besides there will be lots of bricks to jump on, without falling in the river underneath you. In the 8th level, you'll confront the Dog, who'll shoot huge fireballs at you. Once you kill him, he'll fall in lava & rescue Peach.
