People who were lost and disappointed in the chaotic world began to choose their own places, looking for a monarch who could bring them light. , a legend about the Three Dragons Treasures spread quickly among the people: Yinglong, the god who assisted the Yellow Emperor in defeating Chiyou, was unable to return to the sky after the war because of the filth in the world. After the death of Yinglong, the dragon's claws turned into the blue dragon sword; the long's eyes turned into the red dragon balls; and the dragon's heart turned into the jade dragon seal. It is rumored that if one of the three dragons is called king, if three dragons are obtained, the world will be conquered. This also caused the heroes of all parties to start looking for the whereabouts of the treasures.\n\nDuring the late Han Dynasty, Chu Ge, Han Jing, and Chen Yan from Zhaode Village, Xiliang, a group of childhood sweethearts who each had a teenage dream, were also attacked by rumors. In the village, in addition to kidnapping Shen Yan, it also caused Han Jing to fall off a cliff... Later, in order to find Shen Yan and revive Zhaode Village, Chu Ge came to the strange Chang'an, and unintentionally rescued the princess of the Han Dynasty, Yao Zhen, Since then, he has been involved in the war in the late Han Dynasty.", "summary": "Thousands of years ago, the great Xuanyuan, also known as Huangdi - Yellow Emperor - fought against the ruler Chiyou for control over China. Demons joined both forces in this great battle. Finally, Huangdi got the upper hand and became the emperor of China. Shortly before his death, he decided to reincarnate as a mortal many years later, so he came to the border of paradise, and spoke with the dragon demon Yinglong, who was supporting his rival before, as well as other demons. Yinglong descended upon the Earth, and his body parts turned into powerful weapons and artifacts - his claw became a sword, his eye a pearl, and his heart took the shape of a seal. The legends say that if someone can get one of the three artifacts, he can once again wield the power in the whole China.\n\nFast-forward to 196 AD. It is the time of Eastern Han dynasty, the end of one of the several golden epochs of the Chinese civilization. Two gods, Yunkong and Daotian, are playing chess with each other to decide the fate of China. In the village Zhaode live two young noblemen, Chu Ge and his best friend Han Jing, as well as his beloved one Shen Yan. They live a normal life and wish to move to the capital and to find good jobs there. But an accident makes them meet their true destiny...\n\nThe second Huanxiang Sanguozhi game takes us to the time period that preceeded the Three Kingdoms era by about a hundred years. Once again, the game deals with concrete historical events and characters, but adds many fictional elements to them, mostly of supernatural character. The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game. You control a party of heroes and fight enemies in turn-based or active-time combat (you can choose the type of combat since the beginning). The game features pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D cut scenes. It also allows you to choose between three difficulty levels.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/huanxiang-sanguozhi-ii", "videos": [{"id": 96699, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VVNHGPvyK5A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVNHGPvyK5A", "title": "FS2 \u5c55\u793a\u5f71\u7247", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VVNHGPvyK5A/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 96700, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0-EK6ztXG4w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-EK6ztXG4w", "title": "\u300a\u5e7b\u60f3\u4e09\u570b\u8a8c\u300b-2\u4ee3\u56de\u61b6", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0-EK6ztXG4w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
