It was renamed Orius in North America but kept its original title in other regions.\n\nThe overseas versions introduce a variety of changes, with the most notable being the removal of all but one upgradable weapon, as well as the removal of a lives system, which is replaced with an energy bar. The enemy patterns are also changed slightly and the bosses have more health. Upon dying, the player starts where they died instead of going back to a checkpoint.\n\nThe overseas versions also features two-player simultaneous co-operative play.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orius", "videos": [{"id": 105349, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2hOmGnajUdA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hOmGnajUdA", "title": "Arcade Longplay [003] Xexex (World version)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2hOmGnajUdA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
