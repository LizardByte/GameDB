Stability still eluded Russia, however, as the 1911 assassination of Tsar Nicholas II would show. Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin would take advantage of the weakened House of Romanov to further his ambitious economic modernization program.\n\nThis would all be put to the test when the Empire intervened in the Balkan Wars in 1913, marching an army through Romania to aid its Orthodox brethren in Serbia. Treaties and guarantees went from words to material facts, and soon Europe was embroiled in the Great War. Years of industrial warfare unlike anything seen before would change the course of history forever, and by the end, very few states could count themselves as victors rather than victims.\n\nThe year is 1936. In 1919, one year after the red flag flew over Berlin, revolutionary Italian nationalists seized control of Fiume, a city whose fate was still being decided at the peace negotiations. The old guard of Europe has had to battle with the traditional specter of socialism out of Germany, but also a growing threat ostensibly from the political right. At first labeled \"accelerationism\" by critics, the chaotic blend of political futurism, revolutionary nationalism, and other modernist movements became a badge of identification in Fiume. Now, two years after the fall of France to accelerationism, it appears that history approaches a turning point once more.\n\nIn Western Europe, a fragile balance between socialists, accelerationists, and the old republics and kingdoms is about to be upset. To the East, a wounded Russia sits on a throne of bayonets, and the Intermarium prepares itself for the storm ahead. In the Americas, continent-spanning giants face their darkest hour, instability finally coming to their shores. An ocean away in Asia, the fall of empires and the weakness of yet more make everything possible once again. And in Africa, new, fragile hopes stagger forth to be born.", "summary": "Red Flood is a mod for Hearts of Iron IV set in an alternate timeline where the Great War ended in stalemate.
