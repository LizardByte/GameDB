It is played in 1st person, with 3rd person camera options and uses Origin's RealSpace Engine. In the main campaign, players start as a fresh rookie pilot, newly transfered to England. Players can have conversations with other pilots,check the kill board for the entire squadron or commence the next mission. Missions begin with a briefing explaining the objectives and then players are put in the front seat of their aircraft. They must take off, reach the appropriate waypoints, perform the objective and return home to land. All planes have a machine gun, of varying capacities , which fires in front of the plane. Some planes are also able to carry bombs. There is no radar or other detection method on the planes, so players must be alert to oncoming enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
