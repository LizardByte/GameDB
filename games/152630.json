Fate of Persephone attempts to give a new spin on role playing games: a predominately female cast of characters, a 'magic only' battle structure, and a focus on alternative ways to advance in the game. The game awards experience points not only for fighting but also for acquiring wisdom through puzzle solving, lore studying, secret area finding, etc.\n\nThe game also will feature four times of day that are based off of the time of the realm to add different moods to every area. Some treasure chests are 'random prize' to pay homage to the classic paper-and-pencil RPGs that so many of us love. A full digital audio music score in high-quality stereo WAV format is also included to allow us to more accurately help the player to become engrossed in the game; as we feel that music is one of the most powerful forms of art available to games. The project also includes voice acting as well.", "summary": "Fate of Persephone is a point-and-click adventure RPG where your actions and decisions have lasting consequences and uniquely shape your story.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fate-of-persephone"}
