During the mission, Hitsugi is attacked by a mysterious black mass; the player attempts to purify Hitsugi, but Hitsugi disappears prematurely. \"Hitsugi\" is revealed to be a high school girl from Earth playing the video game Phantasy Star Online 2, who finds a strange boy with her avatar's appearance in her room after the fiasco. Hitsugi names the boy \"Aru\".\n\nThe player is subsequently sent to investigate Earth. Through trans-dimensional video feeds, it is discovered that Earth uses a parallel mutation of Photons called Ether that is primarily used as a method of high-speed data transmission, but also resonates with the emotions and fears of the general public to create monsters called Phantoms. The company ESC-A, who created Phantasy Star Online 2, is actually a front for a mysterious organization of Ether-sensitives known as Mother Cluster. Opposing them are the Earth Guides, Ether-sensitives lead by Ardem S. Sacred who fight back against Mother Cluster's Phantoms.\n\nThe player, Hitsugi, and Hitsugi's brother Enga travel around the world to suppress Mother Cluster's efforts. During an attack on Las Vegas, Hitsgui is killed; this triggers Aru's Dark Falz powers to awaken, and he revives Hitsugi, who is captured and taken to Mother Cluster's home base on the Moon. Enga and the player rescue Hitsugi, but discover that Hitsugi was a ploy to allow Mother Cluster to attack the ARKS Ship. The player and Hitsugi return to the ARKS Ship and fend off Mother Cluster, but Mother, the leader of Mother Cluster, absorbs Aru and escapes.\n\nThe heroes pursue Mother back to the Moon base, where she reveals that she is a failed Xion clone discarded by the Photoners and seeks vengeance against them. The heroes defeat Mother, causing her and Aru to separate, and she is redeemed by the heroes. However, Ardem appears and kills and absorbs Mother, revealing his true plan to usher in the next stage of humanity's evolution with Ether. The heroes travel to Yggdrasil and confront Ardem, who banishes the player back to the Oracle dimension and strips the heroes of their Ether abilities. Back on the ARKS Ship, Aru is revealed to have a fragment of Mother's consciousness remaining with him. Mother possesses Aru and returns to Earth with the player, restoring the heroes' powers in the process, and they defeat Ardem with their combined power.", "summary": "The fourth major update to Phantasy Star Online 2 as well as the first major update for the Global version, Episode 4 introduces new enemies and environments, new classes and a wide array of several new features.\n\nThe main new area of Episode 4 is the Planet Earth of the year 2028 AD.
