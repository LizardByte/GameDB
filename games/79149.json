Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II Plus was created in mind to fix this problem. Along with this problem, SEGA included extra content for offline with this game including:\n- Episode II Challenge Mode, which was perviously only online.\n- Perviously Online only quests, Seat of the Heart, West Tower and East Tower are now available offline.\n- Central Dome Fire Swirl, a downloadable quest for the Xbox, is now available offline.\n- The downloadable goods from Fake in Yellow quest are now available offline.\n\nAside from some extra cheat protection, Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II Plus ran exactly the same as the original version and all data from characters, items, ect, can be swapped between the two instantly.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phantasy-star-online-episode-i-and-ii-plus", "videos": [{"id": 46361, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "RWcvbjKusc4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWcvbjKusc4", "title": "Longplay of Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II (Plus) (Episode I - 1/2) [Old]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RWcvbjKusc4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
