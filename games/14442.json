It was made using basically the same engine as Ultima VI but with slightly different graphics. The game contains all of the elements of the other Ultimas, as well as some extra features that add to the experience. You are able to interact with the environment in a realistic manner... picking branches from trees, digging clay from a riverbank etc. Savage Empire also has a lot more character interaction than the previous Ultimas. Characters will jump into conversations whenever they feel they have something pertinent to add.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/worlds-of-ultima-the-savage-empire"}
