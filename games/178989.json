The goal of the game is to have Freddie collect all the pots of gold on each level while avoiding all of the enemies. Optionally collect bonus items to earn more points (10,000 points earn an extra life). When all pots have been collected on a level, you will advance to the next level. What makes the game unique, is that the platforms are connected with telephone poles instead of ladders and Freddie cannot walk past a pole. He must climb up one side and down the other. Enemies however can move past the poles! There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty, featuring different enemies on each level. The earlier levels feature 3 enemies each and the later levels have 4 and 5 enemies. Enemy speed increases gradually each level. Every two levels there are interludes to give the player a short rest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
