Developed by Sensible Software and first released for Amiga in 1992, it featured a zoomed-out bird's-eye view, editable national, club and custom teams and gameplay utilising a relatively simple and user-friendly control scheme. One of the defining gameplay elements was the aftertouch feature, which enabled effective but unrealistic swerves. The game topped charts such as Amiga Power's \"All Time Top 100\". The graphic style of the game was used in other Sensible Software games, such as Mega-Lo-Mania, Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensible-soccer-european-champions", "videos": [{"id": 53835, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XMiZm7-F4Pk"}]}
