The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.\nThis game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against the same opponents as they did in the anime version..", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/captain-tsubasa-j", "videos": [{"id": 30737, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "viDulUYMT_o"}]}
