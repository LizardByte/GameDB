Doc's dream is to utilize the parts to allow Rabby to fly freely. The game is a top-down, vertically scrolling action game that can be considered a precursor to the Jumping Flash series. The player must jump along platforms in search of a heart, which will allow the player to upgrade Rabby and proceed on to the next level. A level will loop indefinitely until the heart is found.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
