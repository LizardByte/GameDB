It aims to carefully recreate the NES classics while giving them a fresh 16-bit coat of paint and a rearranged soundtrack. More than that however, it also aims to bring a slew of new content, both through complete re-imaginings of the classics in EX Mode and a new gauntlet of levels in Wily Tower 2. And it all runs on the original Mega Drive hardware!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-the-sequel-wars", "videos": [{"id": 74184, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "-rVy0YJc-Xo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rVy0YJc-Xo", "title": "(Old) MEGA MAN: THE SEQUEL WARS: EPISODE RED Reveal Trailer (Wily Wars 2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-rVy0YJc-Xo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
