It is a parody of alien conspiracy theories, particularly those from the TV show of the same name. The WAD features a large range of custom textures and a new palette allowing for radically different visual styles to what is usually seen in PWADs. Also featured are several maps by guest level designers, mostly found in the third and final episode. The entirety of the soundtrack was composed by Stuart Rynn (stewboy), though several tracks were re-used from previous WADs.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
