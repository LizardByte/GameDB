It features the same graphics as the aforementioned game, but completely different gameplay. Where the original game was a turn-based RPG on social networks, the remix is an action-based hack and slash game.\n\nThe player controls the main character through a side-scrolling environment using only the mouse. The player can use mouse gestures to perform special combos, which are required to kill the many monsters that will appear from both in front of and behind the character. Killing enemies unlocks experience points which can be used to upgrade stats such as health and stamina when the player reaches a campsite.", "videos": [{"id": 63412, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AQQGSHSSI4I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQQGSHSSI4I", "title": "Dragon Age Legends Remix 01 (free web game)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AQQGSHSSI4I/sddefault.jpg"}]}
