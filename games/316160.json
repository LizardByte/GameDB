It all starts when someone sends you a message from your friend's cell phone, asking for help to escape from a situation as complicated as it is obscure.

Pass by creatures capable of inspiring madness in the eyes of the beholder. Your choice of options can change not only the course of the game's story, but also who you are in it. Find your way out or get lost in the process.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-message--1"}
