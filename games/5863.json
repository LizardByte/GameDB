During the mission, his entire team is killed, until he and his second-in-command, Captain Dan Taylor are left. When they manage to find their answer in a giant laboratory, Death, a gigantic mutant who serves as the facility's security guard, kills Taylor and injures Rogan. While fighting to stay alive, Rogan is approached by an unidentified figure in a semi-corporate attire who offers help. Contact with him is lost.\n\nTwo weeks later, on October 31, Rogan's daughter, Lisa, accompanied by his former partner, semi-retired agent \"G\", arrives at the facility to rescue him. While navigating through the facility, they fend off against hordes of undead creatures, before they encounter Death, whom they fight twice. Later, they fight a deformed sloth, The Fool, and a mutated tendrilous plant named The Sun. Along the way, Lisa muses to \"G\" how she has to live in the shadows of her well-known father and that she is often the subject of his comparison.", "summary": "The House of the Dead III is a 2002 light gun arcade game with a horror zombie-survival theme, and the third installment to the House of the Dead series of video games, developed by Wow Entertainment and Sega. It was later ported to the Xbox in 2003, Microsoft Windows in 2005, the Wii in 2008 in a compilation with The House of the Dead 2, and PlayStation 3 in 2012 with PlayStation Move support. The game continues the story of the previous games and introduces new gameplay concepts such as story branching.
