It is only available in France and Canada.\n\nRayman's Dictations were first released in 1998. The collection consists of four editions. The title of each begins with Les Dict\u00e9es de Rayman, followed by CE2, CM1, CM2 or 6e.\n\nRayman's Dictations were then reissued in 1999 to be part of the Rayman School Accompaniment series. The title of the four editions has been changed to Rayman Accompaniment Scolaire, followed by CE2, CM1, CM2 or 6e. The collection is sometimes referred to as Rayman Dictations.\n\nRayman's Dictations were designed in collaboration with teams of teachers and researchers associated with the C.N.R.S., in accordance with the spelling corrections of 1990. They have been tested with schools and partner families.\n\nAimed at children between eight and twelve years old, Les Dict\u00e9es de Rayman offers an approach to learning spelling. They aim to make the player autonomous in his approach to resolving his spelling difficulties. Also, there is no immediate correction of errors in dictations. Instead, the player has access to several tools to help them correct themselves.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/les-dictees-de-rayman"}
