Ironically, the dark being addressed your grandfather, saying it's been a long time. Apparently, grandfather also knew who or what this figure was, since he called him by the name Rosenkreuz. Rosenkreuz explains that he has waited a hundred years, but now it is possible to bring back the God of Evil, and to control the world! But for an unknown reason, he needs Miu. Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: \"Save... Miu...\". And thus, Michimune embarks on a dangerous journey to the land of evil, to save Miu from the clutches of Rosenkreuz.", "summary": "Seirei Gari is an Adventure game, developed by Advance Communication Company and published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1989.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/seirei-gari"}
