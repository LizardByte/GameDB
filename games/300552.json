It was canceled for unknown reasons, but a prototype surfaced in 2006, dated 20th June, 1995 with a product code labelled GS-9015.\n\nThe subtitle is not official (the game refers to itself simply as \"Clockwork Knight\"), but has been applied due to the existence of the words \"Pengin War\" in the prototype version's header. Gameplay is similar to Sega's Pengo, which may suggest \"Pengin\" is a misspelling of \"Penguin\". That, or it originally had nothing to do with Clockwork Knight. Issue #3 of Sega Saturn Magazine calls the game Clockwork Knight Puzzle and suggests a February/March 1996 release date for Japan.\n\nThe game is played from a top-down perspective, in which Pepperouchau can pick up blocks from underneath him to reveal eggs. The object of the game is to defeat all the enemies by kicking eggs at them.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clockwork-knight-puzzle", "videos": [{"id": 113373, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wlqGXttrLFA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlqGXttrLFA", "title": "Clockwork Knight Puzzle (Pengin War) [Saturn] by SEGA [HD] [1080p60]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wlqGXttrLFA/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2199, "name": "Clockwork Knight"}]}
