History tells us that magic itself originated within its walls and that the castle was not built, but that it appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. Ever since its existence, the castle has granted individuals the gift of magic by surviving its challenge and completing its quest. What initially started as Earlwind\u2019s community of followers has since grown to become a sizable village of scholars and challengers.\n\nEvery year, people from all walks of life flock to Blackwater Village, to devote their lives to study the profound history of the castle and its secrets. Their ultimate goal is to overcome the castle's challenge and be granted the gifts of magic. Occasionally, a group of students will band together to form a temporary alliance. Together they will enter the castle and attempt its quest, knowing that failure results in death.", "summary": "Castle of Blackwater is a multiplayer social deduction game where 10 players navigate a magical 2D castle while completing tasks and uncovering hidden allegiances. Players are assigned to three different factions, each equipped with unique abilities that support their role in the game. While alive, participants use various tools to gather information and identify threats, while eliminated players can influence the outcome by collecting souls to purchase power-ups for their team. Through alliance-building, deception, and strategic ability usage, players work to ensure their faction's survival and ultimate control of the castle.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/castle-of-blackwater", "videos": [{"id": 140909, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "tKHyB5upmmI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKHyB5upmmI", "title": "Castle of Blackwater l Cinematic Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKHyB5upmmI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 138514, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "dUPPW4L6B_Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUPPW4L6B_Q", "title": "Castle of Blackwater I Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dUPPW4L6B_Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
