Don't record a long game like this you've never played before blind starting at midnight, you will fatigue fast and you skills and motivation and enjoyment of the game will dwindle fast. That's the story of this playthrough, the only bit that was not blind was me looking up the 5-4 boss because I was too tired. Good game, but not as good as the original snes version. Decent music and good gimmicks with the other babies aside, the level design gets obnoxious in a decent amount of levels.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQDvtHBc-54/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQDvtHBc-54/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQDvtHBc-54/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQDvtHBc-54/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Yoshi's Island DS (NDS) Longplay [164]", "description": "Oh boy, here's a free lesson for everyone.
