Fight back for freedom, sector by sector, turn by turn. Like the original Jagged Alliance series, Jagged Alliance Flashback gives you the choice to use your preferred tactics and build your squad around it - rush in with heavy armed troops or take the high road of distance shots and sniping.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jagged-alliance-flashback"}
