Use your newly imbued powers to enact The Shadow's Will and unveil your destiny.\n\nOrcs:\n\nThroughout the years, the Orcish shamans have felt the power of the Earth and Fire Elementals wane. A series of cataclysmic events has brought death to many strong Orc warriors. Meanwhile, the Elven Forests bloom and spread ever further.\n\nIn the Orc campaign, play as the Elder shaman Toral, convinced the forests are restricting the flow of power and use what power remains to wreak destruction and fire across the Elven lands.\n\nElves:\n\nCorruption taints the great Elven Forests, a slow decay is setting in and ancient creatures lay slain. Unrest is spreading and war threatens on multiple fronts.\n\nIn the Elf campaign, play as the druid Varen and root out the corrupting source to restore the former peace and harmony of the Forests.", "summary": "A hybrid of challenging turn-based strategy and customizable card collection gameplay set in a medieval fantasy universe.\n\nCampaigns\n\nGather your armies, ready your spells and delve into an engaging single player campaign.

With more chapters released each season, unravel the epic story arc underpinning the Kingdom Draw universe.\n\nOnline Ladder Play\n\nPit yourself against other players from around the world with cross-platform ladder play. Do you have what it takes to ascend the ladder with every victory and reap your rewards? At the end of each season, earn bonus rewards for how high you progressed up the ladder. Make it to the Titan league to have your alias displayed (and glorified for all time) in the Hall of Fame.\n\nDeck Building\n\nBuy randomised card packs with gems earned through ladder play and campaigns; or redeem victory tokens to obtain specific cards of your choice.

Strategically control locations to earn more resources, take advantage of terrain, and be the first to destroy your opponent\u2019s castle. Use power cards to decimate your enemies, alter your cards\u2019 combat effectiveness, and modify the terrain.\n\nFriendly Matches\n\nLooking for something more casual? Stick with the devil you know and add friends to challenge them to friendly battles. Friendly battles do not alter your ladder ranking or provide rewards, so you can trial your deck creations in a more relaxed arena.\n\nCross Platform\n\nLink your account across multiple platforms, allowing you to continue playing wherever you are.
