It's a side-scrolling platform game where the player can choose to play as either Spider-Man or Venom. As Spider-Man the objective is to save the citizens of New York from Venom's evil rampage before the population is reduced to less than five. Meanwhile, Venom's task is to attack and feed on the citizens before eliminating Spider-Man. Regardless of the character chosen the game contains the same twelve levels with the objectives being the same in all. The gameplay is also similar for both characters with running, jumping and swinging with either web or tentacles.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-spider-man--2"}
