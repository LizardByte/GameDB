The war that lasted 1,000 years is brought to an abrupt stop. The people rejoiced to usher in peace.\n\nFragments of Firebringer rain down onto the earth, like fireworks celebrating the victory of the humans and star gods. If Firebringer is extinguished, even the empire would become unnecessary.\n\nThe empire continues to rule, and many places react with rebellion. This ties into a civil war by the emperor\u2019s son and company. Amidst the chaos, a hero brings down Firebringer, the emperor is assassinated, and the empire collapses.\n\n70 years later.\n\nHardly anyone who remembers the era of the empire is around anymore.
