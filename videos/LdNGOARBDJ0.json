Unlike most arcade games, this one does require some strategy to get some treasure items to beat the game. There are some enemies like the ropers (a cactus and hair spike like creature) you can walk through without drawing your sword but can zap you if you do draw your sword which requires you to have a stronger sword to defeat these types of creatures. There are some items in the game granting you immunity from some enemies like the blue and red will 'o wisp (sparkling orb like objects) allowing you to pass through them without harm. This is only done with special items like rings which is needed to beat the game. On floor 59, it's best avoid blocking and absorbing magic spells from the wizards or the demon Druaga. As I noticed it reduced the strength of the sword preventing me from destroying the knights, dragons, and the demon Druaga which prevents you from advancing to the next level. You better off dodge them. \n\nNot a bad game but could of been better. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LdNGOARBDJ0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LdNGOARBDJ0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LdNGOARBDJ0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Longplay [858] Tower of Druaga", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: georgc3\n\nA Maze/Action-Adventure RPG game based on the Japanese Franchise series \"Babylonian Castle Saga\".
