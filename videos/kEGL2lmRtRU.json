The graphics for this game was very good for a flight simulator, and the sound was equally great. This game not only had subtitles when characters spoke, but actual speech as well. You could only use the speech pack if you had a Sound Blaster or a Roland MT sound card. Sound card technology reached a peak around this period. The voices and the sound effects in this game are excellent even by today's standards. The landscape, and aircraft in the game are more detailed than just simple polygons. There are actual textures on the aircraft, tanks, buildings, etc. It may look crude by today's standards, but it was quite advanced if you compare it to games like Su-25, LHX, Falcon 3.0, Mechwarrior, and others. \n\nThe actual game play for this game could be set by the player from rookie to ace. When you get to the actual dog fighting, it is very difficult to shoot down enemy aircraft. The A.I. is quite good, and using a missile to dispatch your enemy cannot be done easily, because your enemies will use countermeasures like flares and chaffs. You have to get very close and attack from the rights angles to successfully use a AIM-9 sidewinder heat seeking missile to get a kill. The sure way to get a kill in this game is by using the 20mm Vulcan cannon, but it can be a bit tricky to get your enemy in the right position to use it. The one good thing about flying modern fighter aircraft are the sophisticated avionics equipment & radars in them that aid in air combat. If you get a radar lock and select air to air guns, the computer will compute the point of impact with the star shaped reticle. You don't have to estimate where the rounds are going to hit. This means you don't have to waste a lot of ammunition to get a beat on the target, and it doesn't take many cannon rounds to severely damage an aircraft or destroy it. \n\nOne thing I really like about this game is the realistic damage control system. If you push \"D\", it will show you where your aircraft was damaged. If the landing gear was damaged, you cannot land. If the fuel tank was damaged, you will lose fuel quicker than normal. If your wings are damaged, you will not be able to maneuver well. If your radar is damaged, you will not be able to use radar guided weapons, like the AIM-120. \n\nThe environmental factors and realism of this game is top notch. You will be faced with what real combat pilots are faced with, like the effects of G forces. When you do a high G turn, you could black out and lose your consciousness. On the HUD, it will display the G forces. \n\nThe story line for this game is what makes this game special. In this game, you play the role of a combat mercenary squadron. The commander of the squadron gets killed during the game, and you take it over. From that point on, you can pick the missions you want, and in the order you choose. You run the squadron like you would run a business, you can buy weapons, see the operating expenses of the squadron, and pick the missions that will keep your squadron in the black. The story of this loops from the point where your commander gets treacherously killed by some 3rd world dictator, and you come back to avenge his death in the last mission. The last mission pays more money than any other mission, and you and your squadron mates get to go on a long vacation! The character development of the game is excellent, every pilot has their own style, and their unique personalities. \n\nOverall, this was a good game, and it was one of the best games I ever played.\n\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\n\u2666 Strike Commander w Speech Pack and Tactical Operations @ Ebay\n       \u2022 https://ebay.to/2MxnoTX\n\u2666 Strike Commander and Wing Commander Privateer @ Ebay\n       \u2022 https://ebay.to/2Vz3ADG\n\u2666 Strike Commander Original Game @ Amazon\n       \u2022 https://amzn.to/2IIrk36\n\u2666 Retro Computer Pentium 200 mhzs w Win95 + Voodoo II on Ebay\n     \u2022 https://ebay.to/2OuJ1qG\n\u2666 PCEM Emulator Tutorial to Emulate Socket 5 Pentium \n     \u2022 https://he-1000-1975.com/pcem-emulator-tutorial/#BB3\n\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\n\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2584\u2588", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEGL2lmRtRU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEGL2lmRtRU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEGL2lmRtRU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEGL2lmRtRU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Strike Commander Tactical Operations Mission 1 Syria", "description": "\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\n\u2666 Title: Strike Commander: Tactical Operations\n\u2666 Publisher: Origin Systems\n\u2666 Year Published: 1993\n\u2666 Format: MS-DOS 6.22\n\u2666 Minimum System Requirements: Intel 486 DX33 mhzs\n\u2666 Type: Flight Simulator\n\u2666 Difficulty: Hard\n\u2666 Flight Model: Simple\n\u2660 Recording Device: Samsung Camcorder with Tripod\n\u2660 Recording Resolution: 720 x 480 @ 30 fps\n\u2660 Aspect Ratio: 4:3\n\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\nReview:\n\nStrike Commander was one of the most unique flight simulators released in the early 1990s, and it was the best of its type at the time.
