Battle a crew of rowdy professional wrestlers including Jobber Joe, Chen Lee, Mad Moose, El Diablo, Kid Turbo, and Beardo.\nPlay vs. computer to capture and defend the belt, or locally versus a friend in hotseat mode.\nKnock down a flung opponent to earn stars. Use stars to dish out heavy damage with power slams, or leap off the turnbuckle for a high flying finishing move!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slam-mania"}
