You are put in the shoes of Edward: a body farm employee who is pained by his past, and only finding solace in the medicine that helps him get through the day. Edward is barely able to cope with his personal issues, which are only intensified by him living in solitude. He puts on a brave front and dutifully wakes up for work every day. His routine serves as his only anchor, but deep inside, trouble is simmering...\n\nOne night, while working the dreaded midnight shift, a chain of disturbing events draws Edward ever close to losing his grip on reality. As the very fabric of his world seems to unravel and twist. His home of the past few years is being pulled from under his feet. The cruel hand of fate once more nudging him towards disaster. One that threatens to engulf Edward's home in shadow.\n\nIs it merely his mind playing tricks on him? Or perhaps there truly is something darker clawing at his heels, threatening to drag him into the depths? We're counting on you to figure it out: The choices you make will shape the results of his terrifying tale. Trapped between a world of horrors inspired by the works of ones such as H.R. Giger, and the unkind reality of the body farm from whence he came.
