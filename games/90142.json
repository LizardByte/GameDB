The serum would give the user psychic abilities, or \"talents\", which could manipulate the world around them, for example levitating or shooting a bolt of lightning. Talents were split into collections called totems, and each Psionic specialised in the use of one totem, others even founding their own. Aiken became the founder of the Science totem.\n\nWhen the game starts, Cain has just been suspended from the DNPC following an incident with Priscilla Divine, leader of the Eye of Ra (a radical organisation who wish to destroy the CoT project for ethical reasons) and founder of the Sun totem. He is eventually recruited back and tasked with infiltrating the Eye of Ra, who have been operating under the guise of a psychic hotline, and apprehend Divine.", "summary": "In the near future, Psionics are among us. Their evil thoughts pulsate across time and space corrupting even the strongest minds. Players assume the role of Agent Cain, a powerful Psionic working for an elite government agency. As Cain, you strive for mastery of innate psychic \u201cTalents\u201d such as the ability to shoot fireballs or the power to summon hideous creatures. Using these \u201cTalents\u201d depletes both Health and Sanity, so players must walk a fine line to ensure that they don't lose their minds!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sanity-aikens-artifact", "videos": [{"id": 118671, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CisFPyKj2gg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CisFPyKj2gg", "title": "Sanity: Aiken's Artifact (2000) - PC Gameplay 4k 2160p / Win 10", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CisFPyKj2gg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118672, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2x7L6B-XRwo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x7L6B-XRwo", "title": "Trailer Sanity : Aiken's artifact", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2x7L6B-XRwo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118673, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "BHgNpGmSh-U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHgNpGmSh-U", "title": "Sanity: Aiken's Artifact (1) - Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BHgNpGmSh-U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
