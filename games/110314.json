After all, there\u2019s only one spot at the top and you just found a chainsaw\u2026\n\nGather your best friends, or enemies (doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ll turn on each other either way), and take down the rampaging hordes of monsters! Beat your \u201callies\u201d to the treasure and gear up with legendary weapons such as the Rat-on-a-Stick, a Scepter that sends love or a Flare Gun.. Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin: Quacked Quest can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can be the first to grab the ducks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/munchkin-quacked-quest", "videos": [{"id": 29960, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "-psfbszDaLI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-psfbszDaLI", "title": "Munchkin: Quacked Quest - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-psfbszDaLI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
