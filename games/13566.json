It focuses on Dam Busters who historically were used to heavily bombard strategic objectives, in this case dams.\n\nThis task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches.\n\nWhen the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually.
