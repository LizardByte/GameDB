UOSSMUD includes a class system based primarily on Final Fantasy Tactics, and worlds based on Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and Final Fantasy 5, 6, and 7. It has a focus on accurately recreating these worlds from the original games and mirroring their storylines in missions.\n\nIn addition to the above, UOSSMUD also has smaller amounts of content from a wide variety of Squaresoft and Square Enix games. There are classes based on the combat system from SaGa Frontier, bosses from Xenogears, and a roguelike mode based on Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon. This is a MUD with fast-paced combat, and a multiclassing system that allows for a wide variety of strategies.\n\nUOSSMUD has a blind user mode available to improve the experience for those who use a screen reader to play.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-unofficial-squaresoft-mud"}
