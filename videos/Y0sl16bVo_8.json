Sorry for my long public absense here on this platform. A lot has changed since the last video.\n\nOfficial small demo release at the end of december this year. \n\nI will upload more videos this month, showing what has changed. Basicly the whole project is pulled over to Unreal Engine 5, refactored from the ground up. A lot of fixes and adjustments in the physics. Finally I am getting close to the result I want.\n\nPlease don't blame the visual quality of the game. I wrote over 200.000 lines of code, I had literally no more time to upgrade the visuals. The main objective this year was to create a functional demo and game, making it run smooth on many system.\n\nBest regards, apfelbaum.\n\nBuy us a coffee: https://ko-fi.com/2unreal4underground\n\nGet more information on our discord server: https://discord.gg/NcXcVWtFyj\n\nLink to Ivans Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iKJPXiC7vFyBsynfd_XNg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0sl16bVo_8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0sl16bVo_8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0sl16bVo_8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0sl16bVo_8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0sl16bVo_8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "TUFU | Quick Solo Lap Around 'Phoenix Steel'", "description": "Here you can see a quick lap around the track 'Phoenix Steel'.
