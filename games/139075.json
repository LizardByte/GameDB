The game has been online since 1998 and although it is technically a browser game, it sees itself rather as an MMORPG. It is programmed and run entirely by volunteers, so playing is free. There are no monthly charges and no premium features that are restricted to players who register a paid account. \n \nThe game is player driven, all roles - from the emperor or commander of the Rebel Alliance to the fighter pilots - are open for player characters. Combat is not implemented yet, but the player driven economy offers many options to mine, trade or build cities, facilities and stations. \n \nAny new player can create their individual character selecting from various skills and more than 50 different races from Star Wars (Wookies, Twi'leks etc). They can then join an existing group - from the infamous Empire to less famous smaller production, trading or even pirate groups - and later found their own company. \n \nThere are more than 5,000 planets that can be explored and colonised. Player characters can own their own ships, vehicles, buildings, cities or even companies. Also player groups (\"factions\") can be owners of anything, setting the Star Wars Combine apart from alliances and guilds in many other similar games. \n \nThe Star Wars Combine offers many roles to choose from and thus allows the player to not only live their own dream of being whatever they want in the Star Wars universe, but also to adapt the game to their favoured style of play, playing the game as more of an adventure, a strategy game, a business sim, or just enjoying the lively community of like minded gamers and Star Wars fans. \n \nDespite the current lack of combat the Star Wars Combine offers a complexity and variety rather unusual for free browser games. If you like Star Wars, you should really give it a go.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-combine"}
