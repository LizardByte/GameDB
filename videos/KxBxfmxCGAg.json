This PC game is a multiplayer shooter/battle royale title taking place in the Second world war. Essentially, the game is a hybrid of the battle royale title that was mixed with war-based FPS games that combine individual and vehicle combat. Both genres are exceedingly popular and have a multitude of releases that are played regularly by millions across the world. \n\nHowever, the idea of BattleRush 2 is to combine all of them together and end up with a pretty interesting result, especially because it even uses elements of in-game building and crafting. The last thing has not been often seen in FPS games, not to mention those that are set in real historic periods. \n\nIn the game, players have a choice of getting either a Soviet soldier defending the Motherland or a Wehrmacht trooper. The battles are set in undefined spaces in Europe, supposedly the Soviet Union. Battle Rush 2 comes with environments that are fully destructible and where the same annihilation appears in phases. \n\nWith this, a small two-story building can be slowly chipped away until it only ends up as a pile of rubble. On the vehicle side, the game provides its players with 15 different kinds of war machines. These start with jeeps and small trucks that offer little protection and even less offensive capabilities but goes all the way to main battle tanks that were used by both sides. \n\nLastly, the game includes a crafting system that is designed to build defenses for the player. To do this, the player has access to many different resources - so much so that looking at the list of resources, which cover oil, stone, wood, metal and other things, the game might seem like a strategy.\n\nHowever, Battle Rush 2 is a purebred action game and the building segment is utilized by the player in the actual match. There, they can craft pillboxes, anti-tank mines, sandbags, concrete walls, and many more things. In this regard, the game could be reminiscent of Fortnight, but the building process is at a much higher level.\n\nBattle Rush 2 is a multiplayer-only experience with no additional mods like single player games. Instead, it\u2019s battle royale game mode is what the players get. The mission of the game is simple and the players should take ground belonging to the enemy army. Some matches set the player in an offensive position, while in other, they are located in their battlement and have to defend them. To do any of these options, they should employ everything at their disposal, along with their FPS fighting skills. \n\nBefore starting a match, the players can choose between seven classes that differ in gear while additional classes, as well as gear and guns, is available to unlock as the game progresses. \n\nThe gameplay itself is fun and dynamic, providing a setup that tries its best to employ all of the versatile elements like crafting and vehicle combat into a coherent multiplayer experience. However, the biggest sell point of the title is the stunning graphics of Battle Rush 2 not often seen in this type of games. Everything visual is on an impressive level and this is especially true with all of the destructible environment. However, the same high quality is clear when it comes to the animation of characters, weapons, and vehicles. \n\nEngaging and fun, Battle Rush 2 is a title that anyone who is into battle royale and/or WW2 games should check out.\n\nUsed segments of the following videos:\n\nBattleRush 2 - Gameplay Highlights - Playing Sniper, Losing Friends, & Village Penetration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59H1IwdQFDQ\n\nBattleRush 2 - PC WW2 FPS 2018 - Crafting, Building, & Destruction! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9YIhG2hqek", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KxBxfmxCGAg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KxBxfmxCGAg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KxBxfmxCGAg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KxBxfmxCGAg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KxBxfmxCGAg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "BattleRush 2 Review and Gameplay (WW2 Multiplayer Shooter)", "description": "Do you struggle with procrastination?
