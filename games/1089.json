However, Donkey Kong unexpectedly recovers, takes Pauline, and escapes with her into the Big-City. Mario pursues the two.", "summary": "Donkey Kong is a Game Boy game which starts out with the premise of being a straight remake of the original Donkey Kong arcade game. Although at first it appears to be just a port, the familiar levels from the arcade game are just a prelude to the real platform jumping adventure. There are 96 levels spread out over 12 worlds. These levels are much more complex than the originals, featuring scrolling backgrounds, numerous objects to collect, and enemies to avoid. Along the way, you will encounter several boss style battles with Donkey Kong, as well. When played on a Super Game Boy, the game is colorized, digitized speech is added and the ending music takes advantage of the SNES sound chip.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/donkey-kong--2", "videos": [{"id": 34028, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "QMb6ObDPlXk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMb6ObDPlXk", "title": "Donkey Kong Longplay (Game Boy) [60 FPS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QMb6ObDPlXk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62860, "name": "TV commercial", "video_id": "s4dinHwO2nU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4dinHwO2nU", "title": "Nintendo Game Boy - Donkey Kong commercial (1994)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s4dinHwO2nU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
