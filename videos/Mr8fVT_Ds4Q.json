Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects\u2014everything, down to the Tetris pieces themselves, pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you\u2019re playing.\n\nFrom deep beneath the ocean to the furthest reaches of outer space and everywhere between, TETRIS EFFECT\u2019s 30-plus stages take players on a wondrous, emotional journey through the universe.
