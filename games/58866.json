It's not been live in for ages, because the previous owner disappeared - vanished without a trace, so it's in a bit of a state. Your own furniture isn't due to arrive for a while so you take a camp bed and set off to Bluebell Cottage to take stock and make a start on the cleaning. Luckily you also bought some furniture with the house so the place isn't that empty.\n\nThe cottage isn't the only thing you bought, along with the house comes some grounds containing a small lake and a derelict mill which is the 'folly referred to in the title.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/agathas-folly"}
