Shoot bullets! \"Last Neko\" follows the story of the last catboy in a world where catgirls and catboys have been enslaved or slaughtered since a long time under the martial law of the Half-Dog Empire. You play as Katz, the last of his kind, a catboy kid who wants to prove he has the right to exist. And maybe to save the remaining catboys and catgirls along the way. \n \nLast Neko features: \n \n* Six levels of fast-paced action! \n* Six challenging boss battles! \n* Challenge and almost no dead time! If a moment is quiet, it is not really quiet! \n* Retro pixel art design, mostly made with the palette of the good old NES! \n* Chiptune soundtrack, made of 10 tracks! \n* A catboy who pew pew pew! \n \nLast Neko does not feature: \n \n* Skill trees. The game is based on your skill and only on your skill! \n* Grind. You will probably die, retry, die and retry again. That's fine! That's how things are working with danmaku! Learn the patterns and feel your skill improve along the runs! \n* Complicated gameplay with tons of stuff to upgrade. Shoot, drop bombs, move forward!The only thing to upgrade is the knowledge of the game! \n* Royalty-free and third party assets. Everything has been done by one developer and handcrafted with love! \n* Fake difficulty. I worked the game design and iterated it a lot of times in order to avoid to do what you shouldn't do when you develop a danmaku. (that includes : color contrast between background and bullets, bonus drops hiding bullets, and stuff like that).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-neko"}
