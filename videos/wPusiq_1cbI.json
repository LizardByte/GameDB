{"id": "wPusiq_1cbI", "snippet": {"title": "Gabriel knight 3 - Day 1, 10:00 am, Walkthrough", "description": "Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned is a point-and-click adventure game, developed by Sierra Studios, and is the third title in the Gabriel Knight series. The game was designed by Jane Jensen, and was released in 1999 for PCs and again in 2001 as a part of Sierra's Best Seller Series. The plot sees Gabriel Knight and his assistant Grace Nakimura attempting to track down an infant that had been abducted from the home of a Scottish family of nobles, and features various religious, mythological and historical elements in the story - primarily vampires, the fabled legend of the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, the Freemasons and the Priory of Sion, and Jesus.\n\nWhile the previous installments focused on different graphic designs, in that the first featured computer-generated, partially rotoscoped graphics and scanned comic book art, while the second was done entirely in full motion video, Gabriel Knight 3 is the first game in the series to be in full 3D. In a departure from the previous two entries, the score was composed by David Henry, who expanded upon some of the themes created by Robert Holmes, while the game saw Tim Curry return in the role of Gabriel Knight; the voice actors for Grace and Mosely were recast. The game was released shortly after the crash of the adventure video game industry, but could not match the critical and financial success of its two predecessors, making it the last adventure game to be published by Sierra.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPusiq_1cbI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPusiq_1cbI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPusiq_1cbI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPusiq_1cbI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPusiq_1cbI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Gabriel knight 3 - Day 1, 10:00 am, Walkthrough", "description": "Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned is a point-and-click adventure game, developed by Sierra Studios, and is the third title in the Gabriel Knight series.
