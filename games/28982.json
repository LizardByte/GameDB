The game is in 2D and consists of a number of puzzles centered on using items collected and interacting with other NPCs. There is no dialogue in the game and the difficulty often derives from trying to determine why a character behaves in the way it does. Solutions to the puzzles are often illogical, in keeping with the atmosphere of the game which has been described as psychedelic.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/full-pipe", "videos": [{"id": 55495, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "55N4TWiZ2Hg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55N4TWiZ2Hg", "title": "Full Pipe - Deutscher Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/55N4TWiZ2Hg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
