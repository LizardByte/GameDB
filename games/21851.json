They have been turned into demons because of a curse cast by the Overlord Zenon of the Netherworld. Adell is the only one who has remained a human. In the opening scene, Adell's mother performs a summoning ritual in hopes to summon Overlord Zenon so they can kill him and break the curse, but instead summons Rozalin. Rozalin introduces herself as the princess and daughter of Overlord Zenon and shows the royal seal of Zenon. Because of the seemingly failed ritual, Adell plans to find Overlord Zenon himself in a quest with the help from Rozalin and other characters throughout the game.", "summary": "In the peaceful world of Veldime, humans rarely encountered monsters. That was until Overlord Zenon cursed the land and all who reside within. With the curse in place, the humans became monsters and ravaged the world. It is up to Adell, the last remaining human, to oppose Overlord Zenon's tyranny and restore peace and harmony to Veldime. In Disgaea 2, players will take on the role of a young fighter named Adell and travel the Netherworld to defeat the evil overlord Zenon. Battles will take place on a 3D grid-based field. During combat, players will take turns with the enemy to move and attack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 37722, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "qn4qqguYpQA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn4qqguYpQA", "title": "[HD] [PSP] Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days - Opening", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qn4qqguYpQA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46837, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "pqFqyQDWyQ8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqFqyQDWyQ8", "title": "Disgaea\u00ae 2: Dark Hero Days Main English Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pqFqyQDWyQ8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46838, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "N3OpCJjWtfs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3OpCJjWtfs", "title": "Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days ...
