Ltd for the Sega Pico. It was released in Japan in August 1994. It was not released in North America until two years later, in November 1996, and was never released in Europe.\n\nIt is a party game featuring Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles Tails Prower, Amy Rose, and Dr. Robotnik/Dr. Eggman, and features many different mini-games. Compared to the Japanese version, games featuring gambling, fortune-telling, fantasy violence, rock-paper-scissors, and other noneducational elements were omitted from the North American version. This means that the entire third page from the Japanese version is eliminated and the remaining games are in different locations than in the Japanese version. The North American version replaces the pilfered non-educational content with a drawing page for young players to create their own designs.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 15115, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "uIE1mUY77nw"}]}
