If they choose a swan, for example, they'll unleash Elsa\u2019s ice powers to write the letter \u2018S\u2019 in the sky, and then transform it into a sparkling swan sculpture. This gives them practice with handwriting and reinforces phonics skills.\n\nChildren can then adorn their sculpture with flowers by joining Olaf in a spelling mini-game. Children are asked to build smaller words such as \u201call\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d from the letters in a bigger story-based word, such as \u201csnowball.\u201d Flowers grow to reward each word they find. Once they\u2019ve gathered enough flowers, children can help Olaf arrange the words on each bouquet into sentences, then use the bouquets to decorate their ice sculpture.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Anna, Olaf and Kristoff to deliver the finished sculptures, and children can get a little extra fine-motor-skill practice as they draw a path for Kristoff\u2019s sled with their LeapPad stylus. Then they\u2019re off for fast-paced fun as they tilt and turn their LeapPad to steer the sled away from hazards and toward glistening snowflakes that keep the sculptures from melting.\n\nThe Disney Frozen learning game works with all LeapPad\u21222, tablets and above.\n\nSee more learning tips and videos on our channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/LeapFrogOfficialSite\n\nFollow LeapFrog on social media:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/LeapFrog\nTwitter: http://www.facebook.com/LeapFrog\nPinterest: http://http://www.pinterest.com/LeapFrogInc\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/LeapFrogOfficial\"", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/khQUyBNIq58/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/khQUyBNIq58/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/khQUyBNIq58/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/khQUyBNIq58/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/khQUyBNIq58/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Disney Frozen: Special Delivery | LeapFrog", "description": "\"Your child can help Anna, Elsa and Olaf deliver beautiful ice sculptures in this fun learning game for kids!\nhttp://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/store/p/disney-frozen-learning-game/_/A-prod39301\n\nChildren begin by choosing an ice sculpture to create.
