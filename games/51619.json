You start by playing different \"Levels\" which you can cooperatively beat with up to 8 players, the storyline is relatively good and is told by hi resolution artwork, the dialogue can be pretty funny :).The gameplay is hack and slash which for newcomers to the genre is very fun, not a very steep learning curve. The boss battles is pretty cool with the music to accompany them nice. PVP is a little bit slow but it's ok, Lunia's Strengths lie in it's Cooperative Play.
