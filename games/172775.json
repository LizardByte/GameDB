The special feature of the simulation is speech recognition with a accompanying microphone. Of course it doesn't really understand what the player is saying but it reacts to the mode of speaking - a friendly tone makes it happy and loud or hectic speeches makes it sad. Sometimes it speaks back and a \"conversation\" occurs. Over time it learns to distinguish the player's voice from others.\n\nLike other virtual pets the Fin Fin needs to eat and sleep. The game is set in a virtual world where the Fin Fin can meet other animals (the player can't interact with those). The pet either plays with them or is scared which affects its mood. A happy Fin Fin rewards the player by singing a song or performing stunts.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fin-fin-on-teo-the-magic-planet"}
