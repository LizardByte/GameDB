Seed believes that he has been chosen to protect the people of Hope County from an \"inevitable collapse\" and has established a congregation called Eden's Gate. Ostensibly, this is to fulfill his mission of leading the people to salvation; in reality, Seed is a radical preacher and Eden's Gate is a militaristic doomsday cult. Under his rule, Eden's Gate has used both coercion and violence to forcibly convert the residents of Hope County, and intimidation to keep them from contacting the federal government for help. When an attempt to arrest Seed ends with the deaths of several lawmen, the player is swept into the armed conflict between Eden's Gate and the remaining Hope County residents who are organizing themselves into a resistance movement. The player takes on the role of a sheriff's deputy who is sent to Hope County to arrest Seed. Seed has assumed the title of \"the Father\" and maintains control over Hope County with the aid of his siblings, known as \"the Heralds\": Jacob, a former military officer that oversees their armed soldiers; John, a lawyer that has been able to acquire much of the land in Hope County for Eden's Gate; and Faith, who acts as a pacifist to bring the people to believe and trust in her older brother. The residents of Hope County opposed to Seed include Pastor Jerome, a local church leader that has seen his congregation taken by Eden's Gate; Mary May, a bartender whose father was murdered by the cult; and Nick Rye, a cropduster pilot who wants to eliminate the influence of the cult in order to build a better future for his children.", "summary": "Welcome to Hope County, Montana, land of the free and the brave, but also home to a fanatical doomsday cult known as The Project at Eden\u2019s Gate that is threatening the community's freedom. Stand up to the cult\u2019s leader, Joseph Seed and the Heralds, and spark the fires of resistance that will liberate the besieged community.\n\nIn this expansive world, your limits and creativity will be tested against the biggest and most ruthless baddest enemy Far Cry has ever seen. It\u2019ll be wild and it\u2019ll get weird, but as long as you keep your wits about you, the residents of Hope County can rest assured knowing you\u2019re their beacon of hope.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/far-cry-5", "videos": [{"id": 14338, "name": "Far Cry 5 Full Presentation", "video_id": "m1kF9rz2ric", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1kF9rz2ric", "title": "Far Cry 5 Full Presentation | E3 2017 Ubisoft Press Conference", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1kF9rz2ric/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14580, "name": "E3 2017 Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "invCtVgUlyA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=invCtVgUlyA", "title": "Far Cry 5 - E3 2017 Gameplay Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/invCtVgUlyA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14581, "name": "E3 2017: The Father's Amazing Grace Trailer", "video_id": "hJHLjaqhmyY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHLjaqhmyY", "title": "Far Cry 5 - E3 2017: The Father's Amazing Grace Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hJHLjaqhmyY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14582, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "q2Ma9HstasU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2Ma9HstasU", "title": "Far Cry 5 - Announcement Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2Ma9HstasU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 15589, "name": "Commented Extended Walkthrough Trailer", "video_id": "imKO65TTBBo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imKO65TTBBo", "title": "Far Cry 5 - Commented Extended Walkthrough Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/imKO65TTBBo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16556, "name": "PGW 2017 Announce Trailer", "video_id": "DW6lQSwL8oA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW6lQSwL8oA", "title": "Far Cry 5: Co-Op - Friend For Hire | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DW6lQSwL8oA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16581, "name": "PGW17 Co-Op Trailer", "video_id": "65eh4YdWfHI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65eh4YdWfHI", "title": "Far Cry 5 - PGW17 Co-Op Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/65eh4YdWfHI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 17183, "name": "The Resistance Trailer", "video_id": "P3La92ethq4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3La92ethq4", "title": "Far Cry 5 - The Resistance Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3La92ethq4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 18090, "name": "Story Trailer", "video_id": "TgT2r-hB4pw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgT2r-hB4pw", "title": "Far Cry 5 - Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TgT2r-hB4pw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 18501, "name": "The Baptism Live Action Trailer", "video_id": "UA4KoqTICog", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA4KoqTICog", "title": "Far Cry 5 - The Baptism Live Action Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UA4KoqTICog/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 18523, "name": "Post Launch Trailer", "video_id": "-Se1hEYRDik", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Se1hEYRDik", "title": "Far Cry 5 - Post Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Se1hEYRDik/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 18805, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "ZOSesIeUHCM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOSesIeUHCM", "title": "Far Cry 5 - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZOSesIeUHCM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
