All 251 Pok\u00e9mon are available in-game without trading, too. We've reworked all of the trainers and wild encounters to fit as well. In addition, there have been a few visual tweaks, and we've added a few new places to explore, too!\n\nIt's not a super technically impressive ROM hack but we've put a ton of work into it and we're really proud of the end result!\n\nIf you want to play it, here's a patch to be applied the original Pok\u00e9mon Crystal ROM:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QJbMI26C0cX8va2Fi95WLesr5QarwMiW?usp=sharing\n\nFor legal reasons we can't provide the pre-patched ROM, but if for whatever reason you have a vanilla Pok\u00e9mon Crystal ROM you can apply the .ips patch to it with a program such as LunarIPS :)\n\nAlso, check out our tumblr! We'll be posting some art we made to celebrate the release, as well as answering any questions! pokefoolsgold.tumblr.com\n\nEdit 4/15/2020: We now have a discord server! https://discord.gg/xMA9Udq", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4UBiwAW_Ut8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4UBiwAW_Ut8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4UBiwAW_Ut8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4UBiwAW_Ut8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4UBiwAW_Ut8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pok\u00e9mon Fool's Gold Trailer", "description": "A couple of friends and I have been working hard at a Pok\u00e9mon Crystal ROM hack for the past year or so and it's finally complete! \n\nIn this game, all of the Pok\u00e9mon have been reworked... think Alolan/Galarian forms, for all the Pok\u00e9mon.
