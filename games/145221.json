The game was never released in Japan. A Pocketsize version of the game was also released. The unit's model number was MG-61. In the game, you have to avoid the platforms that are coming towards the player character, Ziggy the Mazeman. The game's name comes from the fact that you'll be \"squished\" if a platform hits you. The top screen contained game information, while all of the action took place on the bottom screen. This and Zelda were the only two games to have a format like this when it came to multi-screen games.", "videos": [{"id": 71204, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TiT5T0MpPn8"}]}
