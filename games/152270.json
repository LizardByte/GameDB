Me neither!\n\nThis game is a throwback to dreaming and not having your cake, don't remember anything? No worries, you'll forget everything after today too!\n\nThis game is basically a simulation on what a dream could hypothetically be. What is a dream? What is a nightmare? What is your mind that causes you to have a weird dream that doesn't make sense? Are we guilty? Are we innocent?"}
