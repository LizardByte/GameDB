Aetolia is played entirely in text with minimal graphics.\n\nCharacters in Aetolia talk, trade, fight, plot and even kill and eat each other. They roam the continents and explore dungeons, killing (or helping) foul creatures, gather gold and treasure while increasing in power and prestige.\n\nUnlike other fantasy settings, Aetolia enables you to play characters of all alignments and creeds, and it's entirely in the hands of the player whether to become a hated villain, vaunted hero, or anything in between.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
