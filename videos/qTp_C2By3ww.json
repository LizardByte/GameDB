Operencia: The Stolen Sun embraces everything you love about classic first-person dungeon-crawlers, enhancing the old-school turn-based RPG experience with modern sensibilities. \n\nABOUT THIS GAME\nZen Studios\u2019 modern homage to classic first-person dungeon-crawlers takes you to the land of Operencia, an unconventional fantasy world inspired by a faraway land referenced in countless Central European folktales. An old-school turn-based battle system combines with Central European mythology to offer an RPG experience that feels unique yet also familiar.\n\nWHERE HISTORY MEETS LEGEND\nOperencia is home to an intriguing mix of unexplored mythology and fantastical versions of actual historical locations (e.g., Deva Fortress, B\u00e1lv\u00e1nyos) and characters (e.g., Attila, Seven Chieftains of the Magyars), all coming together to form one cohesive new gaming universe. Several of your own seven party members take influence from heroes of forgotten tales told hundreds of years ago, such as the brave knight Mezey and Sebastian the Dragon Slayer. \n\nA TALE FOR THE AGES\nAn unknown force has abducted the Sun King Napkir\u00e1ly, leaving Operencia in a state of perpetual darkness \u2013 and eventual doom. From hidden royal tombs and cursed castles to an ascent up the World Tree to reach the Copper Forest of the Land of the Gods, explore diverse settings throughout the far reaches of the land\u2026and beyond. Each location boasts its own unique atmosphere, visual style, level design and puzzles, and many take place entirely outdoors. \n\nBEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION\nBreathtaking hand-drawn cutscenes and fabulous 2D character portraits bring the story to life in a style not easily compared to any other game. More than 30 colorful roles are fully voiced through top-tier performances authentic to the game\u2019s Central European roots. \n\nPUZZLES EVERYWHERE\nFrom intricate riddles to selecting the proper ingredients to craft new items, dozens of puzzles challenge your brainpower throughout all of Operencia.  \n\nCLASSIC GAMEPLAY AND EXPLORATION\nAlong with a deeply strategic turn-based battle system full of spells and special skills to execute, tile-based movement encourages thorough exploration of each area. For added challenge, turn on Cartographer mode to plot out each of the 13 maps yourself. How many secrets will you find? \n\nOTHER KEY FEATURES\n\u2022 Explore 13 diverse, puzzle-filled levels \n\u2022 Defeat more than 50 enemy types \n\u2022 Switch between 7 fully upgradable \u2013 and memorable \u2013 characters\n\u2022 Robust difficulty settings allow you to select options such as limiting saves, implementing permadeath, and disabling auto-mapping to create your own\n\u2022 Stunning visuals powered by Unreal Engine 4\n\u2022 An epic orchestral score composed by Arthur Gr\u00f3sz\n\u2022 Fully 3D environments, enemies and objects, plus high-fidelity advanced effects with dynamic shadows and lighting\n\u2022 AAA Indie production quality and polish with top-tier voice acting, soundtrack, cutscenes and writing", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTp_C2By3ww/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTp_C2By3ww/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTp_C2By3ww/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTp_C2By3ww/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTp_C2By3ww/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Operencia: The Stolen Sun | Launch Trailer | Download Zen\u2019s Modern Classic Dungeon Crawler Now!", "description": "Operencia: The Stolen Sun modernizes the classic first-person dungeon-crawling RPG is now available on Xbox One \u2013 including Xbox Games Pass \u2013 the Epic Game store, and Windows 10.
