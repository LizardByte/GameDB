The game's core gameplay revolves around quick reflexes and strategic movement as players aim to gather all tokens, with added bonuses for collecting them in the correct flashing order. Power-ups occasionally fall from above, temporarily granting the ability to capture enemies for points. With only three lives at their disposal, players must balance speed and caution to progress. Bombo's simple yet challenging mechanics, combined with its time-limited power-ups and bonus scoring system, create an addictive and engaging experience reminiscent of classic arcade games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bombo"}
