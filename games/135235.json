Some were a bit of a bust, others were pretty rad. \n \nThese games are simple prototypes, proof of concepts, or unfinished works. \n \nWeek 1 - DRIFTING Through Time \nTheme: 10 seconds or less. \n \nTurning your car sideways is SO COOL it FREEZES TIME! Drift to stop time, get as many laps as you can before time runs out! \n \nWeek 2 - Dog Ownership Simulator \nTheme: Durational \n \nPlay with your dog! Click and drag to give it a spin, swipe on poos to clean them up! \n \nWeek 3 - Chillin' Bayside \nTheme: Melbourne \n \nA simple little physics toy inspired by summer holidays on the great ocean road. Kinda like playing around in a bath - click and hold the mouse to push stuff around :) \n \nWeek 4 - Paint the Town Red \nTheme: Colour \n \nBounce around the world and paint as you go, cherry tomato! A game dedicated to a personal friend of the author. \n \nWeek 5 - RONG \nTheme: Phsyics \n \nAn inter-dimensional pong remix, RONG has you sticking it out for the highest score!
