Unique enemy sequences and attack patterns will overlap with each other to challenge the player's reflexes and quick decision making. Will you risk losing a life for the sake of a few hundred extra score points, or will you choose a less rewarding, but safer maneuver?\n\nA single bullet hit will cost you a life, after all.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hypnorain", "videos": [{"id": 9245, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hOOGYAGfhn4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOOGYAGfhn4", "title": "Hypnorain - Bullet Hell Shooter Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hOOGYAGfhn4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
