I was part of the team back then, helping out with things so that's why I still had this stuff laying around after so many years.\n\nThis trailer was produced before the first public beta sometime (I believe) in May of 2006. No monsters were present in this build, and there was only one class. PvP existed with an unfinished quest. At the time, I had no influence with the project till about a week after the release of the first beta. So.. details about this beta are pretty vague to me as my involvement was riiiiighht around the corner. Like I said in Trailer 2, I'm more than happy to answer any questions regarding this game. Simply PM me! =)\n\n\nCredits: \nAoDC - Project Lead/Design/Programmer \nHoF - Design/Mapper/Story\nYue - Sprites \nKren - Sprites \ngm112 - Server / Development\n\nThere were many, many others who have helped out with the project. It's been too long for me to remember.\n\nUPDATE -- Source code here: https://gd-u.com/files/Resources/OOL.7z", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKXftQ6-B84/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKXftQ6-B84/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKXftQ6-B84/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Life Online (Trailer 1)", "description": "-- Trailer 2 --\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLFCX0aQMuw\n\nZelda OOL(Oracle of Life Online) was an online fan game developed at www.zfgc.com in 2006.
