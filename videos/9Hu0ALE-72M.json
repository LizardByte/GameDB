Among the many different life forms discovered, one stands out above them all. A bacteria-esque life form found on Proxima B has been named PBB-1. PBB-1 photosynthesizes and also binds to other organic material, taking over them and devouring them to grow bigger and expand. The researchers and scientists were certain this bacteria did not bind to human beings, but they would be proven wrong. Onboard the SS Destiny, while on the way back to Earth, all hell breaks loose as PBB-1 infects passengers and tries to bind to all other organic material on the ship. Humanity's ingenuity has gotten them further than any other animal in their home solar system, but they will face an unknown horror in a small, black bacteria-like life form, showing them they are not as strong and powerful as they once thought.\n\nPlease leave feedback\n\nMade with Godot", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Hu0ALE-72M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Hu0ALE-72M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Hu0ALE-72M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Hu0ALE-72M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Hu0ALE-72M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The SS Destiny Disaster Steam Trailer V2 - Survival Horror FPS", "description": "Check out the new and very improved demo on Steam:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/3197230/The_SS_Destiny_Disaster/\n\nInspired by Resident Evil\n\nIn 2197, the SS Destiny arrived at Proxima B in the Alpha Centauri star system and discovered something incredible - life.
