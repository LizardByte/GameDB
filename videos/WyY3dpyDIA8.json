Special ending shown. \n\nThis recording is of the projection for the left eye to make for easy viewing in 2D. \n\nI know it was branded as a Mario game, and it's quite good, but still - why did Nintendo use this as the pack-in game? The 3D effect is impressive, the music is good, and it plays well, but this is a surprisingly shallow game as the included launch game for the system. That's not necessarily a negative - it's a lot of fun to play again and again with all of the experimenting to be done with different styles using each of the characters - but Tennis really strikes me as a bizarre choice over some sort of shooter or platformer - if anything, why not TeleroBoxer? \n\nIt might disappoint a bit because of the expectations that come with both the Mario name and a Nintendo pack-in title, but if you can get past that, it's really quite enjoyable. They did a much better job of rendering Tennis in red than Hudson did in the 1984 PC88 port of the original Nintendo Tennis. That game looks it was vomited on by a hot dog cart. \n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WyY3dpyDIA8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WyY3dpyDIA8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WyY3dpyDIA8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WyY3dpyDIA8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mario's Tennis (Virtual Boy) 2D Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Nintendo's 1995 3D sports game for the Virtual Boy, Mario's Tennis.\n\nThis playthrough shows the singles tournament mode as Yoshi on the hard difficulty, followed by a doubles tournament (beginning at 25:16) as Donkey Kong Jr. on the super hard difficulty.
