She wants you to finish what you have begun. Kill King Arthur \u2013\nor whatever he has become after she took his dying vessel to Avalon.", "summary": "King Arthur: Knights Tale mixes an XCOM-style turn-based battle system with traditional RPG mechanics, including character development, choices that impact the direction of your campaign, and upgrading your home base of Camelot.\n\nThe story follows Sir Mordred, who travels with a band of knights across Avalon in search of King Arthur. This is already an interesting twist on the classic legend, as Sir Mordred is King Arthur's nemesis, traditionally shown as the king's traitorous nephew.\n\nIn this version of the tale, Mordred has actually mortally wounded Arthur, and is now stalking him through the isle of Avalon to finish the job on command of The Lady of the Lake.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-arthur-knights-tale", "videos": [{"id": 41701, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "b9BsgIfY5xo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9BsgIfY5xo", "title": "King Arthur: Knight's Tale | Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b9BsgIfY5xo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 45499, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "eB1J4LD47Ik", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB1J4LD47Ik", "title": "King Arthur: Knight's Tale | CGI Trailer Sneak Peek", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eB1J4LD47Ik/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 45500, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "xGXygsoDkvE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXygsoDkvE", "title": "King Arthur: Knight's Tale | Cinematic Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xGXygsoDkvE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 45501, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6VILXGI8B8Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VILXGI8B8Y", "title": "King Arthur: Knight's Tale Dev Stream", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6VILXGI8B8Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
