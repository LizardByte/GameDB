The main difference from the previous game is that the player starts out on the Contestant's Row which means he has to wait for his turn while watching other contestants first playing the game. At times, the contestants will ask the player for advice. Once the proper game has started it works like before with the player choosing to open boxes to reveal their contents while deciding whether to accept the banker's offer. If unsure it's possible to ask another contestant for advice. In addition to the main mode, there's a quick play mode that skips the contestant's row, a banker's mode where the player makes the offers and a shortened mode called What would you do now? which lasts for a maximum of four rounds.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/new-deal-or-no-deal"}
