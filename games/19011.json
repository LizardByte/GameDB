The peaceful inhabitants of the planet decide enough is enough and a hero emerges amongst them who hopes to lead his people to freedom...\n\nUsing nefarious means and exploiting the disunity amongst the human ranks, Harec recruits a rag tag group of rogues, outlaws and hired guns from the various factions and pits them against those who would destroy his people...\n\nAs they begin to fight back against the human invaders, the Raiders soon face a new deadly threat wholly intent on making the entire universe burn, just for kicks\u2026.\"", "summary": "The game is being released as set of standalone campaigns that can be played in any order.
