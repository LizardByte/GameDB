In any case, it starts on an unnamed, small, icy islet near the moon (which is really a recolored version of Scaraba from the original EarthBound/Mother 2), and takes place on a Starmen.net-specific holiday named EB No Matsuri, which is very similar to Christmas. It's unknown in which year/decade it exactly takes place, however.\n\nArn wakes up in his house from what appears to be a crash, which turns out to be Ness, who accidentally crashed into his house while teleporting to an EB No Matsuri party. Arn, who's not familiar with EB No Matsuri or the Annual Gift Man, thinks it's 'some sort of cult', and Ness suggests that they should go to the moon and tell him to 'prove a complete stranger to be a fool'. And thus, the two become traveling partners.\n\nIn Arn's hometown, Arn and Ness first talk to all of the animals, as well as to 'Luigi' who hides behind a building that's actually the first battling/boss area. 'Luigi' says that he doesn't have anything to say yet, and that Arn and Ness should come back once they're worthy.\n\nArn and Ness then go looking for spaceship parts in order to go to the moon, and have to defeat a few bosses in order to get them, namely Mr. Evil Nihco in his cave, Satan Claws in a haunted department store, and Thunder Storm in an area similar to the Fire Springs from the original EarthBound/Mother 2.", "summary": "In the words of its creator, \u201cArn\u2019s Winter Quest has been a labor of love for me for two months, and rivals those hacks such as Hat Quest and EarthBound 2.5: Electric Boogaloo Joint Jive. It has a lot of fun inside jokes, an incoherent story, and all new battle graphics. This hack is basically linear Dragon Warrior with a bunch of humor thrown in, so if you like fighting and you like funny and you like very hard viewtiful fun time hacks, then don\u2019t play this hack because it\u2019ll satisfy your cravings and your head will probably explode.\u201d", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
