In this world there were 4 kingdoms named Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.\n\nOne day, the skies of Sarasaland were suddenly covered by a huge black cloud. From a crack in this cloud, the unknown space monster Tatanga emerged to try to conquer Sarasaland.\n\nTatanga hypnotized the people of all the kingdoms so that he could control them in any way he liked. In this way he took over Sarasaland. Now, he wants to marry Princess Daisy of Sarasaland and make her his queen.\n\nMario came to know of these events, and he has started on a journey to the Chai Kingdom where Princess Daisy is held captive, in order to restore peace to Sarasaland.\n\nCan Mario defeat Tatanga, release people from his interstellar hypnosis, and rescue Princess Daisy? It's all up to you and Mario's skill. Go for it Mario!", "summary": "Super Mario Land is the first Mario's outing on the Game Boy. It is a side-scrolling platformer much in the vein of the previous Super Mario Bros. This time, Mario must save Princess Daisy, rather than Princess Toadstool, from her kidnapper Tatanga, a mysterious spaceman. The game follows largely the same formula of its aforementioned predecessor, with Mario defeating enemies by jumping on them and collecting coins and power ups by hitting floating blocks, with each world leading up to a boss fight which is defeated using by collapsing the floor. A unique feature of this instalment is two scrolling shoot-'em-up levels, the first of which Mario pilots a submarine, and the second an aeroplane.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 35365, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PG1q5q0spQE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG1q5q0spQE", "title": "\u3010\u5358\u767a\u5b9f\u6cc1\u3011\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u3092\u666e\u901a\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PG1q5q0spQE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
