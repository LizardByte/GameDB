Lot of people had been wondering if I'm still alive. It had been an eventful 5 years, and here is the TLDR version:\n\n+ Graduated\n= Met Girl\n= Love girl\n= Got kid\n= Needed Stable Job\n= Found Job\n= Liked Job\n= Worked Hard\n\nBetween work and family, the game development had to take a back seat and had been progressing slowly. As technology changes, I also decided to switch from Flash to better platform (Unity), and that took a good year.\n\nThe next game is not dead nor forgotten, it is just coming along very slowly. I'm hoping to have prototype available by next year end. I haven't decided how to distribute the game. It is most likely will be available on steam though, and i will give free copies for fan of the original Ge.ne.sis game on my mailing list when it is ready to come out.\nAgain, thank you for all the love, supports, and emails that you all sent me over the year. I read every single one of them and they meant a lot and they kept me going. It is just getting harder and harder to give an update as time goes by because there was so little progress and I hated to disappoint you all. At the end of the day though, i figure a late update iis better than not saying anything.\n\nI will be better at giving you all update on this Facebook page. However, I want to be honest, updates will be sparse. I have very little free time, and when I do, i rather put the time i have into making the game.\n\nMy facebook is linked to my phone, so if you wish to reach me, putting a post on the facebook page would be the easiest way.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1manstudio.net\n\nThank you,", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mbV5YMtpgGY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mbV5YMtpgGY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mbV5YMtpgGY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Ge.ne.sis Game Trailer", "description": "// Dec 2016 update//\n\nHi everyone, just want to say thank you for continue interests in my work and the game!
