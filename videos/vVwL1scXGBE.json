These will be opened with a Flashpoint program such as FP Core/Infinity to test whether the game/animation works. \n\nIf it works, the files, screenshots and other important stuff are to be zipped for uploading to the Discord page, where they will be added to the upcoming FP version.

I decide on a case-by-case basis though.\n\n\nQ5) Can you do a playthrough of ______?\n\nA5) No promises, as this channel is just a little project of mine to do playthroughs of old CN games. This is for nostalgia, plus I noticed that some playthroughs are either incomplete or do not exist at all.
