During a single turn, a team can only move one of its worms. Worms can crawl and jump, as well as swing by ninja-rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee when the appropriate items are available. The objective of a traditional match or campaign mission is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending on the power of the weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by having its health reduced to zero or being knocked into the water around and below the level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/worms-2", "videos": [{"id": 14397, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "6hIiCNzBvIY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hIiCNzBvIY", "title": "Worms 2 Intro 2/3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6hIiCNzBvIY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14396, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "PkzFMfCamdU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkzFMfCamdU", "title": "Worms 2 Intro 1/3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkzFMfCamdU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14398, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "iwe-YS0RGpA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwe-YS0RGpA", "title": "Worms 2 Intro 3/3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwe-YS0RGpA/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 212, "name": "Worms"}]}
