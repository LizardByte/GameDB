{"id": "sJ8i5WC70F8", "snippet": {"title": "Batman (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sunsoft's 1989 NES game, Batman. \n\nCheck out the full review, screenshot gallery, and soundtrack at http://www.nintendocomplete.com/batman-the-video-game/\n\nThis game is incredible - the graphics are top-notch, the soundtrack is easily a high-water mark for NES music, and the controls are nigh perfect. If only it weren't so demanding of utter perfection, more people could've appreciated the genius that went into this.\n\n(Shameless self plug - check out my SNES mix of the soundtrack! https://youtu.be/wo85D4cuQP8 )\n\nFor the number of times I've finished this over the years, I've only twice ever managed to finish it without dying (the first time was actually recording this video!). Difficult though it may be, I promise it's possible! It just requires intimate knowledge of every enemy's placement and attack patterns. I've beaten it several times only losing a single life, but the end bosses always got me. This time playing through, equipped with a super solid knowledge of their patterns (and more than just a bit of luck), I destroyed the Joker and saved Gotham with nary a severed limb nor charred Batman corpse in sight. I think this is the bit where I say, \"I'm spent\" and drop the mic.\n\nLooking back, it amazes me that I was able to get so far in this game when I was 8. I didn't quite finish it back then, but I certainly could get to Firebug. For a long time he stopped me, and I shelved the game for quite awhile after repeatedly failing at making any further progress. Something always brought me back though, and would make me renew my efforts to conquer the game once and for all. \n\nThis is a brand new recording to replace the original playthrough I had up of the game - now, not only do I finish it without dying, but it's running at 60fps, which makes the intro look the way it should. At 30fps, games like this that require the flashing effect to fake transparencies look pretty horrendous. If you never played this on the NES and find yourself wondering if you have epilepsy during the first cinematic, don't worry too much. It looked exactly the same 25 years ago on an old tube TV. \n_________________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video.
