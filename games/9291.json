And so began massive purges of the deviants that were reminiscent of the \u201cwitch hunts\u201d of centuries earlier. Leading the genocide was the exorcist corps the \u201cGun Bullet Children\u201d.\n\nAs the overwhelmingly large human armies began to obliterate every vampire and deviant community across the world, the opposing deviant armies sought to gather allies and rally back. Lia Fyle is a half-human, half-vampire girl fighting on the side of the deviants as they embark upon a turnaround strategy, the \u201cSiege on the Holy Land\u2019. Their plan: to lay siege upon the humans\u2019 \u201cHoly Land\u201d and to destroy the Holy Lady Anhel who was the source of the human military power. This is a battle in which defeat is an option for neither army.\n\nFeaturing an addictive dual-polarity gameplay system, this amazing vertical shmup is sure to please any shooter fan. The polarity and color of your character can be changed to absorb enemy bullets of the same polarity while charging the special weapon in the process and doing double damage to enemies of the opposite polarity. Every bullet absorbed charges your special weapon for total destruction. With awesome music, beautiful art, and challenging stages, this is the game that put the eXceed series on the map and has everything you would want from a shmup.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/exceed-2nd-vampire-rex", "videos": [{"id": 11564, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BKCo5PJzF1A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKCo5PJzF1A", "title": "eXceed2nd-REX DEMO1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BKCo5PJzF1A/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11565, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6_4ooEhyou8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_4ooEhyou8", "title": "eXceed2nd-REX DEMO2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6_4ooEhyou8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
