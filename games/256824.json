Putrefier is set in an imposing UAC facility filled with shadows, beasties, and architecture straight out of an idTech 3 game. As you descend into the base, things get weirder, with creepy malfunctioning technology and demonic spaghetti crawling out of the walls in a sickeningly cool manner. There are no fanciful scripted cutscenes, but the thick atmosphere of the map suggests that the experience is part of a larger narrative than what's visible on the surface (a notion heavily reinforced by the set-up to a brilliantly-done boss battle).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/putrefier"}
