You play as Vampire kid named \"Villiam\" who must collect candies hidden by his mean sister in his castle on Halloween. This is another favorite classic of mine, and I was glad to find it again on Bluemaxia's flash point. You can find it there along with a whole lot of other flash games to play if you would like to try. This is a playthrough of levels 1-10 as I got stuck on the last one at the end, whoops. So I just ended it and left it at that. But this is a fun game and a classic to remember.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mz50dDZlVgU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mz50dDZlVgU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mz50dDZlVgU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mz50dDZlVgU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Halloween Classic Games: Vampire Boy", "description": "Vampire Boy is a 2001 classic platformer created by RobotDuck.
