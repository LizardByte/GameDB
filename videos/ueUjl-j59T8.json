What if you can get past that part where the reviewers on the web that couldn't show the rest of the game?  In this video it goes through the first 3 levels as Dr. Jekyll, and the first 2 levels as Mr. Hyde.  The gameplay is boring and pointless as Dr. Jekyll.  Playing as Mr. Hyde is my favorite part of the game.  You can shoot the Psycho-Wave at enemies by pressing B and Up.  This doesn't stop this game from sucking.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ueUjl-j59T8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ueUjl-j59T8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ueUjl-j59T8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Gameplay", "description": "This game is bad as everyone said.
