In the role of their own custom up-and-comer, players must make decisions to balance the boxer's conflicting needs. It takes training to stay sharp, but time spent at promotion may lead to bigger matches, and all work with no play can be bad for a man's mental health. Story development occurs through documentary-style updates and cut scenes. The game aims to present, in the words of its presenter himself, \"a glimpse at what life is like in and out of the ring for these incredible athletes.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/don-king-boxing"}
