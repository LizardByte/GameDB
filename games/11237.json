Beware of the guardians, though, as they would follow you to trap you.", "summary": "Alien's Return is a 1983 video game created for the Atari 2600 that is loosely based on the 1982 film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. It was created in Europe. Copies of the game are very rare, and most European copies still have the typo of the title, which reads, E.T. Go Come. The EU cover shows E.T. standing near a parade of anthropomorphic jelly sandwiches, balloons, trees, and chicken nuggets. None of these creatures ever appear in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aliens-return--1"}
