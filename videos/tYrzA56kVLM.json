Welcome to the first devlog for my pixel art survival sandbox I'm developing using Unity. I'm Peter, I'm 15, and for the past year I've been working on my first indie game in my free time. In this video, I show off the core features of my game, and give some insight into the history of the project. I also focus a bit on the coding, giving some potentially useful tips on one method of implementing infinite procedural world generation.
