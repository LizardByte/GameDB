Unlike other farming games this one doesn't require you to buy additional points or virtual items after you've already paid for the game! Pocket Farm is not a clone, it's a unique experience you won't find in other farming games.\nNow you can build your farms wherever you go! Pocket Farm is a casual sandbox game that lets you build farms at your own pace and sell your harvest in a fun mini-game.\nWith only a shovel and a handful of seeds, build your farm from the ground up into a money making business. Buy fields, fences, a barn, tractor, pond, and a variety of animals. Place them where you want to design your farm the way you like it. Water the crops from your pond, or use a tractor to plow all the fields at once.\nWhen you've harvested enough vegetables that are in demand, head to the market where you'll have to pack customer's baskets with vegetables without letting them fall off the conveyor belt. Fill adjacent baskets to chain them together and collect bonus multipliers to earn the most cash!\nThis extremely addicting combination of harvesting and selling will keep your fingers moving and brain entertained!", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-farm"}
