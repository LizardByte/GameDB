The game features a streamlined battle system and all-new high-resolution character sprites and backgrounds. Battles are the 3-vs-3 matches that KOF is known for, though the tag system from the previous game has been removed. The game features a total of 22 fighters, two of which are exclusive to the home release, and all of whom are returning combatants from previous titles. Included are a five-round arcade \"time attack\" mode, online and local versus, practice and replay modes, and an unlockable art gallery.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-king-of-fighters-xii", "videos": [{"id": 34958, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sYaMX-8_Gyk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYaMX-8_Gyk", "title": "The King of Fighters XII Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sYaMX-8_Gyk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
