The game's 5,000 questions are based on the Key Stage 2 Curriculum that covers children between the ages of 7 and 11 years.\n\nIn other countries the game was adapted not only to the language but also to meet the curriculum. For example: Buzz - Escuela de Talentos is a Spanish version only of the Buzz! game series that features subjects made by Spanish publisher's Santillana. The game is specially designed for the younger ones of the family.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/buzz-the-schools-quiz", "videos": [{"id": 95780, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zaLq6gBrk1s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaLq6gBrk1s", "title": "Buzz!
