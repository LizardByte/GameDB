It includes the large underwater world of Oceanus, the Egyptian-flavoured and hot desert of Stigya, the even hotter and hellish Volcanus with lots of lava, and the flying islands of Aerus. But the civilization of Atlantis has long been wiped from the planet, and now archaeologists are searching the ruins. The inhabitants of Atlantis have, however, created some sort of obstacle course, which stood the test of time. The players are now able to take these \"Trials of Atlantis\", journeying the lost lands and battling terrifying creatures, to find out about the true magic and power of Atlantis. \n \nThe new area is targeted at high-level characters, considering that a character has to be at least Level 40 to begin with the first trial. Further, the lands of Atlantis are accessible from every realm, but every realm has its \"own\" Atlantis, so there are no Player vs. Player fights. \n \nThe Addon also contains one new race for each of the three realms (The half-ogres for Albion, the Shars for Hibernia and the Frostalfs for Midgard) and an even more improved graphics engine, mainly giving players better textures and new water effects.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-age-of-camelot-trials-of-atlantis"}
