The game itself is technically incomplete, but in order to be able to share this hour and a half experience, I remade 99.9% of the art assets, my original musician remade the tracks, and a lot of effort was put into making it the way it is. \n\nThe Vocaloid characters featured are Oliver, Fukase, Miku, Gachapoid /Ryuto, and Kaai Yuki. \n\nThis self let's play was created to make the game as accessible as possible, since the target audience is Vocaloid fans. If anyone also feels like uploading their own let's play videos, please don't feel discouraged. The version of the game I play here is actually a little buggier than the final released version, and I changed some very minor details as well.\n\nIf at any point of the video you'd like to play the game for yourself, the link will be located here: https://edlinklover.itch.io/after-school-a-vocaloid-rpg\n\nLast Part: https://youtu.be/fXWuz0ydab0\n\nOther Support Links:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Edlinklover\nKo-fi: https://ko-fi.com/edlinklover\nVane's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/vanelily/videos\nVane's Twitter: https://twitter.com/rhythmfriend", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5L-soCbJhSY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5L-soCbJhSY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5L-soCbJhSY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "After School-A Vocaloid RPG (Let's Play My Own Game!)", "description": "[Please Read Description!]\nGame Warnings: Mild pixelated blood in one area, some bullying, existential time stuff (minor and limited to an avoidable diary entry), Minor jumpscares (mostly sudden noises), Chase scenes, brief mention of animal death in a piece of dialogue\n\n\"After School-A Vocaloid RPG\" is a Vocaloid RPG horror experience I updated to a playable level.
