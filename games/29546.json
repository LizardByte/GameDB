In this hell of a battle you won't be able to solely rely on your weapons. You'll have to use your creativity and set up different traps to survive. \nNo more bullets? Summon a giant dwarf from the Wizard's hat. Can't push through the walls of enemies? Fly away on a magic elevator. When you feel like there is no escape, pray and an army of crusaders will storm to you on a dope ass tram. \nEven if that won't better your situation, you can always choose to run away to the forest where you can chill with Gangsta bears!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trashville"}
