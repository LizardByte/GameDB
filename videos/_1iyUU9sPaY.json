{"id": "_1iyUU9sPaY", "snippet": {"title": "Flying Shark / Hishouzame (Arcade) - 3-ALL Clear 2.4 Million", "description": "Old replay from 2014.\n\nHishouzame is probably one of the most influential games out there when it comes to shmups. This game laid a lot of the foundation for shmups as we know them today. It also has a very rad soundtrack. \n\nHishouzame is an old Toaplan game, which means the overal design is lots of aimed sniper tanks that shoot sparse, but fast bullets. The game is not terribly difficult though and checkpoint recovery is pretty forgiving. You can still get pretty far without strictly memorizing everything. \n\nThis was part of a shmup tournament back then. Only the first two loops counted, so I checkpoint-milked the final boss a bunch for huge amounts of score. After that I finished another loop lol. \n\nThe game loops infinitely but it stops getting harder somewhere in loop 3. If you really sat down for it, you could probably easily keep playing this forever. \n\nOne thing to be careful about in this game is the shot limit. You can only have a certain number of shots on-screen at a time. Because of this, you might not be able to shoot when in a pinch. To deal with this, it's better to have a separate button for a somewhat lower autofire rate. I had the autofire set to 10 in Mame for normal play and 1 for pointblanking. \n\nExtend items are completely random as far as I know. Not that you'd be hurting for extends either way. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_1iyUU9sPaY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_1iyUU9sPaY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_1iyUU9sPaY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Flying Shark / Hishouzame (Arcade) - 3-ALL Clear 2.4 Million", "description": "Old replay from 2014.\n\nHishouzame is probably one of the most influential games out there when it comes to shmups.
