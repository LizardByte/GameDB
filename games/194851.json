But hope was not lost--before Lilith could claim victory, a traveling knight appeared and drove back Lilith`s forces with ease.\n\nNow known as the Hero of Katti Town, the knight Freya took three villagers under her wing: Sera, a young warrior who fights to protect her grandmother; Thomas, an aspiring mage; and his partner Jake, a talented, yet uninspired, rogue. Together, they train to protect Katti Town, defeat Lilith, and to answer the question on everyone\u2019s minds: Why is Lilith attacking the Ambrose Isles to begin with, and for that matter\u2026 Who is Freya?\n\nContinuing with tradition, Absinthia takes place in the same world as the other titles from Team Bewitched.", "summary": "Absinthia is a turn-based RPG that explores themes of love, loss, betrayal and acceptance as four close friends fight to protect their home.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/absinthia"}
