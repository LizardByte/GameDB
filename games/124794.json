To passengers, you are more than just a driver; you are also a friend, a confidant, a shrink. A voyeur catching a glimpse under the masked but very real lives throughout the City of Light. And you\u2019ll need to play these roles well if you want to catch the killer.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/night-call-deluxe-edition", "videos": [{"id": 90832, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xKu_wl6WQaM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKu_wl6WQaM", "title": "Night Call Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xKu_wl6WQaM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90833, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "f5DZTEkN708", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5DZTEkN708", "title": "Night Call   Game Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f5DZTEkN708/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
