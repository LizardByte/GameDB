To win, the giants created four \"living weapons\" who were so fearsome and effective, both sides lost. The day of the monsters's creations would come to be called Ragnar\u00f6k. Ages later, Count Brahzen, a leader of demons, invaded the Gitane Kingdom, who were able to defend themselves solely by tactical decisions made by their King Fahrenheit II... only to discover Count Brahzen is seeking the Spirit of Roshufa in order to revive one of the four legendary monsters. You are Leon, a fighter chosen by the King to obtain the Spirit before Count Brahzen does."}
