The game takes place two years after a global pandemic has killed almost everyone, but transformed millions of others into what survivors call Freakers \u2013 mindless, feral creatures, more animal than human but very much alive and quickly evolving. In the demo you saw two types of Freaks \u2013 Newts, which were adolescents when infected, are opportunistic hunters, preferring to hit and run from the shadows; and a Horde. Made up of hundreds of individual Freakers, Hordes eat, move and attack together, almost as one. Some Hordes roam the highways at night, while others, like the one in the demo, have found a food source that keeps it in a single location. Skills learned in his prior life as an outlaw biker have given Deacon a slight edge in the seemingly never-ending fight to stay alive.
