Coming to PC and Mac, the inclusive world is styled like a giant block party, where players can compete on levels created by Mythical or by the community, build their own minigames to share, take on daily challenges and more!\n\nThe stars of Blankos Block Party are collectible interactive digital vinyl toys called Blankos, designed by some of the world\u2019s top artists including John-Paul Kaiser, Tara McPherson and Pete Fowler. Unlike other games, where the content you pay for is only licensed, in Blankos Block Party players will have ownership of the Blankos they buy, eliminating the need for grey markets and allowing the community to dictate the value of what is bought and sold in secondary marketplaces supported by Mythical.\n\nBlankos Block Party is developed by Mythical in partnership with Third Kind Games, and will be self-published by Mythical.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 42556, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "juwIwjCRxGI"}, {"id": 42557, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0rg_7H3CvyY"}, {"id": 42558, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kSOOniJ2FPs"}, {"id": 51067, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dhkx6g2EED8"}, {"id": 51068, "name": "Keynotes", "video_id": "fDd7itorCT0"}]}
