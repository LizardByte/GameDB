The exact release date is unknown. However, it's believed to have been released at some point after 1997, due to it having remixes of music from the Sonic & Knuckles Collection for PC/from the Sonic 3 prototype.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Makon Soft's other platformers, using an almost identical engine to those games.
