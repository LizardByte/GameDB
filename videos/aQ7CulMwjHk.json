Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Heart of the Forest, from the makers of Wanderlust: Travel Stories and The Witcher 1, will let you share the deep secrets of the last primeval forest in Europe.\n\nWishlist & Follow now on Steam & GOG.com:\n- https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342620/Werewolf_The_Apocalypse__Heart_of_the_Forest/\n- https://www.gog.com/game/werewolf_the_apocalypse_heart_of_the_forest\n\nThe game will be available on Windows, macOS, and Linux on Steam and GOG.com in Q4 2020.\n\nHeart of the Forest is a narrative adventure game based on the legendary role-playing game Werewolf: The Apocalypse. You play as Maia, a young woman looking to uncover her family\u2019s history. In the pursuit of past mysteries, she arrives at the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, an ancient wilderness full of ancient and dangerous secrets.\n\nThe game\u2019s mechanics are based around three main resources: Rage, Willpower, and Personality. They determine the choices available to Maia and influence the overall presentation of every scene.\n\nThe game is set in one of the last primeval forests of Europe - the Bialowieza Forest. It is a vast area located in Poland, Europe, full of myths and legends which players will also find in the game. The first people settled here 1,500 years ago, but their presence remained relatively limited until they eventually vanished. The mix of nature and mystery makes the Bialowieza Forest a perfect setting for a World of Darkness story.\u00a0\n\nJust like the original Werewolf: The Apocalypse, Heart of the Forest has many themes. These vary from mythological to inspired by its real-world setting, e.g. where should our interference in nature end? Aren\u2019t we morally bound to interfere? How far would you go for a good cause?\n\nThe game stands out thanks to its unique art style. Dynamic collages, which mix photography with hand drawings, are used to represent not only the forest environment but also Maia\u2019s state of mind. The main inspiration for this look was the art of Dave McKean, especially his legendary covers of The Sandman graphic novels. The design team also studied works of artists such as Elke Trittel and Wangechi Mutu.\n\nSean Greaney, Brand Manager for World of Darkness at Paradox Interactive, adds \u201cWe're excited to be partnering with Different Tales: their unique brand of narrative adventure storytelling fits the World of Darkness perfectly. The story of Maia helps us experience the richness and complexities of the Garou, and gives us a new perspective on their long, savage struggle to protect the world from natural and supernatural disaster.\"\n\n---\n\nHeart of the Forest on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342620/Werewolf_The_Apocalypse__Heart_of_the_Forest/\n\nHeart of the Forest on GOG.com: https://www.gog.com/game/werewolf_the_apocalypse_heart_of_the_forest\n\nWorld of Darkness Discord: https://discord.com/invite/qckWRTR\n\n---\n\nAbout Different Tales\nDifferent Tales is a storytelling studio co-founded by The Witcher head story designer Artur Ganszyniec and project lead Jacek Brzezi\u0144ski (The Witcher, Hitman, Dying Light).\nOver the last dozen years, Different Tales members have worked on fantasy franchises with a cult following, mobile games for the mass market, artistic experiments, critically acclaimed products about killing people and prototypes that were meant to exceed the boundaries of the medium.\u00a0\nThey are always ready to tell a new story.\n\nFollow Different Tales:\nWebsite:\u00a0http://differenttales.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/differenttales/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/differenttales\n\nAbout Walkabout Games\nThe publisher behind Liberated and Wanderlust: Travel Stories, Walkabout Games is a Polish publisher and developer of aspiring independent game studios.
