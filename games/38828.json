The meat of the game is on the passing plays, were you are switched to a 3rd person behind-the-quarterback view from which you can see oncoming rushers as well as zoom in on any receiver and via a targeting cursor make passes, or scramble if you don't find any open man, etc.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quarterback-attack-with-mike-ditka"}
