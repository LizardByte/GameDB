Time drags on, and after what feels like hours your wish is granted. Sleep falls over you. And it is a deep, heavy sleep. Your alarm clock rings, but you lie unroused.\n\nInstead of waking up to face the new day, you find yourself trapped. Trapped in a dream and unable to awaken. Your body is smaller than you\u2019re used to. You\u2019re a hamster? Or maybe a bird? Look around! The world around you is unusual.\n\nThe season has no connection to any reality: one moment there is a summer sun shining overhead, and the next it is a harsh frozen winter. Sometimes gravity is so weak that you\u2019ll find yourself floating away, while other times you may find you can barely leave the ground. How is your strength? Are you leaping high into the sky?\n\nDiscover how the universe behaves and use your abilities to collect all of the crystal shards, or you may never reawaken!", "summary": "Animalia Dreamland is a small single-screen platformer for the NES. In each level you play as one of two randomly selected animals, with randomized physics. For \"Three Dreams\" mode you play a random three of the 17 base levels, while for \"Full Game\" mode you play these 17 levels, in order, followed by a final 18th level. Pressing Select on the title screen toggles \"Lucid Mode\", where you choose your preferred jump physics.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/animalia-dreamland"}
