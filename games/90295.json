This in turn led to widespread crop failure and the death of millions. This event roughly lines up with the historical 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, a volcanic event that led to global cooling.\n\nIn response to this, several installations called \"generators\" were built by the British Empire and the United States in the coal-rich North, designed to be city centers in the event that dropping temperatures force mass migration from the south. In all scenarios, the player is the leader of a city around a generator, and will have to manage resources to ensure the city's survival.\n\nThe game launched with three scenarios, each with different backgrounds and storylines. Three additional scenarios were added as DLCs, one free to all players and two as part of the Season Pass. Endless Mode was also introduced in a later patch that eschews narrative elements to focus on surviving for as long as possible while weathering intermediate storms.", "summary": "Frostpunk is a city-building survival game developed and published by 11 bit studios. Players take on the role of a leader in an alternate-history late 19th century, in which they must build and maintain a city during a worldwide volcanic winter, managing resources, making choices on how to survive, and exploring the area outside their city for survivors, resources, or other useful items. The game features several scenarios to undertake, each with their own stories and different challenges.\n\nThe Victorian Edition includes:\n- High Quality Box with artwork from the game\n- DVD Box with installation disc\n- Card with redeemable Steam code\n- \"New London - The Art of Frostpunk\", 56-page hardcover artbook", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frostpunk-victorian-edition", "videos": [{"id": 47522, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "eLGog5qPGMY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLGog5qPGMY", "title": "Frostpunk - Release Date Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eLGog5qPGMY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47523, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "qqEpSOFDXGA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqEpSOFDXGA", "title": "Frostpunk | Official Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqEpSOFDXGA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
