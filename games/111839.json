In recent years, strange-looking beings dubbed as \"Onryou\" ran rampant. The Imperial Army formed an elite squad known as the \"Onryou Subjugation Organisation\", and maintained public order on a daily basis. However, the imperial capital's disorder continued to worsen. Amidst the growing numbers of the public circulating their fears and predictions of the ending of the world, Ryuujin's oracle was finally granted to them. Ryuujin's shrine maiden was then sought to be summoned.\n\nIn accordance to ceremony held by the Imperial Army, the one whom was summoned was none other than Azusa. However, not long after she alighted upon the parallel world, Azusa was invited and lead by a mysterious young man called \"Darius\" to go to the \"Enchanted Forest\", located to the west of the imperial capital. The young man freely admitted to being a demon, and sheltered her in his estate.\n\n\"Come, Miss Shrine Maiden of Ryuujin. Welcome to the dwelling of the demons.\"\n\nThe Imperial Army and the family of demons...\n\nThe two sides...\n\nAzusa finds herself getting entangled within their dispute.", "summary": "Switch port of original game and the sequel.\n16 new stills, new events, and a new fully voiced prologue.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "videos": [{"id": 75788, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ee_Sdyzk2Zg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_Sdyzk2Zg", "title": "Harukanaru Toki no Naka De 6 | DX Switch Edition Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ee_Sdyzk2Zg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
