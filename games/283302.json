The player takes control of Hyde, an adventurous lad who has a knack for exploring dungeons in search of relics from the old world. One day, he arrives at the town called Arvil where he hears a rumor about a nearby unexplored cave. He heads there determined to find new relics, not minding the fact that noone's been there in ages and the place is probably infested with monsters. To his surprise, he doesn't discover and relic or a treasure, but instead, a mysterious girl named Yura. She has apparently lost her memory and can't remember anything but her name.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/d-plus-vine-luv--1"}
