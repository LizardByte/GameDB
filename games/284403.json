You'll have to make the right choice at the right time. Will you be smarter than your companions in misfortune?\n\nForced friendships: Your relationships with others can save your skin, or on the contrary, lead to your downfall. Honesty is one option, lying is another. How many betrayals can you accept before ending your friendship?\n\nOpen another door: collect the reward and end your adventure here, safe in the knowledge that you'll get out alive, or continue, taking all the risks in the hope of obtaining more gems.\n\nA nightmarish environment: the unhealthy horrors you encounter along the way have only one objective: to prevent you from reaching your goal.\n\nEndless adventure: A randomly generated path, multiple choices and a group of unpredictable players under pressure? It's guaranteed that no two games will be the same.\n\nAfter all, it's not as if you have a choice, is it?
