Each map in the WAD was made within a three hour time limit, though the concept differs from traditional speedmapping events in that there was no singular mapping period, allowing participants to create multiple levels. Additionally, several maps exceeded the time limit, with one map taking as long as nine hours to build.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3-heures-dagonie", "videos": [{"id": 94109, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HQGsjzIJN2s"}, {"id": 94110, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "28SUnp-8eJ4"}]}
