There are 9 levels divided into 3x 3 level mini episodes and 3 secret levels. At the end of each 3 level mini episode there is a boss. Every map is huge and takes advantages of Zdoom's special features such as 3D floors and reverb. Also there are tons of secrets and a few top secret Easter eggs. The aim for the level design was realism and a dark atmosphere, with huge height variations and a semi linear overlapping progression.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doomed-space-wars"}
