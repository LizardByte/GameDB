As the player progresses, he or she can explore different regions, venture into secret habitats and discover more adventures. \nThe game's race courses are filled with challenging obstacles that test both the players' and monsters' skills in controlling speed, jumping ability, and reaction time. With enough courage, skill and practice, players can make it to the greatest race in the world, the \"Super Cup.\" \nUsing the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection, players can join up to three other trainers to compete in race tournaments or to capture new monsters on safari.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-racers--1", "videos": [{"id": 32852, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XN5Umv3Sphw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN5Umv3Sphw", "title": "Monster Racers Nintendo DS Trailer - Trailer #7", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XN5Umv3Sphw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
