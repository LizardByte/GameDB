With over 150 different monsters, many with unusual attacks, you will find plenty of sticky situations!\n\nThe procedurally-generated dungeon and vast array of possible items gives immense replay value. Some games you'll find a good weapon early, other times you'll rely on wands or potions or spells.\n\nYou don't see it much in the all-action video above, but some of the most fun is had just standing still trying to work out how to get out of a sticky situation. Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it's Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it's Magic Missile... or maybe it's a Wand of Create Monster, and it'll get even stickier!\n\nYou start with your choice from 16 character classes, each with different starting equipment, stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends very much on what interesting loot you find. Maybe you'll find a great spellbook and put all your efforts into turning your uneducated knight into a master battle mage!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wazhack", "videos": [{"id": 31064, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Z1T3YdSfCDY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1T3YdSfCDY", "title": "WazHack", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z1T3YdSfCDY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
