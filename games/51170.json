As the dusk is setting in the Land of Aventyr, you glide through a sea of clouds, steering higher and higher into the High Skies. As captain of your crew, you mercilessly kidnap peasants and princesses to sell them for slave labor, a hefty bounty, or as a food ingredient, amassing ludicrous amounts of loot."}
