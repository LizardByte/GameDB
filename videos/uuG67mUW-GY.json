Perseus \u2013 the hero of Olympus and demigod son of Zeus \u2013 hearing news that his father is meddling in the human world, decides to rise to fight alongside them. Meanwhile, Athena \u2013 the wise and powerful goddess of wisdom \u2013 learning of Perseus\u2019 plans descends to earth to capture him. She uses magic powers to manipulate the size of her Sacred Treasure, the shield Aegis, which she throws at her opponents to turn them to stone. At the same time, Ares \u2013 the god of war \u2013 fights passionately to fulfill his own beliefs \u2013 that the gods should dominate humanity. Wielding his twin spears to transform into a vigorous dragon, Typhon unleashes a stream of fire on those unfortunate enough to cross its path. The ruler of Asgard, Odin, also joins the fray using Gungnir, a unique spear which summons magical blades to its tip to become a powerful drill that can quickly eliminate any who stand in his way.\n\nIn addition to the four new gods, a number of pre-order bonuses for both physical and digital versions were also announced. Those who pre-order the physical version, through select retailers, will receive alternative costumes for Xu Shu, Mitsunari Ishida, Da Ji, Wang Yuanji, Wang Yi, Lady Hayakawa, Xingcai, Guo Jia, Takatora Todo, and Yoshitsugu Otani. Alternatively, if players choose to pre-order digitally on the Xbox Marketplace and Nintendo eShop, they will receive all of the previously mentioned bonuses plus two extra bonuses: an elusive unicorn and the mighty Pegasus. Digital pre-orders on the PlayStation Store will be rewarded with Pegasus alongside a special Warriors Orochi 4 theme.\n\nTo further showcase the compelling new playable characters, Sacred Treasures, and pre-order bonuses, KOEI TECMO released a fresh asset batch featuring screenshots of the new characters, a look at interactions between a variety of new and existing characters, and a first look at Character Deification \u2013 a brand-new gameplay feature which bestows characters the ultimate power of the mythological gods.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uuG67mUW-GY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uuG67mUW-GY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uuG67mUW-GY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uuG67mUW-GY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uuG67mUW-GY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Warriors Orochi 4 - New Character Highlight Trailer!", "description": "Four new gods, each equipped with powerful mystic weaponry known as Sacred Treasures, join Warriors Orochi 4\u2019s extensive roster; including: Perseus, Ares, Athena, and Odin.
