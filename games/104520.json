Not that simple, since your tribe members trust you blindly and would readily follow any path you present them with.\n\nYou determine the way home simply by skillfully drawing stairs with your finger. Tap the screen once to start a new stairway - then move the finger to the point where the stairs should end and stop touching the screen. The newly created path only exist for a few seconds - so it depends on the right timing. You can make up to 8 paths at a time. The group members will happily follow any path that you draw for them. And this way, with a little bit of luck, you'll make sure that all of the clan members reach their home safely. In the process, watch out for dangerous traps and take care that your people don't fall down to far.\nTo complete a level you have to lead a set amount of members home safely - you'll find the exact amount at the top edge of the screen next to the time display.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/age-of-tribes", "videos": [{"id": 26551, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qwAlg0gI1xs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAlg0gI1xs", "title": "Age of Tribes v1.1 - Lemmings like gameplay for iPod/iPhone", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qwAlg0gI1xs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
