{"id": "d7g3Xwa_tpE", "snippet": {"title": "Time Raiders (Game Trailer)", "description": "In 2247, resources run short, and society has further divided itself into haves and have-nots.\nSome of humanity live in the high towers of cyberpunk cities. For others, it's more like the Wild West, but without the land of plenty, the food or the resources.\nIn this time of strife, a strange thing appears on Earth--a new element that glows and shifts form as you watch it. People call it Flux, and the novelty leads many to start searching for more. Soon enough, it's discovered that a large enough Flux is exactly what it looks like: a portal.\nFor reasons unknown, this portal leads people to World War II, in an alternate history where the Nazis have invaded London. From the perspective of those from 2247, it's a golden opportunity, a new frontier. To some it's a subject of scientific fascination. To many it's a new path to wealth, fame and even infamy. We'll explore these different motivations with our character classes.\nAs people feed their treasures from the past into the Flux, it changes. First, it just alters in colour, but eventually it alters in form, and after being fed a great deal, it begins to look almost anthropomorphic. It's a mystery to humans at this stage, but hints of the truth are there for those who gather enough, look, and think.\nThe truth is, Flux was sent to us by humanity itself from the very far distant future, where we've evolved to become fourth dimensional beings.\nThey have given people from a year where humanity's future is at risk the chance to gather resources from a time in which they were wasted. This ensures more instances in the multiverse where humanity survives. It also by proxy creates a multiversal playground for humans of 2247 to explore and raid to their hearts' content.\nEventually, humans from 2247 will learn the reason why more humans are needed in the future multiverse. They'll also learn why certain extra strange artefacts are scattered across time. There's an enemy to the future humans, a kind of anti-matter to their matter, waging a multiversal war in the unfathomably distant future. Humans from 2247 will encounter strange enemies that wouldn't have appeared in any history book, as these enemies have themselves messed with time. It's a mystery at first, which is cleared up when, as humans from 2247 hunt for treasure, they are eventually hunted themselves.\n\nThe greatest shoot-and-loot #NFT treasure hunt of all time has begun. \n\nBe part of the #TimeRaiders Community, where loyal Time Raiders are rewarded. \nJoin the fun right now and invite all your friends to join the Time Raiders Interdimensional Hub in https://discord.gg/TimeRaiders\n\nUtopian Game Labs Ltd is an independent video games studio and co-publisher.\nThe company has a rich history in developing video games, stretching back over twenty years.
