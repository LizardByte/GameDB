It was originally called Lyra Islands and developed by SePH in 2004-2005, but it wasn\u2019t finished. In 2015, the Lyra Islands project was once again restarted with the goal of finishing the game one day. New overworlds and dungeons were made, and the original LTTP graphics were restored. The project was eventually renamed A Link to the Islands."}
