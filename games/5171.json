She has to use all her charm and wit to find back into her own time. The game is full of humoristic allusions not only to classic adventures, but also to Sunny being a na\u00efve blonde girl thrown into an environment that is too rough for her manicured nails and make up lifestyle. So Blonde is a game that will attract all kinds of players from all ages, female and male, who will not be able to resist Sunny\u2019s irresistible charm."}
