Tuldenorrea is a deceptively simple world, balanced delicately between the extreme forces of a magical universe.\n\nGoldenheart is a retro first person fantasy adventure game created by two people in our home studio. It has a look and feel inspired by our favorite classic console games.\n\nYou\u2019ll master simple but dynamic combat using targeting, dodging, and a shield, while managing your quiver capacity and stamina. You\u2019ll need to take time to explore and observe your surroundings in order to navigate the world and solve the puzzles.\n\nYou play as an outsider, learning the ancient lore of a foreign land as you solve a mystery that has recently befallen it. As you progress, you\u2019ll find a few new tools that will augment the gameplay somewhat and lead you into more dangerous and anomalous places.\n\nGoldenheart omits several features that have become commonplace in modern games. Our focus is on creating more of the classic gameplay that big companies have left behind, not on trying to create a modern RPG or a breakthrough feature.
