Set on a tropical island where you hit bouncy, musical food with drumsticks, Playthings is sure to delight whether or not you\u2019re a musician or a gamer. You don't need lessons to play gummy bears, and music masters will be making sweet symphonies in no time at all. Teleport around a hypercolor fantasy landscape with psychedelic portals, unlock kitchen tools that can rearrange the world around you, and climb the summit of a two story barbeque grill. Lose your body to a rhythm game full of flying hot dogs and hamburger drums, featuring original music by future-funk idols George & Jonathan. If Lisa Frank, George Foreman and Michael Jackson made a video game, the result would be Playthings.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 47779, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "P34eamqaUyc"}]}
