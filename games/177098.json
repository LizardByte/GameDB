But when she gets her big break as the assistant director on Waves of Love, a new film from Sure Shot Pictures, the producer keeps getting in the way of her dream. Susan won\u2019t pay the hard-working crew for overtime, and they\u2019re threatening to strike!

And when the studio owner\u2019s son arrives on set, Maggie needs to convince him that she can bring everything together on time and budget - or she\u2019ll lose her job!"}
