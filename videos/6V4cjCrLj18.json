Pre-order for an adorable capybara pocket plush!\n\nSince you were little, your family\u2019s never lived in one place for very long, always moving to wherever your father\u2019s job has taken you. Wherever you went, you always enjoyed trips out to the country, where you\u2019d pet the animals, taste fresh-grown food, and dream of a slow, steady life.\n\nNow that you\u2019re old enough, and as your family\u2019s about to move again, you\u2019ve just announced to them that you\u2019re striking out on your own, determined to become the farmer you\u2019ve always wanted to be. Your father has his doubts, to say the least, but he\u2019s willing to let you try.\n\nYour journey brings you to a unique spot in the countryside, where three different towns with three very different cultures converge as friends and neighbors. Westown, with its cowboys and corrals, has everything the classic frontier settler needs. Right next door is Lulukoko Village: a warm, friendly paradise to rival any tropical island. Rounding out the neighborhood is Tsuyukusa, which serves as the very model of a traditional Far Eastern village.\n\nThrown into the middle, it\u2019s up to you to learn the ropes, tend your own farm, care for your crops and animals, navigate the crossroads of culture, prove yourself to your family, and just maybe raise one of your own while you\u2019re at it.
