Produced by Nival Interactive it was first released in Russia under the name of Allods: The Seal of Mystery.\nWhile a role playing game, the game uses a real time strategy game interface rather similar to Warcraft II.\nFirst of all, a player chooses between a warrior or a mage for his or her starting character. On his journey he (or she) will meet a few more companions. There will be hirelings available for a fee should a player find any mission too challenging and need reinforcements. Each mission takes place in a game map generally full of enemies. Mission type ranges from rescue to escort to exterminate villains to treasure hunting.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rage-of-mages", "videos": [{"id": 5683, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4Bgx1iXqXxI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bgx1iXqXxI", "title": "Rage of Mages", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Bgx1iXqXxI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
