It has a US setting in terms of the courses and players, unlike PGA European Tour, with 8 courses in total. Control is via the standard method of setting the shot up, then pressing the button once to start a swing, a second time to set the pace, and a third time to set draw/fade. Before taking a shot the club choice, direction and intended draw/fade (spin on the ball) are selected. You can play a 72-hole tournament against 60 other PGA pros, or practice the holes at your leisure."}
