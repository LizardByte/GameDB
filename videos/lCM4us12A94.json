{"id": "lCM4us12A94", "snippet": {"title": "Amiga 500 Longplay [077] Green 5", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nSubscribe: http://tinyurl.com/iamironclawsub\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IronclawFTW\n\nIt's like Another World/Flashback.\n\nOnly played the demo version as a kid, never completed it as I was stuck here: 03:32. Thanks to emulation I could finally figure out what to do (couldn't find a walkthrough). Most people would figure you need to jump to the left platform, which is correct, but as the distance between the things you need to jump  is further apart than you can actually jump when you do it \"normally\", makes it impossible. Luckily I found out that it only works to jump this distance when you land on your right foot, that way the game allows you to step OUTSIDE the floor-area. So, as you can see at 03:32, I step on nothing and can still jump... but like 20 tries before that I just fell down. This was the most frustrating part of the game, doing all of these jumps. Luckily not all platforms were so far apart, but many were.\n\nThere is no real \"demo\" version of this game. All you get is disk 1 of 4, and that's not usually how a demo version is/works. It's mentioned in the beginning of the game (unimportant text which I edited out, like send him money and he send you the 3 missing disks...) that this is disk 1 of 4, but this game version is 3 disks. So I think it's the same as the 1/4 one, it's just that he probably did a typo and actually meant out of 3, or he did some modifications later and made it into 3 disks instead (I know some games uses little space on each disk and some people have moved filed around to use more space on each disk and thus less disks, but don't think that's the case with this one).   (edit: upped a screenshot of the text http://i.imgur.com/AL4O4VZ.png, didn't want it in the video)\n\nRan it on a stock A500, which makes it run a bit slow sometimes. Didn't wanna risk using faster settings in case it breaks something.\n\nLots of pops and clicks. The video gets those from using save states in WinUAE. It's not as apparent when its games with music, only those that are \"silent\" like this one.\n\nVery easy puzzles. Might have been a couple that took a few mins to figure out, will mention those somewhere below.\n\n00:03 - Intro\n\n02:17 - *World 1*\n\n02:33  - All the red button on the second floor does is trapping you with a laser beam and you need to kill yourself if you wanna play again.\n\n03:34 - The first of many dreaded \"long\" jumps. As I could never make it over, I thought there was something else I had to do instead, so looked around the different screens I came from, fully explored everything. Couldn't find anything new, so went back here and was determined the only way over was jumping, and all of a sudden after many jumps. I made it over. Was about to give up on this longplay.\n\n04:50 - There are two paths, left and down. Left leads straight to the 4th and final world, down leads to world 2, so went down so they are done in order.\n\n04:54 - *World 2*. There's two booths in this world - one goes to world 3, the other one to world 4.\n\n05:00 - Some balls flicker red, those can't be destroyed. This ball doesn't flicker red.\n\n05:49 - Tried jumping over many times, but failed. Thought that this time it's probably not a jump issue and there has to be something else I need to do to get over (like with the room at 03:34). Ran back and looked everywhere for like 10 minutes for something new. Thought maybe the rock that gets pushed down at 07:17 goes through the ground and lands in the red water (lava?) and makes a second platform to jump on so I can make it over... but nope. But eventually (again) thought it HAS to be the annoying jump thingy again, so kept trying till I made it. I thought at least one of my previous attempts successfully landed the step-in-air  jump and that's why I thought it wasn't a long jump needed this time. Oh well...\n\n06:20 - My first challenge. Ran up to push the rock sooo many times before I had the right settings. Up, down, up, down, up down.... ARGH! It was such a pain, and had to make a \"long\" jump every time on my way to the rock.\n\n09:31 - *World 3*\n\n12:18 - This flying part was sooooo hard.\n\n14:48 - *World 4*\n\n15:50 - Running right just to show this is where you end up if you went left at 04:50.\n\n17:08  -I tried to pick up this red thingy, but couldn't (the animation is played, though), so assumed it was a button and I pressed it (even though it didn't move down or animate at all as indication). Couldn't get past the security camera later on and thought this \"button\" disables the security field, so tried it a couple of times, but nothing happened. So, started to think this MUST be an item then and it might be like the \"long\" jumps - I need to try to pick it up till I get it. Finally I got it and I should have realized my hand has to touch it. I though the 'pick up' animation would be enough. Makes perfect sense now :)\n\nThe description continues in a comment below. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lCM4us12A94/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lCM4us12A94/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lCM4us12A94/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lCM4us12A94/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga 500 Longplay [077] Green 5", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nSubscribe: http://tinyurl.com/iamironclawsub\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IronclawFTW\n\nIt's like Another World/Flashback.\n\nOnly played the demo version as a kid, never completed it as I was stuck here: 03:32.
