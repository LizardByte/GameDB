Place: Lizard Breath, California.For five years, rumours have abound that numerous giant ants were sighted in the hills around Lizard Breath, even though these have been dismissed as \u201cdelayed hysteria\u201d by the city\u2019s inhabitants.

Even the strange stories that are heard about the hospital in Melville are not taken seriously, as everyone hastily adapts to the \u201catomic\u201d future.All that only changed when Brick Nash stole a plutonium-cartridge loaded truck and headed in the direction of the abandoned lab of Dr. Wells.Is the nightmare starting again?Can one safely go in the desert on the search for the lost submarine?
