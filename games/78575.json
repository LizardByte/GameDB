Some of the strictness of the previous games was reduced through a number of features, including the addition of a panel at left which allowed the user to see a map of the upcoming track segment, including showing speed limits, which greatly reduced the required amount of track memorization, and allowed the player more time to react. The overall reduction of strictness in the game reflected Taito's shift in emphasis from arcade to home-play versions as time went on.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/densha-de-go-professional", "videos": [{"id": 29953, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "TZYiPYXgv10", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZYiPYXgv10", "title": "Densha de GO!
