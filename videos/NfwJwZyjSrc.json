When fire breaks out in a town made entirely of paper, it's up to you to save it.\n\nPaperville is proof that anyone has what it takes to be a hero, as long as safety and saving lives aren\u2019t priorities. Guided by a less-than-stellar fire department, Rookie (that\u2019s you!)  must help restore Paperville to it\u2019s former papery glory. From clearing building fires, rescuing citizens from rubble, hacking through doors, to dealing with townsfolk and their personal issues, Rookie does it all. \n\nOnly you can be the one to save Paperville. Well, someone else probably could, but you\u2019re all they\u2019ve got.\n\nFind out more at www.papervillepanic.com! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca7\ud83d\udd2b", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfwJwZyjSrc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfwJwZyjSrc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfwJwZyjSrc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfwJwZyjSrc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NfwJwZyjSrc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Paperville Panic OFFICIAL Release Trailer", "description": "You\u2019re a rookie firefighter in a town made out of paper... want to watch the world burn?\n\nSmash, sploosh, sizzle & scream your way through a brand new VR experience on Vive, Oculus or Windows MR when Paperville Panic launches this Sep 20 on SteamVR \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udea8\n\nStore: https://goo.gl/uMph82\nFacebook: https://goo.gl/qYv58m\nTwitter: https://goo.gl/K7sqFz\nWebsite: https://goo.gl/zKgcNQ\n\nPaperville Panic is an action-filled, narrative driven virtual reality adventure from indie studio Ultimerse.
