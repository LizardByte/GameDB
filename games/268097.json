What\u2019s more, even though this is a task he could easily complete on his own, he must reluctantly do so in partnership with his newest recruit, rookie Gralsritter and childhood friend Sister Ries Argent.\n\nThus begins the start of a routine mission that becomes anything but, delving into a new and mysterious realm that follows an unnaturally strict set of rules: Phantasma. Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberl\u2019s future will be laid bare\u2026and some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.", "summary": "A remaster of the PSP version of the third installment in the series, serving as a direct sequel to the events of the previous installment and the ending to the Liberl arc, with enhanced graphics, cross-save with the PSP version and extras like PS3 themes, music, calendars and more.
