You'll be travelling from from gingerbread castles to bustling electronic stores to... the beach? Don't expect things to be easy - with 6 brand new weapons at your side, you'll have to choose carefully about which 2 to take into each stage. Can you complete the Xtreme Mega Action Series?\n\nTo those eager for the latest Y+1 news, make no mistake: plenty is on the way, and maybe Operation X.M.A.S. includes a few little secrets of its own...\n\nAn accessibility overview for Mega Man Y+1: Operation X.M.A.S. can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ga5qtMep4cDhXy2rh3lDuqr2wNA1GudS/view?usp=sharing\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VdX3ATp\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lmteam_", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYWrkXMY1Jk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYWrkXMY1Jk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYWrkXMY1Jk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYWrkXMY1Jk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYWrkXMY1Jk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Man Y+1: Operation X.M.A.S. arrives December 8th!", "description": "08/12/2023: The game is out!
