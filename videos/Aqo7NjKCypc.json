This first episode follows BMX rider Jason Hayes in the year 2002 as he gets ready to compete on Pier 30. Little does he know, however, that in the dystopian future of 2095, one evil man has his eyes set on pulling top BMX riders from the past through time to ride for their lives in an ultimate BMX bloodsport. The first couple levels in the game are fairly unassuming, but things are about to get wild.\n\n#ToxicGrind #LetsPlay #Insetik47", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aqo7NjKCypc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aqo7NjKCypc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aqo7NjKCypc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aqo7NjKCypc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aqo7NjKCypc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Let's Play Toxic Grind Part 1: Mad Dog's Scrapyard & Pier 30", "description": "Welcome to Toxic Grind, a fairly average BMX game with a few things going for it, mainly its single-player mode with a ridiculous premise and plot.
