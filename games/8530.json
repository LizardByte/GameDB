The game casts the player as one of six camp counselors (three girls or three boys) at the Camp Crystal Lake and the player\u00b4s main task is to defend the children in the cabins situated all around the lake while slowly killing Jason.\n\nThe cabins are frequently attacked by the mass murderer and the player must get to the attacked cabin within the specific time limit otherwise Jason kills the children. When all the camp counselors or all the children are dead, the game is over. Jason can attack the player outside cabins too, on the pathways when exploring. There are three cycles meaning, Jason must be killed three times (every time Jason is stronger and quicker) to beat the game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/friday-the-13th", "videos": [{"id": 47604, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XYHXcEsZMAE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYHXcEsZMAE", "title": "Friday the 13th (1989) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYHXcEsZMAE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
