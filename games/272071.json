He's been solving criminal cases for as long as he can remember, but lately, things haven't been going well for him. He wraps up insignificant cases: he investigates shoplifters, embezzlers, and officials who cheat on their wives.\n\nHowever, there is a white spot in his life: he suffered a serious car accident four years ago near his then residence, Berlin. He was in a coma for a long time, and his brother, a doctor living in Budapest, helped him in his rehabilitation and in regaining his memories so that he could start a new life in the capital.\n\nOut of necessity, \u00c1bel takes on a seemingly routine, low-paying new job, during which he has to find a missing prostitute. The investigation into the joy girl, who was treated with strange memory loss and loss of consciousness, leads to a drug case involving the Hungarian social elite and the art world. Meanwhile, the Budapest of the second half of the 1930s slowly unfolds before us: the world of alleys behind neon-lit streets, drug distribution centers, and night clubs. But we get a glimpse of the sparkling Pest night, we enter the Corvin Department Store, a luxury Bauhaus villa on Gell\u00e9rt Hill, we sail on the Danube, and even take part in a car race.\n\nHowever, the investigation goes beyond Budapest and the drug deal. \u00c1bel has to realize: he can only solve this case if he learns the whole truth about his own past, about his brother, but most of all about the terrifying experiment that is now threatening the whole of Europe.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lost-budapest", "videos": [{"id": 99786, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "K8N1TnU8pXE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8N1TnU8pXE", "title": "Lost Budapest TEASER | Living Museum", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8N1TnU8pXE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 99787, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "sESEllMLzgU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sESEllMLzgU", "title": "Lost Budapest FREE ROAM | Living Museum", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sESEllMLzgU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
