Surrounded by the unknown and trapped in a series of realms both confusing and dangerous, the youngsters must avoid slipping into the pool between dimensions, embarking on a voyage of discovery and awakening they share with the player, up and down staircases, through light and dark, across the upside-down and the right side-up to their eventual freedom.\n\nSamsara is a beautiful, reflective puzzle game set in a world of echoes where players guide a child safely to the exit by dropping blocks of different shapes and properties into a world of two dimensions split by a pool. Simple mechanics conceal complex interactions involving gravity, balance, redirection and teleportation, with a twist: everything added in the upside down world below reflects in the world above.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samsara-deluxe-edition"}
