A brand-new era has begun - the era of space exploration. When the planets of our solar system were settled, it was time to explore and colonize other worlds and star systems. A once-impossible dream became a reality. As science has reached unprecedented heights, people across the globe have become more united, forgetting about age-old conflicts and feuds.\n\nHowever, along with great discoveries, new troubles appeared in people's lives. The long- awaited encounters with extraterrestrial civilizations led to a fresh round of conflicts, and the competition for resources and habitable territories further exacerbated differences between species. It did not go unnoticed when a new player appeared on the galaxy map and a large number of bloody wars broke out. A formidable rival is approaching us from the very center of the galaxy. Its power is immeasurable, and its intentions are unknown.\n\nThe player will take control of a spaceship as the captain of Space Fleet Command, James Dekker. Together with a team of recruits, on a battle-worn ship, you will look into the most remote corners of the galaxy, engage in fierce space combat, fight with entire fleets, and protect not only the Earth but all of humanity.", "summary": "Take on the role of a Starfleet Command captain, participate in numerous space battles, travel through the galaxy, and fight for the survival of humanity.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-way-road", "videos": [{"id": 137769, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "Nnd3n0zJ6x0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnd3n0zJ6x0", "title": "One Way Road - Official Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nnd3n0zJ6x0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 137770, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FxYqKSqzowY"}]}
