The row may be in any direction, may cross the 'planes' to produce a row which for example goes from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. Play can be for two players or one person against the computer. When play is against the computer, the machine will use a sophisticated, fast logic search to produce a superb mental challenge.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cubit--2"}
