Up to four players can compete on a nine hole, par 38 course. Shoot over trees, sand traps and water hazards. Play from a bag of nine clubs; hook, slice, and control the power of each swing. You will receive penalty strokes for balls that land out of bounds and in the water, and of course the lowest score at the end of the round wins!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pga-golf"}
