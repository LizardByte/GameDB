Instead it was given to Amusement Vision & Genki a Japanese studio who had previous work on a number of other Sega AM2 ports. Problem was Genki later admitted they didn't understand how arcade racers worked. Hence why Daytona USA 2001 has the dubious honour of being the worst Sega home console port of Daytona USA. A better name for it would have been Daytona on Ice, as the handling for the game is terrible. Even changing the options does little to help, power slides are somewhat problematic to do and sharp turns are impossible to perform. \n\nSuch was the issue that the track design for Desert City had to be change to fix the new handling. While features like the roller coaster in National Park Speedway have been axed from the Saturn port, sure the graphics look great and the game runs smooth at 60fps, but the music and sound effects are poorly mixed and the gameplay is just below average. Not to mention the odd car design with huge wheels sticking way to far out of the joints. What should have been the best home port with nine different tracks ended up being a complete mess. Sure if you have never played Daytona before you will no doubt enjoy this version, but even the rushed PAL Saturn release of Daytona CCE sadly plays better than this port. Video is a full race on the Dreamcast version of 777 Speedway.\n\nAlso known as: Daytona USA (North American) \u30c7\u30a4\u30c8\u30ca USA 2001 (Japan)\n\nRelease: 2000\nDeveloper: Amusement Vision / Genki (\u5143\u6c17 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4f1a\u793e)\nPublisher: Sega ( \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30bb\u30ac\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9 )\nFormat: Sega Dreamcast (DC) / \u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\n\nDaytona USA 2001 is not available on any other format.\n\nRandomised Gaming blog: http://randomisedgaming.tumblr.com  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/rdmdgaming \n\nAll footage in this video is captured directly from the Sega Dreamcast console, via an Elgato Game Capture HD60 Pro using a VGA to HDMI upscaler.\n\n#DaytonaUSA2001 #SEGA #Dreamcast", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ortbClRm0nc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ortbClRm0nc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ortbClRm0nc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ortbClRm0nc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ortbClRm0nc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Daytona USA 2001 - Sega Dreamcast - Intro & Three Seven Speedway Race Gameplay [HD 1080p 60fps]", "description": "Any true Daytona fan will have had alarm bells ringing in their head the moment it became clear AM2 weren't involved in this port.
