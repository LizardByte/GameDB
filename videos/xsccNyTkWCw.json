The only way to survive seems to be to randomly dodge around the screen. Landings are rather difficult as well, since gusts of wind throw the jet off course as it attempts to land. Landing with too much momentum generally results in a crash, as the jet collides with buildings or grounded aircraft before it has a chance to brake to a stop. Mig 29 cartridges have a small switch in the back to make the game compatible with U.S. and European systems.\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est 2007 includes gameplay captures from all commercial releases from the US market with a few extras (like famicom releases) just for fun.
