In this first-person puzzle game, you, the entrapped student in your school are allowed a chance to escape the building through a series of puzzles wittingly designed by a school faculty. Not only are they designed to bring out of you the most intense brain activity, you are constantly tested on your patience and willingness to exceed expectations.", "summary": "Class Escape is a puzzle game with five different rooms to discover and solve. Only by solving one room can you enter the next room. You will be going from the normal classroom to the lab to the theater. There are multiple puzzles in each room and their difficulty increases with each succeeding puzzle you solve.\n\nAll the while, you will be constantly reminded by the instructor that you must be doing better than what you are. Can you handle the pressure? Work under a judgmental instructor that's watching every move you're making.\n\nThe types of puzzles range from finding patterns, to manipulating numbers to find the correct solution, and connecting different ideas together to reach the correct answer.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/class-escape"}
