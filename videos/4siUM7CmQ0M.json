This year the theme for the jam was \"Out of Control\". Pretty tricky, and I didn't have a clue what I was making until about 12 hours in - but ended up with a 2D Unity game I'm pretty pleased with! It's called \"Living Labyrinth\", and it's a little puzzle game where you don't have control over the main character, instead controlling the level layout. The development was super fun for this project, and I would honestly love to have had more time to add some more mechanics and levels. Hope you like it!\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/bwdev\nJoin the discord here: https://discord.gg/KX5rq78\n\n-- Social Media --\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/bwdev1 \n\n-- Music --\nSlowly by Smith The Mister https://smiththemister.bandcamp.com\nSmith The Mister https://bit.ly/Smith-The-Mister-YT\nFree Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/s-t-mr-slowly\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/b4p9TiftgJY", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4siUM7CmQ0M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4siUM7CmQ0M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4siUM7CmQ0M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4siUM7CmQ0M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4siUM7CmQ0M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "48 Hours to Make a Game!
