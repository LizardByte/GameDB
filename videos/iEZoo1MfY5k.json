I barely used it until now, because it is indeed different from Flight Simulator, based more on later subLOGIC FSs (A.T.P. and Flight for example). Well, it makes sense since Sierra bought subLOGIC in the late '90s (and Microsoft bought BAo by that juncture). Then another reason why I barely used it until now is that it crashed when I used it with nGlide. It no longer crashes, but its graphics are rather glitchy, which is seen at the end of this video. Its graphics are in-between FS98 and FS2000 with worse scenery textures and buildings than both.\n\nI am running this sim in Windows 8.1. There's a screen problem going on since caused by switching from full screen to windowed mode. The screen goes black until you switch to another program. Some menus have flipped images (even the ? button in the top-right corner next to the X button), and usually those images are messed up.
