The game is janky and not very great because i finished it in the last month. The game has had a development cycle of 1 year and I really wanted to release it to get it over with. Thanks for watching and for playing.\n\nFog of Life is a horror adventure experience in which the player has to traverse a very foggy soviet suburban environment to get to their end goal, a village, by using a map and a compass, multiple useful items found in the game\u2019s locations and avoiding or fighting enemies scattered around the place. Orientation is key, if you walk too far off, you might have to pay with your life.\n\nThe game is planned to have co-op game play as well as single player. Co-op sees you playing through the game with a friend. You must take care of each other in order to survive. One player has a map and the other has the compass. Without your friend, you're walking in thick, blind fog - quite literally. Single player is a more independent and lonely experience, yet your character has more abilities.\n\nSpecial thanks to OmenaKettu for additional modelling.\n\nAlso thanks to Januxe and Krypa for playtesting.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGVJBAu-jRg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGVJBAu-jRg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGVJBAu-jRg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGVJBAu-jRg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Fog of Life Release Trailer", "description": "https://gamejolt.com/games/foglife/536740\nhttps://sentryturbo.itch.io/fog-of-life\n\njust like any other game release, to do my very minimal marketing, i made a trailer for my game that is out on Gamejolt.
