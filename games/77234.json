The turn-based battle engine has been improved: if the enemy is defeated, the next character will automatically switch to another enemy, and not hit the air, like in the previous two games.\n\nThe game itself is, like the previous games, a top-down RPG where your characters travel in the overworld, sometimes entering cities and dungeons to buy equipment, rest and fight random encounters and bosses with turn-based combat. Final Fantasy III also introduces various series staples, such as the Job system and the Moogle species.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-iii--1", "videos": [{"id": 108483, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "ExFHLGOEUVk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExFHLGOEUVk", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fc\u2162 \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ExFHLGOEUVk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 108484, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "PZVP-TnB8d4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZVP-TnB8d4", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcIII \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PZVP-TnB8d4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 107830, "name": "JP TV Commercial", "video_id": "JOTYK-eDZpI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOTYK-eDZpI", "title": "Famicom, Final Fantasy III Advert", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JOTYK-eDZpI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
