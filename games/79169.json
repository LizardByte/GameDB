However, it is a lot different from usual, as lower-ranked idols are also included and no script was given; thus, the selection standards and how the winner is chosen remains unknown. Within \"Project 47\" are seven different teams, such as \"Team Happy\" (representing Kanto), \"Team Smile\" (representing Kansai), \"Team Passion\" (representing Kyushu) and \"Team Rising\" (representing both Hokkaido and Tohoku); amounting in total to over 200 contestants, sorted by rank.", "summary": "Idol Death Game TV (Japanese: \u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30c7\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0TV Hepburn: Aidoru Desu G\u0113mu TV) is an action-adventure video game developed by Witchcraft and published by D3 Publisher for the PlayStation Vita with PlayStation TV support, released on October 20, 2016 in Japan.
