He used his powers to create Tenguu Island. From him came the vibrant colors Red, Blue, and Yellow, which he divided into halves to form man and woman.\n\nEons passed and Tenguu Island prospered. Over time, a hierarchy developed. The people were commanded to blend only with approved color classes. Social standing was determined at birth \u2014 the closer their bloodline was to the original primary colors, the higher their class. \n\nOne day, the sun failed to light the sky. Darkness loomed, gripping the people with a terrible fear. The leader of the Yellow used his limited powers to restore what light he could, but it would not be enough. \n\nOn Tenguu Island, the society\u2019s rigid structure is valued more than individual lives. A darkness is encroaching that only one brave soul has the power to dispel.\n\nAt the dawn of her eighteenth year, Olympia must seek a mate to preserve her bloodline before time runs out. The last of her kind, the maiden\u2019s beauty inspires awe and icy fear. Haunted by her lonely past on distant Tennyo Island, she draws strength from memories of her late mother and takes a bold step forward. With her entire clan wiped out years ago, Olympia has been isolated for most of her life. Now she lives as the only person who can perform the ritual that restores light to a world shrouded in darkness. \n\nThe heads of each Primary district\u2014Red, Blue, and Yellow\u2014lead a society governed by the island's rigid class structure. As Olympia travels between the districts, she discovers their wonders and their weaknesses, as well as an entire underground community of shunned individuals whom she becomes determined to help. If she can find the person destined to be her soulmate, she will finally be able to open her heart and reveal her true name, continue her bloodline, and save the world before it is destroyed.\n\n\nLearn more about the game and pre-order here: http://www.aksysgames.com/olympia/\n\nAbout Aksys Games\nOne of the Top 10 Metacritic Publishers of 2020, Aksys Games Localization, Inc. is a visionary video game publisher committed to publishing unique and high-quality interactive content for all current-generation platforms since 2006.
