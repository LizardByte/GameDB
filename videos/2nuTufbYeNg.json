I start with Tetris, playing A Mode until I get a game over on level twenty. At 16:42 I switch to B Mode and clear a quick round at level five on the fastest speed. Then I switch to Dr. Mario at 19:13, playing until I finish level twenty-five, and finally, at 1:47:35, I do a few quick versus rounds against the CPU.\n\nTetris & Dr. Mario contains both complete games on one cartridge with both NES games' graphics and sound now upgraded to take advantage of the 16-bit hardware. The graphics are a bit more gaudy, but they look nice enough considering that it's a puzzle game. The soundtracks both got a huge boot up the behind, and the remixed music is probably my favorite of the whole package. I love how they used Earthbound samples to give the Dr. Mario tunes a bit more flair.\n\nThe games themselves are pretty much the same as they were on the NES. All of the same game options are here (though the cutscenes have been axed and replaced with a few really cheesy splash screens, all shown in the video), but the newest addition, Mixed Match, is a cool idea. If you are playing a two-player game, this mode will allow one of you to play Tetris and the other to play Dr. Mario at the same time. I don't recall ever seeing this idea incorporated into any similar games since, let alone on the SNES. Neat stuff!\n\nWhen everything is said and done, Tetris & Dr. Mario offers enough to make these SNES conversions worth checking out. Think of it as a puzzle fan's Super Mario All-Stars. There's lot of good gaming still left on these tires!\n\nIf you'd like to see the NES versions of the games, you can find those here:\n\nTetris: https://youtu.be/E6vjqZbkshY\n\nDr. Mario: https://youtu.be/94joL2AgxJI\n_____________\r\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \r\n\r\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nuTufbYeNg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nuTufbYeNg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nuTufbYeNg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nuTufbYeNg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Tetris & Dr. Mario (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Nintendo's 1994 puzzle game for the Super Nintendo, Tetris & Dr. Mario.\n\nI play both games in this video.
