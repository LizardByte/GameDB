Through this careful choice of words, players express themselves as they discuss ongoing problems about life and romance with their in-game partner over text messages, while also chatting with friends and strangers at their favorite local bar about what's on their mind.\n\nThe combination of words they choose impacts the conversations they have, how genuinely they can connect with their partner, and whether their relationship can survive the night.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "videos": [{"id": 36937, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MotLidp9IxE"}]}
