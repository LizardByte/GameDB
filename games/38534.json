However, in 1997, using new weapons designed in secrecy, the Middle Eastern country of Rabu threatened to destroy this fragile peace.\nRabu's proported goal is to purge the world of sin and force a new morality, with her allies. Rabu quickly claimed the Middle East, then spread into both southern Asia and parts of Europe. Their weaponery is terrifyingly eeficient at manufacturing death. They seemed unstoppable. When they gassed Tokyo in 1999, U.S. intervention became unavoidable. If Rabu is allowed to use Japan's manufacturing facilities, there will be no end to the nightmare.\nHoping to protect world peace, the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) heads out to the sea.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/carrier-air-wing"}
