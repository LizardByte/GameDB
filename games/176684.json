Human beings have long reached outer space and traveled to other planets. But they could not find happiness, and soon their only source of feelings became the \"Cyber Net\", a virtual world where people could experience simple emotions such as love or hatred. One day, a deadly virus was discovered in the Cyber Net. A special unit called Blue Metal was sent to annihilate the virus. But something went wrong, and the members of the unit were killed. Serge Shadix survived, but his brother Leon never came back. This accident made Serge join a force called STAND (Special Team for Alert to Network Destruction), which specialized in cybernetic crimes. Will Serge be able to solve the mystery and discover the secret of the virus?", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
