As the boss of their new businesses, players' Sims are responsible for hiring and firing. Some employees are dedicated to their duties while others just put in time for a paycheck, so grooming an efficient staff can be a rewarding challenge.\n\nLike earlier Sims expansion packs, Open for Business adds over 100 new objects to the game, many of which can be used at home as well as at work. Cash registers and service counters, awnings and elevators, and a wide selection of costumes and uniforms become available with the add-on. New areas are offered for builders, where they can custom-create the retail shop of their Sims' dreams.", "summary": "The Sims 2: Open for Business is the third expansion pack for The Sims 2, where you'll get to design your own clothing boutique, beauty salon, florist, high-end electronics shop, bustling restaurant chain, or virtually any other type of business. Hire your staff as the business grows and put talented Sims to work making toys, running the register, crafting floral bouquets, giving sales pitches, or manufacturing robots. But watch out for slacker employees and be prepared to fire them on the spot. Will you build a thriving business empire or become an eccentric entrepreneur designing the next big thing?", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sims-2-open-for-business", "videos": [{"id": 5640, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5uWGckCCwcQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uWGckCCwcQ", "title": "The Sims\u2122 2 Open for Business Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5uWGckCCwcQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
