The games are part of The Idolmaster series of games, and were originally released as Honey Sound, Funky Note, and Groovy Tune. They were the first games in the series to be localized into English.\nThe gameplay in Shiny Festa eschews the simulation format of previous Idolmaster games, and instead features a rhythmic gameplay in which the player times the presses of buttons to the rhythm of the songs and a predetermined pattern displayed on the screen. Each game features a different array of characters and songs, and also includes an original video animation episode. The games' story centers on the 765 Production's participation in a music festival, and is told via the anime episodes and occasional dialogue included in the games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-idolmaster-shiny-festa", "videos": [{"id": 5123, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lmkHpFEg_IE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmkHpFEg_IE", "title": "PSP\u300c\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30b7\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30b9\u30bf\u300d1st PV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lmkHpFEg_IE/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 957, "name": "The Idolmaster"}]}
