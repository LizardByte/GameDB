While this is not the last version of Unbirth made, it is the latest working version I could find. After this version, a lot of other people joined the project but not much more playable content was added. Unbirth was last worked on in late 2004, meaning the project lasted for 3 years. However, while Unbirth is dead, it\u2019s spirit lives on in the Penumbra series of games. Something I hope you will see when the playing the demo / alpha.\"", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvyT75sQ2VQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvyT75sQ2VQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvyT75sQ2VQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Exploring UNBIRTH", "description": "This is an old tech demo of an unreleased game by Thomas Grip from Frictional Games.
