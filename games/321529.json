In this Elseworld, Earth held its last stand against Brainiac in Gotham City, rather than Metropolis. And after it fell, Brainiac decided he had little use for the failing city, leaving it to fall into the void. Rivers of lava now flow through the streets of Gotham, whole city districts are tumbling into an endless void and various iconic locations from Gotham pop up all throughout this Elseworld. As you explore through this Gothic Elseworld, you will find various buildings and locations you\u2019ll have played through in the Batman: Arkham series, like the Ace Chemicals building from which Scarecrow launched his attack on Gotham, or the GCPD where many of the city\u2019s lowlifes were taken by Batman to be brought to justice, and even Arkham Asylum where The Joker put Batman through that fateful night.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-03", "videos": [{"id": 132000, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WPubwl-kLUA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPubwl-kLUA", "title": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League - Season 3 - \"Meet Lawless\"", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WPubwl-kLUA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
