You will have some time to prepare and then can continue your efforts as he progresses.\n\nA twist on the traditional tower defence genre, in this game you can run and jump around the level and place traps and obstacles that should hamper the progress of the hero. Once the hero arrives you can continue to move around and adjust the placement of traps, either by placing more, or by moving the ones you have already placed.\n\nA health bar indicates how much damage the hero has received, and once the hero has no health left, the player wins and can progress to the next level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 56836, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sDHsfsNMAyE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDHsfsNMAyE", "title": "Tower Offender Trailer (Early Dev)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sDHsfsNMAyE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
