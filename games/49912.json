Luckily, J has a wide range of weapons to help him put an end to the alien menace; most notable is the Noisy Cricket. While most aliens are relatively easy to spot, some can change shape and will not reveal themselves until J gets close to them...so keep your eyes peeled. When a stage is cleared, you are treated to an animated sequence that advances the plot. Will the Agent J be able to save the world?
