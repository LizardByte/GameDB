{"id": "vSFFXKeXj3I", "snippet": {"title": "SNOOPY AND THE RED BARON -ATARI 2600-", "description": "Snoopy vs. the Red Baron is a flight combat game released on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and PC in 2006.[1] As the name implies, the protagonist is Snoopy, the dog in Charles M. Schulz's comic strip, Peanuts. The game is based on one of the most famous Snoopy alter egos: a World War I flying ace battling against Manfred von Richthofen the Red Baron, the Flying Circus: Jagdgeschwader 1, the Black Hand and other pre--World War I organizations of Europe.\n\nThe game is introduced in a scene as Charlie Brown and Lucy van Pelt find Snoopy sleeping on top on his doghouse as usual and wondering what Snoopy might be dreaming about. Snoopy quickly wakes up shooting imaginary enemies. Charlie Brown replies that Snoopy is probably dreaming about being a famous World War I flying ace. The game then focuses on Snoopy's dream.\n\nThe game ends with a similar cutscene where Snoopy is acting out flying on his doghouse while typing a story. When Linus asks Charlie Brown what his dog is doing, Charlie Brown replies that he is probably working on a sequel, thereby implying a sequel to the game. It was called Snoopy Flying Ace.\n\nSnoopy vs. the Red Baron is the first (and so far only) time the characters have been animated in 3D with the express permission and tacit approval of Creative Associates and the Schulz family for an officially licensed Peanuts product.\n\nAn earlier game with a similar theme and name, Snoopy and the Red Baron, was released by Atari in 1984 for the Atari 2600 platform. Despite the similarities, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron is not a sequel to the earlier Snoopy and the Red Baron. Planned releases for the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube were canceled, possibly due to low sales or limited resources.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vSFFXKeXj3I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vSFFXKeXj3I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vSFFXKeXj3I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vSFFXKeXj3I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "SNOOPY AND THE RED BARON -ATARI 2600-", "description": "Snoopy vs. the Red Baron is a flight combat game released on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and PC in 2006.[1] As the name implies, the protagonist is Snoopy, the dog in Charles M.
