The first has China in its most disorganized period and the last has virtually all of China controlled by one of three generals.\n\nThe precise requirements for success in each of these scenarios differs, but in all cases the goal is to rule as many states as possible. After the completion of any scenario but number five the game will automatically advance to the next. You may start the game at any scenario.\n\nThe third edition of this game with more game improvements.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-iii-dragon-of-destiny", "collections": [{"id": 766, "name": "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"}]}
