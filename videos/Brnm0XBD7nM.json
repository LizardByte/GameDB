This is just the most expanded-upon version of the game. Back then, this game had... an odd translation due to probably not being translated by any proficient English speakers (I assume.) \n\nThat was the case for this version too until around January of this year when it got some \"English Correction\". I assume this isn't a full-on retranslation, but it's better than it was previously. Some dialogue is still a bit jank but nothing too immersion-breaking.\n\nNow what do I think of this game... I think it's really good. It has some of the coolest moments I've seen in any RPG Maker game, the story is interesting even if a tad bit confusing, and it kept me invested from beginning to end, despite this actually being my second playthrough.\n\nThe main thing I feel like most people would have an issue with is that the first section is... very repetitive. It's meant to be but I do think the game picks up a lot once you get past it. Time loops do tend to be like that...\n\nAnd this game also makes me sad about the fact there aren't many Chinese RPG Maker being translated, since some of the ones I've seen are so cool-looking. But anyway...\n\nThis game does a lot of things in its pretty short runtime and all for the price of free. You can't help but respect it. Even if the story si a bit confusing but I do think I got the gist of it. \n\nBut anyway, good game. Play it if it interests you. I'm tired. Good night.\n\n(...Would you believe me I procrastinated like 5 hours to record this thing. I need to get back to recording more consistently especially since I don't have much to do in the summer... No promises though.)\n\nTimestamps (Somewhat wonky but eh.
