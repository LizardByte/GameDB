When a player wins a round, he or she will earn the Queen\u2019s favor, but will also earn the wrath of the other players, who are then able to vote to take away one of the winner\u2019s powers! Get ready to even the odds against your opponents as you take away the powers they hold most dear and hilariously watch how they deal with the consequences! Whoever is the first person to win three rounds, becomes the Royal Champion!\nIn the world of DepowerBall, you will need to adapt to the changing conditions, or get left behind as the other players take advantage of your weakened state!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/depowerball", "videos": [{"id": 90129, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GhEi3129HrY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhEi3129HrY", "title": "Depowerball - Demo Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GhEi3129HrY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
