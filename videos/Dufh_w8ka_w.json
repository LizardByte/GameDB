Developed and published by Cosmic Void in 2023. The game takes place in a very twisted sci-fi universe, filled with egoistic characters whose only goal is to survive, with our main protagonist not being any different. Named the Lady Tick Tock, she works as a private investigator in this polluted city. But while working on a missing persons case she ends up looking for a serial killer, who is obsessed with people's eyes. \n\nNoirStation Rating: - 3 Out Of 5 - When I picked up this game I had very low expectations. I thought this would be a very complicated, outdated and boring title. But once I started playing I got intrigued by the weird universe and the story this game was depicting. It\u2019s a very narrative based title and most of the puzzles are easily figurable so you shouldn\u2019t waste time clicking around aimlessly, you can easily enjoy the story.\n\nVideo Chapters:\nSky Hotel - 00:00:00\nDowntown - 00:22:46\nProtest - 00:29:58\nMarshes - 00:39:38\nMeeting Vindle - 00:46:18\nFinale - 01:00:12\n\nThis video is recorded, played in my style, and edited by me.
