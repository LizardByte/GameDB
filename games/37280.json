Since filled screens offer the most opportunity for chaining together large combos, the tide can turn very quickly.\n\nThere is also another single player mode called Solo Mode. Any character can be played in this mode. The aim in Solo Mode is to continually clear the screen from coins and try to keep the game going for as long as possible.", "summary": "A puzzle game created in 1997 by Japanese game for the Neo Geo MVS arcade system and ported to the Game Boy and the PlayStation that same year.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/money-puzzle-exchanger", "videos": [{"id": 14431, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "5YP1bWatwxs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YP1bWatwxs", "title": "PS \u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb \u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u52d5\u753b1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5YP1bWatwxs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14430, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "3cmxFE69uyk"}]}
