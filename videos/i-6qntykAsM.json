We could say it\u2019s to make the game better or to add polish, but the truth is the game is already great and ready. The reason, however, is one we could never have predicted\u2026 it\u2019s Batman\u2019s fault.\n\nFollowing late-night discussions, it became clear that Batman: Arkham Shadow, which was not scheduled for release when we were assigned our launch date, might just be a pretty big game. As a small indie team, we need every available opportunity and chance to get our game seen. In addition to that, we really want to play Batman too, and wouldn\u2019t have the time otherwise.\n\nSo, what does this mean? We\u2019ll be moving our release date to 14th November (check out our trailer this afternoon for something special!), and to make it up to the players who have been waiting, we\u2019re now offering a 25% discount through a pre-order program. Previously, there was no discount, and we hope this pre-order and saving go some way towards making up for the extra wait.\n\nSo TL;DR, Batman made us move the date. The shift in the release date allows everyone (us too) to dive into Batman: Arkham Shadow and save the streets of Gotham, knowing that once the dust settles, DIG VR will be there to restore the city.\n\nPRE-ORDER NOW: https://www.meta.com/en-us/experiences/dig-vr/6128709557192619/\n\n#DigVr #metaquestgames #BlameTheBat\n\nFollow DIG VR: \n\nTwitter / X: https://twitter.com/DigVRgame\nTiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@digvrgame\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61552590518247\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/digvrgame/\n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/WiredP\u200b\u200b\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WiredPro\u200b\u200b\nDiscord : https://discord.gg/wiredp\u200b\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/wired_productions/\nBandcamp: https://wiredproductions.bandcamp.com/follow_me\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wiredp", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-6qntykAsM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-6qntykAsM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-6qntykAsM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-6qntykAsM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-6qntykAsM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DIG VR | BATMAN MADE US MOVE OUR DATE TRAILER | NOVEMBER 14th | META QUEST", "description": "With a week to go until launch, we have to move the release of DIG VR.
