It has custom monsters and REQUIRES free-look; jumping and crouching are optional but supported. It also features some lenghty underwater sections, so it is recommended to play with a custom HUD/Mod that has an oxygen bar. It looks better if you set your light options to either \"Dark\" or \"Doom\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
