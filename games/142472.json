Elika leaves the Prince. However, they both end up facing against Elika's father, now referred to as the Mourning King, once again. They escape, and attempt to leave the palace alive. While on their way, Elika shows her frustration with the Prince multiple times, believing bringing her back was not worth the price of the evil it unleashed. The Prince counters that by freeing her, they 'stand a chance' against Ahriman. In a final battle against the Mourning King, the Prince defeats him by impaling him on spikes, a visual reference to the original Prince of Persia game from 1989. In the end, Elika leaves the Prince to search for her people, and the Prince is left alone with a bloodthirsty Ahriman seeking revenge, leading to the events of Prince of Persia: The Fallen King.", "summary": "Prince of Persia: Epilogue is a downloadable content pack for the 2008 reboot of the Prince of Persia franchise.
