CGRHD reviews ICE HOCKEY for Atari 2600 VCS video computer system. You can play as player vs. Atari 2600 or player vs. human being scumbag opponent.  This 1981 classic from Activision shows a game ahead of its time with excellent gameplay, even if it doesn't really resemble a hockey game today.  Check opponents, score goals and play with a two player team in a 3 minute game.  Hockey games today have licenses from the NHL and play on the PS3 and Xbox 360 game consoles, this classic on the Atari has imaginary teams that you can name and call your own.  CGR believes that our blue and red team is the 1991 Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins with Mario Lemiux and Paul Coffey!  Booya, take that green and yellow team!  Ice Hockey is a true classic on the Atari 2600 and this Activision cartridge can be found easily and affordably today.  Check it out and pound your bacon loving neighbors to the north (assuming you're American) into the ice without mercy.  Or check your reality TV loving, SUV driving neighbors to the south into the boards (if you are Canadian).  This is a game for all! Hooray for insulting other peoples' homelands!  Classic Game Room is the ultimate retro reviewer and video game review show for old school games and arcade classics like Ice Hockey for Atari 2600!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jU-5wMwtVNk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jU-5wMwtVNk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jU-5wMwtVNk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jU-5wMwtVNk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jU-5wMwtVNk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Classic Game Room HD - ICE HOCKEY for Atari 2600 review", "description": "IT'S HOCKEY NIGHT at Classic Game Room!
