The player maneuvers the Vaus spacecraft along the blue region located at the bottom of the screen, and must deflect a ball at a formation of bricks and Space Invaders aliens. The player will need to avoid fire from the enemy aliens, although the player can deflect the shots at them. The goal of each stage is to destroy the formation of bricks as well as the aliens, and the player moves forward to the next stage once this goal has been completed. The player travels through several different worlds, with each world containing four stages. At the final stage, the player must defeat a final boss before moving on. Once a world has been completed, the player will acquire a random power-up in the form of characters representing older Taito properties, such as Bubble Bobble, Darius and Psychic Force.", "summary": "Two of Taito's most beloved arcade classics combine with cameos from their other releases to produce one frantic title.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arkanoid-vs-space-invaders", "videos": [{"id": 45011, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "MdoG_Xky2dM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdoG_Xky2dM", "title": "Arkanoid vs Space Invaders \u2013 Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MdoG_Xky2dM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
