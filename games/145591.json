As a first person adventure in the style of Myst, the game sends players walking around between predefined waypoints and sometimes incomprehensive turning angles, clicking on stuff and solving one or the other puzzle in between. \n \nMost of the time is spend wandering around in the all to same-looking empty hallways of a school building and trying to find out what the game wants to be done, as there are no instructions or any other kind of guiding text whatsoever.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/morbid"}
