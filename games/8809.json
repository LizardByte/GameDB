It is an adaptation of the 1989 Japanese-market Famicom game World Grand Prix - Pole to Finish, with the most notable changes being the addition of Unser as an in-game coach, the number of laps, sound and interface design. This game features a season mode and two time trial modes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 3456, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "RDzpkGFm7-Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDzpkGFm7-Y", "title": "Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RDzpkGFm7-Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
