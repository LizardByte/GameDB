The virtual keys that correspond to the ones you press will move, and the Sphere will move in response to the force from the keys. Your goal is to carry the Sphere to the finish line without letting it fall off the keyboard.\n\nHowever, you can't move the Sphere directly, so it often won't behave as you'd like. To manage this irregular Sphere behavior, you\u2019ll need to quickly identify and press the right key from the 40 available. This makes the game more action-packed than it may initially seem.\nMoreover, even though it's challenging enough to move the Sphere as intended, the path to the goal is filled with various obstacles that block your way. Overcoming these obstacles requires flexible thinking and skillful manipulation of the keyboard.\n\nAdditionally, this game also functions as a typing game, as understanding the spatial arrangement of the keys is crucial. It can improve typing accuracy for both beginners and experienced typists. Why not sharpen your typing skills while having fun with an action-packed game?\n\nAnd be careful not to break your keyboard!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/on-the-keyboard", "videos": [{"id": 126376, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "psfv-G6whg0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psfv-G6whg0", "title": "On the Keyboard - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/psfv-G6whg0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
