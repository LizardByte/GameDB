The peaceful, happy people of the island want nothing more than to roam the land with their fuzzy little flocks of fluffy white sheep. All is well and good, until somebody has the bright idea to put up some fences...\nNow the shepherds must compete for the most profitable lands to raise their flocks, driving the sheep to the lands they own and fencing them in so they don\u2019t wander off and join some other shepherd\u2019s flock!\nAnd then there\u2019s that strange black sheep that keeps showing up. Its rare black wool is certain to fetch a pretty price in the market for the shepherd that can pen him in!\nCan you corral the finest herd in the best lands and become the richest shepherd in Sheepland?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sheepland"}
