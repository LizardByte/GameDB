Just as the player finds it exponentially more difficult to accomplish previously simple tasks with the loss of each ability, some of our parents, for instance, struggled with language barriers that made even setting up simple doctors appointments (or self-advocacy at them) daunting. In just ten short weeks, we set out to replicate their experience.\n\nJoin Dru as she faces the same trials, leaving everything she knows behind and sacrificing both her native tongue and abilities in order to pursue a new life elsewhere.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/uprooted--1", "videos": [{"id": 117154, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2zWf-oksXgk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zWf-oksXgk", "title": "Uprooted Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2zWf-oksXgk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
