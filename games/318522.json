The goal is to get the highest score you can in the amount of time you have!\n\nMario can use the coins he earns to buy new cards, upgrade old ones, get rid of ones he doesn't need anymore, or upgrade his stats between rounds. And every once in a while, there might be a super-tough enemy to deal with...", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paper-mario-showtime"}
