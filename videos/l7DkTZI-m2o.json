The playthrough was recorded from a first generation PS1 deck. \n\nBased off of the TV show of the same name, Valerie Irons (Pamela Anderson) and friends run off to save a plastic surgeon that has gotten on the wrong side of the mob and is now being hunted by about 7,000 men in black suits with guns. Loaded with the most over-the-top (sans Stallone) buttrock ever heard, hilariously stilted animated CGI video, wretched voice acting, and some really good (for PS1) polygonal character models, VIP is about the most inane yet entertaining game available for those with IQs below 80. And for everyone else too, though probably for different reasons.\n\nThe whole \"plot\" is carried by a string of minigames: fighting sections involve DDR styled quicktime actions, the shooting sections play like Lethal Enforcers with a D-pad (only with horrible, twitchy controls), and there are a few other sorta-functional diversions - but hey, fear not! Silicone and sassy-mouth breathing will prevail! I guess, for whatever the basis for the stupid action was.\n\nStealth action! Cell phone hacking! Slider puzzles! Beyond awkward sexual innuendo made by women wearing little more than underwear! OMG My face is gonna melt from the awesome!\n___\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l7DkTZI-m2o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l7DkTZI-m2o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l7DkTZI-m2o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "VIP (PS1) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of UbiSoft's 2001 Playstation game, VIP.
