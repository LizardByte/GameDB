It was published by Activision in 1981. One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to \"get to the other side.\" Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted. The chickens are only allowed to move up or down. A cluck sound is heard when a chicken is struck by a car. Comparisons are often made to Frogger, which has also features crossing a street filled with moving vehicles. Similarities did help sales when Frogger was popular in the arcades and a home version was not yet available.\n\nFreeway was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on August 18, 2010.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/freeway", "videos": [{"id": 7101, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "4xzU1rmyGXs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xzU1rmyGXs", "title": "Classic Game Room - FREEWAY review for Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4xzU1rmyGXs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
