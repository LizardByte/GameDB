Donald's life, except for his \"intolerable\" wife, is quiet. But Donald feels empty. He has the so-called retiree's syndrome : he's bored to death! The only way to cure his boredom is TO GO BACK TO WORK. After many hours spent in his city, trying to get hired for various jobs, he finally finds his calling: to be a GHOSTBUSTER! Donald will try to become Bob Delano's assistant (the most famous occult detective in Ireland), be involved in the investigation of Barker Manor and, hopefully, solve the mystery.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/donald-dowell-and-the-ghost-of-barker-manor", "videos": [{"id": 54521, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "h6rPzIC-1h8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6rPzIC-1h8", "title": "Donald Dowell - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h6rPzIC-1h8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
