So get your power gloves out because you\u2019ve been approved to pilot a state-of-the-art Nodeshifter digital vessel. \n \nEach Nodeshifter comes fully equipped with a rapidly orbiting Node capable of summoning destruction at a scale the likes of which has been heretofore unseen. Ok so maybe the Nodeshifter isn't exactly that advanced\u2026 and yes maybe the weapon systems are a little crude but don\u2019t worry along the way you will pick up a number of upgrades to make smashing aliens easier. Sure, it may be in pixels, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less metal. \n \nTo become a Star Defender pilot takes guts, skill, and bravery. But if you are selected to be a part of this elite alien fighting space force then your name will be etched in the stars of valor forever. \n \nPower-Up Your Play Style: Acquire unique and game-changing Enhancements for your Shifter that will dramatically alter your strategy and play style for the run. Try out new combinations for punishing results. \n \nEven Loss is Progress: Pick up Saalt from your fallen foes to purchase Cassettes that will give you a competitive advantage in future runs. These power-ups are permanent upgrades that can be chosen to better fit your uniquely preferred play style and preference. \n \nNew Paths of Destruction Every Time: Every level of Nodeshifter is dynamically generated so that your pixel carnage is fresh every time you play. It\u2019s so timeless, it\u2019s practically undead! \n \nA Unique World to Explore: I mean, \u201cexplore\u201d is a loaded word here, but there\u2019s a story and everything. And it kinda rules? \n \nThink you have what it takes to beat the hardest game known to mankind?
