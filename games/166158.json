The mean magician Godron has stolen the book \u201eMathematica\u201c from the creator of Trillion, and has cast an evil spell over the city: a ban on mathematics. Godron wants to gain power over the whole land and transform the world according to his will. But there are the brave heroes Bernard and Celestine with their friend 2weistein who want to put a stop to Godron to keep Trillion peaceful and beautiful, and no one is ever to be afraid again!", "summary": "The unique and fantastic idea behind the series of 2weistein games is to train math in a real 3D action adventure.
