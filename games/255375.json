Released first as a shareware episode on May 5, it features the brave and dashing Allied spy, William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, as he escapes capture and imprisonment and proceeds to rip the ugly Nazis a new orifice, ultimately even killing the main man himself - Hitler. The game was a huge success, and even to this day, there are communities of obviously insane people who keep releasing new mods. Talk about dedication.\n\nHowever, the storyline of the main game ends in the 1940s. Fast forward a few decades and ask yourself - where did all those people go? BJ - he's still out there somewhere. His enemies, big and small - still alive and kicking. But the years have not been kind to them. There comes a day when spry youngsters turn into old geezers, lifestyles once full of activity give way to sitting in comfy chairs and reading today's newspaper. Fake teeth, cane - check. Now where did you put your gold watch? Oh, it's next to the old radio. Zzzzz...\n\nSo, 30 years after the events of Wolfenstein 3D... As B.J.'s grandson has to leave the city (and, in fact, the planet) for a longer time, old William has to be placed in a retirement house. Imagine his surprise, then, when he wakes up surrounded by his former foes! After listening to a brief monologue by Hans Grosse, you have to leap into action immediately, and hopefully find a way out of this hellish place. But even if you do that, there may be other ghosts of the past waiting for you outside...", "summary": "A mod for Wolfenstein 3D that takes place 30 years after the original game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oldfartenstein-3d"}
