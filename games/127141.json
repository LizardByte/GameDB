It features a campaign with forty levels where blocks need to be cleared by hitting them with the ball to progress to the next level. You have the aid of power-ups (some with a positive effect and others with a negative effect). As you progress through the levels, you keep on gaining more and more points until finally, when you die you can save your final score into the Hall of Scores (the top twenty scores are shown). The game features a level editor, which has the ability to build any kind of level featuring all the tile sets that are featured in the campaign. The last game feature is the ability to play against other people (up to eight others and on the same computer), in which you play the campaign. Once you die the campaign resets and starts all over again for the second player. At the end (once all players have finished their campaign), it shows all high scores and whoever obtained the highest score wins.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
