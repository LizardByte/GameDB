However, it doesn't take long for the skilled and talented to rise above the rest. A bit of elbow grease will allow you to quickly climb the ranks and unlock the many perks that come with promotions.\n\nYour initial main task as a foot soldier will be to patrol the districts, where you'll scan the alleyways for suspicious individuals and search them for illicit goods. Like many guards in many towns, even the sentinels of Odom are corrupt... Will you choose to fine the criminals and pocket some of the money, or arrest them to advance your career? Both options will help you in one way or the other.\n\nThe more promotions you earn, the more perks you'll unlock. Soon you'll get to patrol richer districts, and even command your own rank-and-file soldiers to do your work for you. As a commanding officer, your subordinates' achievements also become your own! Some of the higher ranks will require buttering up your superiors, but your increased pay and a bit of saving will make short work of that, too.\n\nBoundless opportunities await a ruthless and corrupt guard, and your only limit is your imagination. How far will your ambitions take you?", "summary": "You just joined the guards in Odom, a border town full of merchants, travelers, and shady individuals.
