This card game is easy to learn and a delight to play.\nTripeaks (sometimes known as Tri Towers or Tri-Peaks Solitaire) is an original card game with simple rules. All you must do is match cards that are one higher or lower than the card in your hand. An Ace is both high and low, and you place a 2 or King on it. The longer the run the better. Use the free wildcard for when things get a little too tough. If you can\u2019t find a match, just turn over another card from the deck and continue! To win remove all three peaks of cards.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tripeaks-solitaire-classic"}
