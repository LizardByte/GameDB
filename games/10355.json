The player will need to Design chassis, engines, transmissions, and vehicles.\n\nManage production lines, supplies, prices, and employees. Build factories and distribution branches. Set marketing and racing budgets, and most importantly stay profitable. All while hundreds of AI marques attempt to do the same thing.\n\nArmed with a realistic economic simulator with historical purchasing power parity per capita, population, and economic data for over 250 cities, GearCity aims to be a hardcore realistic business simulator. This is not a typical casual tycoon game. Instead GearCity is a modern descendant of the classic 90s management games Detroit and MotorCity. Despite the fidelity of the simulation, once you get the hang of the game it is fairly simple and easy to play. You can choose a more abstract style, or dive deep and micromanage every detail.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gear-city", "videos": [{"id": 84530, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "d3Pu7kpbfUc"}]}
