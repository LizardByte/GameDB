Hit brown, blue and ice meteors. Dodge grey, yellow, fire and lightning meteors. Special attacks work on any type of meteorite. Rainbows can change the color of meteorites. Being on the receiving end of a meteor impact while in an idle position or hitting/dodging the wrong meteors results in losing HP/hit points and allowing your HP to reach zero will result in game over. Rainbow Meteor is a very hard game that requires great reflexes, reactions and focus in order to succeed.\n\nCompany Website: https://www.hardaigames.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hardaigames\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hardaigames\nGoogle Plus: https://plus.google.com/+HardaiGames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yn3mqNv_8Aw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yn3mqNv_8Aw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yn3mqNv_8Aw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yn3mqNv_8Aw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Rainbow Meteor", "description": "Rainbow Meteor is available for iOS and Android.\nGoogle Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hardaigames.rainbowmeteor\nApp Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rainbow-meteor/id1438348480\nAmazon App Store: https://www.amazon.com/Rainbow-Meteor/dp/B071PCQJ8Z\n\nRainbow Meteor is a challenging arcade game where you can choose from a variety of characters to defend against a meteor shower by using their abilities to hit or dodge meteors based on their color.
