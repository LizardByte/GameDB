A question that has all but torn the Sonic the Hedgehog community asunder:\n\nCan a Sonic the Hedgehog game be made such that it supplies a rich and robust experience in a fully 3D environment while staying true to its platforming roots?\n\nWe are here to answer this question, not through an in-depth analysis video, not through a lengthy forum post, but through a fully playable video game experience. After 10 months of research and development we believe that, yes, Sonic can not only exist in 3D, but he can THRIVE in it. GHP's massive environment, winding paths, dynamic physics and hidden collectibles provide players with the freedom to choose where they want to go and how they wish to get there. The only limitations are the laws of physics and the player's own skill.\n\nNo Spline paths.\nNo Boostpads.\nNo scripted cameras.\nNo Boost Button.\n\nGotta Go Fast?\nEarn it.\n\nThis is Green Hill Paradise, reborn.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/green-hill-paradise-act-2-final-mix", "videos": [{"id": 49491, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "6nmokhPUCQ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmokhPUCQ0", "title": "Green Hill Paradise - Act 2: Final Mix Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6nmokhPUCQ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49492, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "C0IsSeE_ckI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0IsSeE_ckI", "title": "Green Hill Paradise - Act 2: RELEASE TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C0IsSeE_ckI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49493, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "woL8_OxLKAY"}, {"id": 49494, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "xJPc-Whu3ak", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJPc-Whu3ak", "title": "Green Hill Paradise - Act 2 - Overview Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJPc-Whu3ak/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
