Soon it will die and explode, engulfing the earth and destroying all life. Only Willy can save the planet, by finding 255 objects that will somehow, mysteriously, reignite the sun.\n\nThe author leaves some doubt as to whether this scenario is literal or merely a metaphor. Is the sun truly on the brink of extinction, or is there a deeper issue plaguing Willy? Can he overcome his sadness and find happiness once more?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jet-set-willy-the-sun-is-no-longer-producing-heat", "videos": [{"id": 139251, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "f-nSlZBNI2g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-nSlZBNI2g", "title": "JSW: The Sun Is No Longer Producing Heat walkthrough | ZX Spectrum | JSWCL-139", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f-nSlZBNI2g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
