With congressional action, a huge segment of the national economy becomes illegal overnight: bars and saloons are ordered to close, distilleries and breweries go quiet, distributors shut down. But a new era is dawning: a gilded age for smugglers, black markets, illegal manufacture, and organized crime.\n\nThis is where you come in. You're a new arrival in the city at the dawn of Prohibition, with ambitions of striking it big. Behind many of the city's facades, people are building makeshift distilleries, secret loading docks, nighttime speakeasies. Work your way into this network, and the world will be yours.\n\nBut think beyond making a quick buck or two. You gotta be thinking ahead. You gotta be thinking bigger. Much bigger.", "summary": "Start a crime syndicate from nothing, and grow it into a well-oiled money machine in City of Gangsters, a mafia management simulation game. Build speakeasies and illegal distilleries. Manage production chains and resource distribution. Smuggle goods from out of town and bribe the police to look the other way. Grow a powerful crew and keep your rivals under your thumb. Eliminate competition and rule the city. But most importantly, keep the money flowing.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-of-gangsters", "videos": [{"id": 46255, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "509XTZ6zZKE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=509XTZ6zZKE", "title": "City of Gangsters | Mafia Management (Ep. 1 - Supply & Demand)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/509XTZ6zZKE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46254, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "E_VAZjwqE6c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_VAZjwqE6c", "title": "City of Gangsters - Official Trailer | gamescom 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E_VAZjwqE6c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
