Throughout the course of his quest, he travels through elemental dungeons, a wilderness region, a mountainside seminary, a large castle, and finally a necropolis, before the final showdown with the Serpent Rider.", "summary": "While you were battling the evil forces of D'Sparil, the other Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in other dimensions. One such dimension is the decaying world where Hexen takes place. A world littered with the mangled corpses of nonbelievers and inhabited by the undead followers that executed them. Only three humans; a warrior, a mage and a cleric; have escaped the leaders' vicious spell. Now these brave souls have sworn to crush the evil regime that threatens to destroy the world forever. Separated upon entering the mystical portal, the three are forced to attempt on their own what they had hoped to do together: find Korax's stronghold, destroy him and restore order in the physical world.\n\nBecome one of 3 heroes. Wield superhuman powers and lethal weapons.\nWalk. Run. Fly. Look all around. Inflict serious pain.\nPillage your way through earthquakes, crumbling bridges and fog.\nTrack down powerful artifacts and cast wicked spells.\nFour sick individuals can wreak havoc via network, two by modem.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hexen-beyond-heretic", "videos": [{"id": 31570, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "dTrI2im443k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTrI2im443k", "title": "Longplay of Hexen: Beyond Heretic", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dTrI2im443k/sddefault.jpg"}]}
