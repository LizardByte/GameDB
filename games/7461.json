Colonies of humans called Rifters have been exploring the \"Frontier\" of planets, but find their way of life threatened by the Outcast, a ruthless species of humans who have mutated into psychotic monsters due to exposure to this very same Rift Energy. Caught in the middle is Emmett Graves, a hired gunslinger ostracized from society because of his own exposure to Rift Energy, leaving him partially mutated, but still able to retain his humanity. Graves is drawn back to his home settlement to face a mysterious outlaw and his war band of Outcast warriors.\n\nStarhawk provides fast paced third-person shooter action set in this lawless frontier of space, allowing players to instantly alter the battlefield by calling down offensive and defensive structures in real-time from an orbiting drop ship, all while blasting away at enemies in the middle of huge single-player or multi-player firefights.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starhawk", "videos": [{"id": 40346, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "64PTsyzCqVs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64PTsyzCqVs", "title": "Starhawk\u2122 - Official Launch Trailer (Available Now)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/64PTsyzCqVs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119816, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "F0rQZgNf57o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0rQZgNf57o", "title": "Starhawk E3 2011 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0rQZgNf57o/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2372, "name": "Warhawk"}]}
