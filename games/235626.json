The Miskatonic University of Massachusetts has launched an expedition, led by William Dyer, to excavate fossils and find concrete evidence for scientific hypotheses about the land. The expedition arrived on an island in the Antarctic region but contact was soon lost as their supply ship returned to an all but abandoned base camp.\n\nYou not only fear the worst for your colleagues but you also have an inexplicable sense of dread surrounding the expedition. Without support from the university anytime soon, you begin a rogue mission to find out what happened to the team. You make your way to Australia and find a fishing boat that is willing to drop you off and pick you back up after two days.", "summary": "Dyer Expedition is a puzzle adventure game with light Lovecraftian horror elements and a story inspired by Lovecraft's 1931 novella At the Mountains of Madness.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dyer-expedition", "videos": [{"id": 116435, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "aoKi-mzx9n0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoKi-mzx9n0", "title": "Dyer Expedition - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoKi-mzx9n0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
