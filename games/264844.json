An old-school puzzle platformer in which you explore rooms, avoid perils and collect all coins to progress. Missed some coins? Fall, collect, undo! Falling into some spikes? Undo!!\n\nTest your forward thinking and logical skills. Plan your falls carefully, as your undos are limited. If you're not paying attention, you'll find yourself unable to restore back to the top, with coins still needing collecting!\n\nEnjoy the retro aesthetics with monochrome pixel art, playing the game on the state of the art handheld GrimBoy (TM) (wink).
