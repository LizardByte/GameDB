As its condition leaves something to be desired, Allyson starts to restore it so it will earn Kyle and her more money. It\u2019s then that she discovers the chest has a hidden compartment which, after managing to open it, proves to contain an old letter by Sammuels himself.

Of course Allyson and Kyle take up this task, and quickly embark on a journey that will take them to Europe and South America.", "summary": "When antique shop owners Allyson Tremonte and her friend Kyle start restoring an 18th century desk, they make a startling discovery.
