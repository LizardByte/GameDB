Notes fall down across the screen and when they hit the judgement line it is time to press the button, or turn the turntable. \n \nThe Theme of BISTROVER is food and travel, the name itself is a combination of the words Bistro and Rover. \n \nSome new features added to BISTROVER is more statistics and analysis on your results after a song, so you can better get an understanding of how you did. The Pacemaker (which keeps a track of how you are doing during a song) can now tell you how how far you are from a next grade, and updates to a new target during the song.", "videos": [{"id": 42742, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "slOAqMqljPQ"}]}
