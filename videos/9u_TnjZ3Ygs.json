It will feature a small cast of antagonist characters, which allows the game to create kind of a personality for every single one of them. The game is going to be one of the scariest Fangames, since the game will have an extremely creepy ambience and moments in the game that could possibly make you a little swetty. This game will be a horror game in many ways and not only use Jumpscares to be scary.\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.scottgames.com\nFNAF Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/animdude\n\nGOD BLESS YOU!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9u_TnjZ3Ygs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9u_TnjZ3Ygs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9u_TnjZ3Ygs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9u_TnjZ3Ygs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9u_TnjZ3Ygs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "INSANITY", "description": "EPIC! - http://gamejolt.com/games/insanity/94933\nCreator: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe7qX5iemAZ2CQ-Nghzo7Mg\n\u2764 SUB 4 MOAR! \u27a5 http://bit.ly/IULITM\n\u25d5 My brother's channel \u27a5 http://bit.ly/maryogames\n\nInsanity is a FNaF Fangame that goes all the way back to FNaF 2 and explores something that Scott mentioned, but never actually solved in the series.
