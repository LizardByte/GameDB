But now, the few survivors of the human race have one last chance to save their planet ... with their help!\n\nThe Confederacy of Leezaluth, the empire now ruling the galaxy, sent a warning to Earth: \"For any of the human survivors - an inter-galactic terrorist group known as Gulfer is planning to invade their planet and use their polluted lands to build armaments and Humans must stop Gulfer Empire so that a planet is inhabitable and peaceful.\n\nUnfortunately, an Earth does not have much time for military resources and weapons to fight as threats. Humans now live in space colonies and some still live on Earth. But there is still a brave young man who suits the Earth's survival situation. His name is Dan Dare, a young pilot who is ready to face the Gulfer terrorists completely alone.\n\nIn the plot we meet characters like Alexis (who joins Dan and dreams of living with him on a peace-filled Planet Earth), Natasha (queen of the Leezaluth Stellar Confederation) and Alexis's sister. Worried about her little sister, who sent her to earth as messenger) and the cruel villain ZZ Badnasty (leader of the terrorist group, Gulfer), this cold-blooded woman is trying to use the Earth's polluted materials to create new weapons. Is mechanical, has a habit of laughing hysterically for no reason and is extremely egomaniacal.\n\nThe game has beautiful graphics and innovates because the ship can absorb the types of shots of several enemies. I played with the G-Beam shot for almost the entire game because I considered him the best. I hope you enjoy this video.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xl_ZTiBxLGg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xl_ZTiBxLGg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xl_ZTiBxLGg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[Longplay] GEN - Gaiares (HD, 60FPS)", "description": "Played by xRavenXP (me)\n\nThis is a longplay of game Gaiares, a 1990 scrolling shooter developed by Telenet Japan and published by Renovation for the Sega Genesis in Japan and North America in 1990.\n\nA story of this game takes place in the year 3008, when the planet Earth has turned into a lifeless place, a wasteland that serves as a garbage dump and radioactive materials because of humans who are no love for their planet.
