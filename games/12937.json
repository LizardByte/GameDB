Following this, he created eight more robots intended for industrial use: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, Elec Man, Time Man, and Oil Man. He received a Nobel Prize for Physics, and his old colleague and rival Doctor Wily has grown bitter for not being acknowledged for his work on the project. Wily discovered a prototype robot made by Doctor Light before Rock and Roll called Proto Man, who is in danger of having his energy generator go critical. Wily gave him a nuclear energy supply to extend his life. He later steals and reprograms the eight industrial robots to attempt world domination. Rock volunteered to stop Wily and rescue his friends, and Dr. Light converted him into a fighting robot, giving him a new name: Mega Man. After defeating all eight Robot Masters and returning them to normal, Mega Man goes through Dr. Wily's fortress and challenges him. After beating Wily, the mad scientist surrenders and asks Mega Man to spare him. Mega Man then returns home, where he's greeted by Dr. Light, Roll, and his friends.", "summary": "Mega Man Powered Up, known as Rockman Rockman in Japan, is a remake of the first Mega Man game. It was released worldwide for the PlayStation Portable in March 2006.\n\nIt was later released in a bundle alongside Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X and was slated for release on the PSP's PlayStation Network. It was released for the PlayStation Network service in Japan, but a US release did not occur due to technical difficulties. The game uses a chibi-style that was intended for the original game but was not possible at the time.\n\nThe designers intended to keep this design faithful to the way the characters worked and looked in the original. While it received generally positive reviews, the game sold poorly, and plans for a remake of Mega Man 2 titled Mega Man Powered Up 2 fell through.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-powered-up", "videos": [{"id": 46701, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aOnOCTGAvzY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOnOCTGAvzY", "title": "Mega Man Powered Up  Sony PSP Trailer - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOnOCTGAvzY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
