It adds a new soundtrack, new characters and so forth. Set in 2089, one year before the Second Huffman Conflict as a series of skirmishes around 2086 have led to increased military activity by both OCU and USN to quell these tensions ( which we saw in Front Mission 5's intro ). You join a mercenary unit ( I think ) hired to spy on the opposing faction and to take part in skirmish battles that occur.\n\nGameplay wise, it's Front Mission. But, there's some new neat gameplay mechanics in this one. For example, you can stand next to your ally and repair them. This you could never do in the original Front Mission game so that's a clear improvement. With this, you can have a dedicated support mech that either only carries shields and long range weapons, with a full-load out of repair items, or something similar.\n\nRegardless, this game comes recommended.\nBut from the looks of things, don't expect a translation patch anytime soon...\n\nPlease leave a Comment and Like!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceP_be7BTyU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceP_be7BTyU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceP_be7BTyU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceP_be7BTyU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceP_be7BTyU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Front Mission 2089: Border of Madness \u2014 [ Nintendo DS ] \u2014 Intro & Gameplay", "description": "Another chapter in the Front Mission series of games, this is;\n\nFront Mission 2089: Border of Madness\n\nOriginally released as a mobile game for Japanese cellphones, Border of Madness makes use of the original Front Mission sprites from the Super Nintendo days but makes them clearer, I think.
