Written by author Orson Scott Card and published by Majesco Entertainment. Advent Rising started as a trilogy, but due to poor critical reception and poor sells the sequels were cancelled.  There was a PSP title in the works called \"Advent Shadow\" that was also cancelled. Due to an epic story and fun gameplay, Advent Rising has acquired a cult following and is considered and underrated classic by fans.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/advent-rising", "videos": [{"id": 3625, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "k1atrmoPObc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1atrmoPObc", "title": "Advent Rising Xbox Trailer - Theatrical Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k1atrmoPObc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
