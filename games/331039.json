Though he's anything but eager, Toshio is whisked away to the Kingdom of Perahim, whereupon he learns that he must recover two magic relics and finish what his predecessors started or be put to the sword.\n\nAn obsession with an ancient legend, a merciless and unforgiving queen, the abduction of men from other worlds... Something is deeply wrong in Perahim, but will Toshio get to the bottom of this mystery and escape with his life? Will he be forced into a life of eternal servitude? Or something far worse...?", "summary": "After a sudden and chance meeting with an otherworldly beauty, Toshio Kaname is whisked away to a magical world, the Kingdom of Perahim.
