Impossible Mission was the first game to use real synthesized speech, an incredible development when first unleashed on the 8-bit formats. The original game included a random game-map system which ensured that no two games were the same. Although the original still stands the test of time today, inclusion of brand new graphics and sound ensures that Impossible Mission is primed to thrill a brand new audience.\n\nThe gamer takes the role of a secret agent attempting to stop evil genius Professor Elvin Atombender who has been tampering with National Security Computers. Players must penetrate Atombender's base, attempting to recover parts of the system password whilst avoiding deadly robots in a race against time.\n\nWhilst the game has been re-written from the ground up and features new graphics, 3D objects, new Sound Effects and Music, the gameplay remains impressively loyal with the game layout changing for every new game. There are now three main characters to choose from plus a brand new tutorial mode. The player can now chose from three game modes, new, original and for the purist; a hybrid mode with the original gameplay using the updated graphics.\n\nThe PSP versions offer an unusual feature which allows players to send a full copy of their game to a friend by Wireless so they can try it for themselves.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/impossible-mission--1", "videos": [{"id": 95212, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SPoaLOu9O-I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPoaLOu9O-I", "title": "Impossible Mission (2007) - PlayStation 2 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SPoaLOu9O-I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
