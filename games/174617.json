It's hard. It's not covered with berries or shiny baubles. I didn't have the money or stomach for that.\nI created Rookfall to intrigue and challenge the \"hard core\" game audience. I used very little money to make it. It's not pretty but there's plenty of content, a form of progression, a difficulty curve, and the core puzzle is oddly compelling.\nYou'll have a hard time at first, but with some practice you'll develop some strategy. Due to the nature of the puzzle, solutions come in satisfying epiphanies.\nYou'll think hard, get frustrated, maybe have to come back to it later, but then finally see the light for some delicious dopamine. Mmmmm dopamine.\nHave fun."}
