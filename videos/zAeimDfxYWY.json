Will you ever make it home?\n\nWith Gravitar: Recharged Atari revisits an incredibly ambitious arcade title. The 1982 original took the rotate, thrust and fire mechanics of Asteroids and Space Duel, combined them with the gravity of Lunar Lander, and added exploration and elements of cave flying. The result was an extremely challenging arcade game that was eventually ported to the Atari 2600.\n\nWanna follow along in what Atari is doing?\nYou can easily check out the latest news, upcoming releases and chat with your fellow enthusiasts by joining our official Discord server: https://discord.gg/XNYQVAwxrB\n#Atari50 #AtariAnniversary", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zAeimDfxYWY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zAeimDfxYWY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zAeimDfxYWY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zAeimDfxYWY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zAeimDfxYWY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Gravitar: Recharged Announcement Trailer", "description": "A lone pilot, far from home, must navigate an abstract universe of uncharted planets and space stations guarded by mysterious, hostile aliens in Gravitar: Recharged. \n\nYou must complete missions in each solar system, navigating a variety of challenging environments, each with varying levels of gravity that will test your skills as a pilot.
