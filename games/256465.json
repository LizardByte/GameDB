This remaster also marks the first time the original Clock Tower game will see an official release outside of Japan, which up until this point only had fan translations. The remastered version will utilize the Carbon Engine.\n\nClock Tower is a survival horror point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Human Entertainment for the Super Famicom in 1995. It is the first installment of the long-running Clock Tower series.\n\nThe story follows Jennifer Simpson as she learns the secrets of the Barrows Mansion and attempts to escape the game's antagonist, Scissorman.\n\nClock Tower originally released in 1995 and is not to be confused with the PlayStation 1 game Clock Tower released in 1996. The franchise only spawned four games, with the most recent release, Clock Tower 3, launching on the PlayStation 2.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clock-tower-rewind", "videos": [{"id": 93637, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZMzM9J20MOU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMzM9J20MOU", "title": "Clock Tower - LRG3 Announcement Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMzM9J20MOU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 115359, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "Jc6rN9_XLt4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc6rN9_XLt4", "title": "Clock Tower: Rewind - Official Gameplay and Developer Commentary Trailer | Guerrilla Collective 2024", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jc6rN9_XLt4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
