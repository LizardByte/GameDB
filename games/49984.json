Start out in Free mode, which allows you to surf in any of six different locales around the world: Travel from Australia to sunny California, through Japan, into Hawaii, Brazil, and ultimately the South Pole. Grand Prix mode sends you to the same glorious locales, but challenges you to surf in a circuit that houses the toughest competition in the world. Choose one of six awesome characters to take through to the game's conclusion, and enjoy creative side games like Frisbee Toss and Capture the Flag. The top-notch graphics and gameplay of ULTIMATE SURFING will have you feeling the ocean's breeze splashing across your face, and the controls are simple to learn but sophisticated enough to appeal to the most discerning handheld gamers. As if all of this weren't a sweet enough deal, you can link up with another player and surf against one another. Now, that's one gnarly game, dude.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-surfing"}
