Each player controls a boat that can place mines. The game plays like a typical light-cycle game such as Blockade. The boats leave continuous trails of mines behind. Players can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win a player must last longer than your opponent before hitting the borders of the screen or a solid line of mines (first person to hit something loses). The game is over when a player has six points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mine-sweeper--1"}
