Commonly known as \u201cthe sickness\u201c, it is an infectious disease caused by a mutation of the influenza virus.        \n       \nVyal Pharmaceuticals was tasked to create a vaccine to stop the spread of this vicious virus. Phase I initial test subjects were shown to have a 100% recovery rate, and an end to this global pandemic was in sight. Standard precautions were ignored due to the spread of the epidemic, pharmacovigilance was ignored due to public outcry, and the a last minute stabilizer antigen was introduced into the production of the Phase III clinical trial antigen.       \n       \nThis \"botched batch\" was either a fluke or was manipulated by someone; which led to zombification.", "summary": "Cold Comfort is an asymmetrical, tactical 5v5 PvP FPS. Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, it has a strong focus on cooperation and environmental destruction. Play as either a Survivor or a Gamma Prime- each side having completely unique game mechanics and vastly different goals. Each Survivor has their own exclusive weapon sets, skills, and gadgets. Their unified goal: the preservation of humanity from the throes of the Gamma Strain pandemic. They must rescue and evacuate civilians, ensuring that the infection does not spread. \n \nAs with any virus, it's main prerogative is to evolve and disseminate. The Gamma Primes, victims mutated by the Gamma Strain, are the perfect catalyst for this task. As a Gamma Prime, you start the game embodying an infected rat. Scurrying around, spreading terror and infection. The more corpses and civilians you infect, the greater your respawn pool becomes. Choose when you want to take the next evolutionary step, and become a zombie, and then fully evolve into a Gamma Prime; using these stages to your advantage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 40150, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZUvxnWAir2w"}]}
