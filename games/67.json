You are cast as the immortal emperor who shapes the future of your race, as contact is made with the neighbouring races. Your objective is simple: control a majority of the known galaxy and eliminate all who stand in the way.\n\nAs ruler you must ultimately decide the destiny of your race as you make decisions on how planetary resources are allocated, where star fleets will be deployed, which races to fight, and which races to ally with. You begin with control of your home planet, from which you can explore and colonize nearby star systems. Your first decisions will centre around the rapid development of colonies into productive worlds, what types of technology to focus on, and which star systems to colonize.\n\nHowever, the true challenge begins when contact is made with other races, and complex strategies must be formulated to manage diplomacy, sabotage, espionage, trade, and interstellar combat.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/master-of-orion", "videos": [{"id": 373, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "Gg_dnfOg7B8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg_dnfOg7B8", "title": "Master of Orion 1 intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gg_dnfOg7B8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 374, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "kYz0-AGDZoc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYz0-AGDZoc", "title": "A Master of Orion 1 game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kYz0-AGDZoc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
