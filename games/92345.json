Her father, Anthony, was also a mechanic. Though he was old, he was still called the 'God of Repair'. Erika was also a good mechanic. One day, Anthony received a command from the Juktland Army. It was to be a airplane mechanic for the Roby Independent Aerial Platoon. Erika didn't want him to overwork himself, so she said, \"I'll go in behalf of him.\" Like this, she was sent to an air base near the border. However, when soldiers first saw her, some despised her, some expected something from her, and some felt disappointed... No one treated her as a full-fledged mechanic... She finally said, \"I'm here as a mechanic. Give me something to do!\"", "summary": "Kazeiro Surf is a PS2 visual novel, developed and published by Russel, which was released in Japan in 2009", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kazeiro-surf", "videos": [{"id": 75110, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "53X3VXTHBr4"}, {"id": 75111, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "PTBJCNib080", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTBJCNib080", "title": "Kazeiro Surf (Opening)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PTBJCNib080/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
