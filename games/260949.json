It consists of levels that were left out of the original Claustrophobia 1024, as well as some original levels. It is the result of a project begun by Joonas \u00c4ij\u00e4l\u00e4 (Jodwin) to improve levels from the alpha stage of Claustrophobia 1024's development that were removed for quality reasons; consequently, most of the levels originate from the alpha stage. Others were developed for the beta stage of development, but were removed as the result of there being too many levels to fit into a full megawad, hence the subtitle. The WAD was released on January 7, 2010.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/claustrophobia-1024-2-the-mystery-of-too-many-maps"}
