But Merlin forewarns you of mysterious places, gruesome creatures, evil forces and magical objects that will enter your quest at every turn. Defying all perils, you will journey through an ominous forest, a supernatural castle, treacherous caves and magical cities - a few of the seven types of realms that will entice you. Some will hold necessary supplies and even treasures, but in others you will be surrounded by immeasuarble evil. Do all in your power to ward off dragons, bargain with wizards and subdue the devil himself, as more than these will try to waylay you in your quest.\n\nBut have faith, brave knight, amazing treasures will spur you on. A staff that emanates the most powerful of magic and a ring with supernatural powers are among the wonders you will behold. Be warned of one other treasure, a magnificent ark, which will act in your favor, if, and only if, you have certain magic in your possession.
