It will look like a real professional NES cart and it will work on your American NES system just like any other original game. Depending on your tastes, you get to choose between a catridge with a red label here: http://www.gamereproductions.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=24 and another one with a black label here: http://www.gamereproductions.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=23 There is no official label, but the red one looks close to the original Japanese version and the black one looks more like what it could have looked like if it was released in America. This was made to be used in a review I made on this French site here: http://www.geekmodeblog.com/2009/07/earth-boundmother-nes-aka-earthbound.html#complet The previous version of this video had its audio stop as soon as the battle against the doll started (at around 4:00). I just changed a setting in audio quality and rendered a new file and it worked, but the point is, this is not the setting I use in my other videos, so sometimes YouTube will not understand a file even if you do it the right way (same settings as usual and the video plays fine in my computer). Anyway, Earth Bound was originally known as Mother in Japan and it's pretty much proven fact today that there existed an actual unique prototype (the game featured in this video) in English and complete. It was never released, but a group of ROM hackers known as Demiforce got the cartridge and they dumped a ROM of it with some hack done to the title screen so that it would be called EarthBound Zero, so that it wouldn't be confused with its sequel that got released in America under the title EarthBound. There's some more background story to that and people who don't believe it's an actual prototype, but an unofficial translation by Demiforce, as I said, it's pretty much proven fact today that it is real. The one featured in this video is the version with no modification to the title screen or anywhere in the game and it should be as close as possible to the actual prototype cartridge. This is one of the best 8-bit RPGs in my opinion.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0w_1cJk5u2k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0w_1cJk5u2k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0w_1cJk5u2k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Earth Bound/Mother a.k.a EarthBound Zero [Prototype] (NES) Intro and Brief Gameplay Demonstration", "description": "If you want to buy this unreleased game, completely in English, with a lifetime warranty, GameReproductions.com sell a cart made from an Eath Bound ROM.
