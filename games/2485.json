When Luigi learns that he's the proud new owner of a creepy old mansion, he's thrilled. Of course, his feelings immediately shift when his brother, the storied Mario, disappears from the house. Now, you'll have to help Luigi track his brother down, making your way through expansive 3D levels. Each stage is packed with ghosts and ghouls to put you on edge; and you'll be armed with a flashlight and a vacuum cleaner to help you capture your foes. Armed with a flashlight and a customized vacuum cleaner, Luigi must rid the mansion of Boos and ghouls -- and find his missing brother to boot!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 36518, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CYhGQeBwyRk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYhGQeBwyRk", "title": "Luigi's Mansion (GameCube) Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYhGQeBwyRk/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 787, "name": "Voices"}]}
