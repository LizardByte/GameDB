Having all the feedback we got from you after our teasers and making-ofs, we figured out that everybody wants the same: to explore the destroyed Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and Pripyat ghost city as deeply as it's possible. \n\nThen we decided to expand these locations in the game comparing to the original concept and ask you for help in doing that. It's hard and dangerous task, assuming that we need to make some extra trips to the Exclusion Zone and scan more buildings and objects.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, we'll be starting the Kickstarter campaign. It'll let you pre-order the game and buy many cool gifts, including our highly demanded Black Stalker mask, and will let us collect some extra funds to do the Chernobylite location expansions plus add some extra features that we were always dreaming of.\n\nSign to our newsletter and stay tuned for the news on Kickstarter campaign launch!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Bf6fpVkmfA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Bf6fpVkmfA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Bf6fpVkmfA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Bf6fpVkmfA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Bf6fpVkmfA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Chernobylite Kickstarter Announcement Teaser", "description": "\u2622\ufe0f\ud83d\ude42\u2622\ufe0f Support us on KICKSTARTER! \u2622\ufe0f\ud83d\ude42\u2622\ufe0f \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-survival-horror-in-3d-scanned-chernob?ref=7cffl2\n\nAdd the game to your wishlist - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016800\nGet the daily pics on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chernobylite/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ChernobyliteGame/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChernobylGame\nVK: https://vk.com/chernobylitegame\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/mehRmzY \n\nHey stalkers!\n\nIt's time to share something special and important, both for you and for us.
