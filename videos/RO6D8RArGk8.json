It features four different stories, one for each character you can play as, and a presentation that'll make any kid (or adult ;) ) fall in love with it within seconds.\n\nMagical Tetris Challenge has just about all of the standard features found in any Tetris game, but it adds quite a few of its own. In addition to the cast of Disney characters and multiple storylines, it introduces \"pentominos\" that are launched at your opponent as you successfully clear lines - they go between standard 2x2 blocks all the way up to massive 5x5 blocks. As you can imagine, they can wreak havoc on the unsuspecting recipient. The AI can be pretty tough in this game - far more so than the recent Puyo Puyo Tetris. I actually can't recall playing another Tetris game that was quite *this* stiff in its difficulty level. \n\nThe graphics really sell this one, though. Try to ignore the ugly and totally out of place prerendered CGI playing field \"toppers\" - they look gross - but the sprites look great,  and they tend to resemble the sprite work from Capcom's SNES Mickey games,  but with much more detail and animation. The story is merely window-dressing, but it undoubtedly captures the signature Disney charm. If you like Mickey and you like Tetris, this one makes for an easy decision. It's well worth playing.\n\nSide note: the N64 game is the only version of the game that was released in America. There was, however, a PlayStation version released in Japan and Europe. \n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RO6D8RArGk8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RO6D8RArGk8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RO6D8RArGk8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RO6D8RArGk8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RO6D8RArGk8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Magical Tetris Challenge (N64) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1998 licensed-based puzzle game for the Nintendo 64, Magical Tetris Challenge.\n\nPlayed through as Donald Duck on the default difficulty level.\n\nIf you'd like to see Mickey's story, see my video of the PlayStation version of the game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n-W12vfTvw\n\nCapcom's Disney take on the N64 of the Soviet PC game was certainly one of the more memorable console versions of Tetris to appear over the years.
