It was later released for PC systems.\n\nYears in the works and heavily inspired by Battlestar Galactica, this space opera game tells the story of the evacuation of mankind through the territories of the evil Rexxons. The game features eight levels of space flight action shooting. For instance navigate your vessel through a minefield within a timelimit. Or destroy the communication arrays of the Raxxons on the planet itself. Although gameplay is limited, the vector graphics are impressive and so are the cutscenes. You can look at your spacecraft from 6 diffent perspectives. The game is best played using the mouse. The action is viewed from the cockpit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/epic", "collections": [{"id": 4876, "name": "Epic & Inferno"}]}
