Its main protagonist is a small robot named Adapter (aka Dongle). The game takes place in a surreal place of 'deleted memories', where all objects: houses, cars, buses, planes etc. are mixed together creating a vertical maze. Gravity is your enemy, you need to carefully jump down from a platform to other platform and not to crash. Once the protagonist reach the very floor, you can travel to the next level.\n\nEach level is procedurally generated based on dozens of amazing presets: various platforms, mazes, traps, power-up stations and many more. Each try is an unique experience.\n\n\nGoogle Play download URL:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icoeye.glassfall\n\n\niOS Games (iPhone - iPad - iPod Touch)\niTunes download URL:\n\nThanks for every Like and Favorite!
