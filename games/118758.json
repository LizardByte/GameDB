The aliens have been eating the people and devouring the city. As a Kebiishi, or knight, you decide to defend the city by burying the aliens alive. Your task is to run around areas set up like mazes and dig holes. The longer you hold down the button the larger the hole will be. Holes need to be placed strategically so as to trap the moving aliens and not to corner yourself. When an alien falls into a hole you must then refill the hole before they can escape. Defeat all 12 rounds to win the game. Play alone, against a friend, or team up with a friend to bury aliens alive in Heiankyo Alien."}
