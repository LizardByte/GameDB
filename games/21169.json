As a pool of water that can take on alternate forms of ice and steam, you must overcome obstacles scattered across the pages of Aquaticus and save it from the corruptive Influence. Tilt and twist your Wii Remote controller to use the various forms and properties of water on your free-flowing journey through Aquaticus, where every page has multiple panels and illustrations that come to life. Tackle problems and defeat enemies to reveal magical Rainbow Drops, each of which will restore some of Aquaticus' power and allow it to open more chapters and grant you new powers. These additional powers, such as sticking to objects as a block of ice or shooting bolts of lightning as a steam cloud, will be essential to destroying the Influence and its minions. Along the way, you can also test your ingenuity and reflexes by finding hidden puzzle pieces. These pieces unlock playrooms that give you the opportunity to use the skills you've learned and race against the clock to complete as many challenges as possible. These challenges won't affect your quest to restore Aquaticus' powers, but everyone needs a break now and again, right? Fluidity offers the chance to slosh and slide your way through an imaginative environment filled with challenging adventures. Are you ready to dive into this unique experience?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fluidity", "videos": [{"id": 43337, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "a7Jmre7Kkv4"}]}
