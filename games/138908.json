The major changes and improvements have been focused on graphic and statistical updates rather than on engine itself. The most significant differences from the original are:\n\nWhole look of the game is less vivid in order to increase the level of realism.\nSome home, away and goalkeepers kits have been updated (including the All Star teams).\nThe appearance of goals and nets has been changed.\nSquads have been updated to exactly reflect 1998 FIFA World Cup squads, the number of players in line-ups has been extended to 22 as well.\nThree difficulty levels instead of five: easy, medium and hard.\nThe choice of match length has been widen to 30 minutes in spaces of 5.\nMatch settings in Exhibition Mode now include the choice of uniforms, extended period, penalty shoot-out and golden goal.\nDuring the Cup Mode the statistics of scores and assists have been added.\nThe imitation of Stade de France, the venue of 1998 FIFA World Cup final, has been added as a new stadium.\nThe immediate replays after most interesting moments like missed shots, fouls or offsides have been implemented during the match.\nThe most noticeable changes during play covered improved shoot system and added power slide bar during corner kicks.\nA new one-two pass method is added, allowing the first player to pass and run without the second player having to return the ball immediately. This new move added much more variety to the game.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-soccer-jikkyou-winning-eleven-3-final-ver", "videos": [{"id": 40639, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7ETVM_YeZRU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ETVM_YeZRU", "title": "World All Stars x Europe All Stars - Winning Eleven 3 - Final Version (Playstation)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7ETVM_YeZRU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
