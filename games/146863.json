Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.\n\nSpikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions.\n\nYou\u2019ll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won\u2019t make it through without your help.\n\nIt\u2019s not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers\u2019 positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.", "summary": "Get ready to command an odd squad of fun birds and devise a plan to bring them safe and sound to the end of the battlefield.
