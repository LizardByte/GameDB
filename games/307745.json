You have three distinct dungeons to overcome, all while managing scarce resources and making hard decisions on when to push on, or use a map to return to the safety of one of the few outposts found in those dark halls.\n\nTraumatarium Penitent takes place well after the events of the original game. The kingdom's knights have broken into two factions: the Penitents, who swore to pay off their sins in defense of the kingdom, and the Ebon Legion, who aim to bring forth again the evil spirits that once haunted the land.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/traumatarium-penitent"}
