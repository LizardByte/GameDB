The catch? Physical violence of any kind is prohibited for the entire continent, and the only way to combat your foes is to get very \"physical\" with them. Adventure, loot, and seduce your way through a plethora of fantasy-oriented locations in an attempt to free yourself of your collected debt, or get fucked into submission while trying. Also defeat the Demon Queen. Maybe.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-girl-dreams"}
