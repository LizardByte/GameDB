And this time you mean it. Those fools at the Intergalactic Horrorcultural Society have given the blue ribbon -- your blue ribbon -- to some ill-deserving pretender to the throne for too many star cycles now, and you are determined it will not happen again. This time, you're pulling out all the stops. There is no monster too deadly for you to capture, no combination of creatures too volatile for you to control. You don't care how many invasive species you have to introduce or ecosystems you have to destroy, your ambition will not be contained. You will slay the competition at any cost.\n\nTerrorarium is an 3D puzzle platformer where you play as the Gardener, a feisty granny with a chip on her shoulder, and her army of adorable, expendable Moogu. The Moogu will die frequently, breed out of control, and are often as insufferable as they are useful.\n\nIn Maker Mode, you choose how the chaos unfolds. Design and publish your own levels with vicious creatures, treacherous hazards, plant monsters, lovely foliage, and destructible terrain. With these moveable, scalable, customizable assets, you can create a beautiful garden, a deadly maze or a murderous gauntlet. Hundreds of community levels have already been designed for you and you can share the levels you build with your friends and frenemies, so they too may see the horrors you have wrought.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/terrorarium"}
