The player controls a fat fly which is flying down a road, and must avoid oncoming bikers. By holding the left mouse button, the player can speed up; the faster the fly is going, the more score the player receives for avoiding bikers. Each collision slows the fly down and takes away one life, and the game is over once all lives are used up.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bikeflyter", "videos": [{"id": 44712, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "DCjkgfjQwPw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCjkgfjQwPw", "title": "BikeFlyter (Windows, 2000) Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DCjkgfjQwPw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
