{"id": "CVQM7XofmKw", "snippet": {"title": "ASTROSMASH\u00ae Official Trailer", "description": "ASTROSMASH\u00ae was originally designed for the Intellivision\u00ae console in 1981 by John Sohl and quickly became one of the most popular games. It sold more than a million copies and earned a spot as one of the top-5 best-selling Intellivision\u00ae games ever. The space-themed game has players using a laser cannon to destroy incoming meteors, bombs, and other targets.\n\nIn ASTROSMASH\u00ae you control a cannon weapon that can scroll left or right along a flat plane in order to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, large or small spinning bombs, and guided missiles, as well as a UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels. Low hills and stars are seen in the background.\n\nThere are many types of targets, each of which may move at a range of speeds. As the game advances, the range of speeds for each type of target increases.\n\nThe game has ten levels, each of which features different objects. Each level is represented by a different beautiful background and a different amazing background music. The sounds and background music are perfectly synchronized with the gameplay. This is a masterpiece compiled by famous game music composer Tommy Tallarico. He has won over 35 industry awards and has worked on more than 300 game titles.\n\nThe player has the option of firing single shots by pressing the fire buttons, or switching to automatic fire at a rate of multiple shots per second. The hyperspace option moves the cannon to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point.\n\nThis reimagined new ASTROSMASH\u00ae is much more exciting, more visually appealing, and a bit more challenging without straying from the game\u2019s original theme and gameplay. The new graphics are phenomenal and the amazing background music \u2013 composed by famous Tommy Tallarico \u2013 adds excitement to this video game classic. Plus, ASTROSMASH\u00ae now allows co-op and versus gameplay for up to four players! These players could play locally or online \u2013 even cross platform \u2013 with each other.\n\nSingle player mode\n- Co-op and versus mode\n- Local and online multiplayer modes up to 4 players (cross platform)\n- 10 different levels\n- Different kind of enemies like spaceships, asteroids, UFOs\n- Fantastic graphics\n- Superb sounds compiled by famous game music composer Tommy Tallarico\n- Keyboard and Joystick support\n\nAstrosmash\u00ae is a registered trademark of BBG Entertainment GmbH.
