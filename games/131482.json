You begin the game with five balls, and need to score as many points as possible by hitting the ball into the various bumpers and targets on the pinball table. The pinball table consists of three different screens, each with a different layout and level of difficulty. To advance from one screen to the next, you need to use a single ball to hit several targets and then get the ball into a white cup that appears. If you are on the second or third screen and the ball falls off the bottom, you will be back to the lower screen; if the ball falls off the bottom screen you will lose that ball. The game ends when all five balls have been lost.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball--6", "videos": [{"id": 49207, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "W_8u9l5i8zs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_8u9l5i8zs", "title": "Pinball for the Mattel Intellivision", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_8u9l5i8zs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
