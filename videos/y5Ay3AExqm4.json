This is part of the series of games they are working with: Miscellaneous Tales from the Pale Moon City. Playthrough contains both endings, with first one being early.\n\nOverall, I like this game. I like the two dudes' characterizations I guess for a game jam. It does provide enough to make me interested of any of them getting involved in the future games later on that they should ki- jk. Love the graphics as well, especially the fullscreen cgs/arts, it's so very cute. Overall, very nice. and makes me want to check their other games, that went under the radar. (maybe a fanart of the two, but who knows.) And about the little girl, and especially in the dev room, yeah it's understandable, still I think it also provided enough for the game jam. Overall, a good game.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5Ay3AExqm4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5Ay3AExqm4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5Ay3AExqm4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5Ay3AExqm4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y5Ay3AExqm4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Swap Jam #4: Key Game: What's in the-] Last Call Playthrough (No Commentary || Both Endings)", "description": "Game link: https://deepseahorror.itch.io/last-call\nCommentary Version: https://youtu.be/VgyktGtldoM\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 - intro plot and warning\n0:06 - clearer intro\n0:10 - gameplay\n\nLast Call, is a short RPG Maker horror game (lighter/tamer than usual one), made by Monty/Deepseahorror, where it's a story about two men meeting at the bar who played hide and seek with a little girl.
