On Halloween, no one ever comes to Plankton's Chum Bucket Halloween Bash. If he can't have his party, then no one can. He blocked all the streets of Bikini Bottom with his Plank-O-Lanterns. It's up to SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Squidward to bring the magic of Halloween back to Bikini Bottom by clearing its streets of Plankton's obstacles. In The game each tile is worth 50 points and every house surronded by your color is worth 100 points. You are competing against the other three characters, bomberman style to cover the most ground. If you win you get teh good ending of everyone gettting candy and Plankton having a change of heart. If you lose, you get the bad ending where Plankton's plan worked.\n\nHalloween Themed Games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBA7nqyBa-vxg0Uj3lwYchv923lZKGQYQ\nFlash Games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBA7nqyBa-vy9mA70UvCoKVC7cbRuPz1l\nSpongeBob Games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBA7nqyBa-vyWgcOy90usiBRQqnOypgW2\nNickelodeon Games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBA7nqyBa-vxOow29zh4FOkdcolLGaMOq\n\nTime Codes:\n0:09 - Story\n0:23 - How To Play\n0:41 - Level 1\n2:30 - Level 2\n4:18 - Level 3\n6:06 - Good Ending\n\n#spongebob #halloween #mutchgames #longplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/874rJ7UinVs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/874rJ7UinVs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/874rJ7UinVs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/874rJ7UinVs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/874rJ7UinVs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SpongeBob SquarePants: Boo or Boom [03] Flash Game Longplay", "description": "SpongeBob SquarePants: Boo or Boom is a 2007 action game based on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"Scaredy Pants\".
