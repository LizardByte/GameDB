Released in 2011, it is a side-scrolling action game with 2D visuals inspired by comic book art. Players control Thor as he battles through the Nine Realms using Mjolnir to unleash melee attacks, ranged lightning powers, and screen-clearing special moves.\n\nThis version focuses on platforming and combat, with a more streamlined experience compared to the 3D action of other platforms. It received relatively better reviews than the console versions, praised for its artistic style and more focused gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thor-god-of-thunder--1"}
