Together with allies, they navigate chaotic battlefields involving firearms, swordsmanship, and magic, aiming to rebuild their club crushed by conspiracy. Known for its setting where girls engage in deadly battles, high playability, and well-crafted background music.\n\nCharacters gain experience points through combat to acquire new skills. The game employs a multi-scenario system where outcomes vary based on strategic decisions and choices made during battles. Although criticized for modest production values, an abrupt mid-story ending, and a simplistic growth system resembling a prototype version, it featured diverse elements typical of doujinshi, such as variations in character dialogue and designs, and occasional single-image cut-ins. Notably, the game manual was integrated within the game rather than being a separate paper format. A commercialized version released as \"Metajo\" was released a year later with many mechanic and graphic improvements as well as story alterations such as allowing players to experience the 1200-year establishment until the end.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/furitsu-metatopology-daigaku-fuzoku-joshi-koukou", "collections": [{"id": 6973, "name": "Metajo"}]}
