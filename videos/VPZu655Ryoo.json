Creations, the Nightsithe. Your Character combats the Nightsithe using four floating mechanical hands that will let you wield four different guns at once, grab and throw enemies and physics objects, and can be used for ranged melee attacks. The gameplay and movement is very fast and chaotic, allowing the player to seamlessly switch between a third person mode and a top-down twinstick shooter mode.\n\nhttp://www.nelogame.com\n\nhttp://indiedb.com/games/nelo\n\nhttp://facebook.com/nelogame\n\nhttp://twitter.com/nelogame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VPZu655Ryoo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VPZu655Ryoo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VPZu655Ryoo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VPZu655Ryoo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VPZu655Ryoo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nelo Kickstarter Greenlight Trailer", "description": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magicandmirrors/nelo\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=625137572&tscn=1456489403\n\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/games/nelo/downloads/nelo-pre-alpha-demo-build-0000\n\n\nNelo Lets you play as a race of aliens who are at war against their A.I.
