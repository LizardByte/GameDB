It is also the highest airport with scheduled airline flights in the world.\n\nFlying into Lukla is dangerous and complex, even in perfect weather providing a challenge for even the most seasoned pilots. Pilots soon learn that anything you do at this altitude needs to be planned and considered. Landing on the uphill runway means you have to flare in a completely different way. Taking off from the very short runway may only be possible because the runway ends with a 3000 foot drop into the valley below, complete with waterfalls. Even taxiing is a complex process due to steep taxiways!\n\nTake your FSX: Steam Edition skills to new heights with Lukla X!", "summary": "Tenzing-Hillary Airport (better known as Lukla Airport), the gateway to Mount Everest, comes to life in this stunning airport and scenery pack.
