The table has a dish with a metallic lid on it. Occasionally, the dish is uncovered to reveal four apples or bombs. By pressing A, Kirby inhales the apples or bombs. Each apple gives the Kirby who inhaled and ate it one point, while any amount of bombs make the Kirby who inhaled it have to sit out for the next round. Whoever gets eight points first wins. If more than one Kirby presses A quickly, the four apples or bombs will be split between the Kirbys."}
