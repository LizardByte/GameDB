These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications and biotechnology, and many of these companies operate above the law. The world in between is where decadence, sex and pop culture mix with violent crime, extreme poverty and the unattainable promise of the American Dream. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw deeply embedded in the crime-ridden city of Night City, going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality.", "summary": "Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is an open-world RPG containing two powerful adventures: the base game of Cyberpunk 2077, taking place in the dark future of Night City, and Phantom Liberty, a spy-thriller story set in the walled-off district of Dogtown. Players take on the role of V, a cyber-enhanced mercenary, and embark on a fight for survival filled with story-defining decisions, action-packed gameplay, and unforgettable characters, including rockerboy Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) and FIA sleeper agent Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba).\n\nThis new release is the perfect way to experience every story of the dark future; it also contains the free Update 2.0, which overhauled many of the game\u2019s systems, introducing dynamic skill trees, high-octane vehicle combat, and enhanced enemy and police AI \u2014 as well as adding new weapons, vehicles, and clothes. The release is bolstered with a set of previously released digital goodies available as part of the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d program, available to all who register.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition", "videos": [{"id": 102820, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "7B4r1jbpS2A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B4r1jbpS2A", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 \u2014 Update 2.1 Overview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7B4r1jbpS2A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 103027, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "Ugb80d5lxEM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugb80d5lxEM", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition \u2014 Official Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ugb80d5lxEM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
