The game was later ported by Bits Studios and published by Irem to the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan in 1992.\n\nOutside of Japan, it later received a sequel titled GunForce II, originally known in Japan as Geo Storm.\n\nThe player is armed with a gun that fires rapid-fire bullets. Each direction it shoots can be fixed toward it so the player doesn't have to hold the joystick toward it. Players may find motorcycles to speed across enemy territory faster in addition to helicopters and cable cars. After scoring over any high score, whether they win or lose, players can enter their name into the high score list after the game over screen is \"achieved\". A strict time limit keeps the game going at a steady pace throughout; the consequence involves losing a life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gunforce", "videos": [{"id": 52714, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "arTnFx6P5HE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arTnFx6P5HE", "title": "SNES Longplay [266] GunForce", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/arTnFx6P5HE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
