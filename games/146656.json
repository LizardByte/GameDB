A special university was founded by the scientists, where researches in bio- and nano-technology were conducted. Since women dominated society during that time, they were the ones imbued with the powers of meta-topology. A series of conflicts between reactionary governments and the \"meta-women\", as they began calling themselves, continued thousands years into the future. Led by Mayumi Tanaka, president of the astronomy department, a group of young women tries to protect their existence using their remarkable powers.", "summary": "Metajo is a tactical role-playing game. The game consists of a series of large-scale battles, with cutscenes and dialogues advancing the story. The player controls a group of meta-women, navigating them over top-down battle area. The main characters are controlled by the players, while \"nameless\" units follow AI routines.
