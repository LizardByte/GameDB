Epyx has now introduced the events, which have been missed at Summer Games. Both games together now get a proper collection of sports, which you can play above all as party competition. In other sports games it was common to shake the joystick until it breaks. At Summer Games II the controls are better thought through and the joystick is only really strained in the discipline \"Cycling\".\n\nThe game is laid out for up to 8 players. The players get points for their reached ranks in each of the disciplines. For each gold medal you get 5 points, for each silver medal 3 points and one point for each bronze medal. The player with the most points wins the game.\n\nAn important alteration against the forerunner version is the menu point \"compete in some events\". With this it is possible to exclude unloved events. Furthermore, this sports game was expanded by a closing ceremony. \n--\nWant to support?
