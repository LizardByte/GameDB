Explore dense thickets and desolate fortresses in your quest, upgrading your gear and confronting more than 10 excruciatingly hard boss fights that will test your skills and require you to think on the go.\n\nWith bullet hell gameplay, you must master dodging and rolling skills and learn to use countless projectile types with different effects and properties to survive. In addition, you'll encounter various levels filled with loot, monsters, secrets, and eccentric companions, providing opportunities for exploration and discovery.\n\nThe game's complex combat and build system will require you to strategically choose from various characters, weapons, and artifacts to fight different builds. The mechanics of restoring stamina and mana will add an extra layer of challenge, keeping you on your toes during battles.\n\nIf you're up for the challenge, enter the world of Stillborn Slayer and become the hero who ends the Curse and saves the Dark Continent from the Horned God's reign.", "summary": "Stillborn Slayer is a beautifully crafted pixel-art bullet hell RPG game set in a cursed Dark Continent, with challenging boss fights, exploration, and complex combat.
