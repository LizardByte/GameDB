Quentin is portrayed in 3D, as are his enemies, but most of his world is in 2D (much like Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil). Unfortunately, the 3D polygon construction of the characters is hideous, though the backgrounds and cut scenes are well done. The first-person control scheme has promise, but suffers from multiple problems. If Quentin is attacked from behind, by the time he pivots, he's usually dead. Highlander is a mediocre game deserving of consideration from Highlander fans but, even considering the scarcity of Jaguar CD titles, probably best left alone by others."}
