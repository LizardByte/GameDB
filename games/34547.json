Yeah? Cause we\u2019re all outta gum... Luckily, there is no shortage of zombies, weapons and ammo in this damned city... Carnivore Land: come for the thrill stay for the kills!\n\nSomething smells rotten... it must be the zombies... oh yeah... there are zombies. Lot's of them... and bad guys that are trying to kill you... with guns, lots of guns... and cake, nope, scratch that, no cake (it\u2019s a lie)... just zombies that are going to have a party on your corpse if they catch you! So, in a way... you are the cake...\n\nAlong with your teammate, you are dropped into a city, that has been destroyed from the war, and are tasked with finding a mysterious package. But you'll have to deal with the residents first, which include meat eating infected and paramilitary soldiers that play lets-fill-them-up-with-lead a lot.\n\nWay after the zombie apocalypse and movie cliches, the war between humans and the infected has ended. Humanity now lives in safezones, while the rest of the world is filled with quarantined cities, mausoleums to the old society before the war, occupied only by paramilitary groups and zombies. Everything outside the safezones either wants to add you to his caloric intake or practice his marksmanship skills on your bloody corpse, hence the nickname of the world, Carnivore Land.", "summary": "Carnivore Land is a 3D top-down shooter. The game flirts with the comedic horror genre and features fast paced action, tons of weapons to use and enemies to shoot. To help in your struggle against the hordes of the undead and enemy soldiers, you are equipped with your standard issued rifle and pistol. So, wear your helmet (or bucket), pick up your rifle (or boomstick) and try not to become a permanent citizen of Carnivore Land.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
