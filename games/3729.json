A beauty that King Dedede cannot abide with. Jealous of the sky's wondrous splendor, King Dedede has acquired a tool that will let him steal the night's stars, plunging the world into eternal drab daylight. When Kirby awoke, he found that it was still daytime. And evermore, it would be daytime, unless Kirby made the journey to find King Dedede and recover the stars to restore the night's sky. So begins the latest Kirby adventure, another action adventure with the morphing marshmallow in a starnge fantasy world. However, the one thing separating this latest adventure is the control scheme. Here, you don't control Kirby directly. Instead, you guide Kirby by tipping your system to roll the little round pink puff through a series of mazes. If you get in a jam you can make Kirby jump by a controller press, and Kirby can still acquire weapons from other enemies, but the real skill is using the tilting to your advantage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kirby-tilt-n-tumble", "videos": [{"id": 62515, "name": "TV commercial", "video_id": "t2BPoSS32J0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2BPoSS32J0", "title": "COMMERCIAL:  Kirby Tilt 'n Tumble", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t2BPoSS32J0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
