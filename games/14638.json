All the enemies launch missiles or mines at the boat which can be dodged by moving left or right. Water bombs can be dropped to get rid of the enemies - but there are only eight available which slowly refill over time.\n\nSometimes a helicopter drops crates which include useful extras like smart bombs, steering rockets or additional speed. The ship can also turn into a submarine to collect things under the water. Every screen has a different objective, e.g. collecting an orb, bombing an underwater station or destroying a powerful ship.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
