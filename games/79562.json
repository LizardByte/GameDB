It was silently cancelled after the publisher, Strategy First, dropped the game and the developer was unable to find another publisher. News about the game was removed from the publisher's site after it missed its release window and included their other DS projects for Jagged Alliance and Disciples II.\n\nWarlords DS is an eight player turn-based strategy game of conquest and empire. Different worlds provide a stage for the player to excel in combat. In the quest for final victory, gamers can assemble vast armies, conquer and loot mighty cities, undertake perilous quests, make and break alliances, and wield magical artifacts of great power. Although economics, diplomacy, and exploration weigh heavily in the outcome of each game, the primary emphasis is placed on combat.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warlords-ds"}
