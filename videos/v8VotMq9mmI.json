This pack also includes old art stuff from menus huds, old ingame huds screens and old gameplay screens. Warning: these dev maps still have bugs and badly designed, so that's why they didn't get to final release. This GenEvo History artifact has been made just for nostalgia. Anyway every map is playable and you can still have fun playing it.\n\n\nJoin our official discord server: https://discord.gg/wnmRFypsRp\nSupport sgor00 on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sgor00", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8VotMq9mmI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8VotMq9mmI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8VotMq9mmI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8VotMq9mmI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8VotMq9mmI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[ Generals : Evolution ] Dev History Map Pack", "description": "DOWNLOAD LINK AND INFO : https://www.patreon.com/posts/generals-dev-map-50377866?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=postshare\n\nThis is old Generals Evolution map pack from 2013-2017 GenEvo dev builds + bonus RC 1 Crisis on the Coast mission remastered for actual GenEvo 0.21.
