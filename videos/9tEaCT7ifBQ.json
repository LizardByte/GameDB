I have been a fan of Arin antics ever since, at first with Jon Tron and currently with Dan. In fact, it was Dan's innocent remark about wanting DLC for \"Kirby's Dreamc Course\" that got a bunch of fans on their way to release this fantastic ROM hack: \"Grumps Dream Course\"! This two player only hack adds over 150 all new levels (with 64 of them properly tested!) featuring music from the show and even replacing Kirby with Arin and Dan grumpier version, along with several nods to the Game Grumps YouTube series. It's amazing work, coordinated by project lead Mowsechao and if you have a friend who love \"Kirby's Dream Course\", this hack is for you.
