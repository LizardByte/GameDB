The Global Risk team is led by Major Cavanaugh and consists of Captain Hall, Specialist Randall, and Private First Class Moralez. The team assault an abandoned hotel where Steiner is supposedly staying but soon find out they've instead killed Steiner's body double. Although the team manage to fight their way out of the hotel, Cavanaugh and Hall deduce that they were set up as Black List was well prepared for their arrival. Cavanaugh is shot shortly afterwards and Hall is knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant. While unconscious, Hall has an unsettling vision of being in his own house through the eyes of someone else. Hall is soon reawakened by Moralez and takes command of the team.", "summary": "CrossfireX delivers an intense first-person shooter experience where players are immersed in a sprawling global conflict between the world\u2019s two most formidable private military factions: Global Risk employs veterans of powerful armed forces who use advanced technologies to fight for order and security; Black List employs hardened mercenaries trained in guerilla tactics who fight to destabilize oppressive regimes in the name of freedom.
