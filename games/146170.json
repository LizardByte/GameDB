Similarly to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, travelling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-iii--2", "videos": [{"id": 87936, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "d15qmRzn2Pc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d15qmRzn2Pc", "title": "Final Fantasy III - Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d15qmRzn2Pc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 87937, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gt5l5cG2E08", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt5l5cG2E08", "title": "Final Fantasy III (SNES) Playthrough [1 of 2] - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gt5l5cG2E08/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 39, "name": "Final Fantasy"}]}
