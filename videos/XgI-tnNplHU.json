{"id": "XgI-tnNplHU", "snippet": {"title": "Zelenhgorm (2002) PC FMV game intro", "description": "Zelenhgorm: Episode I: The Ship Great aka  Land of the Blue Moon was conceived as the first episode of an adventure game series. Three more episodes were planned, but never released.\n\nZelenhgorm is a fantasy continent with earth-like qualities. The player meets and learns about the Deyrec people whose clothes, dwellings and environment are decidedly early Scandinavian. Embedded in this civilization are superstition, folk-lore and magic as well as science.\n\nThe player controls Arrikk Vaheirr, a young man who lives in the fishing village of Senava and invents odd machines in his garden. One day, two strange things happen to upset the daily routine - a giant ship runs aground on the river bank near Arrikk's garden ... and the dormant lighthouse begins to shine again. Arrikk's quest to discover the mysteries of the great ship, and the truths behind his haunting dreams, begins.\n\nThe game is played from first-person perspective; even though it utilizes pre-rendered backgrounds, the scenery incorporates characters going about their daily lives. Even if the player cannot interact with an onscreen character, they react as Arrikk passes by. The view switches to third person only when the main character changes locations, or during special video sequences.\n\nOver 140 live actors form the cast, among those some who participated in the Star Wars movies. Using full-motion video, the game has 360 degree panoramic views. All actions are controlled completely with a mouse, with the exception of using the ESC keyboard key to call up the main menu. Drop down menus appear when talking to the numerous characters. Open and close the bottom-screen inventory window by right-clicking and left-clicking, respectively. Objects in inventory can also be combined which is necessary for solving some of the game's many puzzles.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XgI-tnNplHU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XgI-tnNplHU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XgI-tnNplHU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Zelenhgorm (2002) PC FMV game intro", "description": "Zelenhgorm: Episode I: The Ship Great aka  Land of the Blue Moon was conceived as the first episode of an adventure game series.
