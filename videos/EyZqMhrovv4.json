It was originally released on September 23, 2008 as part of Windows Ultimate Extras, and contained 60 levels including a 20-level tutorial. A free map editor (level builder) was also released, however it is not compatible with the Games for Windows \u2013 Live version of Tinker.\n\nOn December 15, 2009, an expanded Live-enabled version of the game was released on the Games for Windows \u2013 Live client. The game is available for Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, including users who do not have access to Windows Vista Ultimate Extras in other Windows Vista editions, and contains 160 levels including the tutorial. This version also has 15 Achievements worth 200G, similar to many Xbox Live Arcade games. \n\nTinker is a spatial/environmental puzzle game. Players must guide a robot to an end point by moving objects, activating switches, and traversing obstacles. The playing field is a square board divided into a checkerboard pattern. The robot is given a limited number of moves it can make before it runs out of energy, so the player must guide it to the goal marker without expiring all their motions. Essentially any action the robot makes counts as a move, including taking a step, activating a switch, and turning around. Players must carefully plan their actions through a stage so as not to waste moves. Players can replenish the robot's energy by collecting batteries and thus extend the possible number of moves they are allowed to make. Players can earn an achievement star for a level by completing the course on or under par for time, energy, and cog collection, should any cogs exist on that level.\n\nThe robot can be destroyed or rendered inoperable by being hit by a laser beam, falling from a height greater than two blocks, or running out of energy. If any of the hazards destroy the robot in the process of reaching the exit (e.g., the robot walks into a laser beam which crosses through the exit square), the hazard trumps the exit and the robot is destroyed; however, the level will be completed if the exit is reached with zero energy.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EyZqMhrovv4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EyZqMhrovv4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EyZqMhrovv4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EyZqMhrovv4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EyZqMhrovv4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Microsoft Tinker Games for Windows Live Trailer (2009, Microsoft)", "description": "Tinker, also known as Microsoft Tinker, is a puzzle video game developed by Fuel Industries in which the player controls a robot through various mazes and obstacle courses.
