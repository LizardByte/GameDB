This was one of the first ever C64 games I recorded, so I thought it was time to create a QHD version.\n\nA day in the life of a park ranger is anything but simple.\n\nNot only must you pick up all the trash left lying around by messy campers, you also need to play lifeguard, rescuing hapless swimmers from the turbulent undercurrents.\n\nOf course, playing the hero is hungry work, and you'd enjoy chowing down on some sustaining tucker, were it not for those bloody annoying ants that keep sneaking into your hut to raid the fridge! A swift boot up the backside will see them off, but they don't stay gone for long!\n\nThere are some impressive technical features here too, such as parallax scrolling.  It adds a real sense of perspective to the game, and the ripple effects are some, but entirely convincing.\n\nThe game has no ending, so I included each of the levels once, grew the mysterious plant robots fullest extent, and got a spot of log-rolling in for good measure.\n\n\n#c64\n#retrogaming\n#parkpatrol", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBpwfoDA-cs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBpwfoDA-cs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBpwfoDA-cs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBpwfoDA-cs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RBpwfoDA-cs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Park Patrol Longplay (C64) [QHD]", "description": "Follow me on Twitter @ https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nGet Great Retro Scene News @ http://www.vintageisthenewold.com\nDeveloped by Tony Ngo and published by Activision in 1984\n\nIt might be old, but Park Patrol is still a classic.
