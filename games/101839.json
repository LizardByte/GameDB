Drink a cup of coffee. Close the curtains and go to bed. The days change, but the ritual does not. \n \nThis is a short game, taking typically less than 10 minutes to complete. The days do not loop even though it appears so at first glance - each day is different and you'll miss out on some interesting scenes if you only play first day! \n \nQuotidian was made for Global Game Jam 2016. The game was made entirely in 48 hours, with the theme of 'Ritual.'"}
