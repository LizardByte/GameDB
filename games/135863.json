You are a spikey-headed cyber-shield guy (with a cyber-shield) trying to block \"perplexing 3D geometric attacks\" that come flipping toward you. If you hit them, they bounce back. The object of the game is to try to hit Vector Strong Bad's head until it disappears. The game's graphical style appears to be a reference to Nintendo's ill-fated 3D system, the Virtual Boy. The graphics of the console were well-known for solely consisting of the colors red and black, much like those in StrongBadZone. In particular, the game stylistically resembles the Virtual Boy vector game Red Alarm, which at one point also features a large face that must be destroyed.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/strongbadzone"}
