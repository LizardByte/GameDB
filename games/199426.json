The first version mirrors the original arcade game, where the objective is to guide five frogs, one at a time, across a bustling street and a river to reach their designated homes safely. The second version is an enhanced edition, incorporating newer levels. Some levels consist of only two segments of river or road, while others present a single extensive stretch of road without a designated safe zone in the centre. Additionally, Game.com allows up to four players to participate, taking turns during gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frogger--5"}
