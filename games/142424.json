Deep outside the boundaries of known space, alien mines are protected. But not from you. Take cargo, blast star jewel;s from asteroids, and steal energy from the mines. Now we are the invaders...\n\nYou are piloting a Zeus class star mining ship through alien mines in deep space. The mines contain worm holes where the inhabitants of the mine enter and exit. Its floor and ceiling are protected by a laser energy grid within which the asteroids float endlessly.\n\nThe mines contain reserves of shield energy in the form of blue quantum-magneto-resonance cubes and amber spherical plasma that can increase the strength of your weapon if collected.\n\nSome mines also contain hyper drive energy, which you may require from time to time. Beware of the attractor fields powered by the mines energy grid. Avoid the lightening conductors which form part of the grid.\n\nSteal from the alien mines, so the federation may survive ... at least just a little longer...", "summary": "Star Mine is a 3D first person perspective space shoot 'em up.
