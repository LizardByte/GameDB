After a traumatic childhood and a tough entry into the world of adulthood, she was just starting to take control of her life. However, she is now up against an insidious enemy who threatens to take everything away from her. During what may be her final hours, Beth wanders through important moments in her life while also staying a few steps ahead of the monster who won\u2019t rest until she is no more.\n\nMazes in dreams are said to symbolize the dreamer\u2019s feeling of \u201cbeing trapped.\u201d As Beth tries to find meaning and strength in her life, players must guide her through a variety of mazes, each with its own twist. The most challenging sections are reserved for confrontations with the monster, who must be outmaneuvered and outwitted to proceed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/labyrinthine-dreams"}
