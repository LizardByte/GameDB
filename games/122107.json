There are various abilities which will help you fight the different types of ships. You can think of it as a 3D bullet hell game, but instead of shooting, you reflect bullets back at your enemies. \n \nFight for your reputation as a worthy defender and measure your skills against others! Each destroyed spaceship grants you points, depending on how powerful it is. Ultimately, your goal is to survive for as long as possible and reach the highest score you can. Your high score is uploaded to a global leaderboard, which can be seen in the game and on the official Skyrift website. \n \nSkyrift features a customization system, which allows you to change the appearance of your player and the different spaceships. Every achievement you unlock, activates a new color, which can be assigned to the different models.", "summary": "Deflect projectiles. Destroy spaceships. Crack the high score.
