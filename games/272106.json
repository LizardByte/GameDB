Escaping through the small hatch in the side of the cockpit and falling towards a lake, Duke now finds himself in front of an old forgotten house. Whilst it is overgrown and looks abandoned he can't shake the feeling that someone is watching him from behind those dark windows. The bushes too thick to pass and the door surely jammed, the only way in is through the basement but it quickly becomes clear that something is very wrong here.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dimension-shift--1"}
