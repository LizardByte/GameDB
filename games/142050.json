You take the role of a nameless man, a sort of wandering healer. The kind of healer who dabbles in his own medicines way too often and burns down entire towns to stop infections from spreading. Exactly what a situation like this needs. He has now entered the great city, making the first INCISION, and entering the heart of the spreading sickness.", "summary": "Incision offers an experience that demands skill and focus from its player, and rewards them with intense carnage that will paint the town red. Yours is a simple job. Cut, shoot, burn and decimate it all to stop the spread of the Growth. Mercy is weakness. Hesitation is death.\nIncision is designed to be merciless in its difficulty, but the player will never feel weak in the face of danger. Your arsenal is varied, powerful, loud, and will easily turn enemies into sticky red puddles, as long as they don't first do it to you. Movement is fast and responsive; story never gets in the way of the gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 74266, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "z_ggVUkHWFA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_ggVUkHWFA", "title": "INCISION - Realms Deep 2021 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_ggVUkHWFA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 74267, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "OsxjmKPYDOc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsxjmKPYDOc", "title": "INCISION December Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OsxjmKPYDOc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
