Theyre the ideal standard size measurement Ive found for this format; they may look big, but its the definitive standard. If it is different from this pattern, they lose the property of voxels when very small, or when very large they lose the objects personality.\n\nBecause of this new format(voxels animados), it is different from high poly, low poly, pixels (low resolution) and HD (high resolution pixels) graphics.
