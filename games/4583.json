Dangerous traps and even more dangerous enemies await Zapper. It will take fast-footed skill and timing to conquer all the worlds and survive the final showdown with the magpie queen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zapper-one-wicked-cricket", "videos": [{"id": 36292, "name": "Demo Trailer", "video_id": "JHUeQnECuZs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHUeQnECuZs", "title": "Zapper: One Wicked Cricket - Demo Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JHUeQnECuZs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36295, "name": "Trailer (German)", "video_id": "KnClP7D3cxU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnClP7D3cxU", "title": "Zapper: One Wicked Cricket!
