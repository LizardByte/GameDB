The game is a take on the seventh generation era \"console war\" among the three major consoles: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii. It was shown at a closed door event during the Game Developers Conference 2010 on March 2010 in San Francisco. The game was released on August 19, 2010 in Japan, in North America on February 15, 2011, in Europe on March 4, 2011, and in Australia on March 31, 2011. A television anime series adaptation, titled Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation, began airing in July 2013.\n\nThis game is in essence a story-based adventure game, in the sense that much of the game is spent reading the on-screen text, as in a visual novel. However, the game also features 3D-style dungeon exploration, similar to recent Final Fantasy titles. Like most JRPGs, the dungeons feature random encounters, treasure chests, and various obstacles. These obstacles can be cleared by utilizing the various unique dungeon skills each character of Neptune's party has.\nDuring battle, the current turn for characters and enemies are displayed at the top right, as well as upcoming turns. When it is Neptune's turn or any other supporting character's turn, they are given a set amount of AP (Ability Points), which determines how many moves they can make. Each different move consumes a set amount of AP. There is a Sword move, which has the character slash an enemy with their weapon, a Gun move, which has the character shoot the enemy with their weapon (or in Neptune and IF's case, a gun), a Physical move, which has the character go straight up to an enemy and punch and kick them, and the Defend command, which consumes no AP, but puts the character in a defending state and ends their turn.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svPheB4ex1M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svPheB4ex1M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svPheB4ex1M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svPheB4ex1M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svPheB4ex1M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hyperdimension Neptunia\u2122 Victory Official English Trailer V.2", "description": "In this latest installment of the popular Hyperdimension Neptunia series, Neptune reprises her role as the self-aware main character and meets characters new and old after getting transported back to the '80s version of Gamindustri.
