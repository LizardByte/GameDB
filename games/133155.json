It's a horror, story-driven farming simulator where the gods are asking you for their harvest offering. Your dad is telling you white lies, but it feels like it's more than that. As you become more adventurous and explore the island more, things become more strange like finding a vending machine in a hidden room beneath the beach. The island may seem welcoming... at least at first, but your curious itch tells you otherwise as you start to question the reason why your on this remote island.\n\nVenture out further and you'll be lost in its maze-like forests, beaches that have tides that impact your gameplay, caves that send chills down your spine, and much much darker themed environments like an abandoned mine. Bolstered by its cute and cozy art style (But don't be fooled), Harvest Island is all about exploration and farming. Befriend animals along the way, but don't explore too far out. It's safer to play around the farm than to discover the secrets and mysteries of Harvest Island.\n\nA land full of lies awaits for you to explore...", "summary": "Living with your family on a remote island, you discover a sinister purpose of your existence.
