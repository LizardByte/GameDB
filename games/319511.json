A delicious profit surely awaits!\n\nAim for the door (a dot!) in each room. Water rises incessantly, filling the house; languish for too long and you'll drown. There are five floors in the building; played on difficulty setting A (advanced), after every four rooms you'll escape to the next floor and the water level will drop a bit, bestowing some much-needed breath-related respite. Playing on difficulty setting B (beginner), the water level resets on each screen.\n\nLeft and right does what you'd expect. When you're not submerged, the fire button will let you jump. When underwater, you'll start to run out of breath, so repeatedly hammer the fire button to swim up. When you reach the surface either jump out to land on a platform, or slowly pulse the fire button to bob on the top of the water. When you leave the water your lungs will return to fine fettle.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-wicked-father"}
