The game features 20 customizable gameplay classes, six of which are new to the franchise, and they are classified into three groups: attackers, defenders, or support. Each camp also has a new team play class that allows players of the same class to combine forms when they fight against enemies. Players can compete against each other in various competitive multiplayer modes, including the objective-based Turf War mode and the team deathmatch variant Team Vanquish. The game also features several player-versus-environment open zones which allowed players to explore, find collectibles, and complete quests. Split-screen local multiplayer is also available for all gameplay mode", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 33539, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "e_JSp0F6PX8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_JSp0F6PX8", "title": "Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville\u2122 Official Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_JSp0F6PX8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 33540, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RwYjx4VPzx0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwYjx4VPzx0", "title": "Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville\u2122 Official Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RwYjx4VPzx0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 33541, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "m-OkzvkWeqw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-OkzvkWeqw", "title": "Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville - New Festival Content Trailer ft.
