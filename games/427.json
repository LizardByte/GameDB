Apathetic to the cause, Cloud initially fights for personal gain, and for the promise he made to childhood friend Tifa Lockhart.

The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills.\n\nThough minigames had been a recurring feature, FFVII introduces numerous new ones, many of them playable in the theme park Gold Saucer varying from racing with Chocobos to snowboarding.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-vii", "videos": [{"id": 232, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oRanxri0sYs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRanxri0sYs", "title": "Final Fantasy VII / 7 official trailer 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oRanxri0sYs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 48712, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "jNQfY3G35y0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQfY3G35y0", "title": "Inside FINAL FANTASY VII (Closed Captions)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jNQfY3G35y0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 71393, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "h0mqRkhOvtY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0mqRkhOvtY", "title": "Final Fantasy VII (PS1) Playthrough [1 of 3] - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0mqRkhOvtY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
