It was published in Japan for the Famicom in 1988. It is the first of the series of baseball games that was informally known as \"Harisuta\", which saw four games published for the Famicom, and two more for the Super Famicom. The starting entry contains 13 teams, 12 of which are modeled after real Japanese teams, while a 13th team (the I team) consists of a team of women players who represent various idols or models who were popular at the time. The game features a single player mode against the computer, a head-to-head mode for two players, or a home run mode where you compete to see who can hit the most home runs. Before the end of 1988, a version of the same game was released with an updated player roster, under the title Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium '88 Senshuu Shin Data.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kyuukyoku-harikiri-stadium"}
