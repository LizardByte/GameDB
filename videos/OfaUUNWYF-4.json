You do this by affecting the story itself as you review and edit letters, solve puzzles and immerse yourself in the cast\u2019s different stories and fates.\n\nWILL: A Wonderful World features a fantastical tale and cast. A quiet nerd stuck in a hopeless, one-sided crush. An impoverished artist who\u2019s lost all hope and contemplates suicide. A rookie police officer who burns with justice and hopes for his first big case. A young woman desperately chasing her dream against all odds. Even a stray cat who would be satisfied with some dried fish to eat!\n\nDive deep into the story and learn about those that seek out your help, but remember: Changing someone\u2019s fate will affect others. Experience each story, edit letters, and solve puzzles; perhaps the young girl\u2019s memory will return, but what will she learn about herself and her mission?
