When talking about the history of RPGs, you can\u2019t leave this one out - it\u2019s a must-play!\n\nA side-view action RPG released by Nihon Falcom in 1985, the player takes on the role of an adventurer to explore a total of 10 stages and ultimately defeat the King Dragon. Stores are placed on the map and monsters roam the streets, but monsters are finite and cease to appear once they are hunted down.\n\nCombat uses a symbol-encounting system. When you come in contact with an enemy, the battle scene switches to the battlefield, where you fight using weapon attacks (body blows) and magic. Treasure chests appear when enemies are defeated, and items and money can be acquired.\n\nIn this game, the player character does not have a profession, but has two types of experience and levels: warrior and wizard, and can grow into either a warrior or wizard type depending on which type of character is used to defeat enemies. Weapons, armor, and magic also have experience values, and using the same items can result in increased effectiveness.\n\nWith domestic sales of 400,000 units (Japan), this PC game from the 1980s still holds a record that remains unbroken. It's difficult to find another title that truly embodies the term 'epoch-making' as well as this one!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eggconsole-xanadu-pc-8801mkiisr", "videos": [{"id": 105101, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rYT41ig1Hys", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYT41ig1Hys", "title": "EGG\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb \u30b6\u30ca\u30c9\u30a5 PC-8801mkIISR for Nintendo Switch\uff08EGGCONSOLE XANADU PC-8801mkIISR\uff09", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rYT41ig1Hys/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1463, "name": "Xanadu"}]}
