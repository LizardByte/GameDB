You must deal with every aspect of being an arena manager, from the basics of training your warriors (and perhaps even enhancing their performance with body-altering potions) to disease and injury. Warriors age over time, and they even run the risk of getting in trouble outside the arena. Coliseum also features thousands of fighter combinations; uniquely generated news stories, injuries, and diseases; potion and spell effects; and a blow-by-blow combat system to ensure that each game is different.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/coliseum--1"}
