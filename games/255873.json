The success or failure of completing these quick-time events will determine the set of animation you will receive, which will either depict Hayate delving further into the castle or humorously being squished between a wall of spikes. The player earns a score for how well they can run through each level and time the button presses.\n\nIf players were able to master the game and complete the game on hard mode, the publisher Renovation Products, Inc. would supply the player with a \"Master of Ninja Arts\" degree.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/revenge-of-the-ninja-hd-remaster"}
