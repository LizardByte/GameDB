Explore a dangerous, minimalist world, armed with simple two button controls: tap a button to change direction by 90 degrees, and hold down a button to unleash a cathartic dash forward. That\u2019s all you need to solve environmental puzzles and labyrinthine levels. Around each corner is a new challenge that will test your two-button and problem-solving skills. A variety of difficult enemies and bosses help you mark your time as you navigate through 30 levels spread across four worlds.\n\nA cerebral puzzler lies within the heart of this indie twist on Pong.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/qomp-2", "videos": [{"id": 96737, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "tah154H6i1o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tah154H6i1o", "title": "qomp2  -  Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tah154H6i1o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
