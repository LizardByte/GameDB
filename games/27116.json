When you crash-land on an alien planet your ship is almost completely destroyed.

On your journey you encounter ANI, a small, stranded service unit who identifies as female. ANI is the first to admit she\u2019s a bit mad, but she is also a valuable resource, and it soon becomes clear that there will be no escape without her.\n\nAnd so, the two of you begin a journey that neither of you is prepared for, on a planet where even the laws of nature seem not to apply. A journey in which ION and ANI must face the strangest of all possible challenges if they are to have any hope of living to tell their own story.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phoning-home", "videos": [{"id": 12077, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lGcaH0T1np4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGcaH0T1np4", "title": "Phoning Home - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lGcaH0T1np4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12078, "name": "Exploration Teaser", "video_id": "9AEWKg0SpJ4"}, {"id": 12080, "name": "Gameplay Teaser", "video_id": "4wUYlh9KB00"}, {"id": 12079, "name": "Planet Teaser", "video_id": "eTrBrvgV-eg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTrBrvgV-eg", "title": "Phoning Home - Planet Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eTrBrvgV-eg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
