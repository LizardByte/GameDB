THREE COUNT 'EM THREE FRIENDS) and whooping all their asses, even with that, we all had fun.  The only thing I didn't like about HL2 was that 1.) I was the only kid in the county who had it :p 2.) HL2:DM sucked in comparison to Halo 2's multiplayer.  it was a more visceral and violent expierience, but HL2 will always have a better story.  Just please stop the fighting :3", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKA7JkV51Jw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKA7JkV51Jw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKA7JkV51Jw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Half Life 2 Trailer", "description": "The Original Half Life 2 trailer\r\n\r\nJUNE 17th 2008\r\nthis is probably my oldest video from when I was like 12, man things have changed, but reading the comments here is my two cents\r\n\r\nJust to let you guys know, you guys the ones talking about how halo sucks; halo 3 sucked, it flat out sucked there is no go away from that.
