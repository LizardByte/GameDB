This phase is crucial, as you must memorize the layout of objects, the lighting, the sounds of the environment, and the objects you can interact with.\n\nWhen an anomaly is suspected, you must use your phone to take a photo of it and report it to your boss. For this, you will need Wi-Fi, which will force you to leave the storage room. As the game progresses, unexpected events will complicate your task. Each found anomaly earns you $10. You can choose to save this money to end the game when you reach $100 or spend it on upgrades that will help you search for anomalies.", "summary": "Storage Anomaly is a memory and puzzle game in which you have to identify anomalies in a dark and spooky storage room using your phone, while overcoming unexpected challenges.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/storage-anomaly"}
