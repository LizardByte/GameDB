This research will help train the Combine soldiers to fight more effectively against the rebels.\n\nWhilst you hate the idea of helping the Combine you have been told that your family will receive extra rations; water, rice and cake for example. Of course this may be a lie but you do not really have much choice as refusal to participate will result in your immediate death.", "summary": "This mod started from a chat session about learning to map and ways of improving.\n\nThe idea is to allow maps that are not normally released to be part of something bigger and that keeps growing.\n\nIt was original conceived for Half-Life 2 / Orange Box but could easily be extended to other single player games.\n\nIn retrospect it is clear that HoloReality was influenced by a Half-Life mod called Project Quantum Leap and Portal, although at the time of concept it didn\u2019t seem that way.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/holoreality"}
