Taking place on the planet gloria, a newly colonised planet with a manner of living similar to that of the american west, the player fights to defend settlers from airborne pirates, many of which are shaped after guns of the old west. Guns and bombs are levelled-up and collected by dropped power-ups, which are money-themed, with the gun upgrades shown as American dimes and bombs as gold bars.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gun-and-frontier", "videos": [{"id": 31588, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "-ZY_-5GWZsk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZY_-5GWZsk", "title": "Arcade Longplay [493] Gun Frontier", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZY_-5GWZsk/sddefault.jpg"}]}
