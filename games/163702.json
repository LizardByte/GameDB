Nicolae, Andreea's father, was screaming in despair in front of his tavern. Everyone ran to see what had happened. Joining the crowd was Teodor, a brave man, known as a collector of legends and superstitions. Nicolae leads Teodor to the room of the young Andreea, who was lying on the floor, white as snow, her purple lips looking like violets. Teodor examines her and gives Nicolae the news: she is under some kind of spell. At this moment, Ecaterina, a beautiful woman, Petru's mother and Theodor's wife, appears.\nEcaterina is distraught to see Andreea and runs to embrace her. In the corner of the door, little Petru just observes everything. A few minutes later, everyone is around Andreea, who is lying on the bed. Ecaterina tries to hold back her tears, while Teodor explains to Nicolae that for a long time he has been chasing a creature that takes people's lives, making them servants, practically slaves. Nicolae doesn't understand, until Teodor shows him a bite mark on Andreea's neck.\n\nEcaterina yells at Teodor that it's his fault, that the Dark Count bit Andreea to get revenge for Teodor's relentless, practically obsessive hunting. Teodor exclaims that they are wasting their time. Destroying the Dark Count, Vlad Tepes, before dawn is the only way to save Andreea. The hitherto quiet Petru asks everyone what they are waiting for. And so they set off, revealing a great secret.", "summary": "Vampiromania is a game that mixes action and role-playing, where the player controls 3 characters individually - Teodor, Petru and Ecaterina - who possess different characteristics.
