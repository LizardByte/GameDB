The re-release of this team-based multiplayer warfare shooter was developed by what was left of Wing Simulations along with the new development team Project-Z development. The name S\u00f6ldner was completely dropped to avoid associations with the original game, which was not received well by the press.\n\nOwners of this version can play against any S\u00f6ldner player, even if they don't have the expansion pack, as long as all the patches are applied. This version of the game has been patched up to v33671. A notable change is that for the North American release, the AGS (Advanced Gestures System) was altered to remove swearing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/semper-fidelis-marine-corps"}
