{"id": "1_8QuOWJ-kE", "snippet": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [263] Lemmings 2: The Tribes (Prototype)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nLemmings 2: The Tribes is a puzzle video game released in 1993, it is a sequel to Lemmings. As with the original, it was developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis. The gameplay remains mostly the same as the original game, requiring the player to lead a certain number of Lemmings to their exit by giving them the appropriate \"skills\". Ports to the Master System, Game Gear and Game Boy were completed but never released commercially.\n\nA new fast forward button and fan button have been added to the controls. The fast forward replaces the release rate button in the original game, which would let the player release Lemmings faster. The fan button is used to push around any flying Lemmings.\n\nEach Lemming tribe uses their own set of skills. The Classic tribe uses the same skills as the original game, while the rest add skills of their own flavor.\n\nThis port is very good, but it has fewer skills than the original. There are also no traps (except for slippery ice). Each tribe has only 8 Lemmings instead of 60. Also, the Fan is used differently here: instead of affecting Lemmings depending on the distance and position of the Fan relative to Lemmings, it just creates wind in the entire level, and direction of the wind is decided by D-pad movement while holding the action button.\n\nAll Lemmings were saved. After completing the game, I show starting credits and then I show extra animations, screens and sounds. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1_8QuOWJ-kE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1_8QuOWJ-kE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1_8QuOWJ-kE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [263] Lemmings 2: The Tribes (Prototype)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nLemmings 2: The Tribes is a puzzle video game released in 1993, it is a sequel to Lemmings.
