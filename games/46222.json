The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 23115, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "zpRkV6GO-48", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpRkV6GO-48", "title": "Mega Drive Longplay [384] Devilish: The Next Possession", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zpRkV6GO-48/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
