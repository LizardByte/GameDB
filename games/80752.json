While this is not the first Meitantei Conan game to be released, it is the first of many such adventure games on consoles. The game contains two original new cases which can be played in any order and contains anime style opening movies for each of the cases. The game uses top-down perspective with artwork showing side view to achieve bird's perspective presentation. In both episodes, the player directly controls Conan which can move up, down, left, or right, and can talk to other characters or interact with current locations and on-screen objects. As the case story progresses, many puzzle oriented mini-games will also become available.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/detective-conan"}
