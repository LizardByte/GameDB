Welcome to our game. \nIn this game, you decide the rules. \nAnd before we start any game, we need to know How to Win. \n \nMaybe we win by Making the Most Money? Maybe we win if we Slay the Dragon? \nOr maybe it\u2019s by doing something we haven\u2019t even thought of yet. \nLet\u2019s decide together. \n \n\u2018How to Win\u2019 is a new episodic online game made in collaboration with you, the player. \nEach new episode will be created in response to your suggestions which are voted for by the public. \n \nGive us your ideas, vote on your favourites, shape or derail the future of our story. \nCan we find a way that everyone can win?", "summary": "How to Win is an online adventure game where the story is controlled by player\u2019s suggestions and votes. Whatever you decide, that\u2019s what happens next. \n \nCreated by multi-award winning UK theatre company Hidden Track, and commissioned by Harrogate Theatre as one of Manchester HOME\u2019s HOMEMakers commissions, How to Win tries to capture the frenetic energy of a live performance within an adventure game where the ideas of a few can affect the story for everyone. \n \nNew chapters are being made and released throughout Summer 2020. \n \nCreated in Unity, and designed to be played in-browser, players make a series of moral and dialogue choices within each chapter, before being presented a larger question at the end of each chapter, asking what should happen next in the story. \n \nPlayers are then invited to send in their own suggestions for the next chapter via an online form, and a selection of those suggestions are put to a live public vote. \n \nThe winning selection then becomes the main subject of the next chapter to be released, while alternative suggestions that did not win the vote still feature in the game, but in a smaller way. \n \nThe game plays largely like a visual novel, with occasional extra gameplay elements and minigames taking inspiration from various genres including clicker games, tycoon games, and RPGs.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/how-to-win", "videos": [{"id": 39041, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4zfTyVrutco", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zfTyVrutco", "title": "How to Win - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4zfTyVrutco/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
