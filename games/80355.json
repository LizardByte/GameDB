But Santa is not the athlete he used to be (1943 state champion in 400m), he has grown a little...girthy around the middle. He doesn't have quite the energy he used to and if it drops too low he'll fail in his task! Along the way Santa will encounter many objects in the air and on the ground, some will help and some will hinder, so be be careful!\n\nThe 2005 AtariAge 'Holiday Cart: Reindeer Rescue was given out during the 2005 holiday season to anyone who purchased $50 or more from the AtariAge Store.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reindeer-rescue--1"}
