The only thing harder than you are the rocks you sleep on at night. You have arrived in a troubled town looking for peace and quiet, but you're not that lucky. Framed for a crime you didn't commit, you must use your skills as a gunslinger to evade the law and fight to stay alive in a corrupt western town where everyone wants you dead. Fight your way through ten action packed levels. Save the day by thwarting a train heist, go one on one with other gunslingers, fight your way through an abandoned mine and save the girl from a rich tycoon Hell-bent on seeing you dead. Then ride off into the sunset. If you're still alive.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Rating 7/10", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0U3KVpnPy9g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0U3KVpnPy9g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0U3KVpnPy9g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0U3KVpnPy9g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0U3KVpnPy9g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Western Outlaw: Wanted Dead Or Alive - Walkthrough Part 1", "description": "Western Outlaw: Wanted Dead Or Alive - Walkthrough Part 1\nWestern Outlaw: Wanted Dead Or Alive - Gameplay\n\u25baPlaylist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXd3rSycHR4Cq6nLcyun-EinD_95h9_Jv\n\nDifficulty: Normal\nLevel 1\nWelcome To Buffalo Springs\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle: Western Outlaw: Wanted Dead Or Alive\nGenre: First-Person, Shooter\nDeveloper: Jarhead Games\nPublisher: Groove Games\nRelease Date: September 28, 2003\nPlatforms: [PC]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame Description:\nSummary: You are the Stranger, a man hardened by your years as a gunslinger.
