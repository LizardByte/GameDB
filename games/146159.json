Released as AKIBA\u2019S TRIP Plus in Japan, players explore an accurately modeled recreation of the famous \u201cAkiba\u201d district circa 2012, hunting vampiric foes, and tearing off their clothes to expose them to sunlight. The game has been remade to bring it to modern HD graphical standards, all while retaining the charm of the original classic that started a cult hit series.\n\nThe \u201910 Anniversary Edition\u2019 includes the retail edition of the game, custom box with exclusive art, softcover artbook with over 96 pages of illustrations, commemorative short story, and concept artwork from the AKIBA\u2019S TRIP series, and the original Soundtrack of 47 songs on 2 CDs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/akibas-trip-hellbound-and-debriefed-10th-anniversary-edition"}
