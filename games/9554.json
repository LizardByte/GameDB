Similar in some ways to Namco's popular Dig Dug title, Mr. Do! was also popular and saw release on a variety of home video game consoles and systems. It is the first game in the Mr. Do series, and was released both as a standalone game and as a conversion kit (released by Taito Corp.) for existing arcade cabinets. It was one of the first arcade games to be released as a conversion kit, and went on to sell 30,000 units in the United States.[1] It was remade in Japan as Neo Mr. Do! (\u30cd\u30aa\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a5 Neo Misut\u0101 Du?). It was also a popular choice on the 1983 video arcade-based game show Starcade.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 3751, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "VKnWXn02Tpw"}]}
