Unburdened by a human soul and composed of pure darkness, his incredible powers make him an unparalleled killer.

It will take shocking and dramatic turns as an epic conflict unfolds. Alongside the grand main story, the characters you meet and team up with will become a dysfunctional family, providing smaller, more intimate moments in the plot.\n\nSide quests will further expand on the mythology and backstory in the game.", "summary": "Shadow Fate is a modernized, turn-based epic adventure where combat is intricate and challenging but immensely fun and satisfying, relying more on intelligent choices than repetitive grinding.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-fate"}
