The game, or interactive movie, is set in China hundreds of years ago. You are tasked with protecting half of a magical mask. The wearer of the mask will be granted untold power. Unfortunately, the villanous Wang Tu has the other half of the mask, and wants your half badly. So, you must fight off Wang Tu's minions, and eventually Fang Tu himself.\n\nThe gameplay in Supreme Warrior consists of digitized video with interactive elements. At many points during the video, you can unleash a punch, kick, or block. If your timing is correct, you inflict damage on your opponent. If you timing is off, your opponent hurts you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/supreme-warrior", "videos": [{"id": 36227, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NzQiGC5hucE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzQiGC5hucE", "title": "Supreme Warrior Mega-CD 32X", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NzQiGC5hucE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
