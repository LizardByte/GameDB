They are tourists in an area that's controlled by hunters. They are hunted and yet they too are hunters. Everyone is willing to do whatever it takes to survive. What you'll see here is something that we're calling Balance of Power AI. Enemies will react realistically to whatever situation your combat style forces them into. Playing as Joel, Ellie's help and whatever weapons you can scavenge are your best shot at progressing in this brutal, violent world.\n\nThe Last of Us is genre-defining experience blending survival and action elements to tell a character driven story about a population decimated by a modern plague. Cities are abandoned and being reclaimed by nature. Remaining survivors are killing each other for food, weapons and whatever they can find. Joel, a ruthless survivor, and Ellie, a young teenage girl who's braver and wiser beyond her years, must work together to survive their journey across what remains of the United States.\n\nDeveloped by Naughty Dog, The Last of Us is being made exclusively for the PS3 system.\n\nVisit the official The Last of Us website at: http://www.thelastofus.com/\n\nVisit us now on http://www.naughtydog.com/\n\nYou can also follow us on...\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/naughtydog\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/naughty_dog\n\nRated Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Sexual Themes, Strong Language\n\n\u00a92012 Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC.
