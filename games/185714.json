Will you find peaceful, sustainable means of existing in harmony with your world and neighboring Meeps, rather than heartlessly exploiting or conquering one and all? Will you navigate the forces of nature, learn how they work and harness their power to affect progress without destruction? Will you be a part of the journey?\n\nIn World Turtles the player must guide the Meeps in their journey to save both their World Turtle and themselves. To do this they need you. Help them with gathering resources, constructing buildings, expanding their skills, improving their efficiency, forming societies and researching new ways of advancing and improving the environment.\n\nThey, and their children, are going to need all the help they can get if they are to have a chance of saving their Turtle. And who knows? Along the way, you may meet and save others too as the Turtle flies through different parts of space with various characteristics.\n\nWorld Turtles is made by me, a solo developer from South Africa, as the main ingredient of the nerdiest mid-life crises I'm aware of. It is the game I've always wanted to make and, while it is my first, I guarantee that you will be pleasantly surprised by it. It still feels \u2018Unreal\u2019 to me, although it was \u2018Made with Unity\u2019, that the passion project I started out of nerdy interest has actually become such a reality, with enough support and appeal, to warrant pursuing it full-time in exchange for my career of two decades!\n\nI would love to develop World Turtles further alongside a group of enthusiastic real-world Meeps.\n\nPlease, join the Early Access release and be a part of the journey!", "summary": "A wholesome colony builder where you help Meeps save the life of the World Turtle they live on.
