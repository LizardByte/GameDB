It is the sequel to the game Chicken's Revenge.\n\nThe game features a hen who's out to rescue her chickens which have been captured and imprisoned. To secure their release our heroine fires a ball, 'Breakout style', at everything in her path. This clears the ground uncovers treasure which increases the score, pressure plates that allow her to advance and power-ups that may either help or hinder. All of which, if used carefully, will ultimately enable her to free the chicks. When the last chick has been freed the level is complete.\n\nThere are three types of game play, normal, easy and timed, in all the objective is to release the chicks and score points.\n\nThe game is entirely mouse controlled.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chicken-attack"}
