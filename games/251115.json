Play as Liva \u2013 the Sparrow \u2013 after she and her small group of Resistance members are forced to flee Copenhagen and retreat to the small village of Tinglev.\n\nDesperate and downtrodden, the mission remains: regroup, patch up your wounds, and hit the German army again using sabotage, infiltration, spying, and even assassination. Opposite to Gerda\u2019s empathic approach, Liva is not afraid of using violence and often struggles to tell revenge from justice. You will have to carefully balance her fury towards the enemy, duty towards her mission and country, and care for her teammates.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gerda-a-flame-in-winter-livas-story--1"}
