Here i give you some information about A Twisted Tale and take a look at the demo that is currently available on steam.

I first discovered this new point and click adventure game on twitter around a year ago and it instantly caught my eye due to its art work.

Full of loony characters, unexpected twists and challenging riddles.\nAccompany Vio on her unintentional journey through various realms. Explore broken cities, pirate ships in the deepest jungle and other unreal places. Stand by her side when she makes the acquaintance of the (depressive) Death and engage with lots of explicit and ambiguous references, hommages and imitations of the big classics past (and not quite past) times.\n\nWe are a bit vintage - therefore we draw our background art the old-fashioned way with paper, pencil and ink. Colorizing is done digitally - this way we leave less colorful smudges on our desks.\nKey features\nHand-drawn traditionally and digitally created graphics in 4K/Ultra HD\nClassic frame by frame animation\n1-click interface\nFemale main character\nAn undead deuteragonist (depressive Death)\nLots of explicit and ambiguous references, hommages and imitations of the big classics\nEven more comical, thrilling and unique characters\nWeird humor and retro-vibes\nVarying worlds and twisted settings\nExtensive story and classical complex riddles\nDecisions affecting the game\nAlternative endings\n\n \nCREDITS: \"Subscribe Button\" by MrNumber112 https://youtu.be/Fps5vWgKdl0\n\nInspired by LeBouseuh  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5YLPHfjnwdcNNvhZqp_kw  \n& Liam  https://youtu.be/K57WD5t0Gk4\n\nSoundfx:\n\n    Mouse click (by THE_bizniss)\n    https://freesound.org/people/THE_bizniss/sounds/39562/\n    https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en\n\n    Unfa's Menu Sounds (by unfa)\n    https://freesound.org/people/unfa/sounds/244266/\n    https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n    BronzeBell2 (by Zabuhailo)\n    https://freesound.org/people/Zabuhailo/sounds/178645/\n    https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nFont:\n     https://www.dafont.com/fr/roboto.font", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51oBDLHnl5g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51oBDLHnl5g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51oBDLHnl5g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51oBDLHnl5g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51oBDLHnl5g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "A Twisted Tale Demo | A NEW Point and Click adventure Indie Game For 2022", "description": "A Twisted Tale is a new point and click adventure game scheduled for full release in fall 2022! \n\nSupport the kickstarter here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eva-a-twisted-tale/a-twisted-tale?ref=clipboard-prelaunch\n\nThis upcoming point and click adventure game, a twisted tale, is developed and published by indie develop Voodoo Bembel.
