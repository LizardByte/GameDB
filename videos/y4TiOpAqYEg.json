The Zero series took the tight gameplay of the Mega Man X series, brought it to a handheld, and added a satisfyingly dark story that both fans and casuals can appreciate. I must've sacrificed THOUSANDS of hours of my life to these games.  And now, The Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection released today and I am so excited to finally play the Zero series in HD! Without further adieu, here is my playthrough of Mega Man Zero 1 for the GBA!\n\nThis playthrough did not use any Cyber Elves in order to maintain as high a mission rank as possible. As such, my life bar remained at 16 units the whole game, I had no Sub Tanks, and I managed to hold an A rank for the entire playthrough. This allows bosses to use their EX Skills in battle which makes them more interesting. I honestly think Zero 1 is more fun to play this way specifically as the boss patterns are not overly complex and the missions are simpler than in later entries.\n\nNew here?
