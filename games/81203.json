So much. 60 dynamic new colour schemes, new ninja headbands, new secrets and more. The Ultimate Edition doubles the size of N++, bringing the total to 4340 hand-crafted, finely tuned levels in 3 game modes: Solo, Co-op and Race. It also adds a new mode, Hardcore, which changes the rules of the game and lets you see Solo in a whole new light. Hardcore mode is a true challenge for Ultimate ninjas! And it's completely free -- this update means the game could last a lifetime. N++ is truly the last platformer you'll ever need to buy!\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 17598, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "flSoFw4-VyU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flSoFw4-VyU", "title": "N++ Ultimate Edition update is here!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/flSoFw4-VyU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
