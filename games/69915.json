I was beginning to think I'd be holed up in this foul-smelling, disease-ridden infirmary forever.\n\nI was one of the original thousands of adventurers who poured into the small town above Apshai a few months ago. When word of the treasure to be had in the gloomy dunjons of Apshai got out, just about every young lad (and lassie) with any spirit of adventure at all came running here. By boats they came, mainly, but also by land, afoot, or on horseback.\n\nI came over 200 leagues by boat . . . for what? As I stepped off the boat and walked down the plank\u2014happy to be back on land again, I can tell you\u2014I caught my foot on a nail: a big, sharp, rusty nail. And BOY did it hurt! I ripped it right. . . but I bore you with my injury.\n\nSuffice it to say that I was laid up for months while the fortune and glory fell to others. Now the village is almost abandoned, and the locals talk about life getting back to normal.\n\nI have to pay for my trip home somehow, and there's cleaning, painting, and repairing to be done in homes and yards above Apshai. It's not what I imagined when I left home, but if you want to come along, we may find adventure yet!", "summary": "Expansion module for \"Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai\" containing 150 more rooms split into four epsiodes.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dunjonquest-upper-reaches-of-apshai", "videos": [{"id": 121525, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FzuDSn8Qyxo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzuDSn8Qyxo", "title": "Dunjonquest: Upper Reaches of Apshai (1981) 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FzuDSn8Qyxo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
