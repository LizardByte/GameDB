As an opponent you have primarily human players in order to be able to measure yourself against them. Several players can form tennis clubs ( guilds ) for which a battle function ( raid) is being planned. In addition, the property values \u200b\u200bcan be increased by using special items of clothing, each with extra capabilities. These are available in the item shop and can be paid for using either the cash currency alaplaya Points (AP) or the in-game currency gold. Popular items included the speaker, which the game falsely described as an improved version of itself, the Wing of Memory, for which the player spent AP every month to reset their stats, or the so-called gachas, a more expensive variant, to to get to QS. The game itself takes place in the parallel world FantasyLand and takes place on different courts wie Nest Of Rubycrab, Twinkle Town, Snow Moon, Life Woods, Emerald Beach, Arena, Deva Berg oder Atlantis statt.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fantasy-tennis", "videos": [{"id": 54316, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CUhycL6dCAA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhycL6dCAA", "title": "Fantasy Tennis - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CUhycL6dCAA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 54317, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "RfmtV622aF4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfmtV622aF4", "title": "Fantasy Tennis - Ingame Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RfmtV622aF4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
