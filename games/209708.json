The carps, frogs and dragonflies warm up under the first rays of the sun.\nTwo apprentice gardeners are competing to see which one will earn the enviable duty of Imperial Gardener. They will show their skills and try to profit from this first wind of Spring to have the water lilies blossom in their color while making the most harmonious combinations !\nThe goal of the game is to make the water lilies blossom and move them using the breeze of the first wind of Spring, in order to form harmonious geometric figures (alignments or groupings of flowers of your color) worthing victory points.\nHaru Ichiban has been designed by Bruno Cathala, a well-known french boardgame designer, who has still published more than 40 games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/haru-ichiban"}
