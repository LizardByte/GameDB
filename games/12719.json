Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.\n\nThere are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans.\n\nYour buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You\u2019ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you\u2019re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down.\n\nFinish all 5 stages in a level and you\u2019ll be presented with a bonus level.", "summary": "Power Drift is a kart racing game released in arcades by Sega in 1988. More technologically advanced than Sega's earlier 2.5D racing games, like Hang-On (1985) and Out Run (1986), in Power Drift the entire world and track consist of sprites. The upgraded hardware of the Sega Y Board allows individual sprites and the background to be rotated\u2013even while being scaled\u2013making the visuals more dynamic.\n\nDesigned and directed by Yu Suzuki, the game was a critical and commercial success upon release in arcades. It was subsequently ported to various home computers in Europe by Activision in 1989, followed by a PC Engine port published in Japan by Asmik Ace in 1990. It was not released on Sega consoles until the Sega Ages release for the Sega Saturn in 1998.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 63393, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fHwU5JrvcIg"}]}
