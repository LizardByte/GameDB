We've got one evening to find the truth about what happened last night. If Grimoire can't solve this mystery, no one can.\n\nThe Beginning of the Case\n\nGrimoire and Officer James are outside of Coils Co Fairground and Grimoire was briefed before starting the case. As Grimoire headed to the entrance, he found a little girl who is offering help to the detective on the case by giving Grimoire a map of the fairground.\n\nHe enter the fairground to find Charles Ringer, outside the fun house. He questioned the main suspect that Hugh Everton was neglecting the fun house which cause ire with older employees.
