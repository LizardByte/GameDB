Assisted by voices in your head - run, hide and bribe your way out of a strange South African mental hospital, where the staff need more help than the patients. \n\nDeep in the heart of Blomvanspruit, South Africa...\nDaniel Vleisman is diagnosed with Disconnected Electricity Disorder, after being traumatized by constant power outages.\nHe wakes up in Slashbin Clinic, disoriented and with voices in his head.\nHe will need to maintain focus while being hunted down, using speed and stealth to make his way to freedom.\n\nDEDstress is based on the 3-day game jam DIDstress, made by the same small indie team of two brothers. The game's stressful conditions will put your memory and wits to the test.\nIt should take an average of three to five hours to complete DEDstress on normal difficulty.\nThere is also a fast-paced infinite arcade mode as an added bonus.\n\n3StrakGames: https://3strakgames.com/\n\n\n\nDEDstress uses Unreal\u00ae Engine.
