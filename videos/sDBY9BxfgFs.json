Start with a few basic seeds and attempt to grow a thriving ecosystem.\n\nI'm happy to announce that there is now a new Gameplay trailer for PolyPine which showcases a lot of new content!\n\nThe development of the game is progressing nicely. Here's an overview of things I've added recently:\n- 42 animals and 35 plants are now in the game.\n- Mountains that isolate populations of animals and plants.\n- Campaign with 10 levels that take 4-10 hours to complete.\n- Heavily expanded Freeplay mode with advanced terrain generation and lots of customization!\n- Forest Fires, Storms, and Bark Beetle Swarms!\n- Dead wood and fallen trunks with associated animals and plants.\n- Create huge trees by sharing resources via mycorrhizal networks created by mushrooms.\n\nThings are starting to come together and the feedback from a recent closed beta playtest session were very encouraging!\nWe are in the final stretch of finishing the game. I'm really eager to get this game out into the world :)\n\nThe full game is releasing early 2025.
