By removing blocks of the same type, the player eliminates them. In the game's story, the daruma/dharma dolls and colored blocks are summoned by oni to terrorize the populace, and it's down to the player character (the player can choose from a male and a female character) to remove them.\n\nDharma Dojo was released to the Arcade in 1994 and ported to the Super Famicom the following year.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dharma-dojo"}
