{"id": "Wr-nwPp-C3M", "snippet": {"title": "Akhena: Age of Evil first reveal", "description": "I'm an amateur game developer from South Africa, just over a year ago I made the decision to pursue my dream of making games. A year later I'm proud to present Akhena: Age of Evil in a (barely) playable state.\n\nPlease bear in mind that I am an absolute amateur, while I'm super proud of what I've got so far it's still very early and even by the end it will be an obvious amateur game, but hopefully something that at least a small group of people will want to play.\n\nAkhena: AoE is a single player open-world RPG with JRPG gameplay mechanics. At the beginning of the game the player will be asked a few cultural alignment questions and will be placed in a kingdom where the culture most closely matches that of the player. From there you can help (or hurt) the people around you in order to work your way into influential parts of society and up the social ladder to discover the secrets of Akhenan society.\n\nAlong the way you'll have to deal with the undead and unnatural abominations that now infest the continent. The game is designed to keep players, for the most part, within their kingdoms which should make for good replayability, but the player is still free to wander the entire continent as long as they have the resources to stay alive when travelling long distances. The ethically grey story is largely inspired by A Song of Ice and Fire and The Witcher, with gameplay inspired by Skyrim. This is not a children's game, there will be profanity, narcotics, torture and nudity.\n\nThere are four kingdoms on the continent of Akhena:\n1. Kohmaji: the seat of power for High King Kiisto (Rainforest biome)\n2. Sankesroh: Ruled by King Gotah and the Beck estate (Desert biome)\n3. Kithrym: Ruled by King Tanon of the Derro estate (Plains biome)\n4. Aeland: Ruled by King Elize of the Nel estate (Coastal biome)\n\nThe video above showcases the daylight and the weather systems, as well as gives a brief look at the southern part of Cliffdon, the capitol city of the Aeland Kingdom.\nIf you're interested in the game please subscribe to my Channel so that I can gauge interest in the project.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wr-nwPp-C3M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wr-nwPp-C3M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wr-nwPp-C3M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wr-nwPp-C3M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wr-nwPp-C3M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Akhena: Age of Evil first reveal", "description": "I'm an amateur game developer from South Africa, just over a year ago I made the decision to pursue my dream of making games.
