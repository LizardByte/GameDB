It was wireless, communicating with the SNES via a receiver plugged into one of the controller ports, and it allowed for continous aim tracking with smooth cursor control (similar to what we saw with the Wii's remotes) as well as rapid-fire functionality. It was also extremely accurate, though it had to be recalibrated every time you played.  \n\nStyled as a shoulder-mounted bazooka, the Super Scope was a large, awkward, and uncomfortable peripheral that quickly gained a reputation as a battery hog - it would only last a few hours on a fresh set of six AA batteries (and far less if you were using rechargeable batteries like I did back in the day) - but despite its issues, the tiny library of games that supported it included some real SNES gems that earned it a dedicated following. \n\nThe game that came bundled with the Super Scope, Super NES Super Scope 6, is a compilation of several small titles designed to provide owners with a taste of the different gameplay experiences that the new controller could provide. \n\nBlastris featured two different takes on the puzzle genre. Blastris A plays a bit like a horizontal version of Tetris, but instead of moving the pieces yourself, you have to shoot the blocks so that the pieces can slide together smoothly in order to create vertical lines. Blastris B is a Columns-style game where you have to match three matching blocks in a row to clear them from the playing field, done by shooting the blocks to change their colors as they fall.\n\nMole Patrol is a whack-a-mole style shooting gallery that's probably only listed as part of Blastris because they couldn't figure out where else to put it.\n\nThe LazerBlazer games are more action-oriented affairs that feel like a test platform for the mechanics that would eventually serve as the backbone of Battle Clash (https://youtu.be/iKHMx0OsuY0 ) and its sequel Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge (https://youtu.be/-kBfLg23DJA ). \n\nIntercept has you firing at a stream of missiles and planes. Since they all appear at different distances from the screen, the focus is placed on your ability to lead your targets with your shots. Mario also makes a surprise appearance in this mode - occasionally he'll fly by in a biplane resembling the Sky Pop plane that he flew in Super Mario Land on the Game Boy (which just so happens to have been developed by the same team that made this cart), being chased by a rocket-straddling Lemmy Koopa. If you can save Mario in time, you'll get an extra life. Just be careful not to shoot Mario himself!\n\nEngage and Confront are similar to Intercept, except that you're dealing with enemy ships firing directly at you. They play like light-gun takes on Konami's Top Gun, with Engage having you fly over fast scrolling mode 7 backdrops while Confront keeps you stationary as you take out waves of incoming threats.\n\nThe whole package is a bit on the basic side, but the games are well made and the polished presentation prevents it from feeling like a haphazard collection of tech demos, unlike Sega's similar pack of six games released for the Genesis's Menacer.\n\nThe graphics are sharp, the music is catchy, the controls are as spot on as can be, and the whole package could keep you entertained for quite a while despite how shallow the individual experiences tend to be. It doesn't nail the charm of Duck Hunt (https://youtu.be/J3sfsP9W048 ), but it was a good introduction to what we could expect from the Super Scope over the next couple of years. \n\nAll in all, not bad for a package that sold for the typical SNES game price point of $59.99.\n _____________\r\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \r\n\r\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zMK8keCte2M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zMK8keCte2M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zMK8keCte2M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zMK8keCte2M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Super NES Super Scope 6 (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Nintendo's 1992 light-gun game for the Super Nintendo, Super NES Super Scope 6.\n\nThis video shows plays of each of the six games.\n\nBlastris:\n\nBlastris A 0:29\nBlastris B (Type A) 34:03\nBlastris B (Type B) 44:51\nMole Patrol (Stage) 55:28\nMole Patrol (Score) 1:04:45\n\nLazerBlazer:\n\nType A: Intercept 1:06:21\nType B: Engage 1:39:29\nType C: Confront 1:58:16\n\nThe Super Scope 6 pack-in title was the first light-gun shooter to be released for the SNES when it appeared in early 1992, just four months after the console's US launch.\n\nThe Super Scope 6, created by Nintendo's internal R&D1 team, was the spiritual successor to the NES Zapper, and it offered some meaningful upgrades to the tech used in the 8-bit machine's phaser-style pistol.
