The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.\n\nAlthough the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.\n\nThe teams included differs depending on the version of the game.\nBelgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Spain,, and Sweden (Euro Champ '92)\nCIS, England, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and Scotland (European Football Champ)"}
