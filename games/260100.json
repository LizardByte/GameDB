This game has all kinds of progression and ways to build your character to your own liking. The max level of this game is level 50, once you hit this you can sell your experience from your journey which is levels 1 through 50. However, that is not all, after level 50 you still gain experience but it banks in your experience bar which you can then sell into all kinds of stats. The more you sell into a stat the more costly it gets though depending on the class of course the numbers are different. With the sale of experience, you unlock new maps and new content at certain thresholds of sales. So for example at 50 million experience sold you unlock a map where you can obtain gear and items for that sold which is Pirate's Cove! The style was inspired by NexusTK however we have taken 2D mmorpgs to a whole new level! We are completely free to play and the only things that will ever be released are cosmetic items in the cash shop so come join now and see what areas you unlock and new continents to explore!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yugen-saga", "videos": [{"id": 95143, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "7GaCmNY-l7g"}]}
