Go on a new ambitious campaign against Paris' numerous rivals in order to, one by one, bring them all to submission, earning wealth and glory in the process. But don't let the glitter of gold blind you as, in the royal service, the cloaks and daggers of maligners and ill-wishers might prove to be way more dangerous than even the sharpest swords and spears of the best enemy knights.\n\n\u2022 Bounty Hunting\nAccept the offer of Grace & Glory and abandon the military career in favour of bounty hunting. Accompany your new colleagues on their travels around medieval Europe and complete various contracts, some of which might take you to rather unexpected places. They say that bounty hunters die young \u2014 find out if you got what it takes to become an exception from this rule.\n\n\u2022 From a peasant to a king\nBetrayal is the worst possible sin. However is it really that bad if the crown of the whole kingdom is at stake? Stop being a pawn in somebody else's game and make your own dash for the throne. Seizing the crown will be a challenging task, holding onto it will be even harder. But, if you've got a true monarch's ambition, the battle is worth the blood. True greatness is now within your reach \u2014 it's time to become the king or die trying!", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heads-will-roll-reforged-threads-of-destiny"}
