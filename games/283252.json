First part focusing on school days and a group of students who set out on a hiking trip in Japanese Alps. However, the protagonist of the story, Yuuichi Takawashi, dies in an accident during mountain climbing. But because of the reincarnation process of the soul, Yuuichi's memories are played. But in order to playback the memories of the soul, it is necessary to have someone in your heart who you really want to meet. And so the story flashback to the memories of high-school when you were in third year and play until the day of your accident. Second part start with Yuuichi waking up in a hospital. But not is his own body, but rather in that of whomever you made heroine in the first part of the story. Your soul is sort-of possessing that person's body. You want to tell people you know that you are still alive somehow, but because you are not really you, it appears to be rather difficult feat to achieve. But it is a matter of time when the soul decides to merge, and because two souls cannot forever occupy the same body, the one that doesn't merge will disappear, and if Yuuichi's soul merges, he will continue to live on in this body.\n\nThis visual novel plays just as typically, you read through the text with static backgrounds and non-animated characters and occasionally make choices that may propel the story toward a certain direction. There are also unlockable CG scenes and background music which can be viewed from gallery.\n\nDreamcast and PlayStation 2 ports feature some new characters and scenarios which are not present in PC version.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/after-dot-dot-dot-wasureenu-kizuna--1"}
