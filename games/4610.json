The object of the game is to drive through a series of cities and paint every part of the roads in each city as proof of your visit to that city. City Connection was remarkable for its time in that each location had its own background and music which was a variation on the main theme of the game. There are twelve locations: Manhattan, the Grand Canyon, Easter Island, Paris, Neuschwanstein Castle, London, Sydney, Egyptian temples, and cities in India, Holland, China and Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-connection", "videos": [{"id": 23991, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "4BgudbyWZoE"}]}
