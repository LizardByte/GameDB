Instead of a piece being taken the game enters an arena mode and the two pieces fight with a top-down perspective to decide on the result.\nEach piece plays differently due to their attacks and abilities.\nThe losing piece is destroyed but a pieces health is persistent making repeated fights dangerous.\n\nThe game's single player has 50 levels that consist of games in various stages of play that must be completed in order to unlock the next level.\nThe online multiplayer is player hosted which reveals the hosts IP address if used.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chess-arena"}
