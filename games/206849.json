Instead of the player doing all the work themselves, they would delegate the task of growing crops and attending to animals to various harvest sprites.\n\nThe player was assigned to complete quests assigned by the Harvest Goddess in order to earn gold, resources and more harvest sprites.", "summary": "Minna de Bokuj\u014d Monogatari was browser-based and was the only online version of the Bokuj\u014d Monogatari / Harvest Moon series. It was only available in Japanese, aside from unofficial translations in both Indonesian, under Harvest Moon: Indonesia by Prodigy Infinitech, and Thai (under Bubble Farm Online). The game was free to play, although like most other free-to-play browser games, the player had the option of spending real money for extra items/abilities.\n\nThe server was shut down on October 1, 2012, making the game impossible to play.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/minna-de-bokujou-monogatari", "videos": [{"id": 95815, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3D31LmkmAWc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D31LmkmAWc", "title": "Lets Play Minna De Bokujou Monogatari (Harvest Moon With Everyone (Online)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3D31LmkmAWc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
