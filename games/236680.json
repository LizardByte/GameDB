The campaign is set in Inkopolis Square, though instead of being filled with color as in Splatoon 2, it is now all white and more modern-looking. Branches of presumed dead or bleached coral can be seen throughout the plaza. Bits of snow-like specks can also be seen floating in the distance. Deca Tower looks entirely different, resembling a normal building more than a battle tower. The Great Zapfish is also absent from its resting spot.\n\nStill images of Off the Hook are interspersed throughout the Wave's trailer, suggesting they will play a major role in the campaign. This suggestion would align with information revealed in the August 2022 Splatoon 3 Direct, which suggested they would be featured in upcoming DLC.\n\nThe Direct states Wave 2 will arrive in the future, separate from Wave 1.
