Now, as a string of murders casts a shroud over the city and the law begins to fail, justice cannot afford to be blind.\n\nThe son of a murdered lawyer, Takayuki Yagami was raised on the streets of Kamurocho by a yakuza patriarch who paves the way for Yagami to follow in his real father's footsteps. Taking a job at the Genda Law Office, Yagami accepts a high-profile case: Proving Shinpei Okubo, a man suspected of murder, innocent.\n\nAgainst all odds, Yagami succeeds and is hailed as a hero, but his prolific career is short-lived. Only months later, Okubo brutally murders his girlfriend, stabbing her over ten times with a kitchen knife before setting their apartment on fire.\n\nYagami becomes the lawyer who let a murderer walk - and everything he had worked for comes crashing down.\n\nThree years later, Yagami has taken off his lawyer's badge to run a small detective agency in the red-light district of Kamurocho, scraping by on odd jobs and evidence collection.\n\nBut even a city as seedy as this is shaken by a string of serial murders, where the victims' bodies are discovered with their eyes gouged out. Yagami is drawn into the case by his old law firm, where he discovers that in order to bring this killer to light, he must seek the truth that slipped from his grasp three years ago. But can a man haunted by his failures prevail over his own past?", "summary": "Judgment is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The game is a legal thriller set in the Yakuza world of Kamurocho and follows private detective Takayuki Yagami as he investigates a serial murder case. It stars Japanese actor Takuya Kimura and employs a fighting system similar to that of Yakuza 0 where players can change into different styles, namely crane-style which is more focused on fighting groups and tiger-style which is more focused on fighting individuals. Additionally, the game features an investigation mode where the player must find traces of the criminal.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/judgment", "videos": [{"id": 28372, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "URoAnyXqB9g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URoAnyXqB9g", "title": "Project JUDGE | Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/URoAnyXqB9g/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 26003, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZynIsm9s5xI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZynIsm9s5xI", "title": "Judgment | Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZynIsm9s5xI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 28256, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Lt6_ooeidhU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt6_ooeidhU", "title": "Judgment | Combat Trailer (EN UK)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lt6_ooeidhU/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 25314, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_qfKFVA8OL8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qfKFVA8OL8", "title": "Judgment | Features Trailer (English VO)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_qfKFVA8OL8/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 14457, "name": "Kazuya Ayabe"}, {"id": 8189, "name": "Mari"}, {"id": 14474, "name": "Yoji Shono"}, {"id": 14466, "name": "Ko Hattori"}, {"id": 14460, "name": "Masamichi Shintani"}, {"id": 14459, "name": "Masaharu Kaito"}, {"id": 14456, "name": "Kyohei Hamura"}, {"id": 14464, "name": "Mafuyu Fujii"}, {"id": 14465, "name": "Keigo Izumida"}, {"id": 14470, "name": "Ozaki"}, {"id": 14476, "name": "Emi Terasawa"}, {"id": 14473, "name": "Ryusuke Kido"}, {"id": 14477, "name": "Hashimoto"}, {"id": 14455, "name": "Mitsuru Kuroiwa"}, {"id": 14458, "name": "Ryuzo Genda"}, {"id": 14461, "name": "Saori Shirosaki"}, {"id": 14483, "name": "Kaoru Ichimose"}, {"id": 14471, "name": "Akira Murase"}, {"id": 14472, "name": "Satoshi Shioya"}, {"id": 14485, "name": "Mitsugu Matsugane"}, {"id": 14490, "name": "Amon"}, {"id": 14489, "name": "Nanami Matsuoka"}, {"id": 14498, "name": "Kim"}, {"id": 14500, "name": "Charles Employee"}, {"id": 14484, "name": "Shigeru Kajihira"}, {"id": 14493, "name": "Horseplayer Detective"}, {"id": 14492, "name": "Honda"}, {"id": 14494, "name": "Kasai"}, {"id": 14496, "name": "Tashiro"}, {"id": 14487, "name": "Tsukino Saotome"}, {"id": 14499, "name": "Puyo Puyo Cast"}, {"id": 14501, "name": "Yurika Tachibana"}, {"id": 14475, "name": "Shinpei Okubo"}, {"id": 14463, "name": "Fumiya Sugiura"}, {"id": 11869, "name": "Host Photo Poster"}, {"id": 14491, "name": "Cane Man"}, {"id": 14497, "name": "Tsukumo"}, {"id": 14481, "name": "Ishimatsu"}, {"id": 14454, "name": "Takayuki Yagami"}, {"id": 14462, "name": "Issei Hoshino"}, {"id": 14480, "name": "Presiding Judge"}, {"id": 14468, "name": "Toru Higashi"}, {"id": 14469, "name": "Kengo"}, {"id": 14479, "name": "Sakuraba"}, {"id": 14478, "name": "Mashiko"}, {"id": 14482, "name": "Kunihiko Morita"}, {"id": 14486, "name": "Sana Mihama"}, {"id": 14488, "name": "Amane"}, {"id": 14495, "name": "Seiya"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
