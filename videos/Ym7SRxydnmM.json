{"id": "Ym7SRxydnmM", "snippet": {"title": "Hot Wheels Unleashed - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "Hot Wheels is one of the toylines that had its fair share of video games, even dating a long way back to 1985 with a Commodore 64 game by Epyx (yes, the same Epyx behind Impossible Mission, Rogue, and California Games). Unfortunately we didn't see a new console Hot Wheels game for a long while after Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment released the poorly-received Hot Wheels: World's Best Driver in 2013. But after eight years, we finally got a new console Hot Wheels game... and it's fantastic. Who made it, you might ask? Why, Hot Wheels Unleashed was developed by Milestone S.r.l., the same studio behind the RIDE, Monster Energy Supercross and the current Moto GP games. In fact, this is their first arcade racer, since they were mainly known for racing simulators. Y'know, realistic controls and physics.\n\nIt was such a great return, it got a sequel in 2023 titled Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged.
