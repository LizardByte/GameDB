Called Giftia, these robots are programmed with a synthetic soul and serve many purposes in society. There\u2019s just one flaw: a Giftia can live only 81,920 hours (about nine years and four months) before their memories and personality fade from existence, and they become potentially violent.\n\nThat\u2019s where Mizugaki Tsukasa comes in. After failing his college entrance exams, Tsukasa lands a job at the SAI Corporation\u2019s Terminal Service Department, whose purpose is to reclaim these \u201cexpired\u201d Giftia. Surrounded by expired Giftia and assisted by his Giftia work partner, the beautiful, innocent and inexperienced Isla, Tsukasa must come to terms with the short lifespan of these incredibly life-like androids in Plastic Memories.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/plastic-memories", "videos": [{"id": 41906, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "N8nFwZNJFtY"}, {"id": 82611, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wHrvyy2g--g"}]}
