Single player, multiplayer coop, and competitive multiplayer are all supported with different game modes for each. An open, streaming world makes for an exciting sandbox to adventure in!\n\nCounter Spell Classic is the original Counter Spell realm. It contains over twenty zones, over forty quests, and is about a half square kilometer in size. There are several mini-bosses and a final boss to defeat. It offers a fully fleshed out and complete game, and is still occasionally updated. The Classic Realm's graphics are more basic and generally provide better performance for players with older machines.\n\nCounter Spell Reforged is the beta Counter Spell realm. The Reforged Realm showcases the newest graphics, models, and tech that Counter Spell has to offer. It is still under heavy development and new content is constantly being added. It does not currently contain any official quests or bosses, but they are coming soon.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/counter-spell"}
