The first episode is based around fast-paced combat and 1999-style levels with a similar aesthetic to Hell Revealed 2 and Thy Flesh Consumed. Episode 2 features a swampy dark green and grey Heretic and Hexen styled aesthetic, with large layouts and large monster quantities. The unfinished third episode was meant to feature suspenseful exploratory levels with jump scares and high contrast lighting, in a theme featuring lots of cement, charred rock and vine textures.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ezekiel"}
