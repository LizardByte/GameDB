You should go greet your guests.\n\nYou're Pepper, the eponymous birthday kid. It's your 12th birthday today and you're having a party! The cake is nice, but you don't really like your guests that much... Also, there seems to be something important you're forgetting... and where the heck are your parents?\n\nBirthday Kid is a fairly short game about celebrating your birthday, human sacrifice, and discovering yourself.\n\nIt's mostly story focused with a few puzzles. Playtime is about an hour or two.\n\nWarning: this game contains violence and disturbing content!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/birthday-kid"}
