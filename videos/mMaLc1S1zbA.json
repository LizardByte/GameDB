The title is under development and will launch on PCs (Steam, GOG), and Nintendo Switch once ready.

Adapt to new situations by creating various character builds, and maximize your team\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nNadir is a #dark jRPG with procedurally generated maps burning of infernal fire and many extraordinary inspirations with the deepest influence coming straight from Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. The game features fast-paced combat with lots of abilities and special effects, terrifying enemies, strong and vivid, Sin-City inspired art style, and modding support for those who want to expand the world.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n\u26ab Control your Sins. Every Sin has its own Avatar, a shell that will bring its will to Nadir. As the avatar\u2019s journey progresses, their power will grow, unlocking new abilities to fight even stronger threats.

Monochrome style full of high contrasts inspired by comic books like Frank Miller\u2019s Sin-City, Mike Mignola\u2019s Hellboy, and the works of Sergio Toppi and Tsutomu Nihei.\n\u26ab Bloodcurdling bosses. Each level of Nadir has its own Floor Guardian that you will have to defeat in order to go deeper into the city.\n\u26ab Twist on a turn system to make the encounter more exciting. A Threat Counter shows how much time is left before the enemy turn starts. Each character\u2019s skill subtracts from the Threat Counter, so choose your skills carefully at the right time.\n\u26ab Choose your own approach and tactics with different team compositions. There are ways to prolong the player\u2019s turn by using special skills or performing a skill combo.\n\u26ab Reach the bottom of Nadir.
