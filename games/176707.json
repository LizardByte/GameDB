In Lava Golf you do not control the golfer, instead you are the golf ball and your objective is to reach the end portal of each course without falling into the lava.\n\nArmed with unexpected skills for a golf ball, like the ability to dash into the air or to hit the brakes to avoid falling off a platform, you will need to cross all the portal rings of a course to unlock its exit portal. Scattered across the course you'll also find precious experience spheres which will let you gain levels and grant skill points allowing you to unlock new incredible abilities and to enhance your existing ones!\n\nUnlock unique skills, cross all the rings, and most importantly... DO NOT FALL INTO THE LAVA!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lava-golf"}
