Puzzles images included in the game come from eight different regions, as well as eight different sizes, making piecing images together more and more challenging as familiarity with regions fade and the dimensions of puzzles change. Players can solve the puzzles alone or with a friend via a wireless connection, and for those needing an occasional break from jigsaw play, there are three additional mini-games included in the game. Finally, DSi owners can take the game to a whole new level as they are able to snap photos and create their own personalized jigsaw puzzles out of the imported images.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jig-a-pix-wonderful-world"}
