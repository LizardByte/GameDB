She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.\n\nHow could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice? From just a single stumble, one can become a monster\u2026", "summary": "Lost Judgment is an action-adventure video game developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by Sega. A sequel to the 2018 game Judgment (a spin-off of the Like a Dragon series), the game focuses on private detective Takayuki Yagami as he investigates a criminal accused of both sexual harassment and murder\n\nJoined by his partner, ex-yakuza Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system.
