It includes Japanese audio (undub), a revised script, and some redone graphical elements.\n\nPatch notes:\nhttps://twitter.com/sylwahan/status/1540667752070774784\n\nPatch download:\nhttps://mega.nz/file/dCE2nDba#MPjN-18W-IUSrCV4rD3G20G0aH5p1Vd3ScWM0PJS_vg\nhttps://archive.org/details/yakuza-restored\n\nApply using DeltaPatcher:\nhttps://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases/tag/2.0.1\n\nYou will need an ISO disc image of the US release of Yakuza.\n\nIf you want to play it on PS3, you'll have to apply an additional little patch/fix for that, after applying the main patch:\nhttps://mega.nz/file/dP9SBTyD#Eczs4aAR11jTiv3G14qjTgQoyyHX_O6SZ2wIFrLUNWM\n\n\nStep-by-step patching guide:\n1. You need an ISO copy of the US version of Yakuza for PS2.\n2. Go to this page: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md5_checksum.html and analyze your ISO file. \n3. If the result is not 251059e4d54fb61369e1139b5d4d5e6c, your file is corrupt/bad, and you must acquire a proper copy before proceeding.\n4. Download deltapatcher_v2.0.1_win32_bin.zip from here: https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases/tag/2.0.1 and extract the zip. There are various versions of DeltaPatcher, but this one is guaranteed to work.\n5. Download the patch from either: https://mega.nz/file/dCE2nDba#MPjN-18W-IUSrCV4rD3G20G0aH5p1Vd3ScWM0PJS_vg or: https://archive.org/details/yakuza-restored and extract the zip.\n6. Launch DeltaPatcherLite, under \"Original file\" select the original game ISO, under \"XDelta patch\" select the \"Yakuza (USA) (Restored 1.0).xdelta\" patch extracted from the zip in step 5.\n7. On the cogwheel icon, I highly recommend checking \"Backup original file\", otherwise the original ISO file will be lost in the patching process.\n8. Press \"Apply patch\" and WAIT. Don't touch anything even if it looks like the program isn't responding. On my machine it takes about 4 minutes to apply the patch, your mileage may vary.\n9. You should now have another ISO with \"PATCHED\" in the name, that you can load up and play on an emulator or a PS2.\n\nOptional if you intend to play the game on a PS3 using its PS2 emulation function:\n10. Download the PS3 fix patch from here: https://mega.nz/file/dP9SBTyD#Eczs4aAR11jTiv3G14qjTgQoyyHX_O6SZ2wIFrLUNWM\n11. Launch DeltaPatcherLite again, but this time under \"Original file\" select the \"PATCHED\" file that resulted from step 8, and under \"XDelta patch\" select the \"Yakuza (USA) (Restored 1.0) PS3 Fix v2.xdelta\" from step 10.\n12. Press \"Apply patch\".
