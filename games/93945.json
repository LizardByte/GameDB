Also avoid falling down or touching death zone behind you. \n \nEach evil grid block (blue color) has a critical flaw. There is a gap between them. You can run through that gap. Just tap your screen and you will jump. Grids move faster than you, but you can use their speed as an advantage. Timing is the key. You will be able to pass even two block with just one tap when you master the game. \n \nIt is really fun and easy to play, but be warned, Grid Run is hard to master! \n \nEnjoy :)", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
