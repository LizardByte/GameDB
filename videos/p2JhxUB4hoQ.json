He eventually found a book that talked about a lost treasure of a King Garuzia, that before you go to the beyond, hid all his wealth in a mysterious place. Fortunately for Donald inside the book he finds a map that seems to indicate the location where the fortune of the King of Garuzia is hidden! This was the perfect opportunity to Donald get as rich as Scrooge! As it was in a total state of euphoria, Donald did not notice that one of the henchmen of the infamous Pete watched it all, and of course, the wrongdoer would not let your boss know without this coveted treasure.\n\nDonald joins his three nephews (Huey, Dewey and Louie), and all depart on a small plane to seek treasure, even with Daisy warning that they would be late for dinner. Before leaving, Donald promises his girlfriend that she is preparing for a very special surprise. With the following their destination tickets, Pete and his band observe everything and plan a way to prevent the duck reaches the coveted treasure, while they can possess it in place of Donald and and his nephews.\n\nThe game follows a \"metroidvania\" style and while you can choose the player reaches a point where it has to go back to another stage to get specific items. Donald Duck, in a clear homage to Indiana Jones goes on an adventure exploring the style and uses a gun that can shoot plungers, bubbles and popcorn. Various Disney characters are present in this classic. A good Disney game, deserved a remake in HD like Ducktales gained a Ducktales Remastered. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2JhxUB4hoQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2JhxUB4hoQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2JhxUB4hoQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2JhxUB4hoQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [331] Quack Shot Starring Donald Duck", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nLongplay of game Quackshot - Starring Donald Duck for Mega Drive/Genesis.\n\nOne day Donald was stirring in the ancient books of the library of Uncle Scrooge, while the old man took a nap.
