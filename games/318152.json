Using a small deck of critter cards, you need to strategically collect every mushroom from each region within a short number of turns. Each card has its own unique behaviors that can combo with - and against - other cards, leading to a complex system of synergies and sticky situations. Puzzles are procedurally generated, meaning every delivery is a completely one-of-a-kind challenge with at least one solution. While most of your deliveries can be completed with ease, some of them may leave you scrambling to collect that last mushroom!", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spilled-mushrooms"}
