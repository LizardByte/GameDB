I'll answer some questions I think I would get!\n\nQ: Why did V3 take so long?\nA: The scope of Hero Mode has increased vastly since development on V3 started, originally it was meant to be V2 with a few new tweaks, however it now also has new songs, badges, story, skins, and new mechanics!\n\nQ: How much does the demo change?\nA: Once completed, the V3 demo will end after entering Chapter 2's pipe.\n\nQ: Will future updates of the demo add more chapters?\nA: Yes. Chapter 2, balances changes, and general bug fixes.\n\nQ: When will the demo / full game come out?\nA: There is no release date. It will come out when it\u2019s ready.\n\nQ: How can I get a US TTYD ISO?\nA: You need a legal copy of TTYD (US) and a softmodded wii, you can look up a guide on how to dump the rom from the disc.\n\nQ: Can we see anything you're working on?\nA: Yeah, in my discord: https://discord.gg/t8NXUUD\n\nQ: Do you Like Mario?\nA: I am Mario.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed the video, It was fun making and I did rush the ending a bit but It had to be done. I have to finish polishing the DEMO and I did NOT want the trailer to consume all of my time doing so! So here is a treat for now! See ya soon.\n---------------------------------------------\nMy Socials:\n\u25baPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/ReedQT\n\u25baTwitter: https://twitter.com/Reed_QT\n\u25baTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/Reed_QT\n\u25baDiscord: https://discord.gg/t8NXUUD\n\u25baTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@Reed_QTpie\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\u266bMusic\u266a - \u30ab\u30df\u30a4\u30ed\u30a2\u30ef\u30bb \u00b7 binaria\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVzB53BK9Xc", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKEk7NHvC6M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKEk7NHvC6M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKEk7NHvC6M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKEk7NHvC6M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKEk7NHvC6M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Paper Mario: TTYD Hero Mode | Trailer (READ DESCRIPTION)", "description": "\ud83d\udca5Subscribe & Like for more!\ud83d\udca5\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nThe Trailer is finally here!
