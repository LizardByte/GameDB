Her main method of attack is to shoot feathers from her wings, but she has other methods, such as a bag that she can use to capture and throw enemies. She can use her wings to keep her in the air, though, being young, she can only flap them several times before she needs to rest on the ground again. \n \nThis adventure takes the player through a variety of stages that are simplistic and fun in their own ways. Day in the Life of a Harpy is a short , but uplifting experience.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/day-in-the-life-of-a-harpy"}
