Travel through Australia and experience its culture in this comical adventure as you guide bush pilot \"Down Under Dan\" after he crash lands his plane in an unknown area.

Just before the bank decides to repossess his craft, a friend tells him of rumored fortunes being made. So buckle in and head out into the harsh, remote and baffling Outback in search of huge opals that are apparently just waiting to be picked off the ground. Blue beauties! How hard can that be?\n\nThe game has photorealistic settings and uses digitized video animations. It has a standard adventure game inventory using Dan's backpack where appropriate items must be gathered and used in the correct place and manner. It also holds hints - the more you play, the more you can view.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-adventures-of-down-under-dan"}
