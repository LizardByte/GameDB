Play as The Guy, whose parents apparently were too lazy to give him a proper name. Experience feudal injustice, inquisition, witch-hunting, and join The Grand Tournament. Meet valiant, yet incredibly stupid knights. Complete a wide variety of twisted missions and quests, or don\u2019t give a damn about the plot and bring mayhem in the villages and cities. Choose to go on foot, or by a stolen horse. Fight with a sword or pick a fancy automatic crossbow. All that, spiced up with an inappropriate Monty Python-inspired sense of humor.\n\nFollow us on:\nWeb: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3rpVmMh\nTwitch: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3vVI6CJ\nTwitter: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3fdOUFK\nFacebook: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/2NWKVCw", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N2uaQLfUVho/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N2uaQLfUVho/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N2uaQLfUVho/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N2uaQLfUVho/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N2uaQLfUVho/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Rustler (Grand Theft Horse) - Release Trailer", "description": "\u2705 Link to the game \ud83d\udc49   https://bit.ly/3HaLPSO\n\nRustler is an open-world, top-down action game paying tribute to the good old GTA style and gameplay, fusing it with a historically inaccurate medieval setting.
