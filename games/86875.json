If you make a mistake, simply tap the Undo button. Zoom in and out by pinching the screen and pan the view using a two finger drag.\n\nWhile testing, you can see how the strain is distributed across your design. Areas that are under immense strain are colored bright red, while other areas are colored green. This allows you to find and fix problem areas in your design. \n\nThe finger test lets you use your finger to push and pull on your design. You can use this with pinpoint accuracy, or you can just smash your design to smithereens. The finger test has an explosive new twist. You can now create explosions by tapping the screen for ultimate annihilation.\n\nThe newly added Bomb Shack level includes a dummy with full support for ragdoll physics. Throw him around, blow him up, and smash him against your design.\n\nThe slow motion feature lets you slow things down so you can see how your design is failing, and it is also incredibly fun to watch explosions destroying your design in slow motion. \n\nFeatures\n* Realistic physics simulation\n* Ragdoll physics\n* Slow motion mode\n* Stress display shows problem areas in your design\n* Wide variety of levels!\n* Finger Test - smash your design to pieces, or blow it up with realistic explosions!\n* Save/Load designs\n* E-mail your blueprints to your friends\n* Universal support for the iPad", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simplephysics"}
