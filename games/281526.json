Your playing style affects the chance for snek to get corrupted by food.\n\nEarn bonus score by picking up food guaranteed to not corrupt snek. Corruption can spawn bad food, grow snek, make the play field shake or melt in with the background.\n\nAvoid corruption long enough to unlock the secret level!\n\nThe game has been tested on a PAL Atari 600XL expanded to 64K, and an PAL Atari 130XE. The game should work fine on NTSC machines, and the snek speed is adapted to be the same on both variants to make high score table fair.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smol-snek", "videos": [{"id": 104164, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Ow0AKn0Q9fk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0AKn0Q9fk", "title": "ATARI XL / XE += SMOLL SNEK =+ NEW GAME 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ow0AKn0Q9fk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
