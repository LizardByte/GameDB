The Skulhdor Raiders are said to be Vikings that were banished from Iceland, but now their warmongering has led them south. When they found our kingdom to be rich in rare minerals, they plundered the villages and drove the people away.\n\nIn a last ditch effort to prevent total defeat, King Gromir has sent out a group of elite warriors on a perilous quest. Tasked with overcoming great odds, they must make the most out of any resources they can find. The only way they stand a chance to win is by exploiting the enemy's weaknesses using guile rather than brute force.\n\nThese missions will help rebuild the kingdom so that it may thrive again. The people have lost their homes, the mills are not producing food, the road blocks have halted trade, and without their forts and strongholds, the town is left defenseless.\n\nThe casualties of the war have been great, and the few who are left are starving. Though as long as hope remains, they will gladly show their support to the brave few who venture forth to drive back the evil barbarians.\n\nThese brave men will be known henceforth as The Last Cohort!", "summary": "The Last Cohort combines RTS elements with small-scale tactics to create uniquely challenging missions.
