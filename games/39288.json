The series is known as Dark Seal in Japan.\n\nThe class types to choose from are wizard, bard, knight, elf or dwarf. Each of the heroes has a unique standard attack, access to magic and one passive ability. The wizard does maximum magic damage, the bard is resistant to poison, the knight is immune to disease, the elf has increased mobility and the dwarf is resistant to confusion. Unlike the previous game, magic attacks are not unique to each class, though specific characters have a higher chance of using certain attacks. There is also the chance, for any class except the wizard, that the spell will fail and you will transform into a pig for a short time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wizard-fire", "videos": [{"id": 54666, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "M9BW3c9_vbE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9BW3c9_vbE", "title": "Wizard Fire (Arcade) Playthrough longplay retro video game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M9BW3c9_vbE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 54667, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FfxDihoQtT4"}]}
