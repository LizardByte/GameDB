There are a variety of enemies that will hunt you down, and a few little tactics you can use to take them down. Try to get the best score and stay on top of the leaderboard. The game is played from a top-down perspective. All your enemies are in view 90% of the time so it's easy to see and, most importantly, blow them apart. Don't sit still for long, they're coming for you. Can you handle the pressure?", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arcadia"}
