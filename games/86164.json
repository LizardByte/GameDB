It was released for the Taito Type-X2 arcade system in July 2008. It is the only arcade release made for the KOF: MI series. It adds the classic 3 on 3 game play from the 2D KOF series with the hopes of winning over the series' fanbase as well as new players. The game was also released for the PlayStation 2 only in Japan on July 26, 2008.\n\nThe new original character added to the roster is Xiao Lon, Duo Lon's adopted sister and an assassin ninja of the Hizoku clan. She is usually a normal and curious girl. Prone to crying and mercy, she is disliked by most of her clan and her powers alienate her from being truly accepted into society. She reverts to being an assassin once she leaves her home but seems to find displeasure in her profession.\n\nOther new additions to the game include Ash Crimson, Blue Mary and Makoto Mizoguchi from Fighter's History series.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 54392, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "P_4ziHvrRNU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_4ziHvrRNU", "title": "KoF Maximum Impact Regulation A playthrough (PS2) (1CC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P_4ziHvrRNU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
