This time I completed the game with saves and in better quality compared to the previous video which I removed. This game is hard enough on novice difficulty. Everything gets even faster on harder difficulty levels.\r\n\r\nThe movement of snakes is unpredictable and timing of jumps cannot be based on previous experience. Sometimes an unavoidable snake appears underneath just when landing.
