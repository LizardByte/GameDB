This minimizes the exploration aspect to a large extend. The goal of this hack is to remove the linearity as much as possible, without changing anything substantial. In fact, the author very much aimed at the changes being completely unnoticeable if not invisible.\n\nObviously, it would not make sense to allow access to everything at any time. There are a few necessary \u201csync points\u201d for the story: Link needs all pendants to get the Master Sword, to fight Aghanim, to transfer to the Dark World. Link needs all crystals to access Ganon\u2019s tower. Etc. Thus the goal is to allow an \u201cas arbitrary as possible\u201d order for getting the crystals and pendants, respectively.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
