The rules are similar to standard volleyball: the player gains points if the ball touches the ground on his opponent's side, a player can touch the ball only three times before sending it to the other side, and the game ends when one player has scored 15 points. One-player and two-player modes are available. The players can customize the appearance of their character, including color and hairstyle."}
