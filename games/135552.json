It is the first game in the beatmania series to have a home release. Which in turn is part of the BEMANI franchise.\n\nThis game is based on the engine from beatmania 2ndMIX and contains many songs from that game. A second CD is also included with the package, beatmania APPEND YebisuMIX, exclusive to this release. The base game is what is called a \"Key disc\", meaning it can be used to launch other APPEND games in the series, this was made so that they could contain more music and assets on the game without having to ship the engine.\n\nBeatmania is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch.\n\nThe game contain 23 songs from the arcade game Beatmania 2ndMIX, the bonus CD Beatmania YebisuMIX contains an extra 9 songs for a total of 32 songs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatmania--1", "videos": [{"id": 38046, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3iREEJKK2wA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iREEJKK2wA", "title": "PSX Longplay [053] Beatmania", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3iREEJKK2wA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 38047, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "t_xTBmNZtzY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_xTBmNZtzY", "title": "beatmania YebisuMIX - METALGEAR SOLID \uff5eMain Theme", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t_xTBmNZtzY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
