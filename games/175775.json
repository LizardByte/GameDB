The enclave maintains no diplomatic relationship with the surrounding so-called \u00abRepublic of Austria\u00bb or with the Fortress \u00abEuropean Union\u00bb. The downfall of her motherland -- the Soviet Union -- in the early 1990s had a particularly bad effect on the country\u2019s economic situation.\n\nIt is a great challenge to secure survival for the small but proud confederation. External reactionary forces put the country in danger. It\u2019s a lack of respect due to a morally corrupted and perhaps even non-existing unity of the peoples. The goal of a glorious future is almost unreachable.\n\nBut there are a handful of people who don\u2019t give up on a vision for a better tomorrow. Let us tell you the stories of the brave citizens in the beautiful little country of Soviet Unterz\u00f6gersdorf.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soviet-unterzoegersdorf-sector-i"}
