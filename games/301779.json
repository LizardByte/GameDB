Alice considers herself a sophisticated, elegant lady, and she has no desire to go tramping through muddy fields to visit crumbling old castles.\n\nUnfortunately for Alice, however, her dad is determined to spend their summer in Skye so he can meet up with a former friend, Ian Carter, and his family: his wife, the haughty Hilda, and their ginger spawn, the loud and boisterous Piper.\n\nAlice hasn\u2019t seen Piper since they were small children, and she has few memories of her. She doubts that she\u2019ll be able to get on with anybody who lives on a teeny-tiny island full of sheep, but Alice is pleasantly surprised.\n\nPiper isn\u2019t as abrasive as her father, or as stuck-up as her mother. Piper is cheerful and laid-back, and she takes a liking to Alice almost at once.\n\nA friendship begins to blossom between the two girls \u2013 but what will happen when Alice\u2019s holiday ends and she has to go back to London?", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clear-skye-thinking"}
