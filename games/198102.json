Set in Sweden Carol helps her friend Andrea who suffers from temporary memory loss induced by a drug. Soon it turns out this event is not only tied to the unresolved murder of Andrea's daughter two years before, but also to a Swedish Arctic balloon expedition in 1915. The game uses its trademark first-person view with photographs of real locations and objects in a fixed-screen slideshow style. There are puzzles to solve with items stored in an inventory near the top of the screen. A journal is used to keep track of objectives.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-fall-of-april", "collections": [{"id": 1860, "name": "Carol Reed Mysteries"}]}
