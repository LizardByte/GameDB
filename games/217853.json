Visit all the islands on the home planet Lyramion and even fly to the two moons which both are home to unexpected inhabitants.\n\nThe ingame experience and game mechanics are indentical to the original game by Thalion Software but the remake allows higher resolutions, fullscreen mode, music volume, an optional cheat console, an optional graphic filter, an optional auto derune function and much more.\n\nOf course the usability was improved a bit as well but without destroying the retro flair.\n\nNo matter if you are a fan of Ambermoon or retro games in general or if you are just someone who wants to play a lovely crafted RPG with a huge world and story, this game is exactly what you are looking for.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
