Along the way, children search for hidden objects, meet characters called \"Just-Me's\", discover interesting facts and play games to restore six troubled environments to their natural state. Learn about the effects of acid rain and too much pollution. Snorkel to inspect a coral reef or sing in the swamp. Play \"Truth or Siberia\" with Boris the Bear and Syd the Tiger or \"Stash the Trash\" at a city dump where the garbage just keeps coming! A Things To Do List, experiments and web addresses for eco-friendly sites are included in a companion journal.\n\nWith over 200 animated sequences and original music videos, Jubilee's Journey is a great way to introduce environmental issues while teaching children ages 6 and up, how to make a difference in the world around them.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jubilees-journey-a-jane-goodall-environmental-adventure"}
