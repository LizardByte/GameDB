Using the same engine and mechanics as Dofus MMORPG, the player creates an Eliatrope child, meets a cast of important NPCs and discovers the inner workings of their secluded society, while being exposed to little-known aspects of Eliatrope history.\n\nEach game follows a season of the animated series, with a new dungeon released for every episode. In several cases, this meant the inclusion of characters or locations from the show, resulting in interactions that are likely not considered canon (for example, in Les Gardiens, the player and the Eliatrope Fraise are involved in Remington Smisse's evasion from the Knight Justice prison). The second game was interrupted before the season concluded as the team working on the game was needed for other projects. As a last effort, they created an animated end sequence to wrap the storyline on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe story has its main focus on the character N (now retconned), an Eliatrope who was convinced that there was more to the world outside Emrub. Yet Baltazar, the Dragon responsible for the children's safety, insisted that there was no way out, and nothing outside. When a space-time rift opened in front of him, caused by Nox's and Count Harebourg's important manipulations of time, N jumped in, determined to find the truth. He ended up in the World of Twelve during the Age of the Dofus and spent some time around Harebourg before Baltazar found a way to bring him back to Emrub.\n\nHaving exposed the Dragon's lie, N was furious and rebelled against him, but was captured and chained, everyone thinking he was a madman. The council decided to confine him to a secret prison, and Baltazar wiped the Eliatropes' memory to make sure that everyone forgot the incident and N himself. Ultimately, the pariah was freed by accident and blew the entire Emrub apart in a titanic clash fueled by his tremendous rage.", "summary": "Wakfu: Les Gardiens is a browser game intended as an initiation to MMORPGs for young teens and a crossover link to the animated series \"WAKFU\", released by ANKAMA and broadcasted by France 3.\n\nSince 2014, ASHES, an association composed by three players (Krayth, Kyosset and Starlight) worked on its restoration. Reconstituted to be identical to the original, the game is online on a free fan-made server without any kind of monetization.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wakfu-les-gardiens", "videos": [{"id": 54447, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MJs4pue17xc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJs4pue17xc", "title": "WAKFU : les Gardiens | ASHES", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MJs4pue17xc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
