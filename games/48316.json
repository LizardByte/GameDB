The game is based on the two time attack modes from the 1990 Turbografx-16 vertical shoot \u2019em up Super Star Soldier, in which you try to achieve the highest possible score in either 2 or 5 minutes. So there are only two short stages in the game, with the boss battles at the end of each one. Aside from the standard enemies, boxes, and gems, there are various hidden bonuses you can get for extra points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blade-buster"}
