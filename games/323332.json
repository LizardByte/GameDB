Many resources from that project have been lifted wholesale, or slightly tweaked for taste. Included is a new palette by Fuzzball, music by Jimmy and AD_79, and a surprise new enemy. A sprawling reactor base featuring over 1200 monsters, all in tightly-wound and highly-calibrated setpiece encounters, along with some nasty incidental traps along the way.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vesuvius"}
