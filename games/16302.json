Your pizza's here!\" You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence. You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you. You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house. Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive. This may be your last pizza delivery. Can you survive the night?", "summary": "Emily Wants to Play is a unique horror game released on December 10th, 2015.\nEmily Wants to Play is a game based around you, a pizza delivery boy, making your way through an abandoned house, trying to survive until the large clock in the den hits the next hour.
