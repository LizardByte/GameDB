Capable of great feats of a mystical nature, he summons three children (Remeer, whose name is a reference to past works, Alice, and Lydia-- a hidden character who is only playable after you clear the game with the other two) to brave several trials by invoking the power of the \"Arks\" to learn about true Courage, Wisdom, Power, Friendship, Dreams, Memories and Hope. While the main objective of each character is the same, the dialogue is different and the way each area plays out is different -- Remeer is the strongest of the three and excels in combat, but is not as intelligent as Alice and has alternative, harder events needed to accomplish goals. Alice is weaker than Remeer but is smart and scholarly, and her polite nature and cuteness make most characters more agreeable and willing to help her during events. Lydia is the youngest and most difficult character to use -- while most characters will help her like Alice, her small frame makes her incapable of fighting properly, so she must avoid enemies at all costs unless prompted otherwise.", "summary": "Sequel to Mystic Ark from the SNES. This is a pure adventure game, shedding all the JRPG elements the series had up to that point, eliminating all random encounters, making combat an afterthought, and uses the Arks in two iterations for solving puzzles: their Fairy Form and fully awakened Ark Form. They can utilize their powers through cards which can be found or won through games which you'll need to activate different powers from elemental abilities to manipulating a character's thoughts, changing their mind by making them braver or changing their perspective, etc. Subtle differences aside, the rest of the gameplay is fairly standard and includes using items and interacting with objects to progress.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 79071, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "4gMQZuIQoHw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gMQZuIQoHw", "title": "Mystic Ark: Maboroshi Gekijo - Opening 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4gMQZuIQoHw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
