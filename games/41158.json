The game is a single-screen shoot \u2018em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active. \n \nThe first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 40658, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dlsuEWmGLvs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlsuEWmGLvs", "title": "Commodore Amiga Games - Mega Phoenix", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dlsuEWmGLvs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40659, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cn9rLGZ-Gqc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn9rLGZ-Gqc", "title": "Recreativas Espa\u00f1olas: Mega Phoenix (Dinamic/Inder) (1991)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cn9rLGZ-Gqc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
