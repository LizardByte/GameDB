It is the final megawad in the 3 heures d'agonie series, and as with its two predecessors, most maps were made within a three hour time period, differing from most speedmapping events in that there was no singular mapping session, allowing authors to make multiple maps. The project started on 20 January, 2015, not long after the release of the second WAD, but was not released until 6 April, 2017.\n\nAlthough it was considered to be the end of the 3 heures d'agonie series, a single level, L'agonie Finale, was released in 2018.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3-heures-dagonie-3"}
