This time it's not all about speed, but rather pure skill, concentration, and a little luck. The goal is to get as many of the 4 crates you start with to the finish 'zone'. Each crate counts as a 1000 point bonus to an otherwise falling score. Each time you pass a level you unlock the next level, and possibly a new vehicle! Compete locally and globally to gain the highest score on each of the 40 levels! Then take your unlocked vehicles and hone your skills in the free ride arena!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hondunes-truck-trials"}
