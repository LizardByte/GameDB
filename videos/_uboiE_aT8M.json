A few folks have written to ask about the soundtrack, specifically the part around 0:45 to 2:45. Kudos to viewer J4DR4N, who was able to identify this as Brian Scott Bennett's 1978 record \"Voyage (a Journey Into Discoid Funk),\" which unfortunately now is quite rare and expensive!\n\nNew Description Blender Bach (Retro Bach) November 18th, 2021:\nI have realized today that the \"Star Rider (1983)\" video from VintageCG was blocked due to a copyright claim from \"DeepMiningCorpAssoc\" who claimed they owned it. This particular company receives hundreds of thousands of dollars by erroneously claiming they own the copyright on other people's art work. This production is fully owned by Williams Electronics, inc. and Computer Creations, inc. of South Bend, Indiana. I have reuploaded the video without any edits. It is preserved here fully as it was on VintageCG's YouTube Channel. The Original Description I have also placed above from the original upload on VintageCG's YouTube Channel. The video was called \"Star Rider (1983)\" on VintageCG's YouTube Channel. Even the Video Thumbnail is preserved as it was on VintageCG's YouTube Channel. \nThe video had 351,014 views before it was removed. \nThe Video had \ud83d\udc4d5,438 - \ud83d\udc4e64 before it was removed.\nThe whole thing is preserved here.
