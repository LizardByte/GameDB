These are opportunistic mini-missions encountered as you explore the deep unknowns of the Space Hulk that can yield a tactical advantage or be a deadly trap.\n\nExploration and Discovery: Terminators reveal the layout of the Space Hulk as they venture deep into the darkness.\n\nAdditional Weapons, Tactical Options and Game Rules: Game mechanics have been reworked to make Space Hulk Ascension a true video game experience. Combi-weapons (Combi-Melta, Combi-Plasma and a Combi-Flamer) have been added to the game as well different firing modes like aimed shots and alternate flamer patterns.\n\nGenestealer Variations: Genestealers with Fleshhook, Feeder Tendril and Acid Maw biomorphs have been added to the game, each with their own special game mechanics. You can also encounter biomorphs with scythes that have multiple attacks or carapace for increased armor.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 9735, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "d7nzXnpqPqc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7nzXnpqPqc", "title": "Space Hulk Ascension Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d7nzXnpqPqc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
