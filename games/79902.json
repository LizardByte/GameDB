But with your help he can overcome gravity, turn worlds, and even \u2013 escape!\n\nSolving the rotating, physics-based puzzles is easy; just use your finger to continuously turn the cell in both directions around our hero. Of course you also have to make clever use of the Freeze! button, which can overcome gravity. Sound simple? It is \u2013 at first...\n\nFreeze! offers completely new and yet immediately intuitive game mechanics, delightfully gloomy graphics from the internationally renowned pop-up designer and illustrator Jonas Schenk, and a very sinister soundtrack from noted Swiss electronic/trance musician Karl Lukas.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/freeze-the-escape", "videos": [{"id": 59512, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ciQgYVgT0gk"}]}
