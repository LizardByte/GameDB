I know most people follow me for my few Hamilton r/WSB parodies I have put out, but I also happen to be a video game developer! I am currently preparing to launch a Kickstarter for my upcoming game, Bunhouse.\n\nBunhouse is a cute couch co-op greenhouse management game where you play as a bunny. The Kickstarter launches on May 13th, 2021 at 12pm EST.
