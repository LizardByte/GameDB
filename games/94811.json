The main hero must rescue his girlfriend as she was kidnapped by pirates. After the rescue, other hijackers appear all the time - the hero is busy non-stop. Each level is different - ballooning, pirate ship, jungles, a village full of savages ...There are no buttons to interact with - only the joystick.
