The player's car is made out of a gelatin-like substance (hence the name), giving it both flexibility and durability. As the player advances through the level, a meter begins to fill; when it fills to capacity, the player can make the car expand and grow into a monster-truck, allowing it to traverse larger obstacles for a short period of time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jellycar", "videos": [{"id": 92882, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TNx88FMBEfs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNx88FMBEfs", "title": "JellyCar iPhone - First Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TNx88FMBEfs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
