Create the story. \nThroughout the course of Chinese history, upset victories, like the Battle of Guandu and the Battle of Chibi, have proliferated. To make this kind of dramatic battle possible, we have included special large scale strategies called Gambits. Also in these climactic real-time battles, the key to victory is using strategies that best mesh with the rapidly changing conditions on the battlefield. Through the Power Up Kit, the Gambit system has been improved, City Technologies, Foreign tribes, new equipment, and an officer/strategy editor have been added.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-12-with-power-up-kit"}
