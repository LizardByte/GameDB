Time and moves in the game are turn based. Each move is given random zoning type to mark on the map. After you mark zones, you move on to the next cycle and observe the developments in the city.\n\nYou can unlock more advanced types of buildings and structures by completing in-game objectives. Completing objectives also allows you to open different map view tools that will make management easier.\n\nThere are four main types of zones you manage; residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial. You need to constantly try to manage the distance between the zones, the density and the balance between them correctly. Otherwise, escapes from the city may begin, unused buildings may collapse on their own, and the city may collapse with a chain effect.\n\nThe main aim of the game is to keep the administration in your hands as long as possible by ensuring the continuous development of the city and to reach a high population. Stopping city development is part of the game. It's up to you to try again and again to find the best way to keep the city constantly grow.", "summary": "A new city will be established on a flat plain and its administration has been given to you.
