A huge spaceship, the size of a planet was heading through the Solar System with millions of alien colonists on board. Something went wrong, and all of the sudden the alien spaceship lost control. It is yet unknown what caused the crash. However, thanks to this accident the Earth has obtained its very own satellite - the Moon. Most of the aliens died in a crash and just a bunch of them, placed in suspended animation, survived.\n\nWith no one to reanimate them, these poor creatures were doomed to the eternal sleep though. It was a shot from a Russian navy cruiser Aurora main gun that signaled the beginning of the October Revolution of 1917. Drunken sailors missed the Tsar's Winter Palace and hit the Moon instead. This shot deactivated alien sleeping machines and awakened the rest of their crew. A short while after remaining aliens realized that there was only one hope for them to survive - invade Earth.\n\nWhile preparing the invasion, they accidentally discovered with their telescope a sign right in a middle of the largest continent. The sign with a few scratched words on it \u2014 \u00abBackwoods is a Hub of the Earth\u00bb. This shabby road sign was in a tiny godforsaken Russian village Backwoods. Of course alien commanders made a decision to begin the global invasion with capturing such an important strategic point with a mysterious name - Backwoods. Meanwhile, Russia was in a midst of Civil War and Bolsheviks were trying to clear this area of anti-communist forces. Both the front line and Ural River split the village Backwoods in two.\n\nOne part of the village was somehow controlled by the brave Red Army but some remnants of the cowardly Whites were still comfortably stationed on the other side. Both parties were pretty sick and tired of fighting each other and it seemed like they were settled here for a long time. No side had a significant advantage and the end of war a distinct possibility. If it weren't for aliens, the situation was not going to change soon...", "summary": "Red Comrades Save the Galaxy is a 1998 point-and-click graphic adventure game developed by S.K.I.F. and published by Buka Entertainment.
