What if it starred a little animal and didn't feature all that blood and stuff?\n\nYou are a guinea pig. Your cage is pretty boss: it's got pellets, hay, water, and a buddy. It's also got a comfy place for naps. You like napping.\n\nTake naps, wander the world of dreams, and be a small animal in a confusing world. Encounter strange landscapes, take on new forms and powers, and discover what probably doesn't actually happen when a little animal goes to sleep!\n\nThis is a chill exploration game with 100% original graphics, a pretty boss soundtrack, and some very cute li'l piggies.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yume-wheeky"}
