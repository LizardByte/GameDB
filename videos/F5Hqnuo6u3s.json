Next year, the game was cancelled after the show was cancelled.\nBased on the television series airing on Comedy Central, BattleBots has players pitting their custom-designed robotic creations in arena combat against up to three other machines. Three modes of play include Simulation, Arcade, and Multiplayer. Arcade Mode offers the fastest way to participate in the action, offering players a choice of 40 existing BattleBots (including fan favorites Minion, Nightmare, and Enforcer) before entering an arena filled with various power-ups. Players can also enter their own bots in Arcade Mode after first creating them in Simulation Mode, which follows an identical format to the television show. \nSimulation Mode has players advancing their mechanical masterpieces through a series of four weight classes on their way to becoming BattleBot Champion. Twenty different arenas offer such hazards as Pulverizers, Kill Saws, and Hell Raisers. Money raised from tournaments in Simulation Mode can be spent on additional parts, weapons, and decorations like paint, decals, flags, and more. Among the different weapons players can add to their BattleBot are flamethrowers, crushers, and spinning blades. Up to four BattleBot owners can compete simultaneously in Multiplayer Mode, where the last robot standing, spinning, or crawling is declared the winner.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F5Hqnuo6u3s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F5Hqnuo6u3s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F5Hqnuo6u3s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "BattleBots (PS2/GameCube) - Cancelled", "description": "BattleBots was a video game based on the BattleBots license for PlayStation 2 and GameCube developed by Warthog Games and it would have been published by THQ.
