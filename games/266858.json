In the case of State of Decay 2, you throw a curveball. Although this is the 34th update for State of Decay 2, Curveball represents a significant overhaul. This new update, coming to players for free on September 18, is a landmark moment for the game \u2013 not just offering a swathe of new content for the game\u2019s most dedicated players and newcomers alike, but marking a new era in State of Decay 2\u2019s development through the work of Wushu Studios.\n\nWushu, from Liverpool, England, will continue providing support to State of Decay 2 as much of original studio Undead Labs transitions to work on the next entry in the series \u2013 but where you might expect that support to be incremental, Wushu is making a very big splash. Curveball is a major update, touching almost every element of the game, and designed to consistently offer brand new challenges, even to those who have been playing State of Decay 2 since release.\n\nAvailable after the fifth in-game day, curveballs can change the world around your settlement in some very interesting ways. Housed in a new menu, curveballs will periodically appear \u2013 each with their own narrative attached \u2013 offering new objectives, rewards, enemy types and much more. Curveballs can be positive (like finding increased loot) or negative (like buffing regular zombies in multiple ways); they can be timed or objective based; they can affect enemies, your survivors, or other NPCs. Effectively, any element of the game you may have gotten comfortable with can, and often will, change.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/state-of-decay-2-curveball-update", "videos": [{"id": 98001, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "OU1B5eiJSX4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU1B5eiJSX4", "title": "Introducing the CURVEBALL Update | Full Stream VOD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OU1B5eiJSX4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
