The game features slightly over twenty scenarios that are played out on a stylized globe.

There are no skirmish games and no scenario editor to extend the content. An obtuse interface allows for grouping of nearby units and attacks against enemy groups.

Buildings are scattered around the map that can produce new units. Combat victory is given to the side that has the most units; since units cannot retreat from battle, War, The Game becomes a matter of massing as many units together as possible and hoping the enemy can't gather more. With such simple game rules, tactics and strategy lack depth.
