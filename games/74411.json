It pre-dates experiments by id Software (often credited for inventing the first person shooter genre) by two years. It relies on rotary joystick controllers, and had then-revolutionary ray-casting graphics. As an early example of the genre, its gameplay is slower and less fluid than modern third person shooters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-survivor--1"}
