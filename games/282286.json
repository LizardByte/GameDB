He doesn't stop writing weird things and making weird drawings in his notebook, he always seems to be scared and is always scared when you show him a picture.\n\nOn your last day at camp you are awakened with a scream and realize it is your friend's voice. You run to help him, but you can't find him, you run towards where you heard the scream. When you arrive at the place you find your friend dead on the road. You try to help, but it's too late, until a police car appears and arrests you, because they think you murder him.\n\nIn court you try to explain what happened, but because of the lack of evidence no one believes you.\n\nIt sounds like a crazy story, but that's exactly what happened to Parker Hebert. A man whose vacation was ruined by a false accusation. The case became known as \"The Blood Camp Case\". Little did they know that the case would soon take another turn and become known as \"Slenderman, the Return of a Legend\". In this Game you control Parker, who escaped from prison in search of answers about what killed his best friend. For some anomalous reason the station that was supposed to take him to his answers turned into a maze where Slenderman plays cat and mouse hunting. Collect all evidence and escape alive or die trying.", "summary": "Slenderman is back, and he wants to play.
