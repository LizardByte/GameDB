The co-player's character can be one of three other members of the G-Unit crew: Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks, or DJ Whoo Kid, each specializing in different combat techniques. The co-player is either run by the game or through online cooperative play.\nThe game is set in an urban warzone in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, where 50 Cent and G-Unit have been hired to play a rap concert. After the concert the promoter, Anwar is unable to pay them the US $10-million in cash he promised, but relents after being threatened. However, instead of the cash they were promised, he gives them a diamond-and-pearl encrusted human skull (bearing a striking resemblance to a platinum cast diamond encrusted skull by artist Damien Hirst) as collateral. This is promptly stolen by a paramilitary group led by the terrorist Kamal. 50 Cent (with the help of a selected G-Unit partner) decides to get it back at any cost and soon, they find out that there is a much bigger enemy than Kamal.In the video game, he kills Kamal, Anwar and his enemies and he retrieves his skull.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/50-cent-blood-on-the-sand", "videos": [{"id": 62363, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fGNLj8zawFc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGNLj8zawFc", "title": "BLOOD IN THE SAND | Trailer | 50 Cent Music", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fGNLj8zawFc/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 7911, "name": "Carter"}, {"id": 5520, "name": "Raoul"}, {"id": 10126, "name": "Anwar"}, {"id": 10122, "name": "DJ Whoo Kid"}, {"id": 10121, "name": "Lloyd Banks"}, {"id": 10119, "name": "Tony Yayo"}, {"id": 10128, "name": "Enemy"}, {"id": 10117, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 4135, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm36v.jpg"}, "name": "50 Cent", "species": 1}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
