Best described as a cross between Tower Defense, Geometry Wars, and Asteroids, Cereus feels like a retro game with modern touches. \n \nWith challenging gameplay and satisfyingly difficult bosses, you'll need to rely on quick strategy and fast fingers. A skill grid provides gratifying progression that emphasizes versatility rather than increased power, requiring increasingly strategic gameplay on your road to victory.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cereus", "videos": [{"id": 16876, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3jka3ILtKMA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jka3ILtKMA", "title": "Cereus Game Trailer - Get Updates: http://aesth.games/", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3jka3ILtKMA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
