Episode one was first released on October 31, 2007, before being re-issued as a \"New Compact Version\" on May 16, 2008, and is currently the only released portion of Rage Against the Machine. \n \nThe add-on includes a new soundtrack and is intended to add many new levels that are compatible with single player, BloodBath and cooperative play. \n \nThe story is intended to be played out through \"live-action\" cutscenes shown at the end of the episodes. It was created by Matthew \"Daedalus\" Kallis (project leader and mapper), Dimebog (musician), and Filip (oBe) Walgraef (artist and animator). As well as a founder of The Postmortem and later Altar of Stone fan sites, Daedalus was the previous creator of the Sin Campaign mini-episode, which partly utilized assets from BloodLines.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rage-against-the-machine"}
