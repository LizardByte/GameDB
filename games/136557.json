It is possible that as few as four machines were made. Acclaim's Mountain View, California-based coin-op division went out of business shortly after creating the game, so it never went into full production. GamePro reported that Armageddon was shown to their editors behind the scenes at the 1997 ASI show in Las Vegas, but did not appear on the show floor.The arcade board used 3dfx components and included 600 MB of RAM. \n \nGameplay is a cross between real time combat and strategy, with characters representing one of the five colors. White had healing and soldiers; Blue countermagic and water creatures; Black death and undead creatures; Red fire and mountain creatures; and Green elves and forest magic. The game was controlled with a trackball, and supported up to two players. Players could summon creatures to the arena as well as attack the opposing wizard directly", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magic-the-gathering-armageddon"}
