Get your trusty synthball to the target zone, unlock the portal, and drive off into the impossibly colored sunset. But there's one catch.\n\nYou can't interact with the synthball directly. That's why you need cubes and bombs to move it. But first you need to reach them, after jumping, speeding, and wall running your way across neon-soaked landscapes, thinking outside the box to overcome challenges waiting in each level.", "summary": "A hybrid puzzler set in a synthwave world. Complex platforming meets physics-based synthball manipulation, with a dash of high-speed races across a neon-soaked landscape, all set to the tune of a killer electronic soundtrack paying homage to the colorful eighties.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tret", "videos": [{"id": 125923, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "LeiSc5UodZY"}]}
