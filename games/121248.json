Civilizations were destroyed, powers and abilities were diminished, intelligent beings were mutated beyond recognition, and a new invasive and aggressive species begun wreaking havoc on the planets.\n\nWhat caused the Crypto Crystal Storm and where it originated from remains shrouded in mystery, but from what the remaining civilizations pieced together, the storm originated from the unknown parts of space \u2014 the Void.\n\nThe Void is home to many dark and wicked beings that once ruled the Hermeian Galaxy. By using fear and terror to subjugate the civilizations, for a time their rule was absolute. But oppression only works for so long and in the end the Celestial Gods \u2014 children of the Goddess Arcana \u2014 combined forces to banish the old ones into the void.\n\nAs a reward for helping to free the Hermeian Galaxy, Arcana gave each of her children a sector of the galaxy to rule. A galactic peace that lasted for eons ensured; until the Crypto Crystal Storm arrived.\n\nSilently erupting from the Void, solid crystals, massive in size, quickly traveled through the Hermeian Galaxy and took the inhabitants entirely by surprise as they came crashing down on their planets.\n\nThe storm caused galaxy-wide destruction, and for those that survived the ordeal, the problems had only begun. Once embedded in the planet\u2019s crust, the crystals quickly began the process of corrupting life on their host planets.\n\nThe enlightened race called the Trinell underwent a hideous de-evolution, causing their race to almost go extinct.\n\nThe proud race of Rustarian humans were hit with a giant solar flare that reduced their rich planet to a scorched wasteland.\n\nThe highborn of Eldaria \u2014 an ancient race of elves \u2014 rapidly lost their youth and started to turn to dust.\n\nThough they all suffered through trials and tribulations, these races were lucky as they were some of the few that managed to survive. Other species were not as lucky and either died out entirely or were mutated far beyond recognition.", "summary": "Hash Rush is an online sci-fi/fantasy RTS set in the fictional Hermeian galaxy, Hash Rush sees players build, fight and trade their way to victory as they grow and manage their small mining colony, battle monsters, and trade valuable items and resources.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hash-rush", "videos": [{"id": 39374, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AY3lz9TERck", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY3lz9TERck", "title": "Hash Rush Beta Trailer 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AY3lz9TERck/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39377, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "WkhCgIInMb0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkhCgIInMb0", "title": "Learn Hash Rush - Introducing the Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WkhCgIInMb0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39375, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "_1oW7LZce1Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1oW7LZce1Y", "title": "Hash Rush Opening Cinematic", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_1oW7LZce1Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39376, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hBtW8YEjUno", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBtW8YEjUno", "title": "The Zebra Skin", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hBtW8YEjUno/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
