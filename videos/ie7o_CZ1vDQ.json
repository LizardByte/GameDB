{"id": "ie7o_CZ1vDQ", "snippet": {"title": "Arcade Game: Vs. Wrecking Crew (1984 Nintendo)", "description": "A platform game featuring Mario as a wrecking crew and Luigi (if played in 2-player mode) where you must demolish several buildings. You move on to the next and more difficult buildings as you move on to the next level as many buildings have puzzle elements where you must find a way to reach them without getting trapped at the end. Dangerous creatures wandering around throughout the buildings will stop Mario from completing the task. The game has 100 levels.\n\nThis Vs Arcade version released in 1984 a year before the NES version was released and had a dual screen (2 monitors for 2 player co-op) which I cropped out since there's no point in having 2 screens unless there was another player playing with me. Since this was played on MAME, I'm marking it as an arcade game since this game does not seem to work on an NES emulator. Just as difficult as the NES version and also an endless game as after completing 100 levels, the game repeatedly stays at level 99 and does not change after that so I quit afterwards. \n\nInvincibility cheat was used after down to last life.\n\nThis game has some differences from the arcade version such as if Mario is the player, then Luigi is controlled by the CPU and all buildings are seen on the same screen without scrolling.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ie7o_CZ1vDQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ie7o_CZ1vDQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ie7o_CZ1vDQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ie7o_CZ1vDQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ie7o_CZ1vDQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Game: Vs.
