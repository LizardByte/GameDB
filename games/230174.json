Robot battles are all the rage. Fans flock from all four corners of the globe to watch robots duke it out. Competitors rent a bot and send it against a series of other bots. If their bot falls, they lose. But if their bot wins, then the competitors will gain fame and glory (and maybe even a sponsorship) beyond their wildest dreams! You are the latest competitor to challenge the arena. You are randomly assigned a rental bot. Maybe you\u2019ll become the newest champion of the arena. Maybe you\u2019ll fail miserably. Maybe you\u2019re just here to listen to the goofy robot voices. And maybe you\u2019ll get a new friend out of the deal.
