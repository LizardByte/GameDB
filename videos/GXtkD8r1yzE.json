Well... a game of basketball, what else? I don't know if anyone though of that before this game came out, but whatever. It's a fun little game. There are two tournament modes (normal and hard), a dribble bonus game and a exhibition mode where you can customize a single match. Also a Matchup for two players. The pro mode for your opponents you get at the end of the hard tournament mode is only for those single matches, not a separate tournament mode. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GXtkD8r1yzE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GXtkD8r1yzE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GXtkD8r1yzE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GXtkD8r1yzE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GXtkD8r1yzE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nintendo DS Longplay [067] Mario Hoops 3 on 3", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: NPI\n\nWhat would you get if you fuse Mario and Final Fantasy?
