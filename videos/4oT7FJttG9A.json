This is not an emulator.  This footage was recorded directly from my Super Nintendo using an actual Bazooka Blitzkrieg cartridge and the Super Scope light gun.  I'm playing on expert difficulty.\n\nHere's the last Super Scope game that I needed to redo in 60 fps.\n\nLast year I decided to buy some more light gun games, so I took a look at the Super Scope library to see what other titles might be interesting.  Bazooka Blitzkrieg caught my eye, so I picked up a complete copy off Ebay and gave it a shot.  Apparently it's somewhat of a rare game, most likely because it requires the Super Scope.\n\nThe game is rather straightforward.  You progress through five stages blasting robots and occasional aircraft, and you face a boss at the end of each stage.  You only have one life but there are unlimited continues.  You can acquire power-ups along the way such as a shield, life recharges, missile recharges and bombs.  There's also a skull item that will hurt you if you shoot it, similar to the poison mushrooms from Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels.\n\nThe fire button on the Super Scope shoots unlimited rapid-fire shots, but you have to set the Super Scope to turbo or you'll only get semi-automatic shots.  The cursor button fires missiles, and you get a generous amount of those for each level.  Like Yoshi's Safari, there's no cursor on screen, but the rapid-fire shots can be aimed in a similar fashion to the Wii Remote.\n\nEven though this game is simple, it's one of the hardest light gun games I've played so far.  Last year it took me several playthroughs before I figured out how to beat each level and boss.  Then it took several more to refine my gameplay and minimize my deaths.  The instruction manual says you won't get an ending unless you beat the game on expert difficulty, so that made things even more challenging.\n\nThroughout the entire game you have to kill enemies and bosses before they can cut through your life bar.  So that means taking them down as soon as you see them.  Only bosses seem to have weak points, so this is basically a shoot-first game.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game is decent.  It's not too long, and even though it's challenging, you get unlimited continues.  Also, when you continue, you don't necessarily start from the beginning of the stage.  If you've made it about halfway through a level, you'll continue from that spot.  I died once on the final stage but I was able to continue from about the halfway point, which really helped.\n\nRecorded with the Hauppauge HD PVR and the official SNES S-video cable at 60 frames per second.  I used a Toshiba model D-R550 DVD Recorder to upconvert the SNES's native 240p signal to 480i so that the Hauppauge could capture the console's audio/video signal.\n\nThe Super Scope requires a CRT TV to function, and since the Hauppauge only outputs to the TV using component video (a format not supported on my old CRT TV), I used my distribution amplifier to split the SNES's audio/video signal and send one set of cables to the CRT TV while sending the other set of cables to the DVD Recorder/Hauppauge HD PVR combo.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4oT7FJttG9A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4oT7FJttG9A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4oT7FJttG9A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4oT7FJttG9A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4oT7FJttG9A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bazooka Blitzkrieg Playthrough (Actual SNES Capture)", "description": "This is a capture of me playing through Bazooka Blitzkrieg for the SNES.
