The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.\n\nBefore each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices \u2013 pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nigel-mansells-world-championship"}
