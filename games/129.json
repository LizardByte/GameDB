There are 12 scenarios for each race with mostly a single objective: destroy the enemy.\n\nAs with most RTS games of the same era, a lot of time is spent collecting resources and building structures to make/upgrade different types of units.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warcraft-orcs-humans", "videos": [{"id": 212, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "GO1VP5VR-zU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO1VP5VR-zU", "title": "Warcraft: Orcs & Humans - Introduction", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GO1VP5VR-zU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
