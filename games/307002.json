The one that takes the rose to recreate the realms of the forgotten past to a new world. The old world from the original realm has become withered as the curse of Nightmare continues to grow power. You will soon discover through the emulations of reality that the truths of life are not what they appear to be. Now you will travel to these worlds and discover that you are not alone.\n\nAs you return to the depths of the emulated reality, you must find a way to get back to the realm of the withered. This is the place that was considered the finale in the original world before the curse. Nightmare has recreated this forgotten area into his very own realm to represent the ultimate power of his own destruction. This place can now lead to a hidden magical rose which comes with the ultimate power to reset time back before the curse consumed the world. You'll soon discover the hidden truth beyond these emulated realities through the virtual timelines of the past and future.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-dark-place-2", "videos": [{"id": 117543, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "72vyA4UP9C4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72vyA4UP9C4", "title": "A Dark Place 2 Development: Sneak Peek 3 - New Mechanics and Tunnels Level Design Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72vyA4UP9C4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
