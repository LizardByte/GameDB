The supposed culprits are three former retainers of an abolished clan, avenging the execution of their lord by Ogami Itt\u014d. However, the entire matter was planned by Ura-Yagy\u016b (Shadow Yagyu) Yagy\u016b Retsud\u014d, leader of the Ura-Yagy\u016b clan, in order to seize Ogami's post as part of a masterplan to control the three key positions of power: the spy system, the official assassins and the Shogunate Decapitator. During the initial incursion, an ihai (funeral tablet) with the sh\u014dgun's crest on it was placed inside the Ogami family shrine, signifying a supposed wish for the shogun's death. When the tablet is \"discovered\" during the murder investigation, its presence condemns Itt\u014d as a traitor and thus he is forced to forfeit his post.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kozure-ookami"}
