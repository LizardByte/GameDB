The player takes control of one of the four ships and the goal is simple. Destroy the others to rack up the points and win the game. The ship has an energy meter for the weapon, so if you shoot too much you need to recharge for a while to get the firing rate back up. There are also two type of warp drives which makes the ship appear in a different location on the screen as well as a shield that absorbs some of the damage when used. The player has the option of either playing against human players or up to four bots, which are set to learn from the player's style of play and adapt to it to increase the difficulty over time.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/1337-ship-deathmatch"}
