{"id": "GV-RFmdkoII", "snippet": {"title": "Monster Truck Trip 2 - Game preview / gameplay", "description": "Who doesn't love monster trucks?  Really, what's there not to love, huge, hulking behemoths driving around crushing lesser vehicles into powdery debris.  And that's exactly what we get in Monster Truck Trip 2.\n\nWhile this game may look like the typical sidescrolling racer, it's a whole lot more than that.  It plays like one, sure, but it's got a lot of its own oomph to add to the genre.\n\nThe graphics are well drawn and nicely animated.  You've also got a level of detail not typically seen with these games.  You can see the rust on your beat up old truck, the wheels turning as they smash into smaller cars, and the shattered explosions of said smaller cars.  The background, while not exactly a part of the game, adds a great atmosphere that works very well with the game.  And if you accidentally flip over, you'll be treated to a lovely little animation of flaming explosions.\n\nAs is usual with these games, the up and down keys will accelerate and decelerate you while the left and right keys allow you to balance your truck to prevent it from flipping over (unless you really want to see that death animation.  Go ahead, it's pretty cool, we won't hold it against you) or to make jumps -just- right to catch that ramp that has oodles of bonus points to get and cars to crush.  You can also get a boost of nitro by hitting z or n, for those times when you need that extra blast.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to others in its genre, but it has more to it than just that.  Rather than just going from point A to point B, you're able to have fun along the way by doing what monster trucks do best: demolish other cars.  There are heaps of cars, buses, trucks, and other destroyables lying around for you to destroy.  In addition, you've also got bonus stars that add to your score which in turn allows you to upgrade your monster truck with better wheels, nicer paint, better handling, and so on and so forth.\n\nBe sure not to miss out on this one; granted, it's not really a long-lived game, but it's a given that the time you do spend playing Monster Truck Trip 2 will be time well spent.\n\n```\nOther \"Monster Truck Trip\" Game Sequels (Playlist) - http://goo.gl/fXPvZa\n\n**********************************************************\nSubscribe to new gaming videos!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/FreeGamesExplorer\n\n**********************************************************", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GV-RFmdkoII/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GV-RFmdkoII/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GV-RFmdkoII/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Monster Truck Trip 2 - Game preview / gameplay", "description": "Who doesn't love monster trucks?
