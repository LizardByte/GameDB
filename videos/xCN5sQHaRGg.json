Set in the depths of the North Sea in the techno-futuristic 1970s, professional diver Stan is struggling to overcome a life-changing loss and embrace a new future. The isolation of the deep sea is a fitting manifestation of his state of mind, and as Stan retreads further into his self-imposed solitude, he starts to experience strange events far beneath the waves. He will eventually have to make a difficult choice... stay lost in the depths forever, or break free to the surface and to the rest of his life.\n\nUnder The Waves \u00a9 2022 Parallel Studio.
