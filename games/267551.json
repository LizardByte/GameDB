Pick up numbers adding or subtracting to or from your value. Never go below 0 or above 9.\nIn case you are overwhelmed you can trigger one of three bombs by keeping the fire button pushed for a second.\n\nToo easy for you? Go insane with a second player in coop or versus modes!\n\nCan you enter the highscore table?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magic-math"}
