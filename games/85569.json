Earth has been invaded but, mankind has carved existence into the other colonies looking to help out with the conflict rookie Defender pilot Kyoto joins the Galactic Stargate Authority to protect mankind. But shortly after Kyoto finishes training, the Cydonia Base is attacked by the next swarm of Manti which has had the chance to fortify since the last event. The Manti push the GSA back to the far end of the Solar System, and begin to wipe the humans away forever. Kyoto will have to be dispatched on vital missions by the Battleship Memory, receive criticism from Colonel Adams, and learn more about the Manti from Dr. Mudo, to defeat the second alien swarm.", "summary": "Defender is an updated version of the classic arcade game of the same name. The Manti bugs have invaded earth and the remaining human survivors now live in colonies throughout the solar system. As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You've been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for your ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 50004, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_teSL-_jC80", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_teSL-_jC80", "title": "Longplay of Defender", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_teSL-_jC80/sddefault.jpg"}]}
