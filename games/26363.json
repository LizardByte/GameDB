The Evil ruler of the company, Le Docteur, has insane plans that threatens them all with a terrible fate.\n\nAlong his journey, the player will have to master the power of his paint cannon. He will soon find out that each color offers special abilities, from crazy bouncing to sticking to walls, or even tricking encounters and changing their behaviour.
