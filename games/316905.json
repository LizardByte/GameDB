Gotham City was in a state of despair. The city had been turned into a war zone after Bane\u2019s bombs rocked the west side, with the Riddler being the main ringleader of the event. Whole city blocks were under dispute by ferocious gangs and murderous Arkham inmates alike, with innocents often caught in the crossfire. However, one question was on everyone\u2019s mind, where was the Joker? A year later Gotham is still under repair, with all the culprits of the incident safely locked away in Arkham. But Batman knows better, for a new threat has come to Gotham, one that threatens to reinstate the chaos, to bring back the Joker, Bane, and the Riddler. It may already be too late to stop this mysterious individual, for his league of shadows will carry out his orders even when he is gone. Will Batman be able to control the situation and save the city once again, or will the number of his opponents be too great?", "summary": "Batman rogue city is a doom total conversion mod featuring the famous caped crusader as he works to take down his rogues gallery once again.
