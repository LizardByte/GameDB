Check out the VGA Reveal Trailer to relive history as it never happened and ignite a new revolution!\n\n  \n ABOUT ASSASSIN\u2019S CREED III:\n The year is 1775. The American colonies are about to revolt. You are Connor, an assassin who has sworn to secure liberty for his people and his nation. To do so, you will hunt your enemies across a staggeringly large, open, and realistic world. You will unleash your lethal skills in a violent quest that will take you from chaotic city streets to blood-soaked battlefields in the hostile American wilderness and beyond. You will meet legendary heroes of American history, and together you will conspire to annihilate those who threaten Liberty itself. \n  \n Whether you use your predatory instincts to kill silently, or your fearsome arsenal to kill openly, one thing is clear: the world that the Assassin\u2019s live in has become far more deadly. And so have you. \n  \n KEY FEATURES\n  \n CONNER, A NEW ASSASSIN\n You are Connor, a warrior son of a Native American mother and British father. As a bloody revolution draws ever nearer, your clan is threatened by a powerful group seeking to crush the American revolution and control the thirteen colonies. \n  \n Shocked into action by the devastation of your village, you pledge your life to the cause of freedom, and embark on a decades-long quest to achieve it. \n  \n THE SETTING\n There\u2019s the American Revolution you know from history books. And then there\u2019s the revolution you\u2019ll be fighting, set in a world that\u2019s far more realistic, gritty, and alive than any history book could be. \n  \n NAVAL WARFARE\n In Assassin\u2019s Creed III Connor will battle his enemies not only on land, but also on the high seas aboard his stalwart vessel, the Aquila.\n  \n You\u2019ll navigate tumultuous waters and command your own naval warship, sending enemies to their watery graves with cannons and an array of powerful naval weaponry. Or should you choose, ready a boarding party and take the fight to the enemy by battling hand-to-hand on the deck of their own ship. \n  \n ANVIL NEXT\n Experience the jaw-dropping power of Anvil Next, the all-new engine designed exclusively for Assassin\u2019s Creed III. \n  \n The team spent three years building this revolutionary system from the ground up, and the results are nothing short of breathtaking. \n  \n It begins with stunning breakthroughs in motion-capture, animation, and AI technology, which deliver more realistic character animations and interactions than ever before. It continues with dynamic weather, seasons and time, which significantly affect the world around you. And no all-new engine would be complete without a dramatically expanded combat and stealth system. \n  \n  \n Assassin's Creed III: DLC - VGA Reveal Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]\n https://www.youtube.com/UbisoftNA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RpBG0NWJkkY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RpBG0NWJkkY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RpBG0NWJkkY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RpBG0NWJkkY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RpBG0NWJkkY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Assassin's Creed III: DLC - VGA Reveal Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]", "description": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins is now available!\n  \n Watch the Official Launch Trailer: http://ubi.li/8ytgx\n  \n #AssassinsCreed\n  \n Please SUBSCRIBE and visit our official channels for exclusive access and the latest information on all things Assassin\u2019s Creed:\n #AssassinsCreed\n https://AssassinsCreed.com \n https://www.facebook.com/assassinscreed\n https://instagram.com/AssassinsCreed_US\n https://twitter.com/assassinscreed\n https://www.youtube.com/UbisoftNA\n\nDiscover all our Assassin's Creed products and exclusive items on the Ubisoft Store: http://ubi.li/8fcmd\n  \n Assassin's Creed\u00ae III: The Tyranny of King Washington - VGA Reveal Trailer\n Welcome to Assassin's Creed III's Tyranny of King Washington -- a 3-part DLC series exploring an alternate reality in which George Washington goes mad with unlimited power, foregoing Presidency to rule as tyrannical King.
