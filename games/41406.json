In the year LP0002, Patton Helman, prince of the Helman Republic, sought to end this eternal conflict once and for all and conquer Leazas in a reckless bid to win his father's approval.\n\nAllying himself with the enigmatic Dark Lord Noce, Patton succeeds in overrunning the Leazas capital city in a single night with the forces of the Helman 3rd Army and a large swarm of monsters, placing the prosperous nation under enemy occupation. His ego swelled by his early victory, Patton orders his troops to begin entering the neighboring territories of the Free Cities Alliance, planning to make his achievement even greater in the process.\n\nUnbeknownst to Patton, Noce possesses an agenda of his own that goes far beyond mere conquest. Deep within the lowest recesses of Leazas Castle, a terrifying power lies dormant. Sealed by the legendary Dark Sword Chaos, Noce intends to unleash this power onto the world, plunging it into an age of unimaginable despair and torment.\n\nAnticipating Noce's intentions, Princess Lia Parapara Leazas orders her personal ninja Kentou Kanami to flee from Leazas with the royal family's treasured Holy Shield, one of the three items needed to gain entry into the chamber where Chaos resides, and seek out the man that she entrusted with the other two. The fate of her country and the entire Continent hanging in the balance, Lia places all of her faith into this man.\n\nAn outrageous man in possession of abilities that go far beyond all others.\n\nA conceited man who thinks only of himself at all times.\n\nA carefree man who always charges blindly forward without ever considering the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe man called Rance.\n\nThus, the curtain rises on this man's greatest adventure yet.", "summary": "The money Rance got in Custom City as payment for his latest detective work has been long gone.
