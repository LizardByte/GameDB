Legend tells of an evil king known as the Dark King Onyx who brought tragedy and darkness to the kingdom by stealing six magical orbs. However a hero rose up against the Dark King and with his legendary sword as well as the power of the orbs, he sealed Onyx away within another orb. However, the forces of evil rose again as the Dark Bishop Fuelle stole the orb and threw the Kingdom of Dotnia into a state of chaos once more. The game's main protagonist is the grandchild of the brave hero who sealed away the Dark King and thus is entrusted with the responsibility to save the land.\n\nThe kingdom was once a 2D pixelated world but as the King of the Land felt that sprites were outdated he thus decreed for the kingdom to make the switch to 3D. This caused the entire world to become 3D while still retaining its original pixelated look", "summary": "3D Dot Game Heroes is an action adventure title paying a strong homage to 8bit adventure games such as The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy Adventures.\nThe game uses a unique style, presenting 2D retro-style graphics in a 3D environment using voxels", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-dot-game-heroes", "videos": [{"id": 4603, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hoFYEtj2tDw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoFYEtj2tDw", "title": "3D Dot Game Heroes Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoFYEtj2tDw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 63598, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JlWsZXGJahg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlWsZXGJahg", "title": "Atlus USA Trailer: 3D Dot Game Heroes", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JlWsZXGJahg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
