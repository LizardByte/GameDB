The player controls Aldo who climbs ladders onto steel beams while dodging barrels and grabbing treasure. A timer counts down and each bit of treasure adds to the player's score at the end of each stage. Aldo eventually careens across the skyscrapers of Kong City attempting to steal a treasure chest from an enemy helicopter, and in the next stage we realize he is a wanted criminal. No giant ape makes an appearance, and barrels materialize from no where to torment Aldo. If a player loses all of their lives, they are pushed back to the DOS command prompt.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aldos-assault"}
