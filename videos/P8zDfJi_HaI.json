The name \"Vanishing Point\" refers to the fact that the game lacks Pop-up. \nThe main mode which is Arcade Mode is where you race against opponents in circuit races, but the goal is to finish the race with the fastest lap time which is the Vanishing Point (hence the title). The game is provided with supposedly accurate car physics, which can be experienced through various game modes, tracks and cars. The majority of content is initially locked and is progressively unlocked as you play through the game. Stunt Mode is unique in that the player must complete short courses that involve a variety of jumps, barrel rolls, chicanes and collectable balloons against a time limit. \n\n#AES\n#MVS\n#SNK\n#WorldHeroes2\n#StreetFighter2\n#X68K\n#SharpX68000\n#games \n#retrogames\n#retrogaming\n#videogames\n#zagrajmy\n#letsplay\n#retro\n#Playstation\n#amiga\n#Nintendo\n#SNES\n#ps4 \n#swith \n#xbox \n#xbox360 \n#nintendods \n#nintendo3ds \n#gameboy \n#gameboyadvance \n#gameboycolor \n#ps1 \n#ps2 \n#ps3 \n#ps5 \n#playstation \n#xboxone \n#wii \n#wiiu\n#DOS\n#pcwindows\n#Sega\n#Megadrive\n#Genesis\n#gameboyadvance \n#gameplay \n#letsplay\n#shorts \n#short \n#shortvideo \n#shortsvideo\n#gaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8zDfJi_HaI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8zDfJi_HaI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8zDfJi_HaI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Vanishing Point Dreamcast  Playthrough Longplay HD HQ By Urien84", "description": "PLAYED BY TheUrien84 \nSubscribe for more videos.
