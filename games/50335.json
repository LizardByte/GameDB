Curious, Mario attempts to type on it. However, he proves to be a terrible typist. Before Mario can go on any further, the Magical Typewriter explodes. In place of the typewriter is a scroll, which is also floating in the air. Mario takes the typewriter and sees a picture of three pieces of the Magical Typewriter. Mario and Luigi decide to recover all of the pieces and improve Mario's typing skills.", "summary": "Mario Teaches Typing is one of the few licensed Mario computer titles. As the title suggests, Mario Teaches Typing was designed for improving a computer user's typing skills. Kids with no typing experience will get the most from the program, while enjoying cute antics of Nintendo's popular Mario brothers. All of the game's music was sampled from Super Mario World.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-teaches-typing", "videos": [{"id": 35154, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "r-LxHUgI2W0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-LxHUgI2W0", "title": "Mario Teaches Typing (1992) PC Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r-LxHUgI2W0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
