The game includes a number of simulation systems, such as the need to turn on windshield wipers or refuel, as well as a rating system given by cab customers, which is also influenced by their personal tastes. In the game you find yourself in a violent world, so it's equally important to arm your car by choosing from weapons such as a minigun, chainsaw or flamethrower. In addition to missions behind the wheel, you'll also have to grab a weapon on foot, exploring the darkest corners of the city.\n\n\ud83d\uded1 About the creators \ud83d\uded1\nCyberTaxi: Lunatic Nights is being developed by a small studio, consisting of one main designer responsible for most of the game and several people helping with game testing and other smaller aspects. Our ambition is to create the most faithful simulator of a dystopian cab driver and. We intend to launch the game in early access to give ourselves time to develop its mechanics with community input. We plan to refine many gameplay systems and add new content, including more city districts.\n\n\ud83d\uded1 Media/business inquiries \ud83d\uded1\nhedmediagames@gmail.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zeWx8DLtxjY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zeWx8DLtxjY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zeWx8DLtxjY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zeWx8DLtxjY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zeWx8DLtxjY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "CyberTaxi: Lunatic Nights - Debut Gameplay Trailer | Wishlist Now on Steam", "description": "\ud83d\uded1 Wishlist CyberTaxi: Lunatic Nights on Steam \ud83d\uded1\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2927000/CyberTaxi_Lunatic_Nights/\n\n\ud83d\uded1 About the game \ud83d\uded1\nCyberTaxi: Lunatic Nights is an action-packed dystopian cab driver simulator in which you fight for high customer ratings and survival in a crime-ridden city, which you can navigate behind the wheel of a car or on foot.
