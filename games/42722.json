By shining a light on them in a certain way, people can see the phantom world of Lost Heaven.\n\nThe story follows Nayuta Herschel, a young aspiring researcher aiming to see what's further beyond the known world, who was just returning to Remnant Island for the summer, when he and his childhood friend Cygna Alhazen find themselves in the world of Lost Heaven through the guidance of the otherworldly fairy Noi, as they get involved in a plot to stop a madman and his right-hand man from destroying Lost Heaven and potentially Nayuta's own world in the process.", "summary": "Nayuta no Kiseki (Trails of Nayuta) is an action-RPG developed by Nihon Falcom for PlayStation Portable.
