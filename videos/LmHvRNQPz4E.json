Thanks much to Singe for providing the best LD rip that's out there. I gave it some of the ol' AVISynth treatment by removing most of the edge enhancement halos, denoising a bit, and trying to stabilize the animation lines. After the upscale with the BigOldies model I tweaked the color balance to get rid of the some of the red tint. Not a huge project or anything, but I've always loved these types of games for the animation.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmHvRNQPz4E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmHvRNQPz4E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmHvRNQPz4E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmHvRNQPz4E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmHvRNQPz4E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Time Gal - Laserdisc Game - 1080p ESRGAN Upscale", "description": "An upscale of all of the footage from the classic laserdisc game Time Gal.
