I had a copy of it on my dad's old computer, but he has since gotten a new computer and dismembered the old one. For years, I couldn't find any way to download it again, and I assumed that it was discontinued and the only way to play it was to put my dad's old computer back together and play it on there. But today, when I looked it up, I found out about team called DuckWorld Revive, whose goal is to, well, Revive the project. I was able to make a new account and download and play DuckWorld for the first time since 2020.\n\nThe game itself is an edutainment game meant to help children learn subjects like math and Spanish in a fun way, but there are also some games that don't teach you anything and are just meant to be fun games. In this video, I played every minigame at least briefly, and also completed the entire Story Mode. I did have to turn down the graphics in the settings, because it was lagging my shitty school compute way too much.\n\nThe DuckWorld Revive team needs donations to keep the servers running!
