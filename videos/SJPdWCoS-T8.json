{"id": "SJPdWCoS-T8", "snippet": {"title": "Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers Game Sample - N64", "description": "Developed in 1999 alongside \"Shadowgate Classic\" for Game Boy Color, Shadowgate 64: TotFT is one of two Shadowgate titles not developed by ICOM Simulations but by the company known as \"Infinite Ventures\" who acquired the rights to ICOM's game portfolio after the company went completely defunct in 1998. The game takes place centuries after the first Shadowgate where Lord Jair (the original hero) defeated the Warlock and claimed the throne. But as time went by, the kingdom began to decay and bandits, thieves, and other evil beings began to take residence there and claim the Shadowgate region as their own. The story is about a halfling named Del Cottenwood who survives an attack when riding a caravan across Shadowgate with his comrades (who perish). Thrown in Jail, he soon escapes and winds up in a series of events that affect his survival and the fate of the world.\r\n\r\nBeing the first (and perhaps last) original Shadowgate title to be released after \"Beyond Shadowgate\", the game embodies the same spirit and first-person navigation found within the old click-and-pick adventure games, but with a full-roaming 3D environment and somewhat simplified interface that reduces menus and visual clutter. While the game is decent, it lacks the imagination and challenge of the original games and the environs are rather drab with some textures appearing pretty blurry, though there was some  effort in trying to add ambience and nuances to the settings (trickling water, rodents scurrying about, birds flying, etc.) and the audio is pretty good but lacking in variety. The puzzles aren't usually too inventive, though some things are pretty interesting such as a timed area where you have to move about quickly and don't have much time to look around, or having the ability to shrink in size and climb out a window. Generally speaking however, the game is mostly lax and lacks any sense of challenge or urgency outside of paying attention to avoid the occasional pits. There are only two semi-enemies and no real combat, just so you know ahead of time.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the original Shadowgate, there's a fair chance that you can find something of interest in here, but if you haven't or aren't a major fan of adventure games, it's hard to recommend. I can say it would've been worth a rental back in the day simply because it is one of the only games of its kind on the N64, but considering a loose copy goes for about $15 bucks on average these days, you could reserve that cash for some of the more bonafide N64 classics. A sequel called \"Shadowgate Rising\" was planned for N64 but was cancelled. This is a video of the game in action, ending with a on-purpose death.
