This playthrough has all 8 endings, which also all of them involves some bashing a bit of your head and figuring out. Some can be straightforward, but others involves some dialogue choices to choose... on top of the daily actions to choose as well, so yeah, reason why the playthrough is so long, and by far the longest video of my channel.\n\nOverall, there's a lot of going ons in this (there will be spoilers a lol bit as well so make sure you have played the game, and/or watched my playthrough, or any elses if it exists). I still think it's a pretty good game/vn. Tho there are some fair share of issues as well, especially for ending hints in the extras. It's funny because the only one that has icons are basically END 6-8, and I think this could have been done the same as well for the other ones like for END 1-2, like if there will be some choices involved, at least like some icons for the choices. END 3-5 are the only ones I think that are straightforward, and you can just actually get it no issues. Also speaking of END 8, yeah it's also the only other one you will never know how will it trigger, but not by much, but I think at least it can still be obvious. Hints complain asides, I like the art style of this game! And the characters are really well written, showing varying degrees, depending on your daily actions and choices, or basically the mechanic for mind bars. There's a little bit of symbolism I guess going on, especially like END 1 with the donut, and some figure of speeches I guess as well. Music choices/BGMs as well are pretty spot on. And the extras explain further more backstory of certain character/s I guess. Unfortunately for the ones appeared in extras during the shrine section, we will never more of them, since I think, this is the only translated game of theirs by some cool person atm, so maybe in the future, if there will be more, I'll likely be checking out. Speaking of translation, despite I still have yet to learn japanese anyways, I think it's spot on, with some few errors that are negligible, as I had fun reading it, and I think it still sticks with the writing flavor the creator has. And that's all I have to say.\n\nOverall, again, it's an amazing one to play, just still be wary of the warnings when checking out the game on your own.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xVL4NV0jB4o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xVL4NV0jB4o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xVL4NV0jB4o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xVL4NV0jB4o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xVL4NV0jB4o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[You Can't?
