The player controls a walking eyeball called a drelb, with the goal of flipping the gates so they create closed boxes.\n\nPursuing the drelb are square trollaboars who can also use the gates, but can't seal them into boxes. There is an empty border on the outside the maze patrolled by screwhead tanks which shoot at the drelb.\n\nOccasionally one of the boxes becomes what the manual calls a \"drelbish window to the dark corridor.\" This leads to a separate screen where the goal is to free\u2014by touching\u2014as many drelbs as possible while avoiding gorgolytes.\n\nCompleting the dark corridor, or kissing a randomly appearing \"mystery lady\", awards a bonus based on the number of completed boxes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/drelbs", "videos": [{"id": 107882, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7Htde_5c1Zs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Htde_5c1Zs", "title": "C64-Longplay - Drelbs (720p)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Htde_5c1Zs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
