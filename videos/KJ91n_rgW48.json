The typical controls include the gas and brake pedals, a steering wheel, a + / - gear stick, and a handbrake. A \"Nitrous switch\" is available as well, which triggers either the Nitrous Oxide system on tuned NA cars, or a scramble boost function on tuned cars utilizing forced induction. Both boosts in engine power come at the cost of reduced handling. A newer variant of the cabinet Battle Gear 4 Tuned Professional Version, sports a further clutch pedal, and an H-shaped gearbox control. They are used together to simulate full manual shifting. The professional version was released in November 2006.\n\nThere are at least 5 options of gameplay, in Battle Gear 4 Tuned.\n\nEvent race. From time to time Taito announces special races that are restricted to tuned cars. Each key is only allowed to participate once in each event race. Players attempt to set the best time (or drift point record in drift mode) to compete against other players.\nRace mode allows players to race various level of opponents on different tracks. The opponents are computer cars within the same class (A,B,C,D) of the players' car. The game defaults the opponents' skill levels from 1 to 10, but it can be extended to level 98. Levels over 10 can only be unlocked by beating the previous level of opponents.\nDrift mode is the new add-on in BG4 Tuned. In this mode, the player drifts his car around the corners, attempting to gain the maximum number of points. The time is not recorded on the machine, but the drift points.\nOne make race is similar to the race mode, but the opponents appear with the exactly same car model as the player.\nTime attack is the mode where the player attempts to set the best time finishing the track. Players can select other player's ghost car to run with them.\nBattle mode pits the drivers against each other. This extra mode can only be selected when there are more than one entrants joins the game, up to 4 players if 4 cabinets are available.\nThe game displays the result (after a game finishes) to a keyless player, and the additional title and awarded BG (battle gold, the virtual dollars in game) to the player using a key. Information are uploaded to the server, and the player can access the BG later on, provided that the machine is online.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InsertCoinArcad", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ91n_rgW48/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ91n_rgW48/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ91n_rgW48/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ91n_rgW48/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJ91n_rgW48/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Battle Gear 4 Arcade", "description": "The game runs on the Taito Type X motherboard, and has capability of connecting to the Internet.
