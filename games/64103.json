Players must first clear all enemies in early waves in order to move to the final wave, where they must then deplete the stage boss\u2019s health bar completely. Would-be adventurers must be simultaneously cautious because enemies can win by using the same tactics! Each class behaves differently when used. Some classes have abundant movement capabilities and can hit a lot of enemies, while others remain stationary and can safely attack from a far. The gameplay is simple to understand yet savvy players will need to use their warriors and the battlefield strategically to progress farther. \n \nCurrently, Knight Slinger allows players to control up to 500 warriors across multiple game modes including real-time PVP. Knight Slinger\u2019s addictive gameplay, one-of-a-kind graphical style, deep customization options, and compelling RPG elements contribute to what will possibly be one of GAMEVIL\u2019s greatest titles to date.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knight-slinger"}
