Title and characters are an homage to Fuxoft. Takes place in a Czechoslovak apartment building, with gameplay based on map navigation and puzzle-solving against a time limit, controlled by keyboard shortcuts rather than typed-in commands.\n\nReceived an English translation in 2021 as part of an initiative by the Slovak Game Developers Association in cooperation with Slovak Design Museum, with funding by the Slovak Arts Council."}
