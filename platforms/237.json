The design was a combination of an Intel 8080-based motherboard, a VDM-1 graphics card, the 3P+S I/O card to drive a keyboard, and circuitry to connect to a cassette deck for program storage. Additional expansion was available via five S-100 bus slots at the back of the machine. It also included swappable ROMs with a rudimentary operating system.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/sol-20/version/initial-version"}], "games": [{"id": 125635, "name": "Air Traffic Controller", "release_dates": [{"id": 179659, "date": 315446400, "platform": 75, "y": 1979}, {"id": 179660, "date": 315446400, "platform": 126, "y": 1979}, {"id": 179661, "date": 315446400, "platform": 237, "y": 1979}, {"id": 179662, "date": 315446400, "platform": 236, "y": 1979}]}]}
