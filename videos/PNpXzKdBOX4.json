Lake: Season\u2019s Greetings takes place during 1985\u2019s holiday season, one year before the original Lake game. Players take on the role of Thomas Weiss, an amiable mail carrier and father to Lake\u2019s protagonist, Meredith Weiss. Changing the perspective from Meredith to her father, players get an understanding of the Weiss family dynamics and an insight into a snow-covered Providence Oaks from a long-time resident\u2019s point of view. Not only will players learn more about the familiar faces they have grown to love from the main story, but Season\u2019s Greetings introduces five completely new characters to the town of Providence Oaks, each with their very own storylines. The DLC will also provide more background to some unanswered questions that were teased in Lake. Following the ideals of the base game, Season\u2019s Greetings will continue to focus on slice-of-life themes and relaxing vibes, this time embedded in a comfy holiday setting. So curl up with some hot cocoa and a copy of Season\u2019s Greetings because it isn\u2019t Christmas until Thomas Weiss has delivered the holiday cheer.\n\nWishlist Lake: Season's Greetings on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450860", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNpXzKdBOX4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNpXzKdBOX4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNpXzKdBOX4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNpXzKdBOX4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PNpXzKdBOX4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lake: Season's Greetings | Release Date", "description": "Lake: Season's Greetings, the holiday-themed prequel DLC to the popular mail-carrier sim Lake, is coming to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation on November 15!\n\nMake this a December to remember!
