This means no more buggy controls, no more terrible Pikmin AI, no more unresponsive whistle, no more crushing glitch, and so much more! This is a project that has been considered by many people in the past, but no one has had the ability to make it happen until now. By combining the best mechanics of both original Pikmin games, I can finally give the original Pikmin game the quality and polish it deserved. It also features full 2-player mode functionality, with many more additional features planned, although most will likely come in updates after the initial release.\nSpeaking of the release, expect that some time in the first couple months of 2022, although I have the right to change it if I need more time.\n\nIf you have any questions at all, I cannot recommend enough that you join my discord server to discuss it, I don't reply to most of my youtube comments.\nYou can join here: https://discord.gg/WHSaSS5\nAlso follow me on Twitter, I will at least attempt to post updates to this project there as well: https://twitter.com/PikHacker\nThanks for watching!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EzHLbhq1yFM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EzHLbhq1yFM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EzHLbhq1yFM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EzHLbhq1yFM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Pikmin\u00b2 - Reveal Trailer", "description": "Happy 20th birthday, Pikmin!\nAfter being quiet for so long, I'm glad to finally announce to the world what I have been working on!\n\nPikmin\u00b2 is a complete port of Pikmin 1 to the engine of its sequel, Pikmin 2.
