You then lift the curse that it was holding, which was keeping a powerful demon named Kamashi inside his sealed containment, and the world turns into ruins right before your eyes and you're sent to fix it, because the ancient ancestors are too old and cannot fight anymore and it's your duty to stop Kamashi before it's too late.\n\n---------------\nBut that isn't the end. Kamashi also has his own little story, too.\n100 years ago he was once one of the greatest magicians in the land of Raen, and he had a beautiful wife. He had been under the ancient ancestors teachings as they originally planned for him to destroy the evil darkness but the evil darkness had got to him before they could do anything to stop him.\n\n---------------\nAfter you defeat Kamashi you will learn about this story and you'll have to travel back in time because it's too late to save the world that you are currently in. You realize this once you stumble upon a few more quests revealing a time travel mechanism that holds the world in balance and keeps it stable. (Fallen Evolution Universe Core)\n\n---------------\nSo you get teleported to a new world once you have completed all quests in the game and are at least 100 reborn, where you use your time travel mechanism to go back in time where Kamashi was still human. The evil darkness had already taken his wife and tricked him into believing that the evil darkness was the only person who could bring his wife back. He then trusted the evil darkness and gave him his soul, during which, he was turned into a blood thirsty killing machine.\n\n------------------------\nWhich then the ancient ancestors who looked over Kamashi from these other clans had too seal Kamashi away to stop him from destroying the world. But they didn't stop the evil darkness that created him. The evil darkness turned the ancestors greatest ally against them.\n\n------------------------\nYou go back in time in order to destroy the evil darkness and stop it all from ever happening and so Kamashi doesn't turn into a demon. Then the world doesn't destroy itself like it's going to before you find out that your current world was already doomed and that it was too late to save it.", "summary": "Fallen Evolution is a Indie Free-To-Play 2D MMORPG created in Visual Studio 2022 C++ with SFML and being fully rendered by OPENGL inspired by Endless Online and other MMORPGS such as, Diablo, MU Online, Maplestory, Runescape", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fallen-evolution", "videos": [{"id": 53501, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IOYfQ4s5Q90", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOYfQ4s5Q90", "title": "Fallen Evolution Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IOYfQ4s5Q90/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
