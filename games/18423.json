The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sprint-master", "videos": [{"id": 50335, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "q31HTepKuyE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q31HTepKuyE", "title": "Sprint Master for the Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q31HTepKuyE/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4117, "name": "Sprint"}]}
