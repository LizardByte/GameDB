This game is based on the incredible INDIANA JONES and the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK movie that was released in 1981.  Directed by Steven Spielberg, Starring Harrison Ford and written by George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Howard Kazanjian, it's easily one of the greatest movies ever made.  Sadly this game has practically nothing to do with the movie!  You play an archeologist in the game (supposedly Indy) and are sent on a quest to find the lost ark of the covenant... or the game cartridge of Cosmic Ark for the Atari 2600, who can be sure?  This adventure early old school RPG style game required abstract logic to complete. CGRHD was confused and sent into a quantum flux with this concept.  Maybe Data from Star Trek could figure it out, but CGRHD is too dumb.  The Indiana Jones series continues on after \"Raiders\" with INDIANA JONES and the TEMPLE OF DOOM and INDIANA JONES and the LAST CRUSADE.  There's a new one coming out this summer called Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  There are reports of new Indiana Jones video games in development.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. CGRHD is reviewing video game from the past 30 years, from 1978 to the present including Playstation 3 PS3, Sega Genesis, Nintendo Entertainment System NES, Atari 2600, 7800, N64, Dreamcast and Xbox 360.
