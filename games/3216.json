In time, Mana was used to create the ultimate weapon: the Mana Fortress. But this angered the gods and they sent their beasts to destroy the Fortress. A violent war between the beasts and the Fortress plunged the world into chaos, and Mana seemed to all but disappear. Before all was lost, a hero wielding the Mana Sword smashed the Fortress -- civilization had been destroyed, but the world was peaceful again. But time flows like a river, and history repeats...", "summary": "Initially released in Japan in 1993, Secret of Mana took the world by storm with its innovative real-time battle system and gorgeously rendered world. It continues to stand out among other action RPGs for its seamless gameplay that anyone from beginner to veteran can enjoy.\n\nOne of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series.\n\nPlay as Randi and his two companions, Primm and Popoi, as they adventure all around the world. At the center of our epic story is the mystical power of Mana. Battle the empire in its quest for control of Mana. Befriend the eight elementals who wield the forces of nature itself. Numerous encounters await at every turn.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/secret-of-mana", "videos": [{"id": 3950, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "FwGd2kQ9OsM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwGd2kQ9OsM", "title": "Secret of Mana (SNES)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FwGd2kQ9OsM/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 113327, "name": "JP TV Commercial", "video_id": "xRSMWeAk-Dg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRSMWeAk-Dg", "title": "Seiken Densetsu 2 (Secret of Mana) Japanese CM", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xRSMWeAk-Dg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 113328, "name": "US TV Commerical", "video_id": "9wM1hvu6IM4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wM1hvu6IM4", "title": "SNES - Secret of Mana (US) (1993) TV Spot", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9wM1hvu6IM4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
