While twisting the joystick's head to the left or right controls the engine throttle, the stick movement itself is used to shift gears in a realistic H-pattern.\n\nDepending on the chosen skill level, the car available is a family sedan, a modified sedan, a funny car, or a real dragster, although they all look the same on screen. One player can try to beat the predefined par time of 7.7 seconds, or compete against a friend to see who reaches the finish line first. The game manual mentions that a player only wins the game when he brings his victory counter to 99.\n\nThis preprogrammed cartridge plugs into the console of the Fairchild Video Entertainment System for more TV fun. Know when to shift and you'll go the distance with these 2 racy games. But careful... Redline your engine, an dyou wind up shiftless!
