Scientists developed a new technique that allowed them to merge the DNA of humans and animals, producing powerful creatures known as \"gears\". The characters of the game participate in a tournament, the winner of which would face a gear who went out of control and is threatening to lead a gear rebellion against the humans. The game allows you to play as familiar characters from Guilty Gear series, such as the main hero Sol Badguy, who has a certain connection to the gears, and his rival, the leader of the Holy Knights named Ky Kiske. It also introduces a new character, the nurse Fanny, who fights with a syringe and has a mysterious connection to the genius surgeon, and later serial murderer, Dr. Baldhead.\n\nGuilty Gear Petit is a 2D fighting game. The story mode lets you pick a character and take him/her through a series of fights, while in time attack mode you can choose your opponents freely. The graphics are done in \"super-deformed\" style. The game retains key ingredients of Guilty Gear gameplay, such as building tension in order to execute powerful attacks, combo moves, etc.", "summary": "Guilty Gear Petit (\u30ae\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30ae\u30a2 \u30d7\u30c1 Giruti Gia Puchi?) is the first handheld version of the Guilty Gear series released. It is followed by the sequel Guilty Gear Petit 2. Much like Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, it depicts the Guilty Gear characters in a super deformed style. It is also notable for the inclusion of the character Fanny, who appears only in the two Guilty Gear Petit games. The game has seven playable characters, six of which are from other Guilty Gear series games. The game was only released in Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/guilty-gear-petit", "videos": [{"id": 36621, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QlDHStMDh1s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlDHStMDh1s", "title": "WonderSwan Color Longplay - Guilty Gear Petit", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QlDHStMDh1s/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
