Show your ability to control it and make short and long passes. Choose the height, effect and power before shooting to the goal. Become a soccer master and make your rival defenders tremble!\n\nEach country has its national team. You can create your own team with the in-game editor: give it the name you like, choose its equipment and the most important, play with your Mii saved on the Mii Channel of your Wii.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soccer-up"}
