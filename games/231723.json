In this version, Mario earns twice as many points for every piece of treasure he brings to Peach. However, Mario gets slower as he grabs more treasure. To counter this, he can throw all of his treasure, which lightens his load and can stun one of the Octopus's arms for a brief time. Sometimes the Octopus squirts clouds of black ink, and if one hits Mario, he receives a miss. When Mario amasses 200, 500, and 700 points, a Lakitu appears and drops a heart for him to remove a miss. The Modern version also features music, with the tempo changing depending on the speed of the game. In Game & Watch Gallery 4, the Octopus changes color each time the player gets 200 points.\n\nIn Game & Watch Gallery 4, if the player selects the game yet does not actually start it, a humorous sequence is shown. Mario arrives with a bag of loot in one hand and a Game Boy Advance in another. However, he ends up surrounded by four octopus arms (two on each side) that are menacing him. Trapped, he then calls on a Lakitu to help him. He then grabs the fishing pole of the Lakitu and, trying to hold on, is ultimately forced to drop his belongings, with a crown and gold objects falling out of the loot bag. Finally, each octopus arm retrieves a treasure, including the loot bag itself as well as the GBA.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/octopus--2"}
