Bigger and bader than ever before!!!!\n\nStainless/SCi announces the release of the eagerly awaited sequel to its 1997 smash hit Carmageddon, Carmageddon 2 - Carpocalypse now. Carmageddon 1 was released last year amongst \"just a tiny bit\" of controversy, with calls to \"ban this killer car game\" from the media around the world, and then went on to prove its critics wrong by scooping a body bag full of awards from around the globe. Developed once again, by the patients of Parkhurst prison's clinically insane wing, known as Stainless Software, Carmageddon 2 - Carpocalypse Now, is destined to make computer gaming history again. Let's face it, Carmageddon 1 caused a blood storm in a teacup, this time prepare for a full-on tidal wave.\n\nCarmageddon 2 - Carpocalypse Now will take players to the next level of gameplay, whether you are trying to hold down your lunch after taking out those pedestrians waiting for a bus, or franticly trying to re-build your car after having your butt kicked by one of the GAME'S AI opponents, Carmageddon 2 - Carpocalypse Now will take you to the edge and further as you race your way through 1998's greatest driving game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/carmageddon-ii-carpocalypse-now", "videos": [{"id": 1352, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "MyrYDSwD_gk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyrYDSwD_gk", "title": "Carmageddon 2 Intro Movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MyrYDSwD_gk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
