Players can directly shoot opposing astronauts to deplete their health points, or if shot at the right angle with an explosive, can send them flying into space or hurtling into the sun. The planets are destructible and projectiles are affected by gravity, meaning you can make shots weave around multiple planets. Players can upgrade their astronauts with more health and a longer target predictor or upgrade weapon ammo. This is the offline predecessor of Gravitee Wars Online.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gravitee-wars"}
