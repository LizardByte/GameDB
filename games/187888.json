The Gameplay is largely kinetic and uses a lot of video sequences.\n\nFuture humanity is in conflict with a mysterious, incomprehensible alien species which is defined as terrorists by the government. A group of mathematicians developed an algorithm which can predict the behavior of the attackers. A young lonely girl should become a new member of the institute but when she arrives at Kyoto Novalis, the aliens attack and she gets lost in the city. Hilal, her new guardian, a female cyborg, searches her in the city, but they don't have much time, because the government ordered a nuclear attack on the city if the aliens can't be stopped in time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dimensional-prophecy-of-zohar"}
