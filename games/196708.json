The project was led by Daniel Gimmer (Tormentor667). It was first released on June 2, 2007, and at the 2007 ceremony it picked up a regular Cacoward as well as the Mordeth award. The final version of the mod was uploaded on June 16, 2012.\n\nThe PWAD is a reinterpretation of the original id Software's Knee-Deep in the Dead. A core concept of the mod was to expand the original levels by making full use of the power of Marisa Heit (Randi)'s ZDoom port, which adds features that are not possible under the original Doom engine. The levels have an atmosphere and design similar to Quake 2, with large tech bases and similar ambient sounds.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 66436, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "j4-us1_NLnE"}, {"id": 66437, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lGcb3kKoV58"}]}
