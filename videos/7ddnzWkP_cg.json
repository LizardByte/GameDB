Its compelling story and unique look lift off exactly where the original ended.\n\nNew clans led by Mechminds of the Fifth Generation are powerful and well-organized formations with far-reaching plans. Powerful groups have different interests that often crossed, and war broke out again. However this time it is the struggle not for mere control, this is a struggle for survival. The clans want to eliminate the weaker ones standing in their way and will stop at nothing to dominate their enemies. To achieve their goals they use not only military means but economic ones as well.
