The game looks similar to Pac-Man but only has three ghosts. The game play is the same. Move about the maze, eating all the dots and avoiding the ghosts. If you eat a power pellet, the ghosts turn blue then you can eat them for points. Also on the cartridge, starting with version 1.3, is a hidden game called DacPong!. This is just like Pong except the ball is the Pac-Man character.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dacman"}
