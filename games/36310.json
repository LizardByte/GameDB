Tired of waiting to be paid, the mercenaries who fought for Carthage against Rome revolted and laid siege to the city. In the very heart of the disruptions and massacres, Salammbo, the daughter of the Shophet Hamilcar, commander of the Carthaginian forces, falls in love with the chief of the rebels, Matho, who is leading the war against the city. Portraying Spendius, an escaped slave and companion of Matho, the player will discover the fantastic history of these mercenaries who fought against Carthage. Spendius is a survivor and an opportunist more than a conqueror. He is a man who stays in the shadows, much more suited to slipping in the night into an enemy city than confronting an enemy face to face...To save his life, he will have to encourage this war and try to take advantage of the disturbances to gain power, fortune and perhaps the love of the beautiful Salammbo.", "summary": "Inspired by the novel of Gustave Flaubert and the works of Phillippe Druillet, Salammbo: Battle for Carthage puts you in the middle of two of antiquities greatest powers.
