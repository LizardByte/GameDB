Also, please be gentle with any bugs that might arise! I'll be adding updates as and when these come up.\n\nIn Life's Too Short, you take on the role of a celestial marriage councilor as you're tasked with repairing a rift between two vampires who have dramatically fallen out and confined themselves to their respective coffins...\n\nYou'll need to explore the mansion, meet various spooky characters and solve simple puzzles in order to put the mansion back together and mend the rift in the vampires' relationship!\n\nBuy 'Life's Too Short' on Itch.io:\nhttps://olliecoe.itch.io/lifestooshort\n\n\"Playdate is familiar, but unlike anything you've ever seen. It has a very special black and white screen \u2013 not backlit, but super reflective \u2013 that looks way more amazing than you're probably imagining.\n\nIt also has a peppy little processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a surprisingly loud loudspeaker. And when you're not using it, the screen doesn't turn off \u2013 it becomes a very nice low-power clock!\n\nThe Design\n\nThanks to our friends at Teenage Engineering, Playdate looks incredible. It's colorful. It fits in your pocket. And we worked hard to make sure buttons feel perfectly clicky and that the crank action is silky smooth.\n\nThe Crank\n\nYes, the crank. Is it a gimmick? Nah. Does it charge the Playdate's battery? Nope. Is it really fun? Yes yes yes! It's an analog controller that flips out from the side, allowing you to precisely dial in the action.\n\nThe Season\n\nHere's the truly unique bit. Playdate isn't just an empty system. Once you set up your Playdate, you'll start to receive two brand new games... every week. For 12 weeks.\n\nThat's 24 free games, in lots of genres. Some are short. Some are long. Will you love them all? Probably not. Will you have a great time trying them? Absolutely.\"\n\nPlaydate's official site:\n\nhttps://play.date/\n\n#PlayDate #LifesTooShort #Olliecoe", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3MtU1EUpwE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3MtU1EUpwE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3MtU1EUpwE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3MtU1EUpwE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3MtU1EUpwE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "'Life's Too Short' - Playdate Game", "description": "Life's Too Short is the debut title from Ollie Coe developed exclusively for Playdate (Mostly because he is still figuring out all of this \"development\" lark...What is a \"Unity\"?).
