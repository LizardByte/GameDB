However, after offending a high-ranked minister and magic user named Radon, Rance is ironically thrown into the slave camp while his magic-using slave Sill is treated as a VIP.\n\nVowing vengeance, he eventually escapes with the help of an underground resistance group called Ice Flame. Currently Zeth is an extremely un-equal country, with magic users being the only real citizens and the non-magic users treated much like slaves with virtually no rights. Only groups like Ice Flame and the more violent and extreme group known as Pentagon, and perhaps the mysterious King of Zeth try to fight this cruel status quo.\n\nRance joins the group in order to get his revenge against the mages of the government of Zeth, and be reunited with Sill \"while he's at it\".", "summary": "Rance VI -The Collapse of Zeth- is the ninth installment of the Rance Series.\nDespite the fact that 5D was released earlier, Rance VI is usually considered the beginning of the new Rance timeline set after Kichikuou Rance, due to the much bigger scale of the game along with the fact that it takes place in LP0004, leaving the year LP0003 where Kichikuou Rance would have taken place as \"the missing year\", since the canonical events of that year weren't adapted into games. It was also from this point that many details of the lore and the setting were better established and given further detail."}
