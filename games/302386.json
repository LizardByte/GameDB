Makoto doesn't have any money but has been skirting the law for some time through tax evasion, abuse of Japan's basic \"National Pension System\", and odd jobs or \"gigs\" working under the table, becoming more behind on his fiscal obligations by the day. However, there is another odd phenomenon that has developed in Wakui City that Makoto did not immediately become aware of known as the \"New Stalking Law\", which grants protection and partial asylum to qualified candidates who have garnered the attention of unscrupulous parties. This system was put in place at Wakui City to divert resources to an emerging problem that the local police could not manage on their own, and is designed for rather extreme cases. In order for it to work, the \"PG (Public Guardian) System\" was created to assign benefactors who perform tasks on the behalf of their clients.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sip-se-safety-is-power", "videos": [{"id": 114210, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "z_St2DantIc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_St2DantIc", "title": "Safety is Power SE [s.i.p. \uff5esafety is power !\uff5e SE] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_St2DantIc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
