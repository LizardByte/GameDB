During these actions, the Tokobots team up to take on different combinations in order to simulate everything from a ladder that Bolt climbs to wings that allow him to fly over large obstacles. The player will have to use strategy and skill to create these team combos in order to complete each level and succeed in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
