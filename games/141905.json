Battle the Kraken by clear lines across the onslaught of attacking Kraken Tentacles. The Tentacles push more blocks onto the screen every few seconds, forcing to act quickly, and strategize on an every changing board.\n\nClassic Mode\n\nThe classic block falling mechanics you know and love without any new gimicks. Modernize for 2020, with Hard Drops, Lock Delay, and more, making this (hopefully) the best feeling puzzle game on the NES!\n\nTurn Based Kraken Battle Mode\n\nSimilar to \"Kraken Battle Mode\", but instead of the Kraken attacking every few seconds, it advances its tentacle every time you drop a piece.
