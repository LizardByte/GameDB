You can also earn cash to upgrade your bike to improve chances to finish 1st at a tournament.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest highlight is not only you can create your own tracks, but also your own tournament for official courses, custom tracks or a combination of both! You can save up to 16 custom tracks onto a single memory card.\nSeriously, for what might be the first MX game on PS1 and not even released in the USA, this is quite an accomplishment.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/famtCFBj_o4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/famtCFBj_o4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/famtCFBj_o4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "International Moto X - PlayStation Gameplay", "description": "Developed by Graftgold, International Moto X is an early motocross game for the PS1, coming out in 1996.
