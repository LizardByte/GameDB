In 2008, Jack won a talent search looking for a future Formula One driver. The competition was set to be televised, until the rights changed hands at the conclusion of the competition, and the new rights holder dropped the show. The promised prize, a fully paid season in Formula BMW, vanished overnight. This setback led Jack to shift focus and pursue his passion for technology, learning software development, business, game design and more, mostly by reading.\nAfter explaining his vision for iGP Manager to a friend, they moved in to a cramped flat and begin building it, hiring any extra help they needed using loans. Launched in December 2011 as a browser game, iGP Manager was the first of its kind, offering real-time multiplayer strategy. A loyal community grew around the title, which would later reach new heights when it became cross-platform.\nBy 2017 iGP Manager arrived in the app stores, where it went on to amass an audience of millions of players around the world. 2021 marked the addition of 3D graphics and wheel-to-wheel racing, making iGP Manager the first game in the genre to offer onboard and TV cameras, comparable to a racing game. To this day, it remains one-of-a-kind in the app stores, offering an experience and visuals normally reserved for desktop titles. One of the largest games of its kind to this day, with an ambitious team behind it, fully embracing remote work, iGP Games remains a fully independent studio. Jack is also the sole remaining founder, having persisted through the early startup years.", "summary": "iGP Manager is a massively-multiplayer online motorsport manager game.
