Now, they must fight their way through the zombie hordes in search of their spouse and after that, escape Union City. \n \nUnlike the previous games in the series, it is a RPG, though it retains the same controls and 2D side-view perspective. The player does not control Jack and instead creates their own custom survivor, who can level up by gaining XP from quests, killing enemies, and scavenging, after which the player is allowed to upgrade their stats and skill sets as they see fit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-stand-union-city--1"}
