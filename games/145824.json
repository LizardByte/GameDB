Use your bodies from previous attempts as pieces of the puzzle as you help yourself reach greater heights and far-away platforms.\n\nPlay as our beloved crash test dummy and pass through various levels to test the lab\u2019s fantastic inventions! Turret in your way? Put a body in the trash compactor and now you have a shield! Can\u2019t get to the platform above you? Jump on the trampoline bodies to reach new heights! A spike pit that\u2019s too long and you\u2019re lacking ammo? A sphere body is all you need to roll on the spikes with, without taking damage!\n\nLose yourself in this 1920\u2019s futuristic art deco world as you wonder how to get past all the shiny and cool obstacles in your way. Shimmering gold and silky-smooth marble pave the walls and floors of these expensive labs. Within, hear the roars of the turrets decimating everything in their path, the \u2018whoosh\u2019 of wrecking balls swinging by you as you try to avoid them, the \u2018ztztzt\u2019 of the electric flooring that vaporizes all material on it, and the signature sound of the Vacuum Gun, sucking up bodies and making new ones!\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d you ask. Why create this lab and these machines and these obstacles? Well, just like life, humans fail constantly. But we often forget to see the good in failing \u2013 it's meaningful. Lab Rags is built on this philosophy \u2013 that failure is good. Use your previous knowledge and past experiences to get over the next obstacle. Your past failed attempts literally help you in Lab Rags as your position, manipulate and shoot your bodies to cross, solve and advance!\n\nWe at Salt Mine Studios wish you the best and welcome you to our lab. Have fun!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lab-rags"}
