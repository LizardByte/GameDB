Social media was the main focus of all human relationships, bringing people from different places together in a great peaceful community.\n\nBut something was formed under that idyllic facade of freedom. Junk emails, spam, deleted comments, neutralized viruses ... The other side of the truth, which always went unnoticed, was accumulating a lot of waste. And... unexpectedly, from that compressed amount of corrupted waste, Dedalium was born, an unlimited source of energy.\n\nHumanity, dazzled by such power, did not realize that under the shadow of that immense purity, uncontrollable and dangerous forms of infection were also born. And the little things began to fail ... Many files and images became corrupt, social media accounts disappeared overnight, web pages suffered small and untraceable attacks...\n\nChaos started to emerge, the signs that something big was going to happen were too obvious, and fear and anguish took over the world. Those impurities, fed by all the garbage that continued to be generated, grew to become a great threat, a threat that claimed the Dedalium as its own.\n\nHumans, far from seeking a universal solution, began to blame each other as responsible for creating such monsters and abandoned the idea of community. So the first Network Guardians were created, shields being installed to keep everyone's information safe. Programmed not only to protect, but also to obtain Dedalium, its use as the mainline of defense and attack began to spread, but this only divided people more.\n\nHumanity was blinded by fear and ambition, and the Internet, that great discovery that would unite all people into one, fragmented them to the point of almost destroying them.", "summary": "Dedalium is an innovative RPG game which can be played on any website installing the browser extension, but there is a lot to do on the app as well!\n\nThe first steps of the game consists on selecting your initial gear, this gear will get experience when you fight and complete missions and will become more powerful.
