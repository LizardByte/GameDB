It is one of the largest levels ever made. Like the previous project, each mapper was assigned a set of dates to work on the map, each one continuing where the last mapper finished. It took over two years to build, with a final release on 25 May 2014. The map makes extensive use of ZDoom features, such as 3D floors (including swimmable water), and portals.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zdoom-community-map-project-ii"}
