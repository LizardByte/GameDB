A mysterious voice contacts him and says that this world is called Endonesia, and if he wants to return home, he has to call upon its fifty gods. In order to find the gods, the hero has to communicate with the inhabitants of Endnesia by transferring his own emotions to others.\n\nCreated by Taro Kudo and Kazuyuki Kurashima of Love-de-lic fame, Endnesia is one of the spiritual descendants (along with Giftpia and Chulip) of their seminal game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. Like those other games, Endnesia is a puzzle-solving adventure with RPG elements such as statistics, item-gathering, and character growth.\n\nThe theme of the game is sharing emotions; gameplay-wise, it translates into puzzle-solving which involves using the right emotion on the right characters at the right time. For example, using the Hunger emotion on an animal will make it hungry, urging it to find food, which will clear the path for the hero.\n\nSimilarly to Moon and its descendants, Endnesia has a day-night cycle. The hero's health meter is depleted due to exhaustion; though the game's world is quite large, the player always has a time limit for his daily activities. The player should also feed the hero; hunger makes his vision blurry and slows down his pace.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/endonesia"}
