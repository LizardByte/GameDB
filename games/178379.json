It features a story of a suspicious \"Rose\" that is making the game act very strange. It also features characters you meet and some bosses you kill with a powerful flower that you obtain later in the game. You have to obtain the supplies to make the key which leads to the exit of freedom with little you have. But the question is \"is it really an exit\"?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-place"}
