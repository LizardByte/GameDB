It was the first of several updated versions of the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. The main changes consisted of the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (same character vs. matches). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allowed for more balanced competitive play.\nChampion Edition was followed by Street Fighter II' Turbo: Hyper Fighting, released several months later.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/street-fighter-ii-champion-edition"}
