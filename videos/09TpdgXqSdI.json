(Crystal Screen) (c)1986 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "description": "This the Game & Watch Super Mario Bros. handheld game, a Nintendo product released in 1986 and one of 3 units that were released as both New Wide Screen and Crystal Screen units.\n\nThese games differ slightly from other Game & Watch entries in that they don't have a Game A and Game B feature, but just a single game mode.  While this unit does have many fans I find it to rely too much on knowledge of the game - the platform blocks are reused for many different things and it isn't always clear if you can stand on them without prior knowledge of the game.  In that sense this lacks the simplicity of the early Game & Watch units and starts treading in territory closer to the Tiger units.\n\nIt is believed that the Crystal Screen and New Wide Screen versions of these share the same MCU and ROM data, with only the case and screen being different.\n\nRecent work on Game & Watch emulation has come from Algestam, with earlier work being done by Sean Riddle and hap.
