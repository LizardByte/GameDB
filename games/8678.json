Kara, our heroine, has access to a unique gameplay mechanic that she uses to manipulate the world around her. She has a gun that is able to alter the laws of physics through the creation of pockets of gravity and anti-gravity. By mastering the use of these abilities Kara is able to augment her jump in order to almost fly past obstacles. These powers can also be utilized to move objects that block her path and platforms that Kara stands on in order to traverse the levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 3542, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ry4Leim7S-k"}]}
