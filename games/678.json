Considered an unofficial sequel to Empire Earth, the game requires players to collect resources to build an empire, train military units, and conquer opposing civilizations.\nBased on a slightly compressed version of world history, Empires covers five eras, from the Medieval Age to World War II. The game features nine civilizations: England, the Franks, Korea, and China are playable from the Medieval Age to the Imperial Age; the United States, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are playable in the World War I and World War II ages.\nThe game attracted positive critical reaction.\nIn 2009, Activision terminated its multiplayer server contract with GameSpy. Multiplayer can be played unofficially in Gameranger services.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/empires-dawn-of-the-modern-world", "videos": [{"id": 131656, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yOeR1kcYtmU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOeR1kcYtmU", "title": "Empires Dawn of the Modern World, E3 2003 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yOeR1kcYtmU/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 324, "name": "Empire Earth"}]}
