But stay alert, as both treasures and temples can change hands as you compete with other expeditions!\nEach turn, you place a new tile representing an area of the jungle you have just mapped, then spend action points to explore. When a volcano tile is revealed, each player has one extra chance to improve their position, then points are awarded. Plan your moves and stake your claims wisely, and your expedition will take it's place in the history books!"}
