Jump to locate the resource points where weapons and equipment await your arrival. Discover the rush of free-falling and navigate to the nearest location before your opponents. Timing is of high importance. Adjust direction and speed with realistic movements and prepare to fight! If all you have is a knife you must overcome your opponent by stealth to steal his weapons, and be sure to collect any other items scattered about.
