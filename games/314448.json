With standard gameplay, the gameplay mechanics rely on 2 features: spell card system and spark counter, with the spell card system the player may choose 2 of 7 different spell cards before embarking on a mission. The spark counter consumes magic gauge and is basically very similar to a bomb that will fire lasers to eliminate enemies and bullets. The game's story is around Marisa who is investigating magic fluctuations.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kinu-shoku-ryuu-hana-weaving-the-blue-orient"}
