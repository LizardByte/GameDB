Think about how much can be lost in such an immensity, yeah...\n\nYour job is to organize the items and deliver them accordingly, but remember: organization comes first. Not everything that arrives in one day will be delivered in that same day! Quick note: NO wrong deliveries! NO objects on the floor! And be careful with your energy. Everything's okay for the delivery? Great, then activate the RED button and *puff*! Done and gone.\n\nMistakes result in terrible temporal interferences that can destabilize the entire universe, so please be careful. Did you panic? Press the YELLOW button, and we'll do our best to get you back in time. Simple as that.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lis-achados-and-perdidos-dos-confins-do-universo"}
