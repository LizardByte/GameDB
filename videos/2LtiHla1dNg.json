However, because YouTube did not like my 80gb 24-hour long 720p60 file, I had to figure out a way to shorten it (There was no way I wasn't going to show EVERY HOUR that I sat through this!). The driving portions of the video are sped up to 3x real-time speed, so all 24-hours are shown within the 8-hour duration of this video. \n\nA side-note: there is no pause button. Beside maybe 3 2-minute handoffs to pee, I sat and played this all the way through. I ate about half a bottle of Ibuprofen and a couple of pizzas over the time I played, as well. In case you cared. \n\nHere's one of the most famous examples of a middle-finger to politics (or Janet Reno) through video games. Hot on the heels of the controversy and attempts at legislation following games like Night Trap and Mortal Kombat, Penn & Teller created this to highlight what games would actually be like if they were entirely inoffensive while providing meaningful life skills. As you can only imagine, it's the most repetitive, boring thing ever. Point very well made, guys! The game has been used for several years now to raise money for charity, which is pretty excellent. \n\nYou have to drive the bus from Tucson to Las Vegas in real-time, and your bus (is there a bomb on board?) maxes out at 45mph. The alignment is also off, so it constantly pulls slightly to the right - there's no easy way to prop the accelerator and walk away! It's an eight-hour trip. \n\nFinishing your eight-hour shift rewards you with a point and an offer for overtime. I ended up with three points by the end of this recording: I drove to Las Vegas, back to Tucson, and then back to Vegas again. I wanted to see what the day/night cycle looked like! Thank God I never crashed it.... I would have cried. A lot. \n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2LtiHla1dNg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2LtiHla1dNg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2LtiHla1dNg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2LtiHla1dNg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2LtiHla1dNg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Desert Bus (Sega CD) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of the game \"Desert Bus\" included in the unreleased 1995 Sega CD game by Absolute, Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors.\n\nThis video shows me playing through three eight-hour shifts, back-to-back, in real time.
