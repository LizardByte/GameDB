The player who has only two pieces or can't move his pieces has lost the game. \n \nGameplay: \n \nA player starts and placing a piece on a empty spot on the board. Then players take turns placing. \n \nWhoever can close a mill (placing 3 pieces in a row) may remove one of his opponent's pieces from the board but can't remove any piece from a formed mill. \n \nOnce all pieces are placed on the board, players take turns moving. To move, a player slides one of his pieces along a board line to an empty adjacent spot. If he can't move, he has lost the game. \n \nOnce a player has only three pieces, his pieces may jump to any empty spots. Once that player lose another stone now, he has lost the game.", "summary": "3D Morris Prof simulates the famous board game Nine Men's Morris on your PC, including 5 levels from \"very easy\" to \"unbeatable\". \n \nA realistic physics engine and advanced real-time graphics with realistic sound make this game to a unique experience.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-morris", "videos": [{"id": 46736, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2mFLrqjbyfw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mFLrqjbyfw", "title": "3D Morris video demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mFLrqjbyfw/sddefault.jpg"}]}
