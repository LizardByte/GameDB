These are normally not issued to Helldivers due to their specialization compared to the more rounded P-2 \u2018Peacemaker\u2019.\nThe Pistols Perk Pack contains:\n- P-6 \u2018Gunslinger\u2019: A heavy sixshooter revolver. The aptly nicknamed 'Gunslinger' revolver might seem flashy, but packs a proper punch and comes with built in lasersight.\n- FLAM-24 \u2018Pyro\u2019: A compact flamer with the same power as the unupgraded FLAM-40. It has shorter range and very limited ammunition compared to it\u2019s larger cousin, but is very handy when you\u2019re on the move.\n- PLAS-3 \u2018Singe\u2019: A plasma pistol based on the experimental technology of the PLAS-1. It fires superheated gas that explodes on contact with its target. Not recommended for point blank range, but a powerful weapon in its own right.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/helldivers-pistols-perk-pack"}
