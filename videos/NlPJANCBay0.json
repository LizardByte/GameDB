You play as Smokey, a toad armed with a flamethrower, and take the offensive against an invading force of hostile frogs, led by the almighty King Baxter, self-proclaimed sovereign of amphibians, who will stop at nothing to subjugate the inhabitants of Smokey's homestead and the surrounding lands. You'll join forces with a mysterious wizard, who'll provide assistance, as you push forward, intent on putting an end to King Baxter and his foray into the home of toads.\n\nYou progress through 25+ levels of varying types, ranging from pure action to puzzle-based to boss battles. The flamethrower is your primary weapon, and can dispatch enemies with volleys of fireballs, which level-up as you kick butt. A charge-action endows you with two more modes of attack: burst-fire when released; or a burst-shot that rockets you forward as a blazing toad-missile of death! After clearing a few levels, you get a shield to block projectiles, or\u2014with some skill\u2014deflect them back towards whence they came, using the enemy's own firepower against them. A few levels after that, you find grenades that you can collect and throw at any target of your pleasure. You'll bask in the irony of defending your homeland, all the while burning trees to the ground, smashing through boulders, and detonating volatile incendiaries.\n\nThere are also markets where you can buy worthwhile items and chat with the locals. You procure money by collecting items and gems that are found scattered throughout the game. Power-ups and secrets abound. \n\nAvailable on Steam\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1417020/Toad_On_Fire/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NlPJANCBay0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NlPJANCBay0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NlPJANCBay0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NlPJANCBay0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Toad On Fire | Video Game Trailer | HD Reupload", "description": "Buy on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1417020/Toad_On_Fire/\n\nToad On Fire is a top-down, retro-like action-adventure shooter.
