During the mission, his entire team is killed, until he and his second-in-command, Captain Dan Taylor are left. When they manage to find their answer in a giant laboratory, Death, a gigantic mutant who serves as the facility's security guard, kills Taylor and injures Rogan. While fighting to stay alive, Rogan is approached by an unidentified figure in a semi-corporate attire who offers help. Contact with him is lost.\n\nTwo weeks later, on October 31, Rogan's daughter, Lisa, accompanied by his former partner, semi-retired agent \"G\", arrives at the facility to rescue him. While navigating through the facility, they fend off against hordes of undead creatures, before they encounter Death, whom they fight twice. Later, they fight a deformed sloth, The Fool, and a mutated tendrilous plant named The Sun. Along the way, Lisa muses to \"G\" how she has to live in the shadows of her well-known father and that she is often the subject of his comparison.", "summary": "The Typing of the Dead 2, the sequel game to The Typing of the Dead, is an arcade game (ported to Microsoft Windows). It was released in arcades in 2007. This version was a revision of The House of the Dead III, and has only been released in Japan and only for PC as of 2008. While the latter is a standard light gun shooter, Typing replaces the gun with the keyboard. The game is an educational game, as it requires players to enhance their typing skills to be successful. The plot centers around the elimination of the zombie threat after society has collapsed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-typing-of-the-dead-2", "videos": [{"id": 36627, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NiYYyZ4vuSM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiYYyZ4vuSM", "title": "The Typing of the Dead 2 (PC) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NiYYyZ4vuSM/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6255, "name": "The Typing of the Dead"}]}
