The original game was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding his or her party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley on the Oregon Trail via a covered wagon in 1848. The game is the first entry in the Oregon Trail series of games, and has since been released in many editions by various developers and publishers who have acquired rights to it, as well as inspiring a number of spinoffs (such as The Yukon Trail and The Amazon Trail) and the parody The Organ Trail.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ialxwLLlJU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ialxwLLlJU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ialxwLLlJU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ialxwLLlJU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ialxwLLlJU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Oregon Trail Gameplay (Nintendo 3DS) [60 FPS] [1080p]", "description": "\u2776 Nintendo 3DS Games Gameplay Playlist #1 http://bit.ly/1zonphd\n\u2777 Nintendo 3DS Games Gameplay Playlist #2 http://bit.ly/1KpunGp\n\u2778 All Games https://www.youtube.com/user/RetronyashJr/playlists\n \u2665\u263a\u2665 Don't forget to subscribe \u2665\u263a\u2665\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Oregon Trail is a computer game originally developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and produced by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) in 1974.
