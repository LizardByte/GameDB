AI death squads stand watch over every planet and wormhole, the few remaining human settlements are held captive, and the AIs have turned their attention outward, away from the galaxy, to alien threats or opportunities unknown. \n \nThis inattention is our only hope: a small resistance, too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command, has survived. These are the forces you will command in this modern RTS classic. \n \nGo forth into the galaxy, steal AI technology, recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends, and save what remains of humanity. But draw too much attention to yourself, and the full might of some of the most unique AI in modern strategy gaming will come crashing down.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ai-war-collection", "videos": [{"id": 79370, "video_id": "JX4y9JdMKLM"}]}
