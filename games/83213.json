There are blocks that can be broken and blocks that cannot be broken on the screen. When you break the fruit block, Pippi appears and moves up and down on the screen, and when you go around and back to the original position, he returns to the original fruit block. If you touch Pippi, he will be collected at the top left of the screen. Once you return to the fruit, the movement will be faster from the second time. Clear the screen by collecting all the Pippi.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pop-and-chips"}
