Each round you have to place, group and upgrade various tiles to mine gold and collect resources like wood, stone, wheat and fish.\n\nTo mine gold, you need people in your villages. To keep them, you must provide enough wheat and fish. More people and a higher level increases the amount of gold produced per round. You need wood and stone to upgrade the level.\n\nIn order to increase your yield per round, you can solve various tasks during the game and observe the requirements when placing tiles. In addition, there are different random game events that can influence the game in a positive or negative way.\n\n\u2666 Links \u2666\n\n\u25ba Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2328840/?utm_source=youtube\n\u25ba Discord: https://discord.gg/YdJpgD5ggW\n\u25ba X: https://x.com/boettchergames\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/stefanboettchergames\n\u25ba Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/stefanboettchergames\n\u25ba TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@boettchergames\n\u25ba YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@stefanboettchergames\n\u25ba Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/stefanboettchergames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TAWRsv9MODg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TAWRsv9MODg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TAWRsv9MODg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TAWRsv9MODg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TAWRsv9MODg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The First Mine - Gameplay Teaser (Preview)", "description": "My name ist Stefan and I am a solo game developer from Berlin, Germany.
