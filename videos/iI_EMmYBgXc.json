Embalm bodies, encounter demons, and have a taste of things to come!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1295920/The_Mortuary_Assistant/\n\nThe Mortuary Assistant has grown massively since its inception as a 5 minute prototype and I'm so excited to be sharing the new teaser demo that highlights what the full game's direction is. Play it now on Steam and Itch.io!\n\nI've been working very hard and for a long time over the past year to create The Mortuary Assistant. This teaser is a taste of the systems I've built to drive the full game. The full game will handle the story of Rebecca Owens, the history of the mortuary, banishing demons, and so much more!\n\nIf you would like to support my work. Please consider wishlisting The Mortuary Assistant and have a look at the links below.\n\n-Brian\n\nLAUNCH DATE UPDATE - I've been asked a lot about specific launch dates and at this point, I can't really confirm one. I have partnered with DreadXP as a publisher and they have ideas as to when the most effective launch date would be. I am on t rack with MA development but the main reason why I picked up a publisher is to hopefully get MA in front of as large an audience as possible. This means that launch will be what makes the most sense in terms of quality of the game and timing of the market. I hope this makes sense to everyone. I'm working hard to finish the game but I AM one guy so the help from Dread with Marketing etc. is appreciated and affects the launch date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/join/DarkStoneDigital\r\nPlay exclusive prototypes, demos, and early game builds every month while helping me keep the studio running!\r\n\r\nITCH: https://darkstonedigital.itch.io\r\nSTEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/developer/DarkStoneDigital/\r\n\r\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/DSDigitalDev\r\nTWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/darkstonedigital\r\nDISCORD: https://discord.gg/MSQTWWm", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iI_EMmYBgXc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iI_EMmYBgXc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iI_EMmYBgXc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iI_EMmYBgXc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iI_EMmYBgXc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Mortuary Assistant DEMO - Out Now on Steam", "description": "Alone with the dead.
