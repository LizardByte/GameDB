In this game, you play as Suzie, a cute and bubbly girl, who along with her 3 kittens, goes to get some groceries. While returning, kittens started menacing each other and started running around. Before Suzie could stop them, a pack of wild jackals appeared towards those kittens and started chasing them. Suzie became sad and started regretting her decision, but then an \u201cAnimal God\u201d appeared and granted Suzie cat-like abilities which she could utilize to rescue her friends.\n\nThe Whisperer features soothing yet intense gameplay. This game requires you to use its platforming abilities in your favor by making timed jumps, climbing walls, and performing jump dashes. You had to be careful while running through the different environments because you never know how many ambushes lurk there to stop you. Move through intriguing traps, defeat your enemies, and rescue your friends.", "summary": "Join Suzie on her journey to rescue her cute little friends.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-whisperer--1"}
