The controls are simple. The action is fast-paced. Intense dogfights lead to epic, screen-filling bosses. But the truth is:\n\nYou don\u2019t know what Cycle 28 is. Not yet.\n\nAs Olivia Bergen \u2013 a flight lieutenant that has become separated from her fleet \u2013 you only know Cycle 27. You live it over, and over, and over again. And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, every time you drop from warp they are waiting for you.\n\nYou don\u2019t know who they are or what they want. You just know you\u2019re the only thing between them and home. So you get better, faster, stronger. Maybe one of these Cycle\u2019s you\u2019ll figure it out. Until then, you can only keep dying.\n\nKey Features\nKaleidoscopic space combat \u2014 Power slide your way between more bullets than any lesser pilot could handle. Nothing feels better than using your ship\u2019s gun to propel you through enemy-infested space as you grip the trigger ever tighter.\n\nUpgrades \u2014 Beat your personal high score in a run to unlock upgrades. With 45 possible configurations, customise your ship and master new tactics to live just a little longer.\n\nEvolving story \u2014 Uncover the secrets of why you\u2019re stuck in Cycle, why they\u2019re hell-bent on destroying everything you love, and just who they really are.\n\nEpic original score \u2014A powerfully atmospheric mix of modern orchestral and retro electronic sounds by Jordan Rees.
