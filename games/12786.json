The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits.\n\nThe game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-scramble-simulator", "videos": [{"id": 118460, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iwRn24Yu4WQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwRn24Yu4WQ", "title": "Super Scramble Simulator", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iwRn24Yu4WQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
