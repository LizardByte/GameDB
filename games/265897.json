This apartment contained 8 blocks with 12 floors each. It had a proprietary garden, a swimming pool, a basketball court, and a large football ground. It even had a warp pipe that directed to the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\nOne day, both girls Sweety and Natasha were walking down the street. In the middle, there was a paper littered down. So, both of them started reading about this magic show. Soon after they decided to discuss with the rest of their friends at the garden. During the discussion, Donut chooses to stay at home while the others decide to go.\nThe next day, in the afternoon all of them(except Donut) were present at the magic show. A few minutes later, the magician started to perform a trick that was going to be mind-blowing. So he called out Sweety, Ria, and Bunty as assistants and told them to get inside the box. But it wasn't found out that the box wasn't his. So, he didn't care about it and started the trick. The trick worked.\nBut after some time, Natasha went to check on her three friends but, she couldn't find out. She asked the magician where are her friends. But, the magician replied to her that her friends had gone missing and he tried all his methods to bring them back. He ended up failing all these and asked her to call her friends. But, the call did not ring. Then he insists her to call the cops, but he is unaware of the cops who are searching for him. He just chooses to escape. But Natasha saw something strange on the box, and she questioned him about the box. But the magician blamed someone for the reason why her friends went missing.\nThe next day, Natasha walks to her home, nearly a few kilometers away. She dashed Mario by accident. Mario was rushing to his TV interview. She asked about the incident. But, he told her that he didn't have time left.\nAt the interview, the interviewer asks about this incident that made his brother Luigi disappear. Mario explains how his brother disappeared and what was the cause. But then he started to speak broken English and also started calling his brother Luigi as 'Lungi'. Mario hearing this, started to get mad at the interviewer scolding him to correct his speaking. Again the interviewer calls his brother 'Lungi'. Then he asks about his brother's appearance. Mario said that he also wears the same as him. The interviewer tries to pronounce the word incident, but his tongue slips resulting in Mario leaving the interview.\nThe Next day, Mario goes to the magician's house and then asks him to teleport to the location where his brother was trapped. But the magician will only perform unless he calls the cops and the media that the magician wasn't responsible for anything related to this incident. Mario didn't bring his phone and forced him to start quickly. The magician agreed to do that trick. So, Mario got inside the box, and the magician used his signature chant to teleport Mario to the location. But, it turns out Mario fell into some random location and blames the magician.\n\nWill Mario ever be able to find his brother Luigi?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-friend-mario"}
