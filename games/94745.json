It is the third game in the beatmania series and is part of the BEMANI franchise ( which it was named after: BEatMANIa ). It is the only beatmania arcade to have an official European release.\n\nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch.\n\nBeatmania 3rdMix is the first game in the series to introduce combo count, meaning that your current combo is shown while playing and a good or less break your combo. If you get more than 10 combo your great verdicts will start flashing, but it does not award you with any bonuses.\n\nNormal and Easy mode has been added to the game, which differs in what songs can be chosen and when. Battle, Mirror and Random modifiers were added.\n\nThe game features 11 songs from beatmania and beatmania 2ndMIX along with 16 new songs for a total of 27 songs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatmania-3rdmix", "videos": [{"id": 38060, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tHJbFS1McuY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHJbFS1McuY", "title": "Beat Mania 3rd Mix (Konami, 1998) Arcade Spielautomat", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tHJbFS1McuY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 38059, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "atqHnpZ5-Kc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atqHnpZ5-Kc", "title": "beatmania 3rdMIX (Arcade / 1998) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/atqHnpZ5-Kc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2945, "name": "beatmania"}]}
