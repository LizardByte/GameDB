However, it is available as a multiplayer appart from Crysis: Warhead. Anyway, the game is very nice, and has of course very high-end graphics for a multiplayer game. You have still, as always in multiplayer, some details and objects that have been lowered from quality for the smoothness of the game and for servers to run better. Anyway, the most importance is the gameplay, not the graphics. You have many options available, as well as completely upgraded to totally unupgraded weapons. Combine it with the well-known nanosuit techs: Maximum Strength, Maximum Armor, Maximum Speed, Cloak (which is by far the most preferable) and weapon-customization. For a multiplayer the game has reached it's most important factors with succes, and is for sure a recommendation if you are looking for an unique multiplayer game. Also, it has dedicated servers so don't worry about that! And anyway, you should try Crysis and Crysis: Warhead also, they are truly magnificent games which will change your gaming experience for ever! The game features CryEngine 2 where you can create your own maps (Single and Multiplayer) and it's very user-friendly!\n\n\nMy Computer:\n\n- Windows 7 Premium\n- CPU (Processor) - Intel Quad Core i7 860 @ 2.80GHz\n- GPU (Graphics Card) - ATI Radeon HD 5870 (1Gig)\n- Memory - 8 Gigabite (4x2gig)\n- Soundcard: ASUS Xonar D2\n- Monitor - SyncMaster B2230 (Full HD / 70000:1 Dynamic Contrast / (1920x1080)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0NGPJCmHaw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0NGPJCmHaw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0NGPJCmHaw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0NGPJCmHaw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0NGPJCmHaw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Crysis Wars - Official Trailer [Full] (1080p)", "description": "Crysis Wars - Official Trailer in HD\n\nINFO\n\n* Developpers: Crytek\n* Publishers: Electronic Arts\n* Distributors: Steam\n* Wikia: http://crysis.wikia.com/wiki/Crysis_Wars\n* More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis\n* Series: Crysis, Crysis: Warhead\n* System Requirements (minimum):\n\n- Windows\u00ae XP(SP2)/Vista/ Windows 7\n- Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae 4 2.8 GHz (3.2 GHz for Vista), Intel Core 2.0 GHz (2.2 GHz for Vista), AMD Athlon 2800+ (3200+ for Vista) or better\n- 1.0 GB RAM (XP) or 1.5 GB RAM (Vista)\n- DVD-ROM drive\n- 15Gb available HDD Space (Crysis: Warhead inclusive)\n- NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae 6800 GT, ATI\u00ae Radeon\u00ae 9800 Pro (Radeon X800 Pro for Vista) or better\n- Graphics: 256 MB\n- Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible\n- Internet connection.\n- DirectX\u00ae 9.0c or 10\n\n\nCrysis Wars is the multiplayer version which comes with Crysis: Warhead.
