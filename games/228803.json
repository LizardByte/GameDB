Maybe you'd rather immolate them with lava or bombard them with meteors. You could always confuse them into hitting themselves. Then again, why fight goombas when you could enslave them into your army? If that doesn't work out, you've got this motorcycle you could crash into them. The Cleft has 16 character classes, each with a different play style.\nGameplay in the Cleft is as much about exploring as it is about killing things. Secret treasure is hidden everywhere, waiting to be claimed by those willing to endeavour. Quests are prominent, with activities ranging from committing industrial espionage for a paranoid innkeeper to seeking the blessings of the mana spirits. To top it all off, we have an active roleplaying community to make your own story part of the Cleft.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-cleft-of-dimensions", "videos": [{"id": 80812, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PQPI0Yvihqs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQPI0Yvihqs", "title": "The Cleft of Dimensions - Gameplay Sample - MUD Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PQPI0Yvihqs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
