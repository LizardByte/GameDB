Set in a near-futuristic world a socially distanced and disengaged human populace has become dangerously dependent on robotization. Established human social components such as privacy, intimacy, and community are all in states of disruption. Already outnumbered by robots, humanity unwittingly marches towards technological singularity, and the battle for the control of the system begins.\n\nSet in the city of Nutropolis, a sprawling mix of post-modern high-rises, robo-ghetto-infested tenements, empty post-industrial factories and abandoned, underground transportation tunnels. Players are challenged to navigate and survive threats and battles set in locations that range from narrow alleyways, treacherous rooftops, a partially flooded derelict subway system, cyber-vermin-infested subterranean labyrinths, and a seedy underbelly district of human-robot interaction.", "summary": "Disruption is a third-person fight for the future of humanity set in the near future, quasi-dystopian world where robots, driven by the global corporate imperative for cheap and obedient labor, are displacing humans at all levels of the workforce.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disruption"}
