He returns to his home village, only to find it burnt down, and his beloved woman dead. Kneeling at her grave, the warrior swears revenge, but this quest soon turns out to go far beyond it, as demonic forces are threatening the land!\n\nGens\u014d Tairiku Aurelia is a side-scrolling action RPG. You control the warrior (and other characters whom you can control later in the game) by moving him through platform locations - towns, forests, dungeons, etc. In towns you can talk to people to advance the plot. In wilderness areas, you fight enemies by attacking physically or using magic spells in real time. You can also jump in this game. You get experience points for defeating enemies, gain levels and stronger magic.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gensou-tairiku-aurelia"}
