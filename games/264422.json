He found a strange glowing orb, which was later accidentally discover by his fourteen-year-old son Gen, who was rummaging through Dad's collection. As a result, Gen was indeed teleported into a parallel world. There, he meets a young girl named Rinna, who tells him that he is, in fact, \"Gen-Kaiser\", the much-expected savior of their world. Piloting giant combat robots, the two must protect the innocents of that world and defeat evil.\n\nKis\u014d Shinden: Gen-Kaiser is a turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid (what is commonly called in Japan a \"tactical RPG\"). There is overworld navigation, and the player can also visit and explore cities; however, these features are rather rudimentary, and hostile areas cannot be explored in real time and are presented as large-scale strategic battles. The characters move in turns over the top-down battlefield and attack when enemies are in range. Animations are displayed for each attack, and experience points are awarded for successful elimination of an enemy.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kisou-shinden-gen-kaiser"}
