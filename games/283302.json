This rich civilization was built using the power of \"magic\" granted by the spirits. However, this long-lasting civilization rapidly declined after the spirits disappeared and eventually perished.\n\nThere were those who were interested in this ancient world. The protagonist, Hyde, travels around the world seeking the legacy of the old world. During his journey, he happens to visit the town of Arville. There, he hears rumors that something resembling ancient ruins has been found in a nearby cave. Hyde heads to the cave and meets a girl who holds the key to the truth.\n\nThe game was developed over a period of more than two years. It features a wealth of content, including around 800 types of items and modes where the enemies' strength is doubled or tripled, providing substantial replay value.\n\nUnlike the original PC (Windows) version released almost two years earlier, the Dreamcast port does not feature any adult content. A couple of years later, DVD PG Edition release came out which also includes adult content.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/d-plus-vine-luv--1"}
