You'll choose your class from one of four unique adventurers, and then set out with a deck consisting of some basic attack cards. During the course of your adventure, you'll be presented with the opportunity to add powerful new cards to your deck.\n\nNo adventure would be complete without slaying a few monsters that get in your way. In battle, you'll draw cards from your ability deck. Each time you draw a card, you'll be able to swipe right to play the card, or swipe left to skip a turn and regain some stamina.\n\nBetween battles, you'll venture through a variety of locations, represented by an encounter deck. You'll encounter blacksmiths that can upgrade your cards, temples that can help you optimize your deck, and mysterious characters that will make you all sorts of bargains.\n\nThe tactical strategy of combat micro-decisions mixed with the strategic element of deck-building provides a compelling and deep gameplay experience.\n\nAs with all roguelikes, death is permanent. You'll earn some gems that you can use to unlock new cards, but it's back to the drawing board after that. Start out with a new adventurer and set out on your quest once again.\n\nThe good news is that Meteorfall is different every time you play - you'll encounter different locations, different enemies, and different quests. Part of the challenge is adapting to the challenging situations the game puts you in, given the cards available.\n\nGood luck hero - it's time to end the Uberlich's cycle of destruction!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/meteorfall-journey", "videos": [{"id": 18817, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SkNRPOgWoWM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkNRPOgWoWM", "title": "Meteorfall Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SkNRPOgWoWM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
