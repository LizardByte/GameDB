Explore this strange interconnected space, learn its rules, and discover the surprises that dwell within.\n\nRather than ordinary light beams, however, these pulses can and will collide with each other. Create new colours, deflect them in new directions, and pay attention to their timing to unlock the path to new puzzles.\n\nAlong the way you'll encounter a wide array of components which interact in unique and surprising ways. You might even discover you can pass pulses and components between puzzles.\n\nPrisms, glitches, new types of mirrors, and more lurk in the depths.
