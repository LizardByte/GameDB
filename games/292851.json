Three main characters will save the world??\n\nEasy-to-understand game content! Defeat a specific enemy on the stage and get a heart! When you collect all the hearts, the stage boss appears. It is an action game that clears the stage if you defeat the boss.\n\nStrong ~ player! You can choose from three main characters: \"Santos\" the tough guy, \"Kamakura-kun\" the ninja, and \"Rosesub\" the swordsman.\nAll three of them are strong characters.\n\nAnd a suspicious world view... Both the enemy and the boss are full of suspicious characters!!\n\nIf you defeat the boss's \"sheep\", there are a lot of strange and bizarre stage events such as \"sheep curse\" where you will be cursed and become a sheep in the next stage.\n\nAlso, for some reason, something called \"Mr. Chin's Roulette Corner\" appeared between the stages. If you get a hit and do well, your HP will increase and your attack will be powered up!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trio-the-punch"}
