The player must stack items up and then drop a katamari to sweep them away all at once. There are two main game modes available to play, these are the Endless and Challenge modes. Challenge gives you a specific goal to complete, usually with a time set by The King of All Cosmos. These challenge modes involve rolling up a certain amount of a single item, rolling up a number of complete Katamaris, rolling up tons of items into a single Katamari, surviving for a set amount of time, and ???.\n\nGiving the King Katamaris of various sizes makes him say various things. If given a small Katamari, he will say that it's the smallest Katamari he's ever seen. He then tosses it downwards. If given a small, complete Katamari, he tells you the Katamari is okay, but not great. Making a medium-sized Katamari has him congratulate you, and making a big Katamari has him say that he's impressed. Making a gigantic Katamari with tons of items in it well have him exclaim in surprise at the sheer size, then say he is surprised. Giving him one with nothing on it will have him yell at you for wasting a perfectly good Katamari. Then, before tossing it away, he tells you to stop giving him wasted Katamaris. This relates size to number of items within the Katamari, not the actual metric size of the Katamari itself.\n\nWhen a Katamari is thrown into the sky, it turns into a star. The star a Katamari creates depends on the number of items in it. The star can either be a small dot, a normal star, a colored star, a rainbow star, or a planet.", "summary": "Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy (\u3053\u308d\u304c\u3057\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u584a\u9b42, Korogashi Pazuru Katamari Damashii?) is a falling block puzzle video game released by Namco Bandai for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare digital download service for 500 points (5 dollars). It is a spin-off of the Katamari series. However, it bears little resemblance to the series, resembling Tetris more so. It uses the gameplay engine and concept of Pac-Attack, another puzzle game created by Namco.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/korogashi-puzzle-katamari-damacy", "videos": [{"id": 87088, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SLrF3r_GqZg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLrF3r_GqZg", "title": "Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy - Endless mode normal difficulty", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SLrF3r_GqZg/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 910, "name": "Katamari Damacy"}]}
