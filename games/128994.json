While the graphic and playful implementation is often very good, there is often a lack of really good AI that works tactically and creates interesting situations. That's why we wanted this role to be taken by a player who can observe the situation from an RTS perspective and thus has the opportunity to act more tactically than an AI could. \n \nAlthough Dark Prospect offers the possibility that the monsters can be controlled by an AI, the clear focus is on PVP.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 39155, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "DV5jKpn9occ"}]}
