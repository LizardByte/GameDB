Don't let them hit as they make the wall weaker. This sounds simplistic and is, but highly addictive as you score points for every alien destroyed. If a segment of the outer wall is destroyed (by the aliens kamikaze into it) if this happens enough times the outer wall flashes and you need to move in a level, post haste. If you don't, you drift off to space and all is lost. Don't fret though you have a chance to regain lost wall space by simply staying alive. If you stay alive long enough with no more incidents, you can regain that which has been lost...precious wall.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wall-defender"}
