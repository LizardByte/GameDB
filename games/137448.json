It is an amalgamation of every experience you\u2019ve had; every person you have ever met or will meet\u2014 time will not stop for anyone, not even a reclusive vampire who has all but cut himself away from the world and everyone he has ever known. After meeting an eerily familiar reaper, No\u00ebl finds himself at a crossroad. Should he continue down the path he had set forth on, or will he carve out a new ending for himself?\n\nPerhaps the vampire has been even more lost than he realized. He may have forgotten those he had loved and the land that he came from, but it does not matter. Memories are of no use to him.\n\n\"If you could forsake all that you have ever known for a brighter future, would you?\"", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/traumerei-chapter-4"}
