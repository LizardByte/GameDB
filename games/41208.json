If the cards match, they disappear from the playfield. If they don't match, the cards are flipped back over face down and the player tries again. The better the player is at memorizing where the overturned cards were, the easier it will be for him to find a match. \n \nThe game contains 4 variations of its basic premise. The Memory Match 1 variations offer a smaller grid thus making it easier. \n \nMemory Match 1: \nCipher-24 (6x4 grid with numbers) \nSymbol-24 (6x4 grid with symbols) \n \nMemory Match 2: \nSuper Cipher-40 (10x4 grid with numbers) \nSuper symbol-40 (10x4 grid with symbols) \n \nThe game offers both 1 and 2-player modes. When playing alone, the player tries to clear the board in the fewest amount of guesses.
