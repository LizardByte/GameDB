It was initially released as Jungle King. Jungle Hunt is one of the first video games to use parallax scrolling.\nThe player controls an unnamed jungle explorer sporting a pith helmet and a safari suit. The player attempts to rescue his girl from a tribe of hungry cannibals by swinging from vine to vine, swimming a crocodile-infested river, jumping over or ducking beneath rolling rocks, then releasing the girl before she is lowered into a boiling cauldron.\nHome versions were released for the Apple II, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, ColecoVision, VIC-20, and IBM PC. The PC version was developed by Sierra On-Line and is incompatible with anything except an original IBM PC/XT with a CGA video card.\nIn the Atari-ported versions the hero is named Sir Dudley, and the girl, married to Sir Dudley, is Lady Penelope.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jungle-hunt", "videos": [{"id": 83190, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_Ey3dzEjlec", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ey3dzEjlec", "title": "[HQ] Jungle King Lv1 1982 Taito  Mame Retro Arcade Games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Ey3dzEjlec/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
