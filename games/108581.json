They must do so by only checking boxes which are connected to other boxes. Make sure to complete columns before other players do! The first to complete a column earns more points than those that complete them later. In addition to points for completed columns a player can receive a bonus if they checked all the boxes of the same color.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/noch-mal"}
