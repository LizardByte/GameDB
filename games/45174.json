Barbie must find an outfit for her date with Ken. The environment features a shopping mall level, an underwater level, and other worlds to explore. The game is also centered around collecting gems and pearls to fend off opponents.\n\nEnemies in the game include the usual sharks found in underwater levels in addition to jellyfish. Moving cubes of sugar must also be defeated in the game. The bonus rounds of the game are essentially a Concentration-type game where matching identical cards lead to extra points for the player.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-game-girl", "videos": [{"id": 20452, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cEAllMexV0A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEAllMexV0A", "title": "Barbie: Game Girl - Gameboy", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEAllMexV0A/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
