{"id": "0JA1ZGgat_0", "snippet": {"title": "ADG Episode 15 - Snarf", "description": "Episode Originally Released: September 3rd, 2010\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nMy main reason for wanting to cover this game was because it looks really good when run in DOSBox without aspect ratio correction on a wide-screen display. Not a lot of games made for DOS look good when you stretch them to fill a wide screen, but any time you run across a game that runs in EGA 640x350 resolution, it's always worth a try! ;)\n\nActually, the game's pretty neat too, just not too much to say about it. :B\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Information and Corrections:\n\n* Here's a direct link to the page on the RGB Classic Games website where you can get the full version of Snarf: http://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Snarf.html\n\n* Unlike a lot of old independent game developers from the days of DOS (excepting Soleau and Moraff), Everett Kaser has made a TON of other shareware games, mostly logic puzzles, which can be downloaded from his company website at: http://www.kaser.com\n\n* I neglected to mention the First-Aid Stations which restore you up to 50 tags when touched. It's best to save these until you're either ready to leave the level... or desperately low on tags.\n\n* Since it doesn't come across in a 4:3 aspect, 480p video, I took a screenshot of what this game looks like when stretched to 1920x1050 with the HQ3X scaler in DOSBox. (Which fits almost perfectly in a 1920x1080 screen space!)
