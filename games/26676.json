Yen Sid explains that in order to confront Xehanort, they will need to gather the Seven Lights, among those which include the three Keyblade Wielders who befell a terrible fate over a decade ago. At Yen Sid's request, Mickey tells Riku and Kairi of the time he came across Aqua in the Realm of Darkness.\n\nThe story begins where Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep Final Mix's Secret Episode ended, with Aqua discovering the Castle of Dreams within the Realm of Darkness. Sensing something suspicious, Aqua makes haste towards the castle, fending off repeated Heartless attacks along the way. However, upon approaching the castle grounds, the clock on the castle's tower advances, causing the land to crumble.\n\nAqua enters the nearby town to find five Gears that will turn back the clock and restore the grounds. As she locates the Gears and activates them, Aqua experiences flashbacks to her time in the Realm of Light. After reviving the path to the castle, Aqua makes her way forward, but is accosted by a large swarm of Shadows conglomerating into a Demon Tower, which she successfully repels. Entering the castle, she spots what appears to be Terra. When she approaches him, though, the apparition disappears into light. Aqua solemnly recalls her past with her friends before proceeding.", "summary": "A short sequel to Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep that partially takes place during the events of the first Kingdom Hearts, A fragmentary passage gets its name from a hidden ending to BBS and tells the story of Master Aqua's ten-year journey through the Realm of Darkness. 0.2 acts as a prologue to the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III, and also as a demo of Kingdom Hearts traversal, combat, and graphics in Unreal Engine 4 as it will appear in KH3.
