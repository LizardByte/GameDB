In Horse Lords, you will be able to take anything from a smaller nomadic tribe to a great horde and start building your empire from horseback.\n\nThis expansion introduces a number of new systems and game mechanics, for example a completely new government form and the possibility of having tributary states. You can also expand and control trade on the ancient Silk Road in order to finance your conquests - but beware - others will also try to gain control of these lucrative routes, and enemy raiders may try to destroy your trade posts if you don\u2019t guard them well.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 9946, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rtVIu4fHOS4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVIu4fHOS4", "title": "Crusader Kings II - Horse Lords Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rtVIu4fHOS4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
