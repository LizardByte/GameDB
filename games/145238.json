Game & Watch game released in 1984 by Nintendo. In America, the game was originally known as Punch-Out!! (named after the popular franchise), though when the game was included in Game & Watch Gallery 4 they changed the name back to Boxing. The model number for the game was BX-301. Within the box of the game were the unit, LR44 batteries, and a caution leaflet. In the game, you'll box another character. The game is seen from a 2D perspective, and your character is always on the right.\n\nThe only difference between Boxing and Punch-Out!! were the names and the box. The American box had artwork that was made specifically for it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boxing--3", "videos": [{"id": 71211, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ir5Ek73ensc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir5Ek73ensc", "title": "Game & Watch - Boxing (Micro Vs.
