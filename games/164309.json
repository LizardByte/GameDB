Jump, slide, avoid the obstacles \u2026 Master the challenges in the different obstacle courses and hope that you will reach the elevator of the tower.\n\nIn \"23 seconds to 5\" you run linearly through desert environments, pirate areas and greenhouses with dangerous pitfalls. You explore the surface of the moon, underwater landscapes and futuristic high-rise districts. In the depths of a mine you will be led through dark corridors and caves. Night and horror await you too. Be careful. You will also encounter pyramids, artistic design and abstraction on your way. Do not be distracted, dangers lurk between all the diversity and beauty."}
