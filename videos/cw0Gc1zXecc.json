All associated sprites, graphics, text, and sounds for Pikachu have been edited to fit with Cramorant!\n\nSome additional features include: extra Pok\u00e9mon, better Pok\u00e9mon trainer variety, more wild Pok\u00e9mon to be encountered, slightly more challenging trainers, a few additional events and locations, some beta and unused content, Super Game Boy compatibility, every Pok\u00e9mon obtainable in-game, various bug fixes, and much more!\n\nThe official site and download page for Pok\u00e9mon Yellow: Cramorant Edition can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/Cram-o-dev/cramorantedition\n\nTo play Cramorant Edition:\n1. Click the Github link and go to Releases - v1.0 Full Release\n2. Scroll down to Assets and download the \"pokecram.bps\" file.\n3. Patch the .bps file onto a clean, English ROM of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow. There are many online and downloadable ROM patchers that will apply the file to the ROM. If you don't know how to use one, Google is your friend. Also, if you aren't sure how to acquire a ROM of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Google can help too.\n4. Open your Gameboy or Gameboy Advance emulator and load the patched ROM. Alternatively, you can also load the ROM onto your Gameboy Flashcart and play on real hardware. Many Gameboy emulators can be found here: https://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gameboy/\n5. Enjoy!\n\nCan also be downloaded here:\nhttps://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7831/\n1. Make sure you have a program that can extract .rar files like WinRAR or 7-Zip.\n2. Extract the patch to wherever you want and follow step 3 above.\n\nI'd like to give a huge thanks to the Pok\u00e9mon Reverse Engineering Team (pret) for their disassembles of many Pok\u00e9mon games. Cramorant Edition was created using the Pok\u00e9mon Yellow disassembly as a base. I'd also like to thank the pret discord community for being incredibly helpful for guiding me and providing me with advice when I got stuck during hacking. As someone with absolutely no hacking or programming skills, I appreciate their willingness to help. Without them or the disassembly, this project wouldn't have been possible.\n\nI'd also like to thank FrenchOrange for touching up some of the custom art and sprites, Vortyne for allowing me to use code from PureRGB, RainbowMetalPigeon for giving me lots of feedback, and finally Xillicis, JustRegularLuna, and PlagueVonKarma for writing coding tutorials on the disassembly wiki's which I used.\n\nTrailer Music - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vXjBKnKD8\n\nPok\u00e9mon is owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.
