Located in rural locations, and often in or surrounded by farm fields, the airstrips include ground textures and scenic models galore. The facilities available at the strips vary - some offer refueling, while others offer little more than a view over the crops or cattle. It includes airstrips in Kent, Norfolk, Essex, Suffolk, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, East Sussex and Cambridgeshire - this is the perfect introduction to small time flying in the UK!"}
