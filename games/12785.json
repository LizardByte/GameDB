The gameplay is similar to Taito's Bubble Bobble.\nPuff and Blow each have a Methane Gas Gun which fires a cloud of immobilising gas. If this comes into contact with a bad guy he will be absorbed into the gas and then float around the screen for a limited time. Bad guys are harmless in this state. Puff and Blow must suck the floating gas clouds into their guns and blast them out against a vertical surface. Bad guys then turn into bonuses which can be collected.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-methane-bros", "videos": [{"id": 96033, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HQh5IqfHufA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQh5IqfHufA", "title": "Super Methane Bros. - Amiga Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HQh5IqfHufA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
