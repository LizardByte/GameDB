{"id": "vx3gUQpaxz4", "snippet": {"title": "Sirens: Announcement Trailer", "description": "DISCORD- https://discord.gg/NhnNxDEr63 , RELEASE DATE:  TBA \nSteam wishlist: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541950/Sirens/\n\nHow long will you survive in a sea full of bloodthirsty sharks? Will you capture a Spinosaurus and fend off the tentacles of the Kraken? Or perhaps you dream of a Megalodon tooth? Don't look for it in a museum, snatch it from the jaws yourself!\n\nA STORY OF SIRENS\n\nThe game concept is based on a theory in which the evolution of humanity was at some point diverged. The complex organism that chose to leave the ocean and conquer the lands was divided. Part of the species decided to stay in the water and evolve there. Perfecting their physical bodies, these beings began to exhibit more and more traits typical of marine creatures, giving rise to humanoid mermaids who never experienced life on land, evolving underwater. \n\nUNDERWATER EVOLUTION\n\nSimilar to humans on the surface, mermaids also dominated their environment, becoming the dominant species, free from diseases and wars. As long-lived beings, mermaids became increasingly perfect, more intelligent, and adept at hunting. Hiding from homo sapiens, concealing themselves in the depths of the ocean, in underwater caves, mermaids observe humanity, understanding that sooner or later, a confrontation will arise to determine the dominant species.\n\nFROM PREHISTORY TO THE PRESENT\n\nExperience a fascinating journey through the world from the perspective of mermaids at different stages of their evolution. Feel the terror of the prehistoric world, the times of great floods, battling real and mythical creatures. Uncover the secrets hidden at the bottom of oceanic depths!\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n\n- Exploration of sea and ocean waters\n- Survival mode\n- Main Hub customization\n- Mermaid customization\n- Combat using melee weapons\n- Boss battles \n\nMore - https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541950/Sirens/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vx3gUQpaxz4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vx3gUQpaxz4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vx3gUQpaxz4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vx3gUQpaxz4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vx3gUQpaxz4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sirens: Announcement Trailer", "description": "DISCORD- https://discord.gg/NhnNxDEr63 , RELEASE DATE:  TBA \nSteam wishlist: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541950/Sirens/\n\nHow long will you survive in a sea full of bloodthirsty sharks?
