If the player is hit once, then the suit is lost and the player must play as the little girl. One more hit and the player loses a life. Although the game was only released in Japan, the game's text is in English and is completely playable by English speakers.\n\nThe game is very poorly made, which is a shame, because I think it had potential.\n\nThe game was played through twice in order to get true ending. I played through all stages on the first playthrough, and used warps on the second one. There seems to be a lot of secrets in this game. I have found many using a guide, and found several on my own on top of that, but there still probably are some that were missed. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlY__MvVPF8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlY__MvVPF8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlY__MvVPF8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "NES Longplay [892] Miracle Ropitt: 2100-Nen no Daibouken", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nMiracle Ropitt: 2100-Nen no Daibouken (Jap:. \"Miracle Ropit?s Adventure in 2100\" ) is a 1987 action-platformer for Family Computer.\n\nA girl in the year 2100 uses a robot suit.
