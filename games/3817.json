He also obtains a mysterious medallion.\n\nIn Leonardo's absence, the remaining the three Turtles go their separate ways. Raphael adopts a vigilante-styled persona known as the Nightwatcher, Michelangelo gets a job as a children's birthday party entertainer (or punching bag), and Donatello becomes a telephone computer-support assistant.\n\nWhen Leonardo comes home from his long venture, there is immediately strain in his relationship with Raphael.\n\nWhile Leonardo and Master Splinter endeavor to heal their family's bonds, mysterious Foot Clan activity and monster sightings cause additional difficulty.", "summary": "TMNT is a single-player action-adventure multi-platform action game starring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
