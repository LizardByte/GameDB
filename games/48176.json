To succeed the player must press the pads with their feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dance-aerobics", "videos": [{"id": 117129, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LAOUTCbAPGc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAOUTCbAPGc", "title": "Dance Aerobics - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LAOUTCbAPGc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
