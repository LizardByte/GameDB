The alien robots are back and this time they\u2019ve got Korea in their sights. It\u2019s your job to lead a squad into fierce fire-fights and fend off the alien invasion. Plan your routes carefully and use new units and powers to turn the tide of war against a horde of new enemy threat.\n\nTHIS ISN'T TOWER DEFENSE IT'S TOWER OFFENSE. Flipping the tower defense genre on its head, you play the invaders leading your unit into alien-infested districts. Plan carefully, use your money and powers wisely, and make it through unscathed.\n\nA NEW WAY TO PLAY Keep an eye on the action from a top-down perspective, assemble your squad, plan your route using the tactical map and simply execute player powers such as Boost, which speeds up your unit\u2019s offense. Test your leadership abilities in the extra \u2018Art of War\u2019 trials.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anomaly-korea", "videos": [{"id": 33642, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ESSVbuXZUew"}]}
