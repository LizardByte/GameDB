Like its predecessor, it bears considerable similarity to the early titles in the Ultima series.\n\nIn Black Magic, the player resumes the role of the Lord Champion of Syree, who, having defeated the evil wizard in the first game, returned to the life of a simple farmer. This peaceful existence however is interrupted when the news come that the Keeper of the Power has passed away. The Keeper is a person responsible for all the mystic powers in the realm. When a Keeper dies, the power is immediately transferred to a newborn child. This child must be raised as a good person for magical powers to be available to everyone, but if the Dark Forces find the child first, the balance of magic power will be upset. So the Lord Champion prepares for another journey to save the kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-kingdom-of-syree-ii-black-magic"}
