In Staroyale players pilot their starship in one of several modes, taking on a whole armada of enemy starships. Players must make use of the intuitive controls, upgrade options, skills unique to each starship, and an interactive environment to take down enemy ships or risk being destroyed. Choose a ship and loadout that best suits your play style as each ship comes with its own set of passive and active skills, allowing for different play styles and strategies, with not just one way to victory.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/staroyale"}
