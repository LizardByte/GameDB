Will you fight, run, or lead your people to the stars? Or murderously ascend the human throne? \n \nTwo races clash; humans and turans--human discord versus turan magic. When the turans\u2019 ancestors left the world to walk between stars, wild magic began returning. Now humans war to fill the vacuum, blind to the magical blight that is racing to smother the whole continent. High in their plateaus, the last turans must choose: Fight, follow their ancestors into the stars, or perish. And their fate rests on the life of a human child. \n \nThe Aegis Saga is a 280,00-word interactive fantasy novel by Charles Parkes, where your choices affect the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.", "summary": "The blight eats the world while humans war for scraps.
