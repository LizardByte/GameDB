Inspired by the brutal difficulty of Getting Over It, our game takes the challenge to the next dimension, literally! With 3D gameplay, you'll navigate your box through a chaotic, physics-defying world filled with traps, obstacles, and frustration.\n\nIn this trailer, we\u2019re excited to showcase brand-new mechanics that make the gameplay smoother, more accurate, and way more fun (or infuriating, depending on your skills \ud83d\ude09). The old mechanics served their purpose but were outdated and far from perfect. With this update, we\u2019ve reimagined how you interact with the world, adding new tools and physics-based controls to push your limits.\n\nWill you reach the goal? \n\nWishlist the game now: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541550/One_Box_One_Goal/\n\nJoin the discord server of the game:\nhttps://discord.gg/Tb7k3YfR9B\n\n#OneBoxOneGoal #IndieGame #GettingOverIt #PhysicsGame #gamingtrailer", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5qq8Sp-7HY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5qq8Sp-7HY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5qq8Sp-7HY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5qq8Sp-7HY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5qq8Sp-7HY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "One Box One Goal - Announcement Trailer", "description": "Welcome to the latest trailer for One Box One Goal! \n\nThis is not your average rage game.
