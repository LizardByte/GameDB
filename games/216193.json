While Trent was looking out on this cliff, a quick explosion startled him. A strange sword inside a stone had appeared behind him... as it flew straight towards his hands. Trent was confused. His vision began to darken for a few seconds. He felt as if he was traveling at lightspeed. Suddenly... he ended up in a whole new world. Crystal Depths. A place only for those who have been given the Spectral Sword, a sword that can morph its blades into glowing blue objects, like a bow or hammer, or even a spear. Trent had obtained this sword... but he has yet to know that this sword gives the user a quest. A quest to close the Void once more.", "summary": "Sword: Depths of the Void is WorthyWorm and The Sword Teams first upcoming game, releasing in 2024-2025.
