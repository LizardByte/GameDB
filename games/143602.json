Made possible by a faster than light engine discovered and solely owned by the Mezen Corporation, colonists have settled on the only habitable planet in the Alpha Centauri system and named it Aurora. To facility research, logistics and trade, a giant space station was constructed in orbit by Mezen, and now is home to tens of thousands.\n\nHumanity was not the first race to call Aurora home, as the surface is covered in decaying runes of a long dead, technologically advanced civilization. What killed this ancient race was never discovered... or so we thought. Mezen, who had long known the truth, was running experiments upon the culprit, an invasive organic organism, aboard their orbiting station. Believing the organism to be dead or dormant, the Mezen's scientists accidently awoke this ancient horror and it began to infect all organic matter aboard the station.", "summary": "A 2d, sci-fi, metroidvania style shooter coming to PC and Nintendo Switch.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zombies-in-space"}
