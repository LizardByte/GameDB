The Witch's House is deliberately designed with traps at almost every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time.\n\nWith completely remastered visuals, The Witch's House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans. Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-witchs-house-mv", "videos": [{"id": 28849, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Bol92Ra7sbM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bol92Ra7sbM", "title": "The Witch's House MV - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bol92Ra7sbM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
