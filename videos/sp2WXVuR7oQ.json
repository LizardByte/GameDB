Tecmo developed and published it for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES); its development and release coincided with the beat 'em up arcade version of the same name. It was released in December 1988 in Japan, in March 1989 in North America, and in August 1991 in Europe. It has been ported to several other platforms, including the PC Engine, the Super NES, and mobile phones.\n\nThe story follows a ninja named Ryu Hayabusa as he journeys to America to avenge his murdered father. There, he learns that a person named \"the Jaquio\" plans to take control of the world by unleashing an ancient demon through the power contained in two statues. Featuring platforming gameplay similar to Castlevania, players control Ryu through six \"Acts\" that comprise 20 levels; they encounter enemies that must be dispatched with Ryu's katana and other secondary weapons.\n\nNinja Gaiden is renowned for its elaborate story and usage of anime-like cinematic cutscenes. It received extensive coverage and won several awards from video gaming magazines, while criticism focused on its high and unforgiving difficulty, particularly in the later levels. More than fifteen years after its release, the game continued to receive acclaim from print and online publications, being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. It was novelized as part of the Worlds of Power game adaptations written by Seth Godin and Peter Lerangis, and it spawned a soundtrack CD.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:41 - Act I\n03:50 - Act II\n08:43 - Act III\n15:12 - Act IV\n26:32 - Act V\n32:32 - Act VI\n\n#nes #nintendo #playthrough #gaming #retro #walkthrough #longplay #gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sp2WXVuR7oQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sp2WXVuR7oQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sp2WXVuR7oQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sp2WXVuR7oQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sp2WXVuR7oQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ninja Gaiden (1989) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "description": "Playthrough of Tecmo's notoriously challenging Ninja Gaiden.
