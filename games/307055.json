Unlike previous attempts to replace EarthBound Beginnings\u2019 dialogue, this patch repoints virtually all of the text in the game. This allowed the fan translation to be included in its entirety. The main version also makes names of characters, locations, and items more accurate to what they were originally.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mother-restored"}
