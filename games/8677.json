It improves over the game by upgrading the arcade sequences. Here, unlike the original game; sword fighting is about method and is not just wild clicking of the mouse button.

The jousting is now easier to control and the lance no longer bounces around wildly.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/defender-of-the-crown-ii", "collections": [{"id": 1165, "name": "Defender of the Crown"}]}
