Discuss with them to find out their ideas, preferences, and expectations for their dream house. Once the project has been defined, you will have to renovate their home and fulfill the objectives of the mission to satisfy each client. The happier your client is with the result, the more your fame and level increase, unlocking new items, styles, decoration possibilities and bigger projects! With hard work and a sense of style you\u2019ll soon become the most famous designer in town!\n\nOnce an experienced designer, you can decide to keep working on a client\u2019s project or to design your own and even choose between the renovation mode or the decoration mode. In renovation mode, modify the house\u2019s structure by destroying or building walls, remove the hard wood floor or tiles, paint, change the lining, fix the electricity installation, or add a water supply. Then switch to the decoration mode to choose and set up furniture, plants, carpets, wallpapers, curtains and so on. It\u2019s up to you to give each house a real personality.\n\nFeel free to work on your own projects whenever you want. You can choose the structure of your house: Flat, studio, house or duplex and decorate as you wish.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-universe-interior-designer"}
