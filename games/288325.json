Use collected resources at space stations to upgrade guns and shields and improve gas usage. Mostly a peaceful game of exploration, you will have to monitor your ship's gas and ammo usage and may occasionally attract the attention of pirates who will attempt to destroy your ship.\n\nIn Out of Gas, the environment beyond the starting area is procedurally generated and completely random. Apart from the special colored asteroids, the dropped resources are also completely random. There is a chance that you will encounter a trade post, where you can trade gems for large amounts of other resources such as gold, iron, and oxygen.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/out-of-gas--3"}
