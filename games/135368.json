Our jam community has no tolerance for racism and strives to live in a Touhou fan community without it, so many of our creators have donated their jam entries here to be submitted to itch.io's Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality. Included as well is new content for NitorInc.: Touhou Microgames! DEMO+."}
