Radirgy Noa is a sequel to Radirgy, and while it's not as exciting as the original game, it's still a very fun game, definitely better than what I used to think. Some design choices like the collision damage, square screen, and lack of shield are a bit strange and un-Milestone-esque though, and the final boss is really hard, so I didn't put a lot of time in it. But now I managed to 1CC it! I practiced the final stage + boss through a saved state and it paid off big time when doing full runs.\n\n\nThe biggest obstacle to clearing the game definitely was that final boss. You need a strategy and you need to understand its behavior and its patterns to stand a chance. While phase 1 isn't too bad if you don't mess up your route (which I did and paid a life for it lol), phase 2 (the floating head) can get insane. My main strategy was to not damage the front mask and eyes to prevent an early berserk state, and also time when the boss gets under 50% health (and thus enters berserk mode) to minimize the ensuing chaos.\n\n\nWhat I did was only damage the boss by using the ABSNet and pointblanking on the top of the beanie (since the mask can be destroyed separately and you don't want that to happen), and trigger berserk mode right after the pattern with the blue bullets since this one is the hardest one to handle with berserk mode active. When berserk mode is active I try to stay on the top of the screen since the boss fires some lasers below it that try to target you but can't hit you above. Also you can possibly cancel some band-aid-shaped bullets and recharge the ABSNet faster, but it's still a crapshoot. I was kinda lucky to dodge the blue laser attack for example as I didn't expect it at all lol.\n\n\nIt was still close in the end, I came in the last stage with full lives and still barely beat it on my last one. Sure, some of those life losses were quite avoidable, but it shows how brutal the game can be. And it also has a remaining lives bonus (very strange for a Milestone shmup) so you're incentivized to no-death the whole game wtf lol.\n\n\nOn a side-note, I got very close to beating the Dreamer09 on its 3rd stage instead of the 4th one, but I still haven't managed to do that. I have to take some more risks when destroying the right wing and study the superplays to optimize my part destruction. Not only it's badass, but it also gives you more points since the 4th Dreamer09 stage will have a fresh Dreamer09 to hack away at for score.\n\n\nI may return to this game again to beat my score but so far I'm happy to have cleared it.\n\n\nPlayed on Dolphin, recorded with OBS Studio, played live at https://www.twitch.tv/m_knight_jul", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jAeZpto9M50/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jAeZpto9M50/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jAeZpto9M50/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Radirgy Noa \u30e9\u30b8\u30eb\u30ae\u30ce\u30a2 - Arcade Mode - ALL (Good End) - 247.211.520pts", "description": "#\u30e9\u30b8\u30eb\u30ae #shmup #STG\nThat clear was long overdue, dayymn.
