Expand it! is a ticket to the more cheerful aspect of the past, revealing a magical world with cute primitive creatures: the Rainbow Dinos! These dinos literally blow up with excitement: touch them and they will instantly inflate. Help them reach the rainbow! Each tap expands them even more; tap again and again, and see their funny bloated faces. To reach the rainbow, you will need to think carefully about which dino to tap and expand first. Only by using the correct strategy can you create a perfect chain reaction of rolling, falling and bursting creatures that will enable them to taste the beautiful colors of the rainbow. The whole tribe will freak out if one of them makes it to the top!"}
