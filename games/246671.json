She intended for said tree to serve as a symbol of Gensokyo's newfound age of ecology, and it was called the \"Life-Guiding Tree\" to reflect this. However, during the opening celebration, a mysterious light appeared around the top of the tree, giving off a strange power. This prompts teams of Reimu Hakurei and Utsuho Reiuji, Marisa Kirisame and Byakuren Hijiri, and Sanae Kochiya and Kanako Yasaka to investigate.", "summary": "Touhou fangame developed by Ido.
