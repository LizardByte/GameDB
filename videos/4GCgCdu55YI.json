To my knowledge, this is the first video game to feature real-time perspective changes (camera position changes).\n\nGame info:\n\nAs your squadron loses ships, you can add more ships from your inventory (shown at top left). You can also catch ships that periodically appear moving from the top of the screen toward the bottom.  The configuration of the squadron changes as a new squad leader is socketed into position (at the front center of the squad). If your squad leader is killed and a new one takes the front center position, the new squad leader will automatically implement a new configuration.  Be sure to eliminate snipers ASAP.  Keep in mind that the faster you fire, the shorter your shot range. Keep calm and lower your firing rate to achieve optimum distance and accuracy. When navigating the tunnels, watch the indicators that surround the squadron: if a red vertical bar appears on either side, that means you're getting dangerously close to the edge of the tunnel.  This game is designed to create tension. The key is to stay focused and keep from letting the stress get to you.\n\nIf playing on the M.A.M.E. emulator:\n- Set resolution to 1024x768 or higher\n- Gamma Correction = 1.70\n- Vector Beam = 1.70\n\nLeft mouse button = fire\nRight mouse button = add ship from inventory\n\nNot sure what early 80s arcade games to focus on?
