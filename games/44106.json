It was released in Europe as Smash Tennis by Virgin Interactive. A North American release of the game wouldn\u2019t be seen until February 2020 where it would be part of the Nintendo Switch Online lineup.\n\nThe controls of Smash Tennis work similar to other tennis games and especially Namco's previous tennis game World Court Tennis: the player moves the athlete over the court and presses buttons with the correct timing in order to win the match. This time there is no story mode, but a tournament mode instead. Here the goal is to win the Grand Slam by playing various tournament matches. However. a match only has a single set. There are 20 athletes (both male and female) to choose from which have different advantages and drawbacks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smash-tennis", "collections": [{"id": 4601, "name": "Family Tennis"}]}
