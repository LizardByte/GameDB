It was the last title in the series to use the old 512 x 384 resolution. The story is about how Sheila Rae isn't afraid of anything, unlike her sister Louise, who is frightened of anything her sister does. This is, once again, one of the rarest titles due to being out of print for a long time, and is very hard to come across.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/living-books-sheila-rae-the-brave"}
