But, with such a stigma around death and what happens when we die, it\u2019s no surprise people make up stories around the dead.\n\nLate one night, you are called into work to handle some embalmings. Death doesn\u2019t keep day time hours. But there is something different about these bodies because there is something different about you. The phone rings with the Mortician on the other end. The rumors are true, and you can not leave.\n\nPerform embalmings, handle the various jobs around the mortuary, and exorcise demonic forces. All in a day\u2019s work.", "summary": "Having completed your degree in mortuary sciences, you have taken on an apprenticeship at River Fields Mortuary.
