In battle all ways are viable so rush down or sit and lie in wait its your choice. \n \nThree unique game modes are included, elimination, control point and cash grab. Elimination is the standard death match game, where kills are what matters not the last one standing. Control point forces players to keep zones under their control to rack up the most points. Cash grab is a twist on a similar game mode from smash bros, whoever collects the most cash wins! \n \nTread carefully on each of the 6 planets! The weather is not friendly to those who venture to set foot on its surface, and may include heat waves, item rain or a gigantic meteor shower! But for those who desire a more competitive game, weather can be turned off because Twin Stick Heroes revolves around player choice, making any match feel completely personalized to your taste. Don't like an item or gameplay mechanic? You can turn each one on or off, allowing for lots of replay value!", "summary": "In Twin Stick Heroes you take control of an oddball group of \"heroes\" duking it out for ultimate glory! Matches are fast and intense, every second can either mean your victory or demise, so you may have to be a little creative to come out on top. \n \nAll 19 heroes vastly change gameplay, each and every one is equipped with a unique weapon or ability focusing on a certain playstyle. Sniping players across map with a bow and arrow or going in close with a dart gun can be just as effective as laying traps or hiding in plain sight as Ghost. \n \nControls are tight and responsive meaning that no matter how slow or fast your HERO is you'll always have a way out of most situations. \n \nThe core fighting mechanics are easy enough for any new player, but has enough depth to draw veterans of the twin stick shooter genre, with a huge amount of heroes and items to choose from, as well as a large variety of gameplay altering variants, modes, maps, and settings to play around with.  \n \nMany people may describe this game as a multiplayer bullet hell, but with the vast armament and tools given to the player the winner is most likely the one who is the most creative not necessarily the one with the fastest finger.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twin-stick-heroes", "videos": [{"id": 45902, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wPp1yCt5hWQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPp1yCt5hWQ", "title": "Twin Stick Heroes- Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wPp1yCt5hWQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
