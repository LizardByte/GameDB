Toxic pollution and war have reduced the United States to a state of anarchy, except for the occasional city-state. Almost the entire area is covered by water, and dangerous mutants roam the wasteland. The player takes on the role of the Crimson Tape, the new leader of the Superhero League of Hoboken, imbued with the amazing power to Create Organizational Charts. \n \nThe United States is a nightmare land of toxic waste, melted ice caps, and desperate shortages of oat bran. Horrible mutations roam the countryside... monsters spawned of radiation, environmental toxins, and unregulated bio-engineering. But in a tiny corner of New Jersey, a small group of Superheroes has banded together.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/superhero-league-of-hoboken"}
