The post-game Kanto portion of the original Crystal has been greatly expanded with new quests. The player is able to catch all 251 Pokemon as well.\n\nThe gameplay has also been revamped with elements from later games as well. Physical/Special damage split (with new moves from newer games), Fairy Type, Move Re-Learner, EXP for catching have been included. Original game bugs have been fixed, such as with specialty Poke balls.\n\nOf note is that the game optionally includes an \u201cAdvanced AI\u201d hack. However, this will require a special emulator setup to install, as it allows an external script to analyze the player and enemy data to pick smarter moves for the AI. As RHDN does not permit emulator-specific hacks, that variation of the patch will need to be download at the authors\u2019 site, / . The standard version of the hack, which uses the original AI, can be applied and run in any emulator.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-anniversary-crystal"}
