From the frigid Barents Sea to the balmy Mediterranean, the North Atlantic and the English Channel, the Allies can be pitted against Axis forces in one-day battle scenarios or longer campaigns. The Axis forces include the German, Italian and French navies, while U. S., British, and Soviet ships are available on the Allied side.\n\nMore than fourteen major engagements are featured, including the Battle of the Denmark Straits, Atlantic Convoy Run, and Bismarck and Prinz Eugen versus the Hood and Prince of Wales of the Royal Navy. In addition, over 100 random scenarios for either surface or carrier actions can now be fought. The player has a choice of difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert. The higher the level, the more the computer opponent receives an advantage in material, rate of fire, and accuracy.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/great-naval-battles-burning-steel-1939-1942", "videos": [{"id": 135421, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FG-9yo6sbtY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG-9yo6sbtY", "title": "Great Naval Battles 4 gameplay (PC Game, 1995)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FG-9yo6sbtY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
