For you it's the mean streets of Rowdy City. Rowdy City's Wrestling gym is a place where dreams can be made or crushed. You will meet a variety of characters throughout your career, some who want to help you and others who maybe have other plans for you.\nIn career mode you will start as a nobody and fight your way towards the RCW World Championships. It's not going to be an easy journey, you will fight in 1 vs 1 matches, six person brawls and royal rumble events. The aim of the game is to earn cash to improve your stats so you can take on the guys at the top. If you need a bit of extra cash you can pick up a part time job lugging boxes around, or take the more dangerous route and do some street fights.\nThere are a variety of characters to unlock and an endless mode that lets you jump straight into a royal rumble mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rowdy-city-wrestling"}
