Command planes to adjust their headings, altitudes and speeds and guide them to their final approach fix or exit point at the requested altitude. But be careful! You must always maintain Air Traffic rules: a 3-mile lateral or a 1000 feet vertical separation, just like in real air traffic control services. The more planes you safely land, the faster they go- how long can you keep it up?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/app-control"}
