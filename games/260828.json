Unlike all the other Star Revenges, this hack's 8 main levels are all 2.5D and themed around the beat blocks found in SR3.5.\n\nThe hack is split into 2 difficulties:\nNormal mode, which has checkpoints in all levels to save your progress and Hard mode, which removes all the checkpoints.\n\nHard mode can be unlocked once you master all 8 levels once.\nIf you want to just beat the hack, you can do once you got 8 stars, you are not forced to do anything on hard.\nDoing levels checkpointless is more for dare devils that would try to do it anyway, so it got added into the game.\n\nSince the camera can be limited, the hack comes with screenshoots of the levels so you can plan/see ahead what comes next in the level if needed.\n\nThis hack can be pretty hard, even on normal, but it's more a thing of getting the timing down. That said, course 8 is no joke tho.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-revenge-3-dot-9-dreamish-block-beats", "videos": [{"id": 95341, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "TSwzV49pvy4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSwzV49pvy4", "title": "Star Revenge 3.9 DBB - Release Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TSwzV49pvy4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
