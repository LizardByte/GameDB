The game itself is a classic point and click adventure, and should not be confused with the platform game based on the movie.\n\nYou play both Wayne and Garth, and you can switch between them at any time. The plot is simple; In an attempt to save their tv-show, Wayne and Garth decide to hold a pizza-thon (a charity show with a pizza-theme) in order to raise money. In order to be able to hold the pizza-thon Wayne and Garth must embark on several quests to collect items and hire people they need for the show. The adventure includes participating in babe-jeopardy, joining a biker's gang and baking pizza. The graphics are in 2D and the sound contains several samples from the movie.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/waynes-world--2"}
