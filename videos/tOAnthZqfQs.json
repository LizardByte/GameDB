In this game, players can do such tricks as ollies, manuals, wallrides, spin tricks, handplants and lip stalls, Indy and Kickflip, spine transfers, as well as a few types of grind tricks.\n\nWhen doing grinds or manuals, players will be repeatedly prompted to press Up or Down and failing to do that in time will make them bail and lose any points they could've gotten if they landed the trick or the combo they were trying to do.\n\nSuccessfully pulling off tricks and combos will fill in a meter that when half or completely full allows players to activate \"Footy Time\". This will slow down the speed of the skater and add a trail effect to the skater's movement. Footy time allows players to squeeze extra tricks while they are in the air.\n\nThe game features two gameplay modes:\nThrasher Mode, where players complete various missions with the ultimate goal of winning the Thrasher Skater of the Year award.\nFree Skate, where players can skate to their hearts delight on the areas they've unlocked while playing through the Thrasher Mode.\nAs players beat the challenges of the Thrasher Mode, they will unlock Media Clippings in their Scrapbook and be able to see the records they've achieved during gameplay.\n\nIn total, there are 12 Chapters to complete in the Thrasher Mode with 4 missions in each chapter taking place in 3 areas: Plaza, Halfpipe and Downtown.\n\nMore Information about game from Mobygames\nhttps://www.mobygames.com/game/j2me/skate_\n\nSkate \u00a9 2007 Electronic Arts Inc.
