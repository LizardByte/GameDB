It took Japanese arcades by storm, and is one of the most commonly known versions of the game. Due to its popularity, it became the base of rules for many other Japanese games created later on, both licensed and unlicensed. Such games include the TGM series, Tetris Plus series, Tetris S and Shimizu Tetris. It was one of the first games to have lock delay, greatly improving maneuverability at high speeds."}
