In order to do that, you must pick a deck from three starter packs of cards based on Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur and travel to the eight card clubs and defeat their leaders. Along the way, you will challenge many players to collect new cards and the helpful Professor Mason will aid you by giving you cards as well. While becoming a card master is a laudable accomplishment, the real goal of the game is to collect all of the cards over 200 in all. If you want to collect all of the cards, you must play human opponents in the Pop mode to get a chance to earn rare cards. All of the complexity of the real-world game has been captured here.
