Originally published under an incorrect licence, the game led to Henk Rogers's purchase of the Tetris licence on multiple platforms, which later led directly to further Nintendo releases.\n\nIt is infamous for its control scheme, which mapped down to rotate, and A to hard drop, the opposite of most later versions which have down for drop and A for rotate.\n\nOn October 1st, 2018 the game was re-released as part of the AtGames Legends Flashback. It has an updated copyright screen and remapped controls (up/B for rotate, down/A/C for hard drop). On November 1st, 2019, it was re-released on the updated Legends Flashback, Legends Ultimate Arcade, and the Adventure Flashback Blast!."}
