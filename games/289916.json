Initially thrilled to use his phony \"ghost hunting equipment\" for real, he soon learns that the malicious Entity that supposedly killed all the residents may be real as well... and it doesn't plan on letting him leave so easily.\n\nEach chapter will have multiple endings; will Jack help the trapped spirits along the way and get the true answers, or focus on getting out as quickly as possible before he shares their fate?\n\nYou decide how Jack will fare, in Victim Complex.", "summary": "In this narrative-driven, first-person horror game, hack medium Jack Lognare discovers his first legitimate haunting.
