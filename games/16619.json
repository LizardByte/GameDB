You have designed the perfect system: a train, sealed off from the fog, ready to rescue survivors and take them to salvation. \n\nIf only they'd listen...", "summary": "Fear Equation is a turn-based horror strategy game where you play the engineer of a modified freight train, built to protect its occupants from a deadly fog that brings their nightmares to life. Survival depends on analysing passengers' dreams, crafting defenses, upgrading, scavenging and resource management.\n\nAs the Engineer, you'll need to rescue survivors, analyse their dreams and build defenses to protect them from their own imaginations. Complicating matters, passengers have their own theories as to how the fog was created and will form inter-carriage factions based on their beliefs. \n\nEvery game is unique and you can customise your Engineer to dramatically change how the game is played.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "videos": [{"id": 6805, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "l7IBaieZzww"}]}
