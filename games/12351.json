To this day it\u2019s still considered one of the most technically impressive Amiga and PC games ever made. Players controlled their trusty starship, which they could upgrade with five different weapons, missiles and shields.\n\nSuper Stardust 96, the latest incarnation of the game, featured five different worlds (all connected via 3D hyperspace tunnels) and 30 levels chock-full of asteroids, enemies and bosses.
