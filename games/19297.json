At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn.\n\nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei L\u00fcbbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.\n\nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ken-folletts-the-pillars-of-the-earth", "videos": [{"id": 14595, "name": "First Video Insights", "video_id": "S8R94YRM4bw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8R94YRM4bw", "title": "Ken Follett's: The Pillars of the Earth - First Video Insights (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S8R94YRM4bw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14596, "name": "Teaser 1", "video_id": "mSdFp6kcb5M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSdFp6kcb5M", "title": "Ken Follett's: The Pillars of the Earth - Teaser 1 (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mSdFp6kcb5M/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14597, "name": "Teaser 2", "video_id": "-UUszjHXOec", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UUszjHXOec", "title": "The Pillars of the Earth - Teaser 2 (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-UUszjHXOec/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 15624, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CewTYloQSt0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CewTYloQSt0", "title": "The Pillars of the Earth - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CewTYloQSt0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 17185, "name": "Episode 2 Trailer", "video_id": "b0Xrt6ftryg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Xrt6ftryg", "title": "Ken Follett's: The Pillars of the Earth - Episode 2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b0Xrt6ftryg/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 12726, "name": "Aliena"}, {"id": 9606, "name": "Andrew"}, {"id": 12736, "name": "Catface"}, {"id": 12728, "name": "Tom Builder"}, {"id": 12732, "name": "Remigius"}, {"id": 12740, "name": "Adult Jonathan"}, {"id": 12745, "name": "Earl Bartholomew"}, {"id": 12765, "name": "Prior James"}, {"id": 9974, "name": "William"}, {"id": 12742, "name": "Matthew"}, {"id": 12727, "name": "Prior Philip"}, {"id": 12737, "name": "Young Jack"}, {"id": 12733, "name": "Milius"}, {"id": 12746, "name": "Outlaw Leader"}, {"id": 12743, "name": "Arnaldus"}, {"id": 12751, "name": "Story Teller"}, {"id": 12729, "name": "Ellen"}, {"id": 250, "name": "Percy"}, {"id": 12731, "name": "Bishop Waleran"}, {"id": 12739, "name": "Francis"}, {"id": 12760, "name": "Basim"}, {"id": 12758, "name": "Cuthbert"}, {"id": 12753, "name": "Meg"}, {"id": 12767, "name": "Alonso"}, {"id": 5907, "name": "Foreman"}, {"id": 12754, "name": "Reynold"}, {"id": 12762, "name": "Hugh"}, {"id": 12750, "name": "Bishop Henry"}, {"id": 12759, "name": "Aysha"}, {"id": 12764, "name": "The Cantor"}, {"id": 12735, "name": "Regan"}, {"id": 12749, "name": "Gervase"}, {"id": 12763, "name": "Young Jonathan"}, {"id": 12766, "name": "Tashid"}, {"id": 1589, "name": "Paul"}, {"id": 1598, "name": "Walter"}, {"id": 2338, "name": "Timothy"}, {"id": 3469, "name": "Ralph"}, {"id": 11345, "name": "Alfred"}, {"id": 8758, "name": "Aldous"}, {"id": 12744, "name": "Sheriff Eustace"}, {"id": 12738, "name": "Young Richard"}, {"id": 1077, "name": "Martha"}, {"id": 12747, "name": "Symond"}, {"id": 12761, "name": "Alfonso"}, {"id": 12755, "name": "Drunk Worker 2"}, {"id": 12752, "name": "Drunk Worker 1"}, {"id": 12757, "name": "Young Martha"}, {"id": 12748, "name": "Young Monk"}, {"id": 12756, "name": "Rashid"}, {"id": 1044, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 3510, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eqxaecy6e3ibtvrtprbe.jpg"}, "name": "Elizabeth", "species": 1}, {"id": 12741, "name": "Odo"}, {"id": 5159, "name": "Mary"}, {"id": 11741, "name": "Richard"}, {"id": 4338, "name": "Prophet"}, {"id": 114, "name": "Jack"}, {"id": 12734, "name": "Agnes"}, {"id": 12730, "name": "King Stephen"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
