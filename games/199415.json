Extra care has been put into making everything have punch and impact and be fun to use but not the level of overkill. I'm a mad perfectionist when I get going; so repeatedly testing something over and over whilst I tweak values is not unusual.\nGothically medieval, with a taste of moderate-high fantasy. Magic is meant to semi-common in the world, whether through artifacts, or mystical items.\nBased around play where you get used to using both your arsenal and your inventory items in tandem. Flechettes and Discs of Repulsion are really useful now; so use them!\nRigorously playtested with custom doom, heretic, and hexen wads to get a feel for how it plays with them; and to see if I can find reason to switch between my arsenal all the time (which is the sign of a good arsenal, in my opinion).\nIs named this way because... well, \"Hexen\" are witches from germanic folklore. Walpurgisnacht is a grand festival for witches in general. So as a festival of new content for Hexen related shenanigans; its doubly relevant.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/walpurgis", "videos": [{"id": 67619, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5VdDN8kfzRI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VdDN8kfzRI", "title": "Walpurgis Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5VdDN8kfzRI/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 67620, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XN0LKrvj7BY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN0LKrvj7BY", "title": "Walpurgis + MMDoom: WaterSpirit", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XN0LKrvj7BY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
