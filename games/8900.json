The game is presented in isometric view, and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as Ida progresses to the map's exit. Each of the ten levels has a different central mechanic. Interactions include moving platforms and pillar animals, and creating bridges. The player is indirectly cued through the game by design elements like color, and directly cued by crow people, who block Ida's path. Critics compared the game's visual style to a vibrant M. C. Escher drawing and Echochrome. The game includes a camera mode where the player can roam the level to compose screenshots. It includes filters \u00e0 la Instagram.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 3463, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wC1jHHF_Wjo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC1jHHF_Wjo", "title": "Play Monument Valley Panoramic Edition on Steam", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wC1jHHF_Wjo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 19489, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Me4ymG_vnOE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me4ymG_vnOE", "title": "Play Monument Valley Panoramic Edition on Steam", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Me4ymG_vnOE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
