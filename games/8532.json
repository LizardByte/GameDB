Stages are accessed from a world map, with more becoming available as Link clears an area or defeats a boss. The game have been subject to much criticism and Nintendo does not recognize it as part of the series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/link-the-faces-of-evil", "videos": [{"id": 43433, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dKB9Sy3K06w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKB9Sy3K06w", "title": "Link: The Faces of Evil (Zelda CD-I) - Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dKB9Sy3K06w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
