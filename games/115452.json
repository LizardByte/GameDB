A rogues' gallery of fanatically devoted NPCs is ready to obey his every order, but the world Momonga now inhabits is not the one he remembers. The game may be over, but the epic tale of Ainz Ooal Gown is only beginning.\"", "summary": "A different world dark fantasy RPG in which you, the main character in this collapsed world, grow up while challenging various difficulties.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mass-for-the-dead", "videos": [{"id": 25080, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "9u3AFDEh1oQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u3AFDEh1oQ", "title": "\u3010OVERLORD\u3011MASS FOR THE DEAD \u30c6\u30ec\u30d3CM (OxT\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4e3b\u984c\u6b4cVer)\u3010\u30aa\u30d0\u30de\u30b9\u653e\u9001\u5c40/\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9u3AFDEh1oQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 130920, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "y4fpM9JTKKQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4fpM9JTKKQ", "title": "Overlord: Mass for the Dead | OFFICIAL TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y4fpM9JTKKQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
