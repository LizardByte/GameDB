It plays almost exactly the same: players take on the role of Fami-chan, catching falling stars to try and achieve a high score. The gameplay in this version is slightly tweaked, with Fami-chan now having two different jump heights based on the jump button the player chooses. It had a limited release of one cabinet at the Kaden no Ken-chan store in Akihabara before later being released on CD-ROM for Windows.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kira-kira-star-night-ac"}
