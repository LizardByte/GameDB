It follows the adventures of Carl Corey, who wakes up in a hospital with amnesia, escapes and starts searching for answers. After a while he discovers his true identity, his mission and a fantasy world hidden from the eyes of mere mortals. A lot of work has to be done.\n\nThe gameplay is linear and consists of several loosely connected elements: a simple point-n-click adventure, a number of quick-time events and 9 stand-alone puzzles. The story is told through dialogs that follow the text of the novel closely. The game comes with 2D hand-drawn characters and pre-rendered backgrounds.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/devyat-princev-ambera"}
