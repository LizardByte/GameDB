The main difficulty is that the world is invisible to the robot and shown only for a small period when the scan ability is activated. \n \nFuturistic laconic levels will seem simple, but it is worth remembering that each surrounding object is hostile for a small fragile robot. Your main enemies will be time and a limited number of charges. Your friends are reaction, calculation and sense of time. \n \nEach level will require you to carefully study the new difficulties. You will be able to pass through the portal only by learning on your mistakes, looking for a safe way to avoid the obstacles and solve puzzles on a given time. \n \n \nIf it seems to you that there are few difficulties, try to pass each level into three stars!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/peep", "videos": [{"id": 28723, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lYgDljVRmzY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYgDljVRmzY", "title": "Peep trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lYgDljVRmzY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
