We call these dimensions. These alternative worlds will have the same basic shape, but otherwise be very different with different physical laws.We follow Oliver, a boy with special abilities, and his faithful friend, the little dog Spike. Oliver was separated from his parents as a child and it\\'s your task to uncover his past and future as you travel through the dimensions on the quest for answers. The game will feature innovative gameplay, where the player will get to explore alternate realities, where it\\'s possible to manipulate, use and violate nature\\'s laws to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles of more or less challenging difficulty levels."}
