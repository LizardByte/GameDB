The game features two tables, one of which must be unlocked.\n\nYou defend your own goal with your usual flippers. The goal at the other side is defended by four defenders and a goalie. If you complete objectives you are allowed to perform free kicks, corners and penalties. Referees can roam the playing field to kick back the ball to your flippers.\n\nIt is possible to play this flipper game in two player mode, in that case both goals receive flippers and the goal becomes to score in one another's goal.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-soccer-98", "videos": [{"id": 95272, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "qb7Sx8fzyUk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7Sx8fzyUk", "title": "Pinball Soccer '98 - Pin-Ball Games - Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qb7Sx8fzyUk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
