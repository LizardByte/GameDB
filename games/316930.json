The game was developed by Full Fat and set to be published by Swing! Entertainment in late 2000. Despite being based on the live action movie, the game itself had a cartoony artstyle which is more in line with the show rather than the series of movies.\n\nThe game was later cancelled and another racing game based on the movie was later released instead in 2001 exclusively for the PlayStation 2.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-flintstones-in-viva-rock-vegas--1", "videos": [{"id": 126519, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zy32LhSh-cg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy32LhSh-cg", "title": "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas Full Game (Dreamcast)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zy32LhSh-cg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
