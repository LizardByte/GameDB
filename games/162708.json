This news was sobering and fascinating at the same time. Sobering in the sense that the decades old tradition of chess programming had been relegated to the shadows by a self-learning system. Fascinating because it was possible to hope that one could learn really new stuff about chess from this radical approach. Nobody had expected that a cooperative effort by chess developers would soon make this technology generally available.\n\nAs things stand, Fat Fritz defeats in a direct comparison all traditional chess programs and even LCZero. The moves suggested in analysis are often extremely human and planned. With a painfully practical limitation: Fat Fritz needs (like LCZero) a very high performance Nvidia graphics card (\u201cGPU\u201d) in order to achieve its full playing strength. Nevertheless, here for the \u0081rst time in many years we can record a real breakthrough in chess programming. Fat Fritz and LCZero are already beginning to change opening theory.", "summary": "This chess program offers you everything you will need as a dedicated chess enthusiast, with innovative training methods for amateurs and professionals alike using the neural chess engine \"Fat Fritz\".", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fritz-chess-17-steam-edition"}
