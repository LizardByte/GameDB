The port is of the Japanese PlayStation version and does not have any of the gameplay improvements or changes made to the original English version, though the additional cinematics included in the English version are intact. Full motion video has been added to story events in the game and replaces all original anime scenes.\n\nLezard Valeth's teleportation circle was changed from a pink pentagram to a purple circle though this was left unchanged in the PlayStation Portable version. The names of Frei, the elder sister, and Freya, the younger, were reversed from Norse mythology and from the Japanese version (though in the former, Frei is the elder brother).\n\nThe English version of Lenneth uses an enhanced version of the original game's localization and reuses the original English voiceover track. Square Enix cleaned up the original game's English script and additional voice over dialogue for the CG movies was recorded by New Generation Pictures, rather than the original company, TAJ Productions.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 9456, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LPjFmGkSOAk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjFmGkSOAk", "title": "Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth trailer (Jp)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LPjFmGkSOAk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
