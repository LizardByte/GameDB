Zzyzzyxx is opposed by the evil trio by the names Boris, Bluto and Smoot, also known as the Rattifers. These three will try to intercept Zzyzzyxx as he makes his way through the maze. He can collect a helmet in the maze, which can be used to imprison a Rattifer inside a brick, or to break a brick in the row above to move through the maze. As the levels progress, Zzyzzyxx must avoid crumbling bricks, rising missiles, and dropping bombs. The game has a 1up player score and laps tallied at the top of the screen.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zzyzzyxx"}
