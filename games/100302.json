Unlike most medieval/fantasy beat 'em ups, it featured an isometric viewing angle, some platforming (usually involving players stacking rocks or crates to climb on and jump to treasure chests), unusually large stylised sprites, and variable blood/gore settings. \n \nUnusually, there are two European versions of the game: one uses the title Light Bringer, and the other uses the title Dungeon Magic. While this game uses the same title as Taito's earlier NES game Dungeon Magic: Sword of the Elements, the two games are unrelated aside from their titles.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lightbringer"}
