No work in sight, let alone fun? Well, look no further. Become a criminal and make money in various ways - there's always a job waiting, if you're willing to accept it.\n\nPlay up to 4 people, complete jobs, steal, fight and take over hideouts in free-roam areas. Take on unique tasks with special requirements. Buy cars, craft new weapons and ammunition. Nothing can stop you anymore.\n\nAccept and complete all sorts of jobs - from stealing items, and collecting debt from gang members (nicely or not) to eliminating gang leaders or even planting a body bag in a container. The list is long.\n\nDo you have friends? Great! You can play up to 4 people, complete jobs, steal and fight together. Voice and text chat directly in the game.\nNo friends? No problem! Play offline as well.\n\nAnyone can be fought - the police, civilians, gang members. You choose how to do it. It is highly recommended to grab a good melee weapon though - and perhaps throw it with high velocity at your enemy's face. That might just do the trick.\n\nAfter completing jobs and other checklists, you rank up in the criminal world. You can use acquired skill points to learn new attributes & helpful skills.\n\nBe careful, if you go into some area with high-ranking enemies unprepared, you might find out quickly. Always get ready for the action.\n\nOh, customization. Do you want new gloves? You got it. Do you want a new look? Just use your wardrobe.\n\nThere's a farm in the middle of nowhere, so enemy gang members decided to make it their hideout. You may disrupt that.\n\nGo in guns blazing, or the stealthy way - stealth kills deal more damage, but you gotta be really careful not to be seen.\n\nCoordinate with your friends who does what - you can lure enemies to an empty field while your friend prepares to drive right into them, eliminating them from this world.\n\nOnce the hideout is taken over, prepare to defend. They will try to take it back. Craft weapons, aid, and explosive material at the workbench. Use a sentry turret to help you out.\n\nSome jobs might have special requirements, but also the pay is much higher - break into a warehouse, install a virus on their camera system, but you can't be seen. Beat up some civilians, but don't let them call the cops. Take out a gang leader using only explosives. There's plenty more.\n\nTake over farms, abandoned shacks, garages, anything.\n\nHave your very own cannabis farm - plant some cannabis seeds, water them nicely, and watch them grow. Once they're grown, harvest them, make some joints, and sell them to your neighbors.\n\nJust be careful not to sell drugs to an undercover cop.\n\nTake over warehouses and turn them into a drug lab. Hire workers to cook for you. Just don't hire a bald guy or you might not live for very long.", "summary": "Crime Simulator is a co-op game you can become a criminal.
