Since then, the project has gone on to be a complete hack of SWM spanning across and heavily altering all of its levels.\n\nAs this hack is designed with the explicit goal of showing off Lunar Magic, players will find a wide variety of challenges across Super Demo World\u2018s many meticulously crafted levels and will assuredly find themselves stretching out fiber of their SMW muscles along the way.\n\nEach on of the castles in this hack come with a quirky blurb at the end once you defeat the boss, many of them referring to bizarre or somewhat dark scenarios where the Koopa\u2019s were experimenting on the eggs or simply hording them for buffets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-demo-world-the-legend-continues", "videos": [{"id": 66847, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "LJ6ktQ1XFPE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ6ktQ1XFPE", "title": "SMW Hack Longplay - Super Demo World: The Legend Continues", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJ6ktQ1XFPE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
