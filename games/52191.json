There was also a hidden feature in the game, which wasn't documented, and affects a single player game. During a free kick for the CPU if the player has tapped button A for player two, the CPU performs a short-shot, while pressing the button A performs a longer kick.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-sidekicks", "videos": [{"id": 15119, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "1QKB5vnFDXs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QKB5vnFDXs", "title": "Arcade - Super Sidekicks - Tokuten Ou (1992)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1QKB5vnFDXs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
