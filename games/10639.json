Henry was a hot-shot and a rascal and not so much fond of his father. When the old man lost the McCarty ranch to the bank, the young Henry finally rebelled and took off to seek his own fate.\n\nIn the next ten years Henry changed a handful of jobs. By the start of the War McCarty already had problems with local criminals and decided to abandon the state of Texas. Packing his arrogant temper, his disdainful attitude towards the spoilt city-boys and a pair of trusty revolvers, he headed to New York City.\n\nThis new scenario which plays out in the new Suburbs district starts when Lucky Luciano wants Henry \u201cThe Kid\u201d McCarty to join his cause. Things start to go haywire when we find out that \u201cThe Kid\u201d is already on a mission for a damsel in distress.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/omerta-city-of-gangsters-damsel-in-distress", "collections": [{"id": 1243, "name": "Omerta: City of Gangsters"}]}
