{"id": "iqryl5lj7Uo", "snippet": {"title": "Abadox (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Milton Bradley's 1990 NES game, Abadox: The Deadly Inner War.\n\nFor my full write-up and review, including screen shot galleries and soundtrack, check out http://www.nintendocomplete.com/abadox\n\nAbadox is an excellent 8-bit shooter from Natsume that apes some major concepts from LifeForce... calling it \"inspired by\" might be being generous... but it still manages to provide its own unique brand of alien creature organs to pilot a space fighter through. The enemies have some pretty disturbing designs throughout, as do the levels themselves. That giant tongue still haunts me a bit to this day, as does that gross orange digestive organ that blinks lewdly at you. I still don't understand how ROB ended up as a boss, but whatever. \n\nThe music is also AWESOME, and was done by Kiyohei Sada, the Konami legend that composed the music for Rush'n Attack and Contra. A resume like that speaks for itself, don't you think? \n\nAnyone else remember the TV commercials for this? They were sweet - they were actually the reason I got into this as a kid. \n\nIt's seriously hard, but in most situations, there is a simple solution around wildly weaving in and out fire - with a bit of attention to enemy patterns and placement, you can usually find a relatively safe spot on the screen. These spots really are vital to getting through some of the harder corridors and boss encounters, but if you make it, Abadox is an incredibly satisfying game to conquer!\n\nThe original playthrough I had recorded of this game was one of my first videos uploaded back in 2013. It was uploaded in 240p, which meant that half of the flickering stuff disappears constantly in that video. Since four years have now passed, I figured it was time to fix that. It's a great game, and it deserved a brand new fresh playthrough at 60fps, so here it is!\n\n__________________________\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iqryl5lj7Uo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iqryl5lj7Uo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iqryl5lj7Uo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iqryl5lj7Uo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Abadox (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Milton Bradley's 1990 NES game, Abadox: The Deadly Inner War.\n\nFor my full write-up and review, including screen shot galleries and soundtrack, check out http://www.nintendocomplete.com/abadox\n\nAbadox is an excellent 8-bit shooter from Natsume that apes some major concepts from LifeForce... calling it \"inspired by\" might be being generous... but it still manages to provide its own unique brand of alien creature organs to pilot a space fighter through.
