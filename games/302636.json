Suddenly the zombie apocalypse happens and the two heroes need to gear up and escape. The game has 20 levels and two types of objectives: surviving zombie waves by killing everything or surviving waves while protecting Jake because he is busy doing something else. Usually procuring new weapon types which get unlocked after beating the current level. Weapons have limited ammo (but ammo pickups frequently respawn) and later the game introduces new enemy types, e.g. one which spits acid.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zombie-strippers-stole-my-heart-then-ate-my-brains"}
