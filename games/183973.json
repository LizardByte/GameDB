You lead a small squad of mercenaries, who have vowed to restore order and rid the country of the Khondo.\n\nYou need to carefully plot your way through the region, recruiting mercenaries, upgrading your skills procuring armour and weapons and forming alliances with friendly militia. Each location in the campaign map hosts hostile militia, which you must fight in turn-based squad combat.\n\nWhen your squad is strong enough you can confront the ringleader militia, but it will not be easy.\n\nNearly everything in the game is randomly generated, including the campaign map, enemy and resource locations. Scene layout and buildings are procedurally generated, leading to a huge variety of different scenes which your squad has to fight through.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/merc-tactics", "videos": [{"id": 134973, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-NqX3eTq7uY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NqX3eTq7uY", "title": "Merc Tactics 1.8", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-NqX3eTq7uY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
