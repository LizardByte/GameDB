Take care of adorable frogs, grow crops, cook meals, place toys and decorations, and uncover the secrets of Frog island!\n\nWith 2023 coming to an end, almost a year has passed since I began development for Frog Island on December 25th, 2022. Over the course of these many months, Frog Island has come a long way and gone through so many changes, from graphics overhauls, gameplay expansions, and much more. Although there is still so much work to be done, each passing day brings development closer and closer to completion. I also could never have imagined this game growing so big, and it's all thanks to you guys. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your endless patience and support! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAs a final video for 2023, I thought I'd make a lil teaser trailer for Frog Island, as a culmination of a year's worth of development :) Enjoy!\n\n(P.S. Except the next Devlog to come out sometime in January 2024, as the jukebox competition comes to a close!)\n\nThank you so much to Jamal Green for the music!
