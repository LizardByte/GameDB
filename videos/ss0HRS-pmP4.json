Prior to Fairy Tail and Eden's Zero, this is Rave Groove Adventure: Yuukyuu no Kizuna released on January 31st, 2002 for the original Playstation. Came out when the Playstation 2 was out. Aired on Toonami (Cartoon Network) in the U.S. with cuts, but I think the uncut version would be aired in Canada. Aired on most likely Space or Showcase. There is also some more games based upon Hiro Mashima's anime/manga series, Rave Master on the PS2, Gamecube and the Gameboy Advance, hell even another on the PS1. This game is like Ys on a isometric plane. The main character is a silver haired dude and a little snowman like creature that looks depressed most of the time. You slash your enemies and whatnot. As for this game, the graphics look great, the soundtrack is great, the gameplay is fine and sound effects and low quality voices that you would hear on an old cell phone. It requires a bit of patience though. A good game actually and only 10 bucks when I bought on ebay. \nAll rights belong to TokyoPop, Konami Digital Entertainment and Hiro Mashima.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ss0HRS-pmP4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ss0HRS-pmP4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ss0HRS-pmP4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Rave Groove Adventure: Rave Eternal Bond (PS1) (2002) Runthrough", "description": "Alright guys, here is a late release game for the original Playstation.
