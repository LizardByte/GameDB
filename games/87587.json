I need more beta testers for my next update: The Deadly Challenges! \n \nHello human. I'm BAIKOH, and I'm all about typing. Write words by tapping tiles that randomly fall from the top of your screen. Each tile has a letter so... you get the point, I hope. \n \nType quickly and constantly to destroy tiles and keep them from reaching the top of your screen, or just use power-ups to make everything explode. That will work too. \n \nThe \u201cget hyped\u201d list: \n \n\u2022 TOTALLY FREE GAME! WITH WORDS! Yes, in uppercase for greedy humans. \n \n\u2022 ONLINE VERSUS MATCHES in real time. Make your friends suffer by sending them bombs, boulders, freezing tiles and more. The first one to reach the top loses the game. \n \n\u2022 UNLOCK LOTS OF BADGES to slash, ignite and blow up things. \n \n\u2022 LEVEL UP! The better you get, the more your words will earn and the more you'll suffer. \n \n\u2022 OBSESSIVELY CRAFTED WITH LOVE by my state of the art developer monkeys: design, code, everything. \n \n\u2022 Sarcastic humor. \n \n\u2022 100% candy-free app. \n \n\u2022 No pay to play, no pay to win. \n \n\u2022 IT\u2019S FREE DAMMIT! \n \nThe storage permission is for storing cached ads on the SD memory card. The reasons are: \n \n1. To save internal storage space and save data when not connected to WiFi. \n2. More chances to watch rewarded ads (I confess this benefits me more than you). \n \n \nI would really love to hear your suggestions and feedback... I'm surprised to hear that as you. \n \n \nFor real though, did anyone read this?", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 18219, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CgbSGLIXgzs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgbSGLIXgzs", "title": "BAIKOH: Words & Brain Challenges", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CgbSGLIXgzs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 18220, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "fssErRvoXVw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fssErRvoXVw", "title": "Five steps to play BAIKOH", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fssErRvoXVw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 18221, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "YPN-JqSVvWE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPN-JqSVvWE", "title": "BAIKOH - Boom Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YPN-JqSVvWE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
