Hall of Fame announcer Vin Scully provides all of the play-by-play action, and Dave Campbell tags along doing color commentary. From the first pitch to the World Series-saving catch made in deep right field to close out the season, MLB 2002 is a complete baseball package.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mlb-2002", "collections": [{"id": 2669, "name": "MLB"}]}
