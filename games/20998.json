What were they created for?\n\nThe answer still eludes us.\n\nWhat we do know, is that the mysterious labyrinths appeared decades ago, and with them, the world was changed forever. Their true form unknown and ever-changing, they sprawl across the world like a web, connecting towns and villages, mountains, lakes, and deserts.\n\nMany adventurers delved into these labyrinths dreaming of riches, and those fortunate enough to return did so with tales and treasures untold. It was only natural that the children of our world began to look upon these heroes with their unconditional admiration. And as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\n\nHere at our campus, we strive to equip young men and women with the tools they\u2019ll need to become full-fledged adventurers. To all the bright-eyed students stepping through our gates for their first term: Welcome. We hope your studies here are as enriching and productive as you\u2019ve dreamed they would be.\n\n- Principal Feinman", "summary": "Class of Heroes is a role-playing dungeon crawler game.
