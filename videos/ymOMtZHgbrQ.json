Mana Khemia 2 ~The Fallen Academy and the Alchemists~) is a role-playing video game developed by Japanese developer Gust for the PlayStation 2. A \"Portable+\" version for PlayStation Portable was released on 1 October 2009 (Japan only). The game is a spiritual successor to Gust's Atelier Iris series, (recognized as Project A10), and the sequel to Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis.\n\nMana Khemia 2 is classified as a console role-playing video game and is a direct sequel to Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis also created by Gust.\nLike its predecessor, the core of this game focuses on alchemy through which players can create items, weapons, armors and accessories to be used throughout the duration of the game. These alchemy recipes can be attained through field explorations, completing certain jobs or bought in shops. Each item has its own special properties, from elemental attributes to special skills (called \"Common Skills\") which are useful during battle. Like the previous installment, the quality of an item depends on its \"Ether Level\" which starts at 50 and can either increase or decrease according to the selected elemental attributes on the \"alchemy wheel.\" New recipes can be derived from older ones depending on the ingredient selected during item creation.\n\nAt the start of the game, players are given a choice between two characters: Razeluxe Meitzen (or Raze for short) or Ulrika Mulberry. The events that plays out following the choice of characters differs greatly as Raze's route deals with his past while Ulrika's route deals with the origin of Mana. But in either character's playthrough, the core events will still remain the same (taking alchemy classes and school events), though the jobs available may slightly differ.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymOMtZHgbrQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymOMtZHgbrQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymOMtZHgbrQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mana Khemia 2 US English Trailer", "description": "Official trailer of Mana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy for PlayStation 2.\n\n\nMana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy (\u30de\u30ca\u30b1\u30df\u30a22 \u301c\u304a\u3061\u305f\u5b66\u5712\u3068\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u58eb\u305f\u3061\u301c Mana Khemia 2 ~Ochita Gakuen to Renkinjutsushi-tachi~ lit.
