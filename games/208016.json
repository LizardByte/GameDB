Your goal is not to hurt the countless Villains you will face spanning across several dungeons, it is to keep your party alive so they can do the hurting, by any means necessary.\nThroughout your dungeon dives you will incept Memories which can be used to trade for new Scripts - or if you have downloaded Scripts with their own god rolled skills, level them up too! Sell your extra Scripts in the Auction House for extra Memories to spend.\nThere are 35 uniquely skilled subclasses of Scripts to be found, including Tanks and Melee DPS to place on your front line, Mages and Ranged DPS for your back line, and Shamans - a wildcard class that can be placed anywhere in your party setup.\nLowlife places you in battle with a variety of weak and powerful Villains, equipped with only a variety of healing spells to keep everyone (and yourself!) alive. Spend your gained Parameter Points to build the perfect healer and fit your play style and sprinkle a little icing on top by spending Node Points in one of three skill trees.\nComplete Quests and level up to gain access to a variety of dungeons with Bosses and challenges that await you. When you feel confident enough, team up online to take down a Raid Boss or two."}
