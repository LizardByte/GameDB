Soft that was released together with Crazy Hit 2 (known as the Playstation Pok\u00e9mon for using unlicensed art from the franchise) and a special controller to play both.\n\nIt is currently not possible to find the game or recordings of it available, so the only image of it available is the one on the back of the set's box. From the box art and the description on it (in addition to the use of the controller), it is possible to deduce that it shares the same gameplay as Crazy Hit 2 (a whack-a-mole like game), but without the use of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nIn Crazy Hit 2 it is possible to see on the initial screen that the game was made by Poho and Majorros, however without the file for this game, it is uncertain to say that this game was also produced by both developers.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-hit", "collections": [{"id": 9130, "name": "Crazy Hit"}]}
