Another game with no complete walkthrough on YouTube. Unfortunately, it's one of the worst games I played; music and graphics are poor, story is absent and gameplay is extremely repetitive. Pity that konami made such a terrible game. Every mission is exactly the same and only the number of enemies vary (mission 1 has 2 enemy fighters, mission 2 has 4...mission 10 has 20). The hit system is very weird, it seems there is an internal chance meter that decides if you get hit or not. Anyway, in this video I play the Career mode and show a quite stable pattern to avoid enemy missiles and finish the game without too much hassle. I don't show the other 2 modes (Air Combat and Bombing Run) since these are practice missions with exactly the same environment is in Career.
