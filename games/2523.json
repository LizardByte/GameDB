In Ishar 2, the player starts with the character of Zubaran, who is the new lord of Ishar. He receives a vision that tells him to defeat the sorcerer Shandar. It is also possible to import a party of characters from the first Ishar. The game now takes place on an archipelago, each island bearing the name of one of Jarel's companions. Each island also features a different type of landscape: Irvan's island is covered with swamps, Akeer's and Otbar's are underground complexes, Zach's island is covered by a city, Jon's is mountainous, and Thorm's has treetop gangways in a forest.\n\nThis game has a combat system that's more ergonomic than in the first Ishar, and a day-night cycle in which shops are closed at night and the nightclub is closed by day. It also adds a bank (let's leave it to players to figure out what to do with it). Saving the game does not remove gold from the player any more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ishar-2-messengers-of-doom", "videos": [{"id": 25760, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "QFgoHdWTOsc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFgoHdWTOsc", "title": "Ishar 2 - Messengers of Doom 1993 PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QFgoHdWTOsc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 487, "name": "Ishar"}]}
