I just developed this short, free indie beat 'em up meme game inspired by Streets of Rage and Final Fight, with a hint of Marvel vs Capcom! Taste the goodness of the assist and character switching system within the game! Will you choose King, the ordinary college student who somehow found a legendary sword? How about Naira? Nevermind, she's a perverted weeaboo stalker. Or is that how you like your waifus? Well, how about choose Faliyos! He's handicapped but his left arm is pretty strong, i-if you know what I mean! Not into tough guys? There's Alen! The most ordinary guy you can pick! Well, except he's like good a Taekwondo (but he quit lol). Which ordinary human would you pick on this war against powerful evil beings? Or would you be more hyped to play Puyo Puyo Tetris with me? Or Super Smash Melee? Oh yeah, there's also Smash Attacks here!
