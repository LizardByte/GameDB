This is a completely original work that could only be distributed and played on feature phones.\n\nThis work is set on the planet Damir. It was a peaceful planet with abundant water and greenery, but five years ago, demonic beasts began to appear.\nPeople were exhausted by the repeated attacks of the monsters and beasts, and everyone kept looking for a brave man who would save the world. ......\nOne day, the hero accidentally wears a mysterious bracelet called \"COMP\" which attracts magical beasts. The protagonist sets out on a journey to discover the true identity of \"COMP\". And to face his own destiny, he sets off on a journey into the vast world.\n\nIn addition to the series' customary \"Nakama System\" in which players negotiate with demonic beasts that stand in their way as enemies and, if successful, are lent power, this title also features the \"Obedience Attack,\" in which defeated demonic beasts recognize your power and become your befrienders, enabling you to collect befrienders more efficiently. Together with your unique friends and fellow travelers, you will unravel the truth of the history passed down to you on the planet Damir.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/g-mode-archives-plus-megami-tensei-gaiden-shinyaku-last-bible-iii-mugen-no-eiyuu"}
