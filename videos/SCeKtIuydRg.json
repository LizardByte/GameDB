It is still far away, but something isn't right. Our scanners can't get clear readings and satellites sent to sample it get blown up. With our teleportation technology, we sent a manned space ship called the terminator to gather information. What we learned was shocking. The asteroid was some kind of autonomous warmachine factory, Machine cave. If it reached the earth, it would be a disaster. We lost contact with terminator but learned the weakness of the machines: their power generator, machine heart. We can teleport a small ship past most of their defences to destroy it. That is your mission. Find and destroy the machine heart and escape the caves through it's exhaust shaft.\n\nCheck it out and more at: https://www.megacatstudios.com\n\nCome join in on the discussion at our official Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/megacat\n\nMachine Cave is not licensed, sponsored, published, or endorsed by Nintendo Co.
