Set on resource-filled battlegrounds, each team must protect their base while devising strategies to infiltrate the enemy's. Your flag is perched on the roof of your base just out of enemy reach, but so is theirs. The only way in? Tear down their walls by gathering resources, crafting items such as pickaxes, bombs and cannons, and launch a full-scale blitz!\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Coming January 2025 to Steam!\n\u25ba https://store.steampowered.com/app/3101380/Base_Blitz/\n\nThe grounds are rich with natural resources - trees, stones, sticks, and more - all waiting to be harvested. Use your crafting table to forge weapons, tools, and explosives to break through enemy defenses or strengthen your own. Use your metal ore to craft cannonballs and unleash devastating firepower on your opponents, or put it towards defense items such as bear traps and landmines to keep your rivals out of your base! Teamwork is key. Use catapult to launch teammates onto enemy roofs, build barricades to defend critical points, or sneak over enemy defenses with wall spikes. Engage in intense player vs player combat with a variety of craftable weapons like swords, spears, axes, bows, and cannons. Will your team rely on brute force, sneaky tactics, or clever teamwork to capture the flag and claim victory?\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Join our Discord!\nhttps://discord.gg/2WHVMk5R5W\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Follow us on social media!\nhttps://x.com/soupshouse\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@soupshouse\nhttps://www.instagram.com/soupshouse/\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/soups-house.bsky.social\n\n\u25ba Have questions?
