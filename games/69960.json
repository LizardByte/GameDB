It focuses more on realistic flight operations, and less on gameplay. Flight startup is more complex, and instead of a visual map, there is a more technical GPS system. It includes six planes and scenery for the USA and Western Europe. Also included is an in-game \"operations manual\", flight instruction videos and training flight courses, all geared to prepare the user for the real thing. Hardware acceleration is supported only for 3Dfx cards.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pro-pilot-99", "videos": [{"id": 18466, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "iEZoo1MfY5k"}]}
