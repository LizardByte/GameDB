Having grown weary of his lonely existence, he decides to visit the resort city of Lost Wages to experience what he has not lived before, and find the woman of his dreams, starting with nothing but an out-of-style 1970s disco-era leisure suit and $94 in his pocket. Larry's quest involves four possible women: a nameless, seedy-looking prostitute; Fawn, a club-goer of low moral fiber; Faith, a receptionist who (true to her name) is faithful to her boyfriend; and Eve, a bathing beauty and Larry's ultimate goal.", "summary": "A middle-aged male virgin named Larry Laffer desperately tries to \"get lucky\" in the fictional American city of Lost Wages.\n\nYour goal in Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is to find and seduce the girl of your dreams. This goal won't come easy, because you only have one night, and unfortunately, you are stuck with Larry's looks. Other problems, such as lack of money, lack of opportunity, and bad breath can complicate things significantly. Your interaction with the game controls the outcome of each situation.\n\nFor example, having your character sign on with a major league baseball team or start a successful men's magazine could be beneficial to your ultimate goal. On the other hand, catching a fatal disease or losing all your cash can only impede your progress. A combination of common sense, logical thinking, and downright sheer luck is needed to achieve your goal.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 1472, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XqXpWJhsuaI"}]}
