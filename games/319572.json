The aim is to hit bricks on the right of the screen to make them disappear but if you let the ball past the bat then you lose one of three lives. Before the start of the game you can choose whether to play with one or two bats, and playing with two bats has them parallel to each other a small distance apart. There are also three types of games to play and they are:\n\nPractise Game: A normal game with the choice to choose the speed of the bat (1-4) with 1 being the slowest.\n\nProgressive Game: Every time you hit the ball it speeds up and also removing a set of bricks makes the ball faster.\n\nAcceleration Game: The ball will speed up for every 10th brick disappearing and it speeds up when all the bricks have been removed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/breakout-3"}
