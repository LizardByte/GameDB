Players control Shrek and up to three of his companions as they side-scroll through levels based on locations in the feature film sequel Shrek 2. Different obstacles require the abilities of different characters to overcome them, so players must switch between their chosen team members as each situation requires. Shrek is strong enough to move objects that others can not, for example, while Donkey is able to kick open doors and Fiona can slow down time for easier attacks. The game also features characters and areas not seen in the film, offering fans new fairy tale people to meet and lands to explore.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shrek-2--2"}
