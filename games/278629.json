This hack is just the opposite.\n\nZeldara's Glitch City is intended to be a very strange, unconventional, and otherwise confusingly random hack, that deliberately exploits unusual aspects of the SMW engine (as well as the fact that most SMW hack players are quite familiar with the original SMW's levels) to its advantage. (It also intends to showcase various little-used edits that are possible in SMW hacks.)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zeldaras-glitch-city"}
