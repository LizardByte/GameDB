Once you reach 100,000 points, your train takes off and heads for the stars, completing the game.\n\nTony Crowther single-handedly created an incredibly innovative and challenging game early on in the C64's life-cycle. Not only does the player have to watch the top half of the screen to shoot enemies, he/she must also watch the bottom half and steer the train accordingly to avoid oncoming missiles and trains.\n\nHaving to multi-task in such a manner, particularly at such high speeds, makes the game incredibly challenging; the goal of reaching 100,000 points is quite a challenge to reach. In fact, I die on a number of occasions, usually because everything happens at once!\n\nI owned this back on my real C64, but I was too young to work out what was going on and didn't play it for more than a couple of minutes at a time.\n\nOne thing that I didn't realise was that if you pick up 50 missiles then your train explodes. This is why you can hear the alarm sounding for the first 2/3 of the video until I realised what was going on!\n\nThe one criticism I have about the game is the way some of the enemy trains can sometimes spawn directly on top of your own train, killing you instantly without a chance to react. This usually happens inside of tunnels, but fortunately not that often in other locations.\n\nThe has some decent graphics and a simple, yet catchy background music tune. All things considered, this was a pretty good game, especially for it's time!\n\nEnjoy!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ljZzZlASclU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ljZzZlASclU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ljZzZlASclU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ljZzZlASclU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ljZzZlASclU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Suicide Express Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Antony Crowther and published by Gremlin Graphics in 1985.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nThe objective of Suicide Express is to guide your nuclear-powered death-train, the SCHI-PARG, along monorail tracks on the surface of the planet Nilmerg, destroying aliens in a bid to make the planet habitable by humans.
