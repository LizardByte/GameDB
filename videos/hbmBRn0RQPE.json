{"id": "hbmBRn0RQPE", "snippet": {"title": "Green Wind - Hell ALL! 1cc +TLB", "description": "First western clear of this game, as far as I know. It's certainly the only clear on Youtube. Three of x.x's shmups down, two to go. The remaining two will likely not be seeing a clear from me in a LONG time.\n\nFor those not in the know, x.x made Blue Wish Resurrection, Eden's Edge and Eden's Aegis, all of which I have prior videos of. This is his first game, or at least the first one he released.\n\nMechanically, it's a combination of Blue Wish Resurrection and Eden's Aegis. The BWR element is chests around each of the levels that you need to collide with to reveal and then shoot at to open up, and they'll spit coins at you until they scroll offscreen. The Eden's Aegis element is the special attack that cancels the bullets of any enemies it kills. The more coins you have, the more points you get from killing enemies. Also, the unlock requirement for the True Last Boss is a 1cc of Hell difficulty, just like BWR and Eden's Aegis.\n\nThis game is both easier and harder than BWR. It's easier because the bullet patterns generally are not as harsh, but to offset that, this is the only one of x.x's games that does not have any kind of autobomb feature; it's manual bombs or bust.\n\nIf you want to play for survival in this game, scoring well is paramount as you get an extra life every 2,500,000 points. You will need every single one that you get as the TLB is absolutely brutal.\n\nThe run itself:\nSurvival-wise, it was pretty good all around until the TLB, which I could have done better, but I was expecting to die at least four times to that beast anyway. No-miss of stages 1 through 3 was great and set me up well for the remainder of the game.\n\nTo be fair, the only reason this is the only clear on Youtube is probably because nobody else likes this game enough. :V", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hbmBRn0RQPE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hbmBRn0RQPE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hbmBRn0RQPE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hbmBRn0RQPE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Green Wind - Hell ALL! 1cc +TLB", "description": "First western clear of this game, as far as I know.
