When two animals of the same kind touch they merge into bigger ones!\n\nPlan your moves carefully and avoid dropping too many animals at once, or you might run out of space. The game goes on forever or until all animals fill up the screen. Zooplop is easy to play but hard to master. How big can you go? Can you reach the whale? Can you merge the whale?!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zooplop"}
