You are in control of a rookie firefighter that has to eliminate hazards, rescue people, and extinguish wild flames throughout the various missions of the game. During the process, you are assisted by your teammates that might give you hints or carry out orders.\n\nThe game uses TruVideo technology to display screen-filling digitized video. It was both released as SEGA CD and as SEGA CD 32X title. Thanks to the additional hardware power of the Sega 32X which allows up to 32k different colors on screen simultaneously, the CD 32X version offers higher video quality compared to the standard SEGA CD version which can only be displayed in up to 64 colors at the same time. However, the sound quality of the SEGA CD version is far superior to the scratchy, unpleasant audio of the CD 32x variant. This longplay shows the CD 32X version of the game.\n\nFAHRENHEIT offers a total of three levels. The player is forced to make quick QTE decisions at critical points during gameplay. Most of the time, this means you have to decide in which direction your team will advance by pressing a directional button on your gamepad. In some occasions, you also have to choose which action to perform with the help of the A, B, or C button (such as opening a door, choosing a tool, checking for heat, and so on). When making decisions, time is critical. If the player fails to give an input in time, the game will automatically choose what will happen next. The player also has to maintain a certain level of oxygen which is running out fast (this is mostly triggered by performing certain actions such as checking rooms for hazards or objectives). Oxygen can be refilled by finding hazards or sources of air.\n\nObjectives for each mission:\nMission 1: Eliminate all hazards (not in easy mode), find the daughter, exit the building.\nMission 2: Rescue the lady and her birds (they are placed seperately in different locations).\nMission 3: Find the bomb and defuse it, shut off the power, capture the professor by finding a way into the bunker.\n\nGameplay experience differs immensely depending on which difficulty setting you choose. Each mission comes with its unique additional handicaps when picking normal or hard mode compared to easy difficulty. Here are the most notable differences for all three missions:\nMission 1: While finding hazards in easy mode will grant you additional oxygen, no such thing will happen in hard mode. Hard mode also forces you to find all hazards before being able to finish the mission sucessfully.\nMission 2: The hotel consists of two floors only in easy mode. Normal mode forces the player to go through 3 floors. In hard mode, the total number of floors is four.\nMission 3: The size of the basement is increasing immensely with each difficulty level. While easy mode basically only consists of three rooms, hard mode throws a brutal maze at the player that comes with 20+ rooms. There are three random entry points to the basement on each difficulty setting.\n\nFAHRENHEIT is a game of trial and error. However, simple memorization is not enough to finish the game successfully as it has some elements of luck and randomization. While the floor layout of the levels always remains the same, hazards, traps and objectives are placed randomly in each playthrough. This is also the reason why players can not find a written walkthrough for the game on the internet. The floor plans for each level and each difficulty setting can be found in the game's printed manual. Referring to those maps is essential to finish the game successfully - especially in higher difficulty settings.\n\nThis playthrough was done in hard mode, finishing the game with perfect score and all hazards found. I picked the shortest route possible through the game, avoiding all dead ends, game overs and empty rooms. I did this also to prevent viewers from losing their sanity as the game gets unbearably monotonous and repetitive in hard mode.\n\nI honestly wanted to like this game - but ultimately it is one hell of an unintuitive mofo and becomes a painful chore especially in hard more.\n\nEmulation via KEGA Fusion was used to record this longplay on a PC.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8BkvESIqXc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8BkvESIqXc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8BkvESIqXc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8BkvESIqXc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p8BkvESIqXc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "FAHRENHEIT (SEGA CD 32X) (1995) - Longplay [Hard Mode/Perfect Score] (uncommented)", "description": ":: FAHRENHEIT ::\n\nSega CD 32X / Sega of America (1995)\nIn-Game language: English / HD WS: 720p\n\nFAHRENHEIT is a SEGA CD exclusive FMV game released by SEGA of America in 1995.
