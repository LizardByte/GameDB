However, if you're a Halo or MW snob, you'll no doubt turn your nose up to this game seeing as it's just a simple FPS with a mission setup similar to console FPS games of the past, and nothing more. It didn't break any new ground, and really failed to capture the essence of the Die Hard Franchise. Overall, not the greatest FPS game ever made, but not the worse. I'd never pay full price for the game (and I assume those who did were either die hard Die Hard fans, or People who only owned a Gamecube), but for the $3 I paid for it, it's not a bad buy.
