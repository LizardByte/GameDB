The enigmatic abilities of patients locked inside were one of the worst threats possible. Despite the radiation caused by the Chernobyl nuclear plant breakdown, the few USSR politicians aware of its existence didn\u2019t order the evacuation of the facility. Worried scientists sent out a research and rescue expedition. Little did they know what they were about to discover.
