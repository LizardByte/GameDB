However, one night 4 years later, under the glare of a full moon, Richter mysteriously vanished.\n\nWith no idea where to begin her search, Maria Renard set out to look for him. It was then that fate intervened. Castlevania, the castle of Dracula, which is rumored to appear once every century, suddenly materialized from out of the mist as if to show her the way.\n\nMeanwhile, powerful forces were struggling for the soul of a man named Alucard. The very same Alucard who had teamed up with Trevor Belmont to battle his immortal father, Count Vlad Tepes Dracula. Alucard, in order to purge the world of his own cursed blood line, had submerged his vampiric powers and entered into what was supposed to be an eternal slumber. But now, he is awake and aware of the evil once again at work in his homeland.\n\nThe time has once again come for the forces of Good and Evil to engage in their ancient battle. Dracula's castle beckons you\u2026", "summary": "The PlayStation Portable port of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was included as an unlockable bonus game in Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles.\n\nThe Dracula X Chronicles version features numerous differences from the original PlayStation 1 version. There is a new script and newly recorded voice acting, as well as an option to use the original Japanese voices. Maria Renard has been added as a boss and playable character, sporting a new moveset modeled after her abilities in Castlevania: Rondo of Blood. Several familiars, which were omitted from previous international versions of the original game, have been re-added. Like the Xbox 360 version, \"I Am the Wind\" was replaced with \"Mournful Serenade\"--a new piece composed by Michiru Yamane--as the closing theme. An English-recorded version of the song \"Nocturne\" has also been added.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night--2"}
