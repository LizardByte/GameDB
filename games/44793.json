League, being published on November 22, almost two weeks later after the end of that season. At the time of its release J.League Jikky\u014d Winning Eleven 97 was considered to be the most realistic soccer game for the PlayStation or any other console. It featured narration by Jon Kabira and commentary by Yasutaro Matsuki, a former Japanese football player and manager. \nThe 1996 season can be included in the \"Golden Age\" as in back then J.League was at its popularity peak, and many likeable superstars were playing in it: Guido Buchwald, Uwe Bein, Dragan Stojkovi\u0107, Salvatore Schillaci, Ivan Ha\u0161ek, Dunga, Ed\u00edlson, Jorginho, Mazinho, Careca, Ruy Ramos, Hidetoshi Nakata, among many others. \nBoth the playstyle and the league format (double stage with Victory Goal and Final match at the end) were very characteristic and promoted overly offensive, stylish and spectacular football. \nUp to two players can compete in a series of games that include: Exhibition, full J.League season, Hyper cup, All-Star match and Penalty Kick modes. It is also possible to view the players' profile."}
