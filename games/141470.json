However, as the release was delayed, the game was renamed Anstoss 2007. On August 11, 2006, Anstoss 2007 was released, which corresponds to Anstoss 2006 except for the changed name, in an anniversary edition that contains some of the series' predecessors (Anstoss 2 Gold, Anstoss 3, Anstoss Action and Anstoss 4 Edition 03/04). The announcement by the developers to expand the text mode, revise the transfer market and reintegrate the popular network mode, which is designed for up to 64 players, was well received. However, the deletion of a national coach mode and a hot seat mode were received negatively. On January 30, 2007, after 5 patches, the work on Kick 2007 was officially stopped. Despite bitter criticism from the community because of remaining bugs and missing functions (described in the manual), Ascaron decided to take this step due to a lack of financial and human resources.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anstoss-2007"}
