This map is so so so funny, sexy girls related, a rather stupid looking museum being invaded by demons. I wonder if the demons like these sexy girls or not, ah hahaha!!! And why there's no Marilyn Monroe? Her pose which wear the white dress looks sexy too, it should be placed in this museum right lol? Maybe Audrey Hepburn, her \"Holly Golightly\" role in Breakfast at Tiffany's probably the best, and indeed I was talking about that pose which she wear the black gown carrying a cigarette stick.\n\nVery stupid map, but somehow \"not\" easy to max it without taking the armor. Anyway a few more tries and good aim may helps lol. lol at this museum, hope there's Vocaloid Museum soon.\n\nDSDA record is 1:33 by Memfis.\n\nAOL Girls Museum:\nhttp://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=9734", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dHjyRQuRWDI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dHjyRQuRWDI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dHjyRQuRWDI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dHjyRQuRWDI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dHjyRQuRWDI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Doom 2] AOL Girls Museum Map01 UV-Max in 1:35", "description": "Pwad: AOL Girls Museum \nSkill: UV Max\nMap: 1\nName: AOL Girls Museum \nTime: 1:35\nRecorded with: PrBoom-plus 2.5.1.2-test\n\nI decided to upload this map on youtube because this map is funny for its sexy girls.\n\nlol at this map.
