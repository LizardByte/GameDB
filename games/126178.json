This includes maps from GTA: III, GTA: Vice City, Manhunt, Manhunt 2, Bully, and of course GTA: San Andreas itself. Not only are we adding the maps, we are also trying to implement the features these games have as well. This includes hardware shops, vehicles, peds, weapons, and other content.\n\nEverything is done in the same style as how San Andreas is.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grand-theft-auto-underground"}
