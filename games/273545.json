Changes included: Adjusted enemy placements to prevent many \u2018cheap shots\u2019, such as item boxes bouncing you into enemies. Many bottomless pit areas were replaced with new routes or made harder to fall into at a moment\u2019s notice. More plentiful Special Ring placement, allowing a more freeform approach to entering Special Stages, and Special Stage entry requirement reduced to 5 SP Rings.\n\nAdvance 2 is still a challenging game! Bosses haven\u2019t been touched, and in the later half of the game you should expect plenty of enemies and the return of the dreaded bottomless pits. The hack attempts to balance things in a fair way but also rewards memorisation for repeat play and speedrunning - without as harsh a penalty for not doing so.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-advance-2-sp", "videos": [{"id": 100271, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "548JeUEAOCo"}]}
