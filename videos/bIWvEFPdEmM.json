Imagine fighting monsters and capturing them to fight along side you...hmm reminds me of another game that has the same concept.....anyways. I can see why its good. This is the second story of the Zenithia Castle Saga. Im not gonna elaborate much on the story. Its your typical \"Go Save/Find/Avenge your parents death cliche. Its also has more then just the obvious. As for my recording, i did some off screen leveling and you  know the drill guys.
