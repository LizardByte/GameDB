With its over-the-top style, players will be able to power-up characters and give them superhuman abilities and special powers called \"Mojo\" abilities. For example, a pitcher might throw a pitch that acts as a buzz-saw and slices through the hitter's bat; a batter may hit a ground ball that lodges itself in the field so it can't be picked up, and a fielder might use their suction glove ability to suction the ball into their glove to record an out.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crushed-baseball"}
