To most people, he appears to be a massively unlikable weirdo with a libido big enough to crush continents, but in reality, he is a massively unlikable weirdo with a libido big enough to crush continents WITH THE HEART OF GOLD KIND OF. He moved from the city to the rural town due to very vague reasons involving his parents' jobs. How a job they are doing could require their child to have to live with his uncle in a small town for exactly a year before moving back is better left out of the question. But, soon after arriving, it all goes to bad when after the mysterious death of a woman in the town, Useless discovers he has the ability to stick his hand into his TV! At first it only appears to be a neat party trick, but after a foreplay joke or two, him and his newly found \"friends\" end up discovering a world that can only be accessed through entering a TV! Long story short, being that Useless is a special snowflake, he ends up with a massive dude with a flat cap and lead pipe living inside of his mind, the voice in his head called it a \"Purse Owner\" or something, and now with this power, him and his greatest buddies must venture into the TV World and slay shadows (copyright free .pngs with masks on) to learn the truth behind the mysterious murders going on in Inaba.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/persono"}
