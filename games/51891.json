That door leads to more questions, and those questions lead to Greenland. Philip follows the clues - they're all he has left. On leaving the final signs of human civilization behind him, in search of the location mentioned in his father's ambiguous notes, Philip wonders if he's left some part of his humanity behind as well. Soon, that will be the least of his fears.", "summary": "The Penumbra Collection is a first person horror adventure focusing on story, immersion, and puzzle solving.
