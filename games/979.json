After the doctor is shot down, Yuri, Nikolai's best soldier, who has as much a grudge against Makarov as Price, gives Soap an adrenaline shot to keep his heart going, and helps secure a safe route out of the country.\nMeanwhile, the war between Russia and the United States continues, despite the U.S. Capital being secured.

Derek \"Frost\" Westbrook, \"Grinch\", \"Truck\", and their C.O. \"Sandman\" facilitates the Russian army's withdrawal from the invasion of Lower Manhattan, New York City. They begin by destroying a jamming tower on top of the New York Stock Exchange, then hijack a Russian Oscar II submarine in the East River with the assistance of the US Navy SEALs, in order to use its ordnance against its own fleet. Eventually, Russia pulls back its forces from the US East Coast.\nOn October 4, 2016, Russian President Boris Vorshevsky announces his plans to make peace with the U.S. at a summit in Hamburg. However, during the flight, Makarov's men hijack Vorshevsky's plane and force it into a crash landing on the tarmac of an airport. F.S.O. Agent Andrei Harkov attempts to secure Vorshevsky, but is killed when Makarov appears inside what the F.S.O. believe to be a evacuation helicopter Makarov kidnaps the President, and plans to capture and torture his daughter Alena, to force the President to give Makarov access to the Russian nuclear arsenal that has the capability and destructive power to destroy the entire continent of Europe.", "summary": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games (Treyarch for the Wii version), with Raven Software having assisted in development and published by Activision.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3", "videos": [{"id": 668, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1xjCdN_rWCE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xjCdN_rWCE", "title": "Official Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xjCdN_rWCE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 676, "name": "The Vet & The n00b Official Trailer", "video_id": "hx6Cr1GAkLI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx6Cr1GAkLI", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - The Vet & The n00b Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hx6Cr1GAkLI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 1710, "name": "Gameplay Online Multiplayer", "video_id": "dNToodVM21M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNToodVM21M", "title": "MW3 18/0 Sabotage downturn patrickloli", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dNToodVM21M/sddefault.jpg"}]}
