Talk with friends in person and on the phone, attend classes, study, do homework, shop for clothes at the mall and go out on dates.\n\nYou choose one of two characters to play. Besides your 6 closest friends, there are 20 other characters to meet during the course of the game - including prospective boyfriends. The scenarios are presented by way of video clips. Conversations come about by selecting one of several provided replies.\n\nThere are various types of mini-games to solve within the game including variations of Concentration and Tetris as well as a shooting accuracy game and a picture puzzle.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mckenzie-and-co", "videos": [{"id": 104965, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "krkuL2QqD6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krkuL2QqD6g", "title": "McKenzie & Co (1995) PC FMV game trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/krkuL2QqD6g/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
