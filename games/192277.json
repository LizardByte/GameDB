All of these games can connect to each other to play Classic or Battle mode with up to four players. Classic is based on the co-op mode from the original and uses the Japanese arcade phase system. Battle is based on the Battle Game from Super Mario All-Stars. The remake also uses the GBA's Single-Pak multiplayer feature. It can connect and play with other GBA systems without the game, although Battle is the only multiplayer mode that can be played in this way.\n\nThe GBA remake of Mario Bros. enhances the graphics to take advantage of the GBA's 32-bit capabilities, including adding backgrounds to the stages. It also adds new movement options and better aerial controls.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 70520, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EbYq8lzD3YQ"}, {"id": 70521, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AhFFEymXOAk"}, {"id": 70522, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rTimMgLCjnA"}, {"id": 70523, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "y9jPbF_NDXA"}]}
