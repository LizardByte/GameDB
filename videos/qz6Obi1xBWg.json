If you pick up a certain amount they will give you a level with a skill attributed to it. Level 1 will always give you the POC in addition to the skill it gives. If you increase the level above max it will go back to zero and the game will give you a life and bomb fragment. \n\nSo far as I know the skills for Reimu!B are:\nAvoidance - Makes your hitbox smaller. \nSpirit Recovery - Increases the Invulnerability after using a bomb or dying.\nReflexes - Increases your deathbomb window. \nOther characters have different skills. \n\nThe scoring system seems to involve chaining by damaging enemies. Doing so raises the multiplier in the bottom right to a maximum of x999. At that point all cancelled bullets will be turned into point items. \n\nReimu!B is a very nice shottype. In addition to good long distance damage, Utsuho's shotgun is extremely powerful and their bombs are pretty decent too. \n\nSo yeah as you can see in the last part, the normal game is the omote loop and there's a harder Ura loop. \nUra loop - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51mqCkqOzH4\n\nDownload:\nhttp://th-jss.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qz6Obi1xBWg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qz6Obi1xBWg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qz6Obi1xBWg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qz6Obi1xBWg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qz6Obi1xBWg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou \u6771\u65b9\u5c0e\u547d\u6a39 \uff5e Mystical Power Plant (Danmakufu) - Lunatic Omote 1cc", "description": "From the makers of The Last Comer, Mystical Power Plant is one of the newest products in the fully-fledged Touhou fangame department. \n\nThe system seems to be revolving around picking up the leaf items.
