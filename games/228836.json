It uses the technology of free roaming, offering a much more immersive experience than traditional virtual reality. Each player has a virtual reality headset and a PC in a backpack. They can interact and move freely throughout the game.\n\nThe game is played with 2 teams of 2 to 3 players. The team of Norse gods from the Order faces off against the team of demonic forces from Chaos.\nEach player chooses their playing style between the mage and their magic staff, or the archer and their evil bow. Both teams have a common goal: to get the dragon's strength as many times as possible without being neutralized by the enemy's force.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/catch-the-dragon"}
