Today is different though; Brad has grown tired of fighting all the time. The usual grind for XP has grown dull, and he has decided to pursue his dreams of making music instead of shedding blood. Fashioning a lute out of an old axe, he steps out to save his town in the most bizarre of ways.", "summary": "What genre is the game?\nIt is a mixture of Tower Defense, RPG & RTS with some shoot\u2019em\u2019up and Snake elements.\n\nWhat's Gameplay like?\nMove Brad around the battlefield and dodge incoming enemy attacks and projectiles. Brad is constantly playing his axe-lute and generating notes, standing still will cause him to \"jam\" and generate notes even faster. These notes act as your in-game resource; you can spend them to perform solos to summon units to follow and fight for you, as well as solos to boost their performance.\n\nNavigate your party through the hordes of enemies, dodging and attacking, preventing them from destroying your town's prized decorative crystal. Survive waves to progress, collect loot, and unlock new units. Upon death you are able to visit the town shop in order to upgrade Brad, the town and your followers, in hopes to make it further next time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 6382, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "H6D_5ClkVzE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6D_5ClkVzE", "title": "Bardbarian Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H6D_5ClkVzE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
