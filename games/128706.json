We call it a \u201cphysics-based dating sim.\u201d It was important to me that we toss the idea of what\u2019s typically considered a \u201cdating sim\u201d by the wayside; I didn\u2019t want a lot of text with multiple endings and torrid affairs. I wanted to make something that accurately portrayed the feeling of dating\u2014 the frustration of trying to find someone who fits with you, the twitchy anticipation of trying to read social cues on a first date when you don\u2019t even know what to look for, the process of finding out how you and your partner are both different people than you assumed. I hope that comes across.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/how-to-be-happy"}
