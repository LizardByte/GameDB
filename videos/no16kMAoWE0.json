{"id": "no16kMAoWE0", "snippet": {"title": "Draconus: Cult of the Wyrm Game Sample - Dreamcast", "description": "Draconus: Cult of the Wyrm is a hack and slash game developed by Treyarch and published by Crave Entertainment for Dreamcast. It's said to be the spiritual successor to Treyarch's earlier hackfest, \"Die by the Sword\" (which was in turn partially inspired by the Apple II game \"The Bilestoad\") and also stated to to use the Tony Hawk engine (the male hero, Cynric, kinda does look like a medieval Tony Hawk). Playing as a male warrior, Cynric, skilled in melee combat or a female sorceress, Aeowyn, proficient in magic (they don't alter the story however), your task is to unite all the races and stop a mysterious new race, Draconus, led by a highly powerful and influential dragon named X'Calith-Da'ar, and an evil shaman named Rakka.\r\n\r\nCharacters play differently from each other (besides Cynric having stronger melee and Aeowyn having more powerful spells) and part of the focus of this game is in studying enemy patterns and how best to deal with swarms. While this sounds self explanatory, one change in the gameplay to keep players more alert is that, while attacks can be blocked, they put your guard down after a successful block, forcing you to be more alert and put up your guard with each successful block. Each character also has different combos that vary depending on your weapon and what directions you swing, though it often feels rather clumsy and a straight attack combo or simple sideswipe in conjunction with a solid defense usually suffices in place of a number of unnecessarily difficult to perform combos you won't remember half the time. Generally speaking, the warrior is easier to use early on and the sorceress proves more useful later in the game.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are pretty crisp, though the framerate and camera can be somewhat erratic. The audio/visuals are adequate. Overall, this game is okay.
