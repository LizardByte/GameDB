You can build on top of old tiles, but you can only build five tiles wide, five tiles deep and five tiles tall. Run out of water or carrots, or get stuck on the edge, and it's game over! Each time you place a tile your rabbit gets thirsty, so frequently visit oases to fill up on water. As your rabbit travels along the path, it feeds and gains carrots which are useful when fighting off foes such as foxes. Successfully fighting off three opponents levels your rabbit up and increases its maximum carrots by two. And it will need all the carrots it can get for when the boss arrives!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/path-of-the-rabbit"}
