Everything is already dead or dying... except you. Or so you think. Players must figure out a way to properly fortify their home against each night's new danger, as they learn the truth behind the apocalypse and search for a way to safety, if one exists.\n\nPlayers will journey alongside David, a lone survivor after the end of the world, who finds himself having prophetic dreams... or nightmares. Each chapter of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous fog or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a result, you'll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs. But you don't have forever. Certain actions advance the in-game clock, and you'll need to complete your preparations to (hopefully) stay alive before night falls.\n\nWill you make it through all four days? Will your companions?", "summary": "After scraping out a bleak existence in the post-apocalyptic wastelands, you thought you were prepared for anything. But now there\u2019s no way to run.
