An entry in the titular World Series Baseball series of baseball titles, the game was first released in the United States in November 1995, with a worldwide release in the following months. In Japan, World Series Baseball game is sponsored by professional Japanese baseball player Hideo Nomo.\n\nThe game later received a 1996 sequel, World Series Baseball II.\n\nThis Saturn version is unrelated to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear games of the same name - it is a brand new entry, despite not having a brand new name (although during development it was known as Grand Slam Baseball), which takes advantage of the system's 3D graphics.\n\nJapanese version possibly to make this distinction, being sponsored by Hideo Nomo. This of course, can cause further confusion, as there is a Nomo Hideo no World Series Baseball for the Game Gear also. It would not be the last game to disregard previous entries in the series - a 2001 World Series Baseball exists also.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-series-baseball--2"}
