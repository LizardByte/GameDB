By switching between the two at any time, players can use Tor's up-close melee attacks or cause damage from afar with Roberta's spells. This game stays faithful to the traditional third-person action-adventure. Magical items and weapons gained along the way will develop the characters' abilities and strengths. In particular, elementally-aligned motes can be attached to weapons and armor as a combat bonus. There are many puzzles and side-quests along the way, and players will fight evil Neopets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neopets-the-darkest-faerie", "videos": [{"id": 94004, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ONhuHp67aeI"}, {"id": 94005, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FTqovWVUqMc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTqovWVUqMc", "title": "Neopets: The Darkest Faerie - Trailer 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FTqovWVUqMc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
