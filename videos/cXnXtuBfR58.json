Design and optimize factories to create cubes, used galaxy-wide as crates, musical instruments, even chic coffins. Rewind and replay the action to hunt for improvements. Compete with your friends, work out why the factory robots keep misbehaving, unmask a cube conspiracy, and help a tiny octopus with a nightmare family visit.\n\n*Design*\nFill a cube factory with a variety of devices and program them to work together to produce the required cubes. Each workstation's grid command system allows you to create complex loops, and lasers and other sensors allow you to branch the flow of the logic. Pull apart and reassemble cubes, merge them, paint them, teleport them, set fire to them, add payloads, and ship them off to the customer.\n\n*Rewind*\nGrab the timeline handle and crank time backwards to see the state of the factory in the past. Replay past steps and spot where a solution has a bug or could be made more efficient.\n\n*Optimize*\nCompete against your friends and the rest of the world to produce the quickest, or simplest, or least wasteful solution to each puzzle.\n\n*Create*\nBuild your own puzzles using Hexahedra's built-in level editor and share them via the Steam Workshop.\n\n*Save (or rule!) the Galaxy*\nCubes have become the galaxy's most important commodity, a fact that some intend to exploit to their own advantage. Track down the conspiracy, infiltrate it, and bring it down. Or don't, and take your place amongst the new rulers.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cXnXtuBfR58/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cXnXtuBfR58/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cXnXtuBfR58/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cXnXtuBfR58/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cXnXtuBfR58/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hexahedra - Available Now!", "description": "Hexahedra has launched on Steam!
