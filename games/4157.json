Ten of the included games are installments of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, while the remaining two to four games are only related to the series through its publisher, Sega.\n\nAccording to the director, Yojiro Ogawa, the purpose of the compilation was to introduce younger players to the original games in the Sonic series. The games are played through a Genesis emulator developed by Sonic Team themselves. Outside of the games, the compilation includes Sonic-themed videos and illustrations, as well as high-resolution scans of the instruction manuals and Sonic the Hedgehog comic covers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-mega-collection", "videos": [{"id": 36808, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lFmiyVcliN8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmiyVcliN8", "title": "Sonic Mega Collection [GameCube] Gameplay [1080p]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lFmiyVcliN8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
