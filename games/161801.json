We begin with the Prototype as it was rolled out of the factory and first flown at Eastleigh in 1936, and end with the Mk1A \u2018standard\u2019 production Spitfire which fought alongside that other venerable fighter, the Hawker Hurricane, in the Battle of Britain.", "summary": "The supplied paint schemes include a number of aircraft flown by the \u2018aces\u2019 of the Battles of France and Britain and the flight dynamics of this simulation have been specially programmed to allow you to fly \u2018by the book\u2019, so go ahead and try your skill at \u2018matching the numbers\u2019 achieved by \u2018Mutt\u2019 Summers and Jeffrey Quill in the prototype, or test your nerve on an endurance run over the fields of France and back in your Mk1A! Custom built with an incredibly detailed and ultra-high quality cockpit, exacting flight dynamics and realistic Merlin engine sounds, this is the ultimate Spitfire package for Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-steam-edition-battle-of-britain-spitfire"}
