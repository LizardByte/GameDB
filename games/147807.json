The game features first person dungeon-crawling through randomly-generated floors of the Neuro Tower, with deaths in the dungeon advancing the narrative.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/baroque--1", "videos": [{"id": 78563, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "XYNfsFi2IBE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYNfsFi2IBE", "title": "BAROQUE OpeningMovie[SEGA SATURN]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYNfsFi2IBE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
