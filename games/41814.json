It consumes the land it appears out of as it rises, higher than ever. And then, before long, it's gone. Only the wisest can predict where it will next appear. There are those who attempt to climb its inner halls, but the twisted forms of the creatures captured by the Tower, and the twisted form of the Tower itself, prevent those brave souls from going far. And it seems that each floor is composed of a slice of an entirely different location! Magical trickery is afoot. Surely there is some great reward awaiting the one who reaches the top, but who could possibly reach it?\n\nThe player assumes the role of the eponymous FIGHT KNIGHT. Known best from the gladiator circuit, this master of weapons has been absent from the arena for some time (much to the disappointment of his fans), yet it turns out he's been chasing after the Tower all along! One has to wonder, why? And why does he refuse to touch any of his many armaments?", "summary": "Fight Knight is a mix between a first person dungeon crawler and a high speed action game. Players spend their time ascending a massive Tower, learning the story of Fight Knight and getting to know friend & foe alike. Along the way they'll solve puzzles, collect artifacts and help Fight Knight grow in power. Encounters take place in real time, through grid based melee combat. Wits and reflexes pave the way to victory. Will you master the Tower and those who wait within?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fight-knight", "videos": [{"id": 14744, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "BTDNO4zOGuQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTDNO4zOGuQ", "title": "four and a half minutes of FIGHT KNIGHT", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BTDNO4zOGuQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14745, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sqlIUPBeoKo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqlIUPBeoKo", "title": "FIGHT KNIGHT kickstarter trailer!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sqlIUPBeoKo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
