Whilst the Xenomorph stalks him in the facility, he steals numerous copies of Dr. Lingard's research files and also deletes a message that Lingard had sent to Marshal Waits regarding Ransome (a list of all the times he blackmailed or threatened someone). An explosion later engulfs an area of the facility, with the executive taking his leave in an elevator to comms. Ransome also manages to save a resident from a burning room during this experience.\n\nThe elevator crashes into comms, with Ransome having to climb out of it. Once investigating around the Working Joe stricken area, he closes a message recorded by Nina Taylor to Sevastopol and takes an audio log recorded by Ellen Ripley in hopes of using it as a bargaining chip to get on-board the Torrens. Whilst experiencing a close encounter with the Drone, Ransome managed to override elevator security control and escape.\n\nHis fate afterwards is unknown.", "summary": "Welcome to Corporate Lockdown, the first expansion pack for Alien: Isolation.
