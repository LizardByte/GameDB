{"id": "I9LfzYylKZw", "snippet": {"title": "Bubble Symphony (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Taito's 1997 arcade action game port for the Sega Saturn, Bubble Symphony. The entire playthrough is in English.\n\nThis video shows two separate playthroughs of the game. The first is played in the default game mode, and achieves the best possible ending for \"normal\" game by collecting all four keys and finding the magic rod. The second playthrough is of the \"Super\" game, accessible with a secret code on the title screen. Super mode kicks the difficulty level of the monsters up a few notches (they go faster, many gain projectile attacks), and provides the only way to getting the \"true\" ending. \n\nThe second playthrough begins at 41:27\n\nPlease also note that the entire game, besides the option menu, can be switched into English. On the main menu, if you hit Left Right Left Right A B C B, a new secret option will show up. Inside that menu are all of the more hidden settings - you can change cabinet region (for language select), super mode, among a few other things. Completely import-friendly!\n\nBubble Symphony is a great game. I loved the arcade game (I used to have a Bubble Bobble arcade machine in my house, that'll tell you how much I love the series), and this port is arcade perfect. No excepts, no buts. It's perfect. And it allows you access to the Japanese, US, and World configurations, which is even better. \n\nThe game plays very closely to the way the original Bubble Bobble did, but there have been a few big improvements made. The controls are a bit more floaty, which makes it a whole lot easier to handle Bub and Bob around tricky platforms. The game has tons of paths you can take through it (like the Darius series), so you can play it a few times and have few levels repeated. And finally, the graphics and sound are beyond words they're so good. I'll go on the record right here and say that, outside of the Darius series, this soundtrack has to be my absolute favorite by Zuntata. It has a fairy-tale orchestra vibe with a heavy dose of \"cute\" voices (like the intro to Yoshi's Story, but far less annoying and shrill) chiming in at big moments. It's totally adorable, and it won't leave your head. Not quite as insanely catchy as the original BB theme, but it's not too far off either.  \n\nWhile it'd be easy to go on about how Japan had all the good games, that Sega hated money, blah blah blah, nothing changes the fact now that this is an awesome port of a great game, and it's now totally within your reach to play it, in English, and not emulated on a compilation, if you so choose. It's awesome that it exists,  even if it is not a cheap game to be had.\n\nNo matter how you get access to it, though, this really is a must for Bubble Bobble fans. The numbering for the series was fubar'ed since - well, always: this is the third \"Bubble Bobble 2\", after Rainbow Islands and the NES/GB Bubble Bobble 2, but it's definitely the best one.   \n____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I9LfzYylKZw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I9LfzYylKZw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I9LfzYylKZw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I9LfzYylKZw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Bubble Symphony (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Taito's 1997 arcade action game port for the Sega Saturn, Bubble Symphony.
