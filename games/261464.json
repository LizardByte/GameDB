This is the first of (hopefully) many bimonthly ZDoom-oriented community projects organized by several veterans of the DBP series, run on the ZDoom forums. The project targets ZDoom 2.8.1 but has also been tested with recent GZDoom versions. Dungeon Synths features an ogg soundtrack of music from classic RPGs, particularly Legend of Dragoon and Dark Cloud 2, newly arranged for (virtual) vintage synthesizers and drum machines.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-synths"}
