Your controls include 2 turntables and a fader. There are 20 songs including a lesson tune and 2 hidden songs. One of the bonus tunes is a remake of the \u00ab outrun \u00bb theme song. The \u00ab Beats \u00bb fall down in columns on the left and right side. When the beat hits the horizontal line, that is when you start scraching. The music is accompanied by animated videos that are shown in the background. The game is very \u00ab ghetto \u00bb. Most of the tunes are generic Rap and R&B songs created by \u00ab Hiro \u00bb from Sega\u2019s music development team.\n\nCrackin DJ was only released as a dedicated cabinet in very limited numbers in Japan. There are less 5 than Crackin DJ machines in the USA as of July 2003.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crackin-dj", "videos": [{"id": 93556, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XQm6D1ju6Xk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQm6D1ju6Xk", "title": "Crackin' DJ - Attract (Naomi) (2000) [60FPS] with audio", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XQm6D1ju6Xk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
