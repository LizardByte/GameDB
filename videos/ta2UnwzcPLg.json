{"id": "ta2UnwzcPLg", "snippet": {"title": "Captain Commando Longplay (Arcade) [60 FPS]", "description": "Developed and published by Capcom in 1991\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nOriginally released into the arcades in 1991, Captain Commando is a side-scrolling beat 'em up based on Capcom's venerable CPS1 hardware. The game builds on the fighting game template laid out in Capcom's earlier classic, Final Fight, but mixes things up considerably with more content, better visuals and a quirky sci-fi setting.\n\nThe game is set in a futuristic version of Metro City, the same location as Final Fight, but in the year 2026. An invasion of intergalactic super criminals has arrived on Earth and it's up to Captain Commando and his trike team of Commando Companions to clean up Earth and restore peace.\n\nHaving deposited a coin, the player can choose from one of four different Commandos with which to do battle. Each character possesses unique abilities, special moves, strengths and weaknesses. I have to admit, the choice of characters is quite outlandish and is the only game I can think of where you can choose to play as a knife-wielding Mummy, or a giant mech-suit piloted by a baby with genius-level intelligence.\n\nHaving recently played through Final Fight, I'd forgotten just how difficult that game could be, thanks largely to some very cheap enemy attack routines that range from total stun-locking a player, to hitting them the moment they get up from a knockdown. Much of these issues have been ironed out in Captain Commando, resulting in a fair (though no less challenging) game - most importantly, it's a lot more fun to play than it's predecessors.\n\nIn addition to basic combat moves, the player may occasionally scavenge weaponry dropped by enemies, or looted from smashed containers. These include swords, hammers and even a rocket launcher - perfect for demolishing multiple enemies at once!\n\nWhilst these weapons are pretty standard as far as fighting games go, I wasn't expecting to be able to pilot giant, stomping battle mechs. These armoured behemoths provide the player with an additional level of protection, as well as being able to dish out plenty of punishment - from giant robot fists to flamethrowers, these beasts pack some serious firepower. The main disadvantage, however, is their lumbering speed which leaves you open to rear and attacks.\n\nGraphically, Captain Commando is a great title. The artwork and animation still stands up today and I particularly like the more humorous approach to the enemy designs - the way the basic enemies wave their hands about in anticipation whilst preparing to fight you is great and their are plenty of other neat touches.\n\nAs for the game's audio, it boasts some thumping music that sounds great, but it does tend to drown out most of the sound effects. I would imagine that in a busy arcade you'd be hard-pressed to make out any of the actual effects.\n\nThe game builds on the side-scrolling formula as laid down in Final Fight, but refines just about gameplay mechanic for the better. With better graphics, audio and controls, the game is a lot more fun to play than earlier side-scrollers. Whilst my favourite of Capcom's CPS brawlers remains The Punisher (released two years after this), Captain Commando is a worthy challenger in the fun stakes.\n\nWith it's cast of wacky characters, great fighting and challenging gameplay, Captain Commando is an excellent fighting game that should come top of any beat 'em up aficionado's list. Whilst the game did receive a conversion to the SNES, the arcade version remains the definitive version and best way to enjoy some gut-thumping action.\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ta2UnwzcPLg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ta2UnwzcPLg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ta2UnwzcPLg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ta2UnwzcPLg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ta2UnwzcPLg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Captain Commando Longplay (Arcade) [60 FPS]", "description": "Developed and published by Capcom in 1991\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nOriginally released into the arcades in 1991, Captain Commando is a side-scrolling beat 'em up based on Capcom's venerable CPS1 hardware.
