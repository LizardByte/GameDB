{"id": "rCDQEnbcpho", "snippet": {"title": "The Legend of Zelda: Parallel Remodel V1.1 (ALTTP Hack)", "description": "A complete video walkthrough with a 100% item collection for version 1.1 of The Legend of Zelda: Parallel Remodel. Played in real time on Snes9x 1.55 with re-records used to optimize video length.\n\nParallel Remodel is a dumbed-down fork of Parallel Worlds, which is one of the first fully completed mods of A Link to the Past. Parallel Worlds has excellent overworlds and caves, but the difficulty of the dungeons themselves is off the charts (extreme backtracking, bomb jumping, repetitive mini bosses, enemies that are too powerful). This fork of Parallel Worlds, released by PuzzleDude in 2012, attempts to address the biggest pitfalls of the original Parallel Worlds. The final result is that the new Parallel Remodel ended up being too linear, the difficulty is inconsistent now, among other things.\n\nDownload links:\nPR v1.1: https://mega.nz/file/VmBUgYJQ#psT5_Qz7zBRLI7oKyHnV9FfkFXzrDkWsHtp_qyfXOiw\nPR v1.1 (with MSU-1): https://mega.nz/file/Q6IUUKSL#UhgF-2R15EhL1dvlwOb3wjRDm0rIjvU4ekXKGkxvfno\nMSU-1 Getting Started: https://www.zeldix.net/t1607-msu1-getting-started-guide\nMSU-1 Patch and Audio Files: https://www.zeldix.net/t791-the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past\nUPS Patcher: https://mega.nz/file/w3BAFS7B#T1AEFUcJgp_rq5jeej-laObhhWT4S15iNFxZM3dXXMo\nSNES Rom Utility: https://www.romhacking.net/download/utilities/593/\n\nNote: You must use a US rom with no header.
