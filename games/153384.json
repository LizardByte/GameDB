As the nation prospered in modernization, some species were outcasted and stood at the crossroads of their lives. They were - vampires. Although they possessed superhuman physical abilities, they would burn under the sun and only lived off of blood. They suffered from having keen senses, and most of them could not adjust to their eternal life. Thus - they were vulnerable species. This is a story about a young man named Yatsufusa, who became a vampire against his will and seeks the meaning of life as he encounters different people and species surrounding him.", "summary": "\"MARS RED\" is a sound theatre that is originally written by Bun-O Fujisawa.
