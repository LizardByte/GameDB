The player controls Keijir\u014d Teit\u014d, who by day is a well-liked doctor in his hometown. However, by night, he takes up his sword and exacts bloody vengeance on the wicked and the corrupt.\n\nDuring the daytime, the player can move about Keijir\u014d's hometown, speaking with people to gather information, visiting the many shops such as a restaurant and a bookstore, and perhaps even getting into a fight now and then. Returning to his home allows him to save the game, view and accept the current job requests, and consult with his father about a variety of topics.\n\nDuring the night, the game becomes more like a stealth action game such as Tenchu. Controlling either Keijir\u014d or one of several other characters, the player must continue to gather information about the targets for each request while evading detection, eventually reaching the main target who must be killed. Successfully completing requests will earn money and reputation.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hissatsu-ura-kagyou", "videos": [{"id": 143311, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "UkQRNRdQeBM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkQRNRdQeBM", "title": "Hissatsu Ura Kagyou Mission 1 Highest Rank", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkQRNRdQeBM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 143312, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uFBMEOyhIP4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFBMEOyhIP4", "title": "Hissatsu Urakagyou PlayStation 2 Trailer - First Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uFBMEOyhIP4/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 143313, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jmBfomOXjrc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmBfomOXjrc", "title": "Hissatsu Urakagyou PlayStation 2 Trailer - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jmBfomOXjrc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 143314, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "1XxHDdPTDIE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XxHDdPTDIE", "title": "PS2 \u5fc5\u6bba\u88cf\u7a3c\u696d OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1XxHDdPTDIE/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3546, "name": "Hissatsu"}]}
