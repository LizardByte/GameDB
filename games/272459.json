Meanwhile, the hero of the failure, Roland, resides in the paladins' sea stronghold on Athanos as one of the recruits. The war with the orcs bypasses this island, but despite this, our hero dreams of becoming a paladin and decides to share the main one with the greenskins. He decides to go out to achieve his dream, but not everything is as simple as it appears at the beginning. He has to go through procedures and a bumpy road, as well as many exciting and difficult cases. He becomes acquainted with the necessity of exclusion and their intentions. The idea is to establish Beliar's rule and enslave all humans or, if that is not possible, destroy them. Roland quickly realizes that what matters on his journey is not the destination, but the path he will take. So he goes by himself, strongly opposes the invaders and defends the independence of the people of the Kingdom of Myrtana.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gothic-ii-odyssey", "videos": [{"id": 99907, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Xl4TPedpL-Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl4TPedpL-Q", "title": "Odyssee - Im Auftrag des K\u00f6nigs - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xl4TPedpL-Q/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
