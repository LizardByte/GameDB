Two of the best Spec Ops agents move in on their own, hitting the enemy hard before they can escape with the loot. This is a no-frills, old style, gun-blazing and explosion-roaring attack against multitude of enemies. While sometimes helped by the Army, you are mostly on your own. Hit them hard where it hurts and become a legend for generations to come!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chernobyl-commando", "characters": [{"id": 11525, "name": "Fedor"}, {"id": 4697, "name": "Yuri"}]}
