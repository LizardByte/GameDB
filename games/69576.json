You can buy and play them separately, but they link into the same main menu - and, if you have bought them all, you get another bonus game for free (it will be unlocked after you've installed the last game). \n \nEight Ball Chaos is \"billard light\" - you don't play against an opponent, you \"just\" have to shoot the balls in the pockets with the corresponding color. You can get bonus points for scoring tricks, though. The game features the well-known \"Monsters Inc\" protagonists.", "videos": [{"id": 32752, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "_n1MI5mpmVY"}]}
