The sequel to Cricket 96, it was developed by Melbourne House (as Beam Software) and published by EA Sports. It was the final cricket game in the series to be developed by Melbourne House.\n\nCompared to the previous game, the improvement in graphics continued with three-dimensional stadiums (though players remained rendered as sprites). Cricketing legends Ritchie Benaud and Ian Botham for the first time provided commentary and also featured in full motion video interludes. The game did not feature real player names as with previous games in the series (with real Australian and English sides appearing for the first time in the game's successor, Ashes Tour Edition).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cricket-97"}
