There are two teams which fight over the premise of having more terrain area than the other team. Each kill covers a portion of the other team's territory which gradually increases throughout the match. \n\nWe're a tiny team of four high schoolers. We work on Kronorite in our free time and despite our limited resources, it turned out to be a great little project and we hope everyone enjoys playing it as much as we enjoyed developing it.\n\nComing out on September 20th 2019.\nAdd it to your wishlist to get notified when it comes out!\n\nDiscord: https://discord.kronorite.com\nWebsite: https://kronorite.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Kronorite\nEmail: hello@kronorite.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIbTQW4Bap0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIbTQW4Bap0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIbTQW4Bap0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Kronorite Pre-Release Trailer", "description": "Wishlist it: https://store.steampowered.com/app/876780/Kronorite/\n\nKronorite is a nice little casual arcade game that you can hop into when you're bored and play with up to 10 people (5 vs 5).
