They have characteristics of strong reproductive ability, that\u2019s why they are large in population. They are powerful, good at calculating and have occupied most of the mainland. They are on good terms with the demons. The mortals might be the weakest as an individual, but some of them are strong enough to fight against the devils.\nThe demons: Their original forms are mostly animals and monsters. Compared with the others, their immortal practice is the hardest and not many of them can become an immortal in the end. However, once they succeed, they are stronger than the others too. They are friendly with the mortals, but they are not against the devils too. The mortals and the devils often fight with each other to win this neutral party over. The demons dwell in hidden places like the forest. They are also the ruler of the southern seas. Lord Demon is the ruler of the demons.\n\nThe devils: With horns on head, most of the devils are born with talent. Their big size and strong strength make them the best material to become immortals. As they are few in number, they have been suppressed by the mortals for a long time. In the many wars with the mortals, they won a few times but eventually, the mortals would take over the world from their control. Hidden on the northern snow land, they are preparing to invade the territory of mortal anytime.\nThe mainland is divided into few parts. The central plain is where the kingdom of mortals built. The northern land is the domain of the devils (there\u2019s a shutter mountain at the north of the snow land serving as a natural barrier). To the southwest is a misty forest. The west part is controlled by some religion powers. The south is the dependency of the rich and famous. The southern and eastern parts of the continent are bordered by Kyuyu Sea. On some islands in the east, there are some hidden prestigious families. The southern ocean is the home of Sea Monsters.\nThe legend has it that Immortal Fruit can grant people eternal life. Moreover, a new system of practice, that overrides the three races, can be created. With it, the world can be united and the disputes will come to an end.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5e5V6jnOqw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5e5V6jnOqw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5e5V6jnOqw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5e5V6jnOqw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5e5V6jnOqw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "FORLANDS | Official Trailer", "description": "Pre-Registration Link: http://forlands.eyougame.com/register/\niOS & Android Pre-Registration Link: https://eyou.io/16\n\u2601 \u2601 \u2601 \u2601 \u2601\nFollow us to get news and updates:\nOfficial Website\uff1ahttps://forlands.eyougame.com/\nForlands Players Community (Official Group)(https://www.facebook.com/groups/EyouF...)\nForlands Official Instagram: @eyougame_official (https://www.instagram.com/eyougame_of...)\nEyougame support mail: support@eyougame.com\n\nForlands\uff1aThere are three races in this world consisting of mortals, demons, and devils.\n\nThe mortals: Their practice to immortality is relatively easy.
