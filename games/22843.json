It is an action/arcade tank sim game which involves piloting floating tanks in a sci-fi universe shooting down enemy tanks and destroying enemy installations. The war is fought between 3 contrasting factions on numerous worlds. Developed and published by Interactive Magic and Bluemoon interactive, Thunder Brigade features a 30-mission campaign mode, dozens of single scenarios as well as a scenario editor with almost limitless posiblities. Originaly, the game featured an online multiplayer mode which was similar to single scenario and featured an editor. Unfortunatly, the main connection type, \"play on imagic.com\" has now closed down so multiplayer no longer works properly. Thunder Brigade however is still popular today thanks to it's addictive gameplay, imaginative universe and the almost infinite possibilities of the scenario editor.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thunder-brigade", "videos": [{"id": 41796, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_qYTFQp_5-g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qYTFQp_5-g", "title": "Thunder Brigade Intro Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_qYTFQp_5-g/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49714, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "910z2ySDRig", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=910z2ySDRig", "title": "Thunder Brigade PC Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/910z2ySDRig/sddefault.jpg"}]}
