It maintained the same intuitive power-up system of \"Nemesis\", \"Salamander\" et. al. but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather that the traditional Gradius ship. Parodius' eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat/half-boat creature.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
