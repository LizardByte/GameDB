If the cursor stops looking at the sword, your grip will be lost and the sword will fall back to its original position.\n\nThe Steam version includes an online mode in which the sword gets longer and heavier each time someone pulls it out.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-one-who-pulls-out-the-sword-will-be-crowned-king", "videos": [{"id": 67153, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "FSEO_nlbfgo"}]}
