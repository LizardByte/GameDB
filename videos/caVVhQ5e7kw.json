{"id": "caVVhQ5e7kw", "snippet": {"title": "ODS Amazing Art Corner - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) Longplay", "description": "ODS Amazing Art Corner is a piece of educational art software released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997. The software allows you to paint using 4 different colors of balls: red, blue, green, and multicolored beach balls. You can change the size of the brush and the number of brushes between 1, 2, and 4. Alternatively, you can allow the program to create illustrations for you, and you can control the program's pattern using five sliders on the bottom. There is no music or sound in this program after the intro.\n\nThis longplay includes trying out all of the colors, sizes, and numbers of the brushes, as well as using the sliders to alter the program's automatic paint function. I also showed what happens when you try and print the picture, but because no printer was connected I received an error. The error caused almost all of my drawing to vanish. As a child, the best use I could find for the four simultaneous brushes was to make butterfly wings, so I made it a point to make one here. Beyond that, the funnest thing to do with this program is just to zone out and make cool patterns.\n\nI wanted to upload this because Ohio Distinctive Software was a big part of my childhood and I couldn't find any footage of it on Youtube. Fortunately this game along with many other Ohio Distinctive games has been preserved digitally and can be found archived online. \n\nOhio Distinctive still operates but seems to be out of software publishing. Their facebook page suggests that they shut down during covid and reopened selling items such as mugs.\n\nIf you played this game please comment and let me know the when and where. My mother worked for the marketing firm that Ohio Distinctive used, so we ended up with discs of many of their games. I'm guessing that if anyone else played these games it would have been in a school setting but I'm not sure.\n\nThis session was recorded on December 9th, 2022 using DOSBox running Windows 3.1.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/caVVhQ5e7kw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/caVVhQ5e7kw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/caVVhQ5e7kw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/caVVhQ5e7kw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/caVVhQ5e7kw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ODS Amazing Art Corner - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) Longplay", "description": "ODS Amazing Art Corner is a piece of educational art software released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997.
