Some Devotees go as far as altering their bodies with a special kind of traditional technology, aimed to ease the energy's mastering.\nAnd when the stars are aligned, they can show off their skills during the Ritual, in which they'll fight following a certain set of rules :\n\n- They must use unique ceremonial swords that won't endanger the eliminated Devotee's soul, ensuring they can respawn within a brand new physical body. No one dies during the Ritual.\n\n- The goal is to run towards the enemy Altar to reach their Orb. When filled with the Orb's energy, the Devotees can enhance their senses, feeling what true transcendance is like. They must bring back the enemy Orb's ernergy to their own Altar.\n\n- They can choose between 3 Roles, receiving a ceremonial gear according to it, and then pick the Power they'll use according tot heir role. They're only allowed to use that skill during the Ritual, having to show their mastering and creativity of the Energy. They can change Roles and Powers as much as they want upon reincarnation.\n\nThe Ritual is a thrilling moment for both Devotees and the inhabitants of the City it's taking part in. Thus, the winning Devotees are not only rewarded physically, by training their bodies, or mentally, by enhancing their energy-mastering capacities, but they also earn the right to have their names & soul join the Nebulas.\n\nYou are a Devotee. You can become a legend.
