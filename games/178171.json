The Hokusei Line has an extremely rare feature that the track gauge is narrow which is unique in Japan. Because the track width is narrower than the width of both arms spread, it is necessary to slow down specially on the curves. You can enjoy the train driving experience by running at low speed and enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nYou can drive through a 20.4km trip from Nishi-Kuwana Station to Ageki Station, on the aforementioned Sangi Railway Hokusei Line.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tetsudou-nippon-rosen-tabi-sangi-tetsudou-hen"}
