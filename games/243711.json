As a powerful wizard, you'll make your way through each floor of a treacherous dungeon, one hole at a time. Instead of using a ball and clubs, you'll propel yourself through each carefully constructed corridor. The hazards on these courses are a bit more hazardous than usual. Don't worry: you've got a spell or two you can use against the monsters that lurk in the roughs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wizard-golf-rpg"}
