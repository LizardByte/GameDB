In this remake you can play through the real story told by Blue Tidal, as well as the alternative story, which is a recreation of the first game. In this remake too, the music and sounds have been recreated, with each ending having its own music.\n\nThe suspense part of the game was inspired by some famous horror movies from the 80s/90s.\n\nAs the main story is based on the real story of Blue Tidal, it ends up being very short, unlike the alternative story which is a recreation and reimagining of the first game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-smiling-man-remake", "videos": [{"id": 100827, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WvNZYBpLIpk"}]}
