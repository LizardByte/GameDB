It has simple objectives, and a simple goal. The game features progressively harder levels. Each level builds upon the previous. Some levels feature verticality, while others have small platforms. The player must execute precise jumps, and movements in order to complete a level. However, what sets Infinity apart from other platformers, is the lack of checkpoints. Infinity does not feature saves, checkpoints or level selection. You simply play to complete all levels. We offer three gamemodes, Standard Play, Progressive Play, and Training. Standard Play is the 12 level experience. Players will play through 12 levels, all expanding upon different ideas, and introducing new challenges. Progressive Play is a single level that is challenging and quite lengthy. Training is a way for players to practice their skills in a safe environment.\""}
