The game was written to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the museum and the 35th anniversary of the ZX Spectrum.\n\nThe game is set in the museum, where some games have gone missing. The player has to locate the games and bring them back to the correct exhibit. The museum consists of several single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically to offer a large amount of exploration. Items such as discs, boards, and cartridges can be picked up and stored in an inventory with room for four items. There they can be examined and then the player has to find the correct exhibit to put it back. Both items and exhibits have descriptions that can be read for some more information about video game history.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-computer-spiele-museums-museum-guide"}
