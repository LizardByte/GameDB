To stay the encroaching darkness, the order known as the Scions of the Seventh Dawn called upon the aid of those brave adventurers who would lend their blades. Their combined efforts did quell the Garlean threat, earning accolades from leaders of nations and commonfolk alike.\n\nYet where there is light, there will always be shadow. The beast tribes persist in their efforts to summon the primals\u2014aetherial entities whose powers swell with the amassed crystals and fervent prayers of their followers. The once-defeated Garlean forces resurface, harboring renewed ambitions of conquest. And the baleful Ascians lurk in the shadows, their presence rousing dark forces long since forgotten.\n\nAs new threats emerge, adventurers must once again heed the Crystal's call.", "summary": "Patch 2.1, the very first major version update for Final Fantasy XIV, sees large-scale additions and refinements made to Eorzea.
