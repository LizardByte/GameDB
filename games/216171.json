Now they have to fight to live on this alien planet, with extreme consequences.\n\nBy playing MetalCore, you may receive in-game rewards through missions, PvP, or PvE matches. If fighting isn\u2019t your style, become a Baron and recruit your vassals through Barony (a renting and borrowing system in MetalCore) and let others fight with your vehicles on your behalf. Barons can also acquire land to mine for resources.", "summary": "MetalCore is an NFT-based, open world, mechanized combat game.
