While many of them have hidden the XStones needed to battle them, Cody is able to secure them via time-travel. During this, Cody will fight against three Robopon user cyborgs created by Dr. Zero. Finally, Cody often encounters the comically underpowered Nick D who seeks to collect a XStone to sell to support his orphanage and duels with him over them.", "summary": "Hudson's Pokemon-like handheld RPG for the Game Boy Color that featured the \"GB Kiss\", a built-in infrared port to make for wireless link, to trade Robopons with friends, interact with household remotes to power up or evolve your Robopon, and unlock treasure chests that can't be opened otherwise.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/robopon-2-ring-version", "videos": [{"id": 87281, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_WO5LBkfkWE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WO5LBkfkWE", "title": "Let's Play GBA 475: Robopon 2 - Ring Version", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_WO5LBkfkWE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
