The game stars characters that either look like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them.\n\nThe show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situations the protagonists find themselves in.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bakushou-yoshimoto-shinkigeki"}
