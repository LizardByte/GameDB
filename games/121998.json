Military conflict is everywhere and entire continents are changing.\n\nIn Medieval Dynasty, you take on the role of a young man who has fled from war and wants to take his fate into his own hands. From being alone, inexperienced and poor you will develop into a master of many skills, a leader of your community and the founder of a prosperous dynasty which is meant to last and prosper for generations to come. Defending against wild animals while hunting for food, gathering resources and crafting equipment, building a house and erecting a whole bustling village while founding a family all contribute to a unique gameplay experience across many genres. Tough winters and unexpected events challenge your skills and dexterity as you strive to build your own legacy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/medieval-dynasty", "videos": [{"id": 40277, "name": "Gamescom 2020 Trailer", "video_id": "ST14nkbbY4c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST14nkbbY4c", "title": "Medieval Dynasty - Official Trailer | gamescom 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ST14nkbbY4c/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 53916, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "5m0_Ezoqdp8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m0_Ezoqdp8", "title": "Medieval Dynasty - Official Full Release Developer Diary | gamescom 2021", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5m0_Ezoqdp8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 53917, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "2B-q-nw3Ssw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-q-nw3Ssw", "title": "Medieval Dynasty Release Date Trailer - Future Games Show Gamescom 2021", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2B-q-nw3Ssw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
