{"id": "0oP1eR0tnUI", "snippet": {"title": "[Quake] January Jump Jam 2 - jjj2_gw_x9 \"Ternate Sufferance\" Nightmare 100%", "description": "Really nicely detailed map from GW_X9 with an intriguing progression system, albeit somewhat confusing. Primary objective is to bust out of your cell and collect & plant three explosive devices and escape the facility. There are sub objectives too - collecting the keys to unlock the first set of boots, activating the extraction crane and finding the platform codes to keep things interesting. This will have you combing every inch of the map and revisiting areas from a new vertical perspective. This sort of exploration heavy gameplay is ideal for jump boot focused maps.\n\nCombat is pretty harsh throughout due to the extreme verticality & really aggressive use of high tier enemies. Every action the player takes, a whole load of enemies get dumped on them. There's some neato little set[piece ideas too like the floor collapsing into the water and the mini-boss and prowlers on the top floor. No clue how you're supposed to survive the massive fight with the quad jump boots without finding the trifecta. Attempting to climb to the top will probably get you railed out of the sky by all the aggressive prowlers. It feels a bit slapped together and spammy, but the respawning ammo & multiple options for retreating make it a lot of fun regardless.\n\nI've deliberately played this quite slowly and delayed the super secret until the end of the map after finding all the clues to try to demonstrate the intended progression. The super secret is way cool - odd letters on the terminal messages are highlighted and if you remember them and solve the anagram it says \"UNDER THE BED\". Combine that with the final pad at the top of the map talking about a grenade launcher and you'll find the plasma rifle secret and a final secret that triggers on the map exit! That is to say if a a random ogre doesn't set the secret off mid combat at the start of the map...\n\nAlso doesn't this facility look cool? You bet it does. Just the right degree of disrepair and all the hostile architectural touches like the horizontal spike canopies surrounding the quad/switches. Everything densely layered together too. Yep, great! Looking forward to the next one.\n\nRecorded with vkquake 1.12.2\nDownload JJJ2 here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qCqgenNFA9HRQ51UO4y-bTPzM8E5hhh2/view?usp=sharing", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0oP1eR0tnUI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0oP1eR0tnUI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0oP1eR0tnUI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[Quake] January Jump Jam 2 - jjj2_gw_x9 \"Ternate Sufferance\" Nightmare 100%", "description": "Really nicely detailed map from GW_X9 with an intriguing progression system, albeit somewhat confusing.
