This game will have different gameplay between the two characters Sonic and Shadow who will be the only playable characters. \n\nSonic will start off easy and will begin to get harder as each level goes while Shadow starts off difficult from the start and will have more of a technical moveset that applies to his unique gameplay which is very different. I advise to play as Sonic first and learn how the combat works and the enemies work to know how to play as Shadow better. \n\nThis is the first update video to show progress on the game. This video shows our new three save slots as well as the last area visited with the rings you have saved up as well as lives in the data selection overview. Loading Screens that give brief descriptions or tips of the area you are going too. Side missions are added as well to the game of course since it is open world via hub worlds to run through or visit. Side missions are not only available from main characters but can be found across certain npcs as you visit or go through areas you are needed for the next part of the story. An Afterimage Character is there to switch between Sonic and Shadow wherever it is available through the open hub worlds. Shadow indicator for main character side missions will be them missing from the Base Area after progressing and getting them to come there. This gameplay is of someone who is a pro at this game. This mission is meant to be hard because of it being a power scale mission. (Power Scale Missions are side missions that increase the strength of the moves associated with the scale power up. The person playing on this video has already beaten this mission and have unlocked both power ups from both power scale missions. It is purely for demonstration purposes.)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DuJSmibXhNY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DuJSmibXhNY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DuJSmibXhNY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DuJSmibXhNY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DuJSmibXhNY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic Skywind - Progress Update - Side Missions", "description": "Sonic Skywind is a different type of Sonic Fangame that isn't inspired by really anything but sure wonder as to why Sonic never really has combat moves in his games.
