I can't believe it. We were so close when we were younger and I feel like a part of my life is now missing. I feel so helpless, like I can't do anything to bring him back.\n\nI feel so sad and it feels like my heart is heavy. I can't help but think about all of the fun times we had together growing up. All of our adventures, our secrets, and even our arguments. I miss him so much and I can't believe he's gone.\n\nI'm struggling to cope with this news and it's hard to stay focused on anything else. I hope that writing in this journal will help me to process my emotions and come to terms with what has happened. I know that my friend would want me to remember the good times and continue to live life to the fullest.", "summary": "Last August I lost a good childhood friend of mine and took it pretty hard. When I was visiting my hometown for his funeral, I connected with his parents who shared with me some of his old belongings. Among them was a copy of an old map of his backed up on a 3.5\u201d floppy from high school. Thomas and I were into amateur Doom mapping in the early 00s but I had never seen this map of his prior to uncovering it on one of the old floppy discs. As a way of paying tribute to him and all the great memories we had together, I took the plunge and installed Doom Builder in order to polish up his map and add a few modern amenities just for convenience's sake.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/myhouse-dot-wad", "videos": [{"id": 86126, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rtrELyz0KZM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtrELyz0KZM", "title": "myhouse.wad", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rtrELyz0KZM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
