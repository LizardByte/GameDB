Then one day, after returning home from a fishing trip, the Vikings get captured by Tomator again. Tomator then calls upon a robotic guard to send them into the Arena, which falls short when a system failure happens. During the blackout, the three Vikings dismantle the robot piece by piece and wear its parts on their bodies, granting them new abilities. The three Vikings are then accidentally sent through time once again. Equipped with the new robotic gear, Erik, Olaf, and Baleog must journey through each level to find their way back home. Along the way, they befriend a werewolf named Fang and a dragon named Scorch, both of whom assist them in their quest.", "summary": "Lost Vikings 2 is a side-scrolling platform adventure in which the player alternates control of three of the five playable characters, guiding each of them one at a time from a designated start point in each level to the exit, collecting three specific items along the way. The game predetermines which characters are available in any specific level.[7] Control may be swapped from character to character at any point. In the two-player cooperative mode, each player simultaneously controls one character and is allowed to change control to the third, unused character at any point. Every level is designed such that each character must contribute his unique skills to help the other two through to the end. Similarly, to finish the level, all three characters must reach the exit point with the three items in possession.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/norse-by-norse-west-the-return-of-the-lost-vikings", "videos": [{"id": 59875, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hDg2yB83QcI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDg2yB83QcI", "title": "Lost Vikings 2 (PC)(Part 1)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hDg2yB83QcI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 59876, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XMP-ygAfQqM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMP-ygAfQqM", "title": "Lost Vikings 2: Norse by Norsewest ...
