The scenarios were the only playable parts included; for features such as single maps, a map editor, or multiplayer, buying the original Heroes III was still required.\n\nThe plot of the Chronicles was set on Antagarich, tied together by the character of Tarnum, who leads various armies and factions throughout them. The released Chronicles were:\n\nWarlords of the Wasteland (2000). Tarnum's original story, as a young Barbarian leading an uprising against the oppressive Wizard-Kings of Bracaduun.\n\nConquest of the Underworld (2000). Tarnum's first adventure as the Immortal Hero as he adopts the guise of an Erathian Knight in a campaign against the Demons, Necromancers and Warlocks of the Underworld.\n\nMasters of the Elements (2000). Tarnum becomes that which he hates most, a Wizard, in a hectic bid to assist the Wizards of Bracada in their quest to save the planet from the destructive Elemental Lords.\n\nClash of the Dragons (2000). Tarnum takes up the bow and defends the Elves and Dwarves of AvLee as a Ranger while opposing the tyrannical Queen of Nighon, Mutare, and her legions of murderous Dragons.\n\nThe World Tree (2000). As a Barbarian, Tarnum defends the World Tree in northeastern Antagarich from evil Barbarians and Necromancers led by the demigod Vorr. This was available as a free download for those who purchased two Heroes Chronicles games, but the installer could only recognize the North American version.\n\nThe Fiery Moon (2000). The sequel to The World Tree continues Tarnum's quest as, in hot pursuit of Vorr, he travels to a moon populated by the demonic Kreegan. This was available as a free download for those who purchased three Heroes Chronicles games, but the installer could only recognize the North American version.\n\nRevolt of the Beastmasters (2001). Tarnum travels to the Mudlands of Tatalia, becoming a Beastmaster to free the Mudlanders from the oppression he brought upon them centuries ago. This campaign was one of two included in the single-disc installment, The Final Chapters.\n\nThe Sword of Frost (2001). Tarnum must become a Dungeon Overlord of Nighon to stop his former friend, the Elven Hero Gelu, from discovering the Sword of Frost. This campaign was one of two included in the single-disc installment, The Final Chapters.", "summary": "Heroes Chronicles is a series of five stand-alone games and two free expansions, offering eight new single-player campaigns. They are based on the Armageddon's Blade/Shadow of Death engine, and therefore feature all the various features added by these expansions, including the Conflux town, magical terrains, and combination artifacts;\n\nEight titles featuring the gameplay you know and love from Heroes of Might and Magic III. Eight chapters that tell the story of Tarnum, a barbarian hero and liberator of his kinsmen. After generations of oppression, Tarnum discovers his people's true history and leads an army of Stronghold troops against their tyrannical masters. Marching from the arid roughlands of his homeland and the muggy swamps of the lowlands, he follows and even surpasses the deeds of his legendary ancestor, who defeated the spellcasting oppressors long ago.\n\nThis great pack of all eight Heroes Chronicles chapters will allow you to spend hours adventuring on the continent of Antagarich.\n\n\"Heroes Chronicles: All chapters\" includes \"Warlords of the Wastelands\", \"Conquest of the Underworld\", \"Masters of the Elements\", \"Clash of the Dragons\", \"The World Tree\", \"The Fiery Moon\", \"Revolt of the Beastmasters\", and \"The Sword of Frost\".", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heroes-chronicles-all-chapters", "videos": [{"id": 45653, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0E2VsjgYHo0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E2VsjgYHo0", "title": "Heroes of Might and Magic III: Chronicles (2000) - All INTRO with Tarnum", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0E2VsjgYHo0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 194, "name": "Heroes of Might and Magic"}]}
