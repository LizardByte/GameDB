You can play against a friend or the computer at any one of over twenty different table layouts. There are only seven balls on the table instead of the normal fifteen, and if you fail to pot a ball three times, you lose the frame. There's not that much else to say about it, but one nice feature is that you can design your own table layouts and save and load them for later use."}
