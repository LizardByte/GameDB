Pentas are shapes made from five connected squares, this means that they all have the same area but a different shape. The player\u2019s task is to fit the shapes into a box. There are twelve shapes in total which must be fitted into a box. The shareware game has just a 6x10 box but the registered game has three other box sizes 5 x 12, 4 x 15, and 3 x 20.\n\nPieces may be rotated and/or flipped in order to position them in the box and there\u2019s an optional grid setting to help with the planning.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pentablox"}
