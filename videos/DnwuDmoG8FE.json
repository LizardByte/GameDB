Inspired by RPG Maker games and other classics such as Killer7 and Resident Evil, the game features a mysterious story with touches of both surrealistic horror and comedic slice of life.\n\nThe story's setup is simple: Mason Henning, an apathetic and highly overthinking engineer, gets as a mysterious gift some days of free stay at The Coneflower Hotel, the most expensive hotel in the world.  But instead of being welcomed by a warm sauna and expensive food, he sees himself in a regular snow lodging, while dealing with bizarre people and weird situations. While his daytime activities are rather peaceful, Mason starts having weird and violent nightmares which also seem to influence reality.
