I am Terra - and you will soon be my slave!\"\n(Roll retreats and Rock turns into Mega Man to fight against Terra, but even the charged shot doesn't work on him, and is defeated.)\nMega Man: \"What?!

The alien robots call themselves \"Stardroids\" and have conquered most of our major cities. They are constructed of alien material which renders our weapons useless. But, I have done some analysis and constructed a new weapon for you. It will replace your Super Mega Buster. It is called the \"Mega Arm\" and it allows you to charge energy in your fist before you fire it. I have also created a new assistant for you. His name is \"Tango.\" I'll enhance this item replicator to make powerful items for you. Collect as many P Chips as possible and return to my lab to exchange them for power-up items. Good luck, Mega Man.\"", "summary": "Mega Man V, known as Rockman World 5, is a video game developed and published by Capcom for the Game Boy handheld game console. It is the fifth and final game in the Game Boy version of the original Mega Man series. The game follows the adventures of the protagonist Mega Man as he must defend the Earth from a group of powerful robots from outer space called the \"Stardroids\". Mega Man V was also unique from the previous Game Boy Mega Man games as it features original and unique bosses rather than recycling those from the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-v", "videos": [{"id": 1555, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "qFN-IUbkxS8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFN-IUbkxS8", "title": "Let's Play - Megaman V (Gameboy) - 01 - Neptune & Venus - Upon a painted ocean.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qFN-IUbkxS8/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 116739, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VxefnwmJlhc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxefnwmJlhc", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf & \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3 & \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4 Nintendo Switch Online \u8ffd\u52a0\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb [2024\u5e746\u67087\u65e5]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VxefnwmJlhc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
