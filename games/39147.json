{"id": 39147, "name": "Roland Ahoy!", "summary": "After loading, press the DEL key and the ship is now under your control, in \nthe Map Scene. \nTo move the ship up, down, left or right use either the AMSOFT JY1 Joystick \nor the cursor control keys. \nTo move from the map !o another scene, you must dock the ship against the \nquays (the grey zones). Your first visit must be to Powder Quay to collect \nammunition. After Roland has collected ammunition, he must move as far as \npossible to the left and then jump on board using both the fire button and \nleft direction simultaneously. The map will then reappear with the ship in the \nappropriate position. \nTo fire a cannon ball or to make Roland jump upwards, press the joystick \nbutton or the key marked X on the keyboard. To make Roland run left or right \nuse the joystick or the left and right cursor control keys. \nAfter losing a life, the boom is rebuilt, but Roland retains the ammunition \nand treasure that is on board the ship. \nAfter treasure has been deposited at the back of the cave, or has been stolen \nfrom the harbour, Roland boards the ship automatically as he reaches it. The \ngame then returns to the map scene and you must repeat the sequence to obtain \nfurther items of treasure. There are many items of treasure which are stolen \none by one. After obtaining three of a kind a new treasure appears in the \nharbour. \nNOTE; The program prevents the moves below, so no cheating is possible! \n \nOnce you have collected cannon balls, you may only use them to fire at the \nboom. Firing is not possible at point-blank range. \n \nYou may not enter Powder Quay with ammunition or treasure. \n \nYou may not enter the harbour with treasure. \n \nYou may not visit Treasure Cove without treasure."}
