The controls require the player to use a joystick to control the plane to bank left, right, up or down as well as a lever to power the engine up or down. The game offers the Beginners' Class and Expert Class difficulties. The player takes control of a training biplane, but will get the opportunity to fly better and bigger aircraft through progression. The gameplay shows a realistic console of aircraft controls and a 3D landscape, in which the plane takes off, flies around and lands. The player must follow take off, flying and landing procedures to achieve as many points as possible, but can lose the game if an accident happens.", "videos": [{"id": 71784, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "b3v8vKxe78E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3v8vKxe78E", "title": "Landing Gear (Ver 4.2 O) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3v8vKxe78E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
