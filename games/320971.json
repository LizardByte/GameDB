A bunch of college kids go partying on a lake on Halloween night, only to be picked off one by one by something lurking in the woods, until only one girl is left to defeat the silent monstrous killing machine once and for all.\n\nOnly that\u2019s where this story begins.\n\nWhen Final Girl Vivian Finala misses her shot to kill the supernatural slasher Jack Headed Jill, things quickly spiral into a time-bending, out of control comedy of horrors in this Slasher Movie Satire.\n\nJoin Vivian as she recounts the horrific (and at times comedic) events that occurred on Lake Shishkabob, using some carefully selected action figures to recreate the scenes, along with snippets of her own memories. Help her uncover the truth and meet a queer and colorful cast of characters like Vivian\u2019s \u201cbest friend\u201d Joy Rancher, the walking jock stereotype Mark A. Martin, and of course Jill, the pumpkin demon who, despite her best efforts, just can\u2019t seem to kill anyone tonight.\n\nTeam up with Jill and Vivian to investigate crime scenes that both have and haven\u2019t happened yet, make choices that slightly change the course of events, and find clues about what really happened that night. The more clues you uncover the more options will be available to you during their final showdown with the true puppet master of Shishkabob Lake.", "summary": "A slasher satire visual novel where the Final Girl, Vivian Finala, teams up with the monster, Jack Headed Jill, to find out who really killed everyone on Lake Shish Kabob.\n\nMake choices, investigate crime scenes, and meet a cast of queer and colorful characters!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jill-o-lantern", "videos": [{"id": 130969, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bjafATWHlNo"}]}
