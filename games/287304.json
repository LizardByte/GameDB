It features around 90 enemies and should only take 5-15 minutes to beat. I really wanted to understand the privatives that make up a typical map and be able to re-create them and make use of them multiple times properly in a way that didn't feel 'rehashy'. While Lost and Foundry isn't my first Quake map thanks to the Reload Jam, it was my first idea that I reworked and scrapped until around 2 months ago. I'm glad I persisted if not for the learning experience it gave me as I felt I learned a lot of Arcane Dimensions quirks and have a better appreciation for some of the iconic maps made in it. Feel free to message me any agregious errors that may softlock the player or break events. Not made or tested for any multiplayer but does have spawns.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lost-and-foundry"}
