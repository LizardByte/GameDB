Onwa is the setting for Pok\u00e9mon Coral Version, a romhack that sets out to recreate the feeling of playing Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal for the first time. Journey through Onwa meeting interesting characters, earning the 8 Onwa League Badges, and working your way towards challenging the Onwa Pok\u00e9mon League.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Coral Version features a simple story akin to the first two generations of Pok\u00e9mon with many interesting characters and locations to see along the way. Things aren't completely what they seem, however. There has been talk of a group of ruffians abusing Pok\u00e9mon and using them in their money-making schemes. That can't be good news...\n\nThe 2022 Demo has been rebuilt from the ground up in the Pok\u00e9mon Polished Crystal engine allowing for many new features such as 60fps gameplay, abilities, and many many more. Much of the game design has been tweaked or completely overhauled, so even if you've played older demos, you should be in for a new and exciting experience!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-coral-version", "videos": [{"id": 83271, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "c0LODhhXnuI"}]}
