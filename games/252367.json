As part of their 10 Years of Doom feature, Doomworld named it one of the ten best WADs of 1994.\n\nOne of the first ever fan-made Doom mods, UAC_DEAD features an attempt at creating realistic-looking vehicles and environments. It contains a replacement sky graphic, and uses careful flat and texture choices in places to simulate colored lighting. It also includes the first known instance of the self-referencing sectors trick, used to create invisible stairs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doomsday-of-uac"}
