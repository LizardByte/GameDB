An evil, curtain-scratching and hairball-vomiting force from outer space has arrived on your peaceful home planet! They captured you and all your friends, built ugly factories everywhere and littered the landscapes with cat hair and poop.\n\nAnd on top of that, they took that one girl you just got together with onto one of their ships, which is heading towards outer space! Do you have the balls of wool to pack your guns, escape from your prison, and go on a journey through space to free your world from this abomination?", "summary": "Shadow of the Wool Ball is a 2016 total conversion for the ZDoom engine. Made by MSPaintR0cks, this is a unique shooter in which the player is a hedgehog fighting an army of cats. It is spread across three episodes, each having six levels. The mapping style is more akin to Wolfenstein 3D than classic Doom.\n\nThe playful art style, creative gameplay mechanics, and humorous plot were well-received, including a runner-up at the Cacowards 2016. A sequel, Rise of the Wool Ball, was released by MSPaintR0cks the following year.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-of-the-wool-ball", "videos": [{"id": 80460, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ic1Fiwr8sMo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic1Fiwr8sMo", "title": "Shadow Of The Wool Ball ep.1 bunker brawl (NO COMMENTARY)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ic1Fiwr8sMo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
