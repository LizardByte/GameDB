Some, for example, become leaders of the Shogunate to carry out ruthless policies, some became common murderers, and still others deliberately incite revolt against the government. \n \nThrough the influence of the devilish reincarnation, outbreaks of famine and plagues further increase the dead, providing the evil with yet more strength and delight. \n \nThe mountain of dead gathered by these means is subsequently heaped up on the altar of the Netherworld and fashioned into two pillars in which the hermaphroditic male and female are to be subsequently imprisoned. \n \nAt this time one man returns to the Netherworld. The name of this warrior who stands directly before these literal pillars of the dead in the darkness is Asura. Master of magic, he is the dark swordsman appearing in this realm to wreak his revenge on Yuga. \n \nRegardless, his enemy steadily proceeds with the construction of his utopia. The curtain now rises on this drama of revenge that will engulf both our world and the land of the dead.", "summary": "Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage is a 3D fighting game produced by SNK for the Hyper Neo Geo 64 system It's the sixth game in Samurai Shodown series and the eighth in the official chronology (tenth if considered the non-canonical games). It is the followup to the original Samurai Shodown 64 on the same platform, and like its predecessor, it received relatively no distribution outside of Japan. It should not be confused with Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage, which is an entirely different game. In order to avoid confusion, some sources refer this game as Samurai Shodown 64 II.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 38554, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "U6s5XiJ4jUc"}]}
