Players control an adventurer attempting to cross a treacherous network of bridges spanning a deadly abyss. The game begins with a bird's-eye view of the bridge system, requiring quick route planning as lingering too long results in falling. Upon reaching each bridge's end, players face diverse challenges from monsters, ranging from solving math problems to navigating mazes. These mini-games add depth and variety to the core bridge-crossing mechanic. The ultimate goal is to reach the Mountain of the Golden Lion, marked by a flashing 'F'. This mix of time-pressured navigation and varied puzzles creates a compelling and multifaceted gaming experience that tests both reflexes and problem-solving skills.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/abyss"}
