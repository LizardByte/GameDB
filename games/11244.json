However, the increasing information flow and infection by a virus (the main character) confused Eden, allowing her to begin questioning the meaning of its existence and the consequences of her actions. Trying to fathom the paradoxes that surrounded her and realizing the power she possessed, she shut herself down.\n\nThe player character and protagonist is a hacker virus unofficially named Swayzak, traversing the Project-K network on a mission to re-awaken Eden and to reveal the true being at her core by progressing deeper through the system, and destroying the other viruses, anti-viruses, security programs, defense systems, and firewalls within.", "summary": "A rail shooter with a heavy emphasis on audiovisual elements in which a hacker attempts to breach an AI integral for the continuation of the human race to prevent it from shutting down due to information overload.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rez", "videos": [{"id": 88126, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9n8sQAchi34", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n8sQAchi34", "title": "Dreamcast Longplay - Rez", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9n8sQAchi34/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88127, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "L9tkx7xDmig", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9tkx7xDmig", "title": "Game Tapes Raw: Rez Trailer (2001)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L9tkx7xDmig/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
