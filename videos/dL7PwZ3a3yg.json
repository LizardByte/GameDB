Players will step into the shoes of Yuri Kozukata, Ren Hojo, and Miu Hinasaki as they venture up the eerie Mt. Hikami in hopes of finding those who have previously disappeared. In order to overcome the malevolent spirits housed in the mountain\u2019s waters, they will have to master the Camera Obscura \u2013 a unique camera that can deal damage to ghosts upon taking a photo. Each successful shot will cause a spirit to emit Spirit Fragments and if players are able to capture an image of the ghost and these mysterious fragments in the same frame, they will unleash a high-damage Fatal Frame attack. Upgrading the camera\u2019s parts, such as equipping a stronger lens or changing out the film, allows more powerful images to be taken, giving players more protection as they venture further up the mountain. When a ghost has been defeated, the camera is able to perform the Glancing ability to uncover the ghost\u2019s past \u2013 helping to uncover the truth behind the disappearances on the mountain.\n\nNew to this enhanced version is a brand-new Photo Mode where players can use any character or ghost from their adventure, position them on a background of their choice, while adding a variety of effects (lens type, frame choice, focus, etc.) to make the perfect scary photo. New costumes and accessories have also been added including Yuri\u2019s \u2018Punk Ensemble\u2019, \u2018Cutesy Goth Ensemble (Black)\u2019, \u2018Swimsuit (Blue)\u2019, and the \u2018Triathlon Suit\u2019 as well as Miu\u2019s \u2018Miku Hinasaki Outfit (The Tormented)\u2019, \u2018Cutesy Goth Ensemble (White)\u2019, \u2018Swimsuit (Yellow)\u2019, and \u2018Swimsuit (Pink)\u2019, along with Ren\u2019s \u2018Groom\u2019s Outfit\u2019.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dL7PwZ3a3yg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dL7PwZ3a3yg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dL7PwZ3a3yg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dL7PwZ3a3yg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dL7PwZ3a3yg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fatal Frame: Maiden of the Black Water - Overview Trailer", "description": "FATAL FRAME: Maiden of Black Water the spine-chilling adventure launches digitally on October 28, 2021 across North America on Nintendo Switch/PS4/PS5/Xbox One/Xbox One X|S, PC Steam.\n\nFATAL FRAME: Maiden of Black Water is an enhanced version of the 2014 Wii U release of the same name, allowing players on all platforms to enjoy this unique horror experience.
