The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys-2--1", "videos": [{"id": 85875, "name": "Trailer #1", "video_id": "b_V0MybZIOU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_V0MybZIOU", "title": "Five Night's at Freddy's 2 Remaster - Mobile", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b_V0MybZIOU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
