Players can choose which worlds they want to play. Also there are optional secret levels: cape, water, motor skills, and more. These levels don't unlock more levels, and they aren't necessary to see the credits. Also, there are many fast strats built into the levels to reward continued play.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-nothing-world"}
