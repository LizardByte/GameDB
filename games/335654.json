Unlike traditional racing games that focus on speed, Eggy Car requires precision and control to keep the egg from falling. Navigate through hills, gaps, and obstacles, collect coins to unlock better cars, and use power-ups like the diamond freeze to help you travel farther. Every run is a test of balance and patience, making it an addictive game for players of all skill levels. How far can you go without cracking the egg?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eggy-car", "videos": [{"id": 143174, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "lgFhzhRM29M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgFhzhRM29M", "title": "Eggy Car // Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lgFhzhRM29M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
