It's called Nihility and I'll hopefully one day expand it into a full 36-level megawad. It's an old-school style wad with some new and replaced monsters and weapons, inspired by the Alphas/Beta but also old-school 90's partial conversions aka Strain. If you like DTWID, No End In Sight, Monti's favillesco and erkatane episodes, and Doom: The Lost Episode then you might enjoy this. If you don't like abstract, explorational and moody maps (and graytall) you should probably steer clear.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nihility-infinite-teeth"}
