A cloverleaf will generate randomly after a certain number of furry kills. Collecting three clovers will turn Gore into a minotaur, granting him invincibility and allowing him to stomp on enemies. This lasts for about 15\u201320 seconds. The player has three lives and accumulates points for each furry killed. There are also OpenFeint and Game Center leaderboards and achievements.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/minigore", "videos": [{"id": 17006, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "k1OL_zrENbg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1OL_zrENbg", "title": "Minigore Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k1OL_zrENbg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
