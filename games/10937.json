Research new alien technologies and bring them into battle with a mix of turn-based strategy and real-time skirmishes.\n\nNow a new Faction bursts onto the scene, a race of Artificial Intelligence who once served as slaves and now return seeking vengeance. Playing as the Loa, your Fleets will become masters of metamorphosis, shape-shifting into new forms to become the ships you need, where you need them. Durable and hardy, your colonies can be built on any rocky planet. Building an empire of silicon and steel, you will bring your former masters to their knees\u2026or will you bring about the End of Flesh.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sword-of-the-stars-ii-enhanced-edition", "videos": [{"id": 13385, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "roxP-JcVxSk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roxP-JcVxSk", "title": "Sword of the Stars II Enhanced Edition - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/roxP-JcVxSk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
