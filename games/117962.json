In WordZap, players race to make proper English words to fill their rack of words, but when one player makes a word already found by the other player, the word is \"zapped\" from both players' racks. Each round ends when either one player fills the word rack, or time runs out without either player being able to make another word.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wordzap"}
