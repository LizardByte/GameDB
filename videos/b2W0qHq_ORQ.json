Overall,it is a decent port of the game if you don't mind the lack of colours and the kinda low quality audio. As for my thoughts on the game in general, even though i grew up playing it with the NES version,i don't know if i really like the game cause it is one of those games that are hard but not for the right reasons. Half the time it feels luck based even. i think this game has an unbalanced difficulty curve. The order of levels is inconsistant difficulty wise. Some levels can go on for way too long if they require you to get the ball on a specific spot to go to the next level.(I particularly loathe levels 3,9,10,12,and 25 with that,i never look forward to play them. i think level 26 can kiss my ass too)To make matters worse,the ball gets faster and faster in less than a minute(on most versions of the game anyway)it's probably gonna be a matter of time for you to lose a life due to the ball going insanely fast. Thankfully though this version has a difficulty select that kinda makes the game more bearable to play. At the same time though,there is some flicker that happens when the ball is moving fast,which makes it harder to see the ball,but i think that's either an emulation issue,or maybe it can be solved with some custom performance configuration. Maybe the difficulty is fine for a hardcore gamer,but for regular people,this is usually too much. and mind you,i'm not bad at games generally speaking,but no matter how much i tried to get good at this game,it is just not very fun to me,so i'm glad there's an easier setting on this version. I rather play Arkanoid Doh it Again than this or the sequel,Revenge of Doh.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b2W0qHq_ORQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b2W0qHq_ORQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b2W0qHq_ORQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b2W0qHq_ORQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b2W0qHq_ORQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Arkanoid Macintosh Version Longplay", "description": "Since no one else has bothered yet,here's a longplay video of the Macintosh version of Arkanoid.
