Since this equipment is made by BoscoTech, suspicion falls on Momma Bosco. After successfully returning her to their plane of existence via a seance, Sam & Max eventually find out that she's not behind the clones herself, but did make the cloning equipment for some unknown customer for a large amount of money. Luckily she should be able to take command of the clones, if she can get a new body.", "summary": "Episode 4 of an epic 5 game saga.\n\nIn Episode 4, the indescribable forces that have been pulling the Freelance Police\u2019s strings begin revealing themselves, in a tale that will change the way you look at Sam & Max...forever!\n\nAn onslaught of oversized canine clones akin to a zombie apocalypse has our heroes running for cover in a barricaded ramshackle diner as the episode begins.
