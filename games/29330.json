You can design tanks, manage research, equip infantry, set up infantry training, optimize production and build combined arms battalions to crush your enemies. You have complete freedom to customize your army and you will need both superior designing and logistical skills as well as masterful tactics to outsmart your opponents and triumph on the battlefield. \n \nThe combat system is based on measuring anti-tank firepower against armor and anti-personnel firepower against infantry cover while the combat distance gradually decreases during the battle. The terrain affects the starting distance of engagement, cover and tank maneuverability. Side, rear or top armor is exposed to enemy fire when tanks are fighting in complex environments, like woods, urban areas or marshland. It is an accurate and clever yet immediate system designed around the idea of optimizing your divisions. \n \nTherefore, research is an important part of the game. You can develop new tank engines, suspension, guns and infantry weapons or improve industrial efficiency and training methods. \n \nYou can design a new tank, set up a production line to produce it and increase the production capacity by capturing enemy cities. \n \nProper training is essential for victory. Inadequate training will cause increased casualties, while good training will generate combat bonuses. The training capacity is also limited: optimize carefully. \n \nYou can manage infantry equipment at the platoon level. Select small arms and heavy weapons to provide the necessary firepower, then unleash it to see your enemies vanquished! \n \n \nMain features: \n- Randomly generated maps \n- More than 2100 possible tank designs \n- Tech tree with 99 research projects \n- Customizable infantry equipment with 23 infantry weapons \n- Custom training doctrines", "summary": "Land Doctrine is a 3D strategy game focusing on military optimization.
