You must go fast, that much is clear, but why? And how fast is too fast?\n\nWith intense highway driving, a story mode that gradually ramps up the difficulty, and a fresh world and road to master each time you get behind the wheel, Nightvision will have you in a cold sweat as you anticipate the next curve about to come into your headlights.\n\n- Realistic seat-of-your-pants racing featuring the challenge of limited visibility; is that a sheer mountain pass lurking in the darkness, or a switchback on the edge of a cliff?\n- Randomly generated terrain. Never the same drive twice.\n- Lost desert highways engineered by RoadGen\u2122 artificial intelligence in real-time carve through the random hillsides.\n- Engaging story integrated seamlessly without long cutscenes taking away from the action.\n- Sandbox mode: to practice, hand-craft unique challenges, or leave up to the RNG gods.\n- One BILLION world seeds, four different RoadGen\u2122 algorithms, and dozens of road and world settings, offer over 10 QUINTILLION levels. Play 'em all!\n- Share your favorite level passphrases with your friends and dare them to make it as fast or as far. Or just repeat your favorites and try for better times.\n- Literal Endless mode to test your endurance and see how far you can stay on the road.\n- Spectacular crashes! Die over and over and love every minute. Wincing has never been so much fun.\n- No map. No memorizing the \"track\".
