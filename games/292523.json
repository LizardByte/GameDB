Saint Orianne had to call upon all of her power to defeat him, since no one else stood a chance.\n\nNow Loptr has returned, and his first move has already wiped out one of the world's strongest armies. However, it will be some time before he regains his full strength, so his victory is not yet certain.\n\nSword Princess Sistina is a fairly sheltered young woman, but her combat skills are first class. She sets out on a journey to discover Loptr's weakness and prevent his resurrection, together with her childhood friend Luis and his best friend, Rayne. Luis has the knowledge of a scholar, while Rayne's street smarts are unrivaled.\n\nThe three of them will encounter fantastical monsters, religious zealots with their own ideas of how Loptr should be confronted, and other demons who scheme against humanity on their way to fight the Demon God. Through their combined wits and abilities, they must save the Human World or be annihilated by the demons!", "summary": "Since a young age, Sistina has been lauded as the Sword Princess thanks to her masterful bladework.
