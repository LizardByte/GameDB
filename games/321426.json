One day, rifts began to appear all over the world, from which creepy creatures began to emerge. They look like humans, but they have heads, arms and legs. 420 days have passed since their appearance, and the hospital of the city of Groywood has become for its inhabitants the last chance to survive in this world.\n\nAfter hearing this, many questions arose in Tim's mind, but the most important one was how could his wife be four months pregnant when he had spent so much time in a coma. Unfortunately he couldn't ask that question, his vocal cords weren't ready for the sudden awakening.\n\nSuddenly shouts of \u201cThey're here!\u201d rang through the corridors of the hospital. In an instant everything went quiet and Tim's wife decided to help him, but then the door to the room opened abruptly and he walked in. You've forgotten the most important rule - \u201cdon't move\u201d. The monster noticed Tim's movement and lunged at him, but his wife blocked his path, throwing Tim back. She sacrificed her life for a man who hadn't been with her in about 10 years. Tim hit his head on the wall and lost consciousness.\n\nUpon waking up, Tim found that he was in an unfamiliar room. There is a door in front of him, but it is also here.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-boring-place-the-road-2-head", "videos": [{"id": 131876, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "W_PlpruSHzA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_PlpruSHzA", "title": "a Boring Place: The Road 2 Head - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_PlpruSHzA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
