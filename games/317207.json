Each player starts with a fixed prize fund. When a player makes too many mistakes, they are at risk of elimination and can choose another player to challenge. The winner takes the prize fund of the other player, who is eliminated. The last remaining player must answer seven questions. If they fail to answer enough correctly, the losing finalist can steal the champion's title by answering an eighth question.\nThe game features both single-player and multiplayer modes for up to seven players. Each player can customize their name and appearance. The PlayStation 2 version supports the EyeToy camera. The game is fully voiced by the original host, Amadeus.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/leredita"}
