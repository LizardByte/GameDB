{"id": "Gh6TtH_7uUs", "snippet": {"title": "Erma - Alpha 0.1 trailer", "description": "\"Erma (Early Mammal)\" is a light evolution sim in the vain of games like Spore and EVO Search for Eden. What sets it apart from the average Spore successor is that it takes basically the opposite approach. Erma is a \"low-concept, high-octane\" take on the formula, where fun action gameplay comes first, and every small adjustment you make to your character impacts that gameplay drastically.\n\nAt long last: the game is a game now and not just a testroom! All basic gameplay systems are complete, and there're currently 3 bosses spread across 3 biomes.\n\nThe game: https://almyriganhero.itch.io/erma\nThe dev server: https://discord.gg/kmrhFHT8XK", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gh6TtH_7uUs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gh6TtH_7uUs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gh6TtH_7uUs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gh6TtH_7uUs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gh6TtH_7uUs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Erma - Alpha 0.1 trailer", "description": "\"Erma (Early Mammal)\" is a light evolution sim in the vain of games like Spore and EVO Search for Eden.
