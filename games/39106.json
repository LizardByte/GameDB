You play the pan of Fnar Tuck, who must decipher the blood-stained parchment found on the body of the Bishop of Derby. \n \nThe first part of the rhyme on the parchment requests you to gain fire protection by finding werewolves fangs and a scrying glass. Then you must trek through the misty wood until you find the abode of the Witch of Good. Give them to her. and she will give you fire protection in return. \n \nThe second verse tells you that if you find the \"man of solitary means\" he will give you a map. However, this map is hard to decipher, but is meant to help you get safely through the forest \n \nTucky makes his way around the forest, encountering all manner of nasty creatures. They shoot at him and he can fight back by throwing swords and, if he finds them, other weapons. \n \nI like this game very much. It has given me many hours of pleasure. It is easy to get into, yet difficult to get out of. I still don't know how the scoring works. I think it works on tasks done\" like the first pan of Short Circuit. Graphics, although simple and single-colour-ed, are still ample for the game and do not detract from the overall appeal. Sound is just the standard bang-bang.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/curse-of-sherwood"}
