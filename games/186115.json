Throughout the game, you'll be challenged with solving puzzles directly connected to the twisted works and mind of a serial killer. In order to progress you need to put yourself in the killer's shoes, and think like him in order to solve the puzzles. Willingly or not, he wants you to help him finish his magnum opus.\n\nBy exploration, reading, taking notes, finding items and paying attention to the environment, you'll be able to piece together what happened in this eerie house and what the serial killer is trying to achieve with it. The more you dive into the mind of the killer, the more you'll discover things that are better off being hidden away.\n\nSometimes the truth is better left shrouded in ignorance.", "summary": "A first-person atmospheric horror-puzzle game that focuses on the narrative to tie together the gruesome world with creative puzzles.
