A small group of scientists are secretly investigating it when a mysterious woman appears, facing an impossible task.\n\nStars Die is a non-linear, sci-fi mystery game with branching dialogues.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Completely non-linear story. Have long debates with people or ignore them the entire game.\n- Five parallel, but interconnected story lines, each with its own completely separate ending.\n- The player isn't at the center of the narrative. Each character has their own agenda and they will try to act accordingly in real time, with or without you.\n- You can take your time to explore the environments freely, but you might miss events and conversations if you take too long.\n- The choices aren't about moral dilemmas, but ideological ones. It's all about your personal perspective on the events and what you believe in.\n- Dark industrial soundtrack by composer Connor ORT Linning.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stars-die", "videos": [{"id": 37101, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "iuyITSnLDgk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuyITSnLDgk", "title": "Stars Die Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iuyITSnLDgk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
