It is based on a Japanese manga set during a historical Chinese civil war.\n\nSekiryuou (often translated as \"Red Dragon King\") is a traditional Famicom adventure game from Sunsoft, in which the player controls a protagonist via a series of menus in order to solve a series of puzzles. Though Sunsoft is credited as publisher, it is unclear if the game was made in-house or contracted to another developer.\n\nThe game, and the manga it is based on, depict a period of ancient Chinese history between the Qin and Han dynasties, a few decades before the Three Kingdoms era began. As expected of a transitional period, there was plenty of intrigue and conflict leading up to the change of power that future novels and mangas could draw from.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sekiryuu-ou"}
