Birthright, the easiest path, has the ability to use scouting missions to grind experience and money and simpler mission objectives that give greater amounts of experience and money. Revelation is in the middle as the scouting missions are available but the mission objectives are similar to Conquest's. This is ignoring the 3 difficulty settings in-game.\n\n\"Two kingdoms at war \u2013 the peace-loving Hoshido and the glory-seeking Nohr \u2013 It\u2019s up to the player to decide which side to take.
