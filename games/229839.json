While Mushitchi can be found all over the planet, their biggest and safest home is the Mushitchi Forest. Mushitchi hide amongst the leaves, grass, dirt, and under the ground. Due to this, other Tamagotchi wandering in the forest accidentally step on them occasionally. On the Morino Tamagotchi, the user is tasked with caring for a Mushitchi, helping it grow big while avoiding getting injured.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tamagotchi-garden"}
