Thanks to Unlimit Energy, anyone can do whatever they want, provided they gather enough of it. You can go to Brazil! You can smear sunscreen on your liver! You can even shoot frozen yogurt out of your armpits!\n\nThe Powerful Monkey Council is a group of magic monkeys who are perfectly attuned to Unlimit Energy and can easily control it. For this reason they are frequently sought after by evildoers, such as Sticky Funnybone of the skeletal Ribson family. In 2009, the evil skeleton tried to capture the powerful monkey council and make them his perfect power source, but he was stopped by his mortal enemies, the Super Freaks, in their brand new Grand Gyros.\n\nThe year is 2024, and things are as different as they are the same. The Super Freaks grew more powerful, and gained new forms and appearances. Meanwhile, after a time travel incident, Sticky\u2019s hated brother Kranion stepped in and replaced him for a while as the galaxy\u2019s most feared evil skeleton, and the other Ribsons followed suit.\n\nAfter Kranion was forced to seek out Sticky to reluctantly ally with him, the evil skeletons now share equal prominence, which they hate more than anything\u2014but the enemy of my enemy is my friend, after all. While Sticky\u2019s Stronghold was under renovation, he was forced to stay at the Ribson household for the weekend, and put up with his half siblings: Kranion, younger brother Krankenspine, sister Whipeon, and the three headed cousin Geryon. He was also never too fond of his father Marrow Prime\u2019s wife, Karen. And yet, the ever-scheming skeleton knew something useful when he saw it; all of these evil skeletons he was unfortunately related to were some of the strongest beings in the universe. Suddenly, hunting down and capturing the Monkey Council didn\u2019t seem like such a sky-high notion afterall. Against his better judgement, Sticky decided to recruit the entire Ribson clan to do his dirty work.\n\nOf course, if we were to repeat what happened in 2009, it was time for the Super Freaks to head back to the stratosphere. By a funny coincidence, they were just giving their Grand Gyros a new paint job when they noticed the massive skullships darken the skies. The Super Freaks no longer feared Sticky or Kranion, but the whole Ribson family ravaging the galaxy raised their eyebrows. They needed to act fast. Luckily, they had a lot going for them; Scruffy\u2019s training in Brazil gave him white gloves. Gambi finally got that teardrop shaped head! With these new powers, and a whole helping of unwilling participants yoinked from a capsule machine, the Super Freaks were going to rattle some bones.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-freaks-presents-strato-freaks-2", "videos": [{"id": 126013, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-y0vEYYkh4k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y0vEYYkh4k", "title": "Strato Freaks 2 (Demo 3 / Early Alpha Release)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-y0vEYYkh4k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
