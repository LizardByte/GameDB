The original is a golf manga produced by Japanese cartoonist Fujiko Fujio A. The protagonist is often called \"ape\" because he looks like a monkey. In the game version, players have to compete with assassins organized by Shadow Golf in the natural environment. The various nirvana skills that appeared in the original work also have a very gorgeous performance in the game. Using the somatosensory operation of the Wii remote control, players will be able to experience a very realistic feeling of hitting the ball during the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pro-golfer-saru"}
