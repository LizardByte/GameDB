Use the paddle to bounce the ball back into the playfield when it's about to leave the screen.\n\nThe game offers 23 levels to play. The more levels you play, the faster will be the game, but also the more special bricks you encounter (exploding bricks, which destroys adjacent bricks; extra lives; etc.) and the more different background themes you will see.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/breakout-3000"}
