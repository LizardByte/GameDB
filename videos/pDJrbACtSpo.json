(I looooove Stargate)\n\nWhat is \"Stargate Network\"?\n\nStargate Network is an online video game in the universe of Stargate, made by fans for the fans.\n\nStargate Network is based on the simulation and exploration of many worlds from the Stargate universe, reproduced with great realism and attention to details. You will find the planets and spaceships from the series Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and later from Stargate Universe, reproduced with the highest fidelity.\n\nIn the future you\u2019ll be able to create a SG Team and explore planets we\u2019ll build (from the show and fictive ones), you\u2019ll be able to choose your race, weapons, equipment and fight against IA and also real players (PvP / PvE).\n\nGameplay wise, Stargate Network will resemble a Skyrim/Fallout but in multiplayer, with RPG mechanisms similar to a Dark Souls, with co-op, missions, space battles, etc...\n\nThere will be a Main Story, but especially many things to discover, puzzles games, and side quests which will rythm your gaming experience.\n\nThe player will be able to choose what he wants to do: explore, fight, both of them, and many more. You will play the adventure your own way.\n\nFor download and a lot more information on this project, visit the site: https://www.stargate-network.net/en/\n\nEdit: 2 more worlds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52bv77br3G0", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDJrbACtSpo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDJrbACtSpo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDJrbACtSpo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDJrbACtSpo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pDJrbACtSpo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Stargate Network - v4.0 Alpha (PC)(Quicklook)", "description": "These \"Quicklooks\" are mainly recorded for World of Longplays.
