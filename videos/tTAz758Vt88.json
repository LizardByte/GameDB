Haunted by a vision of a child\u2019s murder, you travel to an abandoned hotel resort, which years ago became the stage of an unthinkable tragedy. There you begin your search for difficult answers.\n\nAs a medium with access to both worlds, you have a wider perspective and can see more clearly that there\u2019s no one simple truth to what others perceive. Nothing is what it seems, everything has an other side.\n\nComing Holiday 2020 to PC & Xbox Series X.
