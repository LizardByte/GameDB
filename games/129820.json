One morning you father asks you to meet him at his office. There he asks you to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a Pokemon Master, because he never had the chance when he was younger. You accept and receive your very first Pokemon, and Eevee!\n\nAnd so your adventure begins! On the way you will meet many unique people, and face many challenges including the evil Team Genesis who plan to release Giratina from the Distortion World and use his power for world domination. Of course it's up you you to stop them, you are the protagonist after all.", "summary": "Players begin the game with one Pok\u00e9mon, and can capture more using Pok\u00e9 Balls. They can also use their Pok\u00e9mon to battle other Pok\u00e9mon. When the player encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pok\u00e9mon fight.\n\nDuring battle, the player may use a move, use an item, switch their active Pok\u00e9mon, or flee, although fleeing is not an option in battles against trainers. All Pok\u00e9mon have hit points (HP); when a Pok\u00e9mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived.\n\nIf the player's Pok\u00e9mon defeats the opposing Pok\u00e9mon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pok\u00e9mon evolve into a new species of Pok\u00e9mon when they reach a certain level."}
