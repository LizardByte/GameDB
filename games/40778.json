Not only had a previously unknown (but commercially released) title surfaced but it has also been recognized as the only Canadian developed Atari 2600 game. The group was hoping to capitalize on the video game market that was booming at the time. They had hoped to get the game out for the 1983 Christmas season, but delays in the programming precluded that and the game missed the Christmas window. After it was finally finished in early 1984, Peter remembers taking the game out to retailers door to door to purchase copies of the game. They had no distributor, and by then the video game market had collapsed."}
