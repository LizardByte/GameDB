It is based on the film of the same title. Ports for the Commodore 16 and MSX were developed by Mr. Micro and published in 1987.\n\nAliens: The Computer Game is played from a first-person perspective and is set inside an atmosphere processing plant, a maze complex consisting of 255 rooms.\n\nThe player encounters Alien enemies throughout the game. Upon killing an Alien, the body leaves a deadly pool of acid blood that must be avoided. The player also faces the threat of bio-mechanical growth, which, if left uncontained, results in new Alien eggs and facehugger enemies. The player's ultimate goal is to reach the room that houses the Queen Alien and her nests, both of which must be destroyed. The player can directly control a team of Marine soldiers, or can issue orders to the team from the Mobile Tactical Operations Bay (MTOB). When playing from the MTOB, the player has a view of the team's surroundings via video cameras attached to each soldier's helmet.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aliens-the-computer-game", "collections": [{"id": 3039, "name": "Alien"}]}
