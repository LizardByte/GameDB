The game shares some elements with Tron-like games, but the gameplay mechanics are based on numbers instead. It's easy to learn, but you'll have to plan ahead and be smart to obtain good scores.\n\nThe game may also be played as a two player battle puzzler, where the players try to kill each other by fencing each other in."}
