Turn Pok\u00e9mon back to that ancient form they took up during the chaos.\n\nDuring all of this a child was born of those two... His name was Asher. Around his 5th birthday, the parents decided to divorce, because Jackson, Asher's father,\nfeared what they\u2019ve created, and wanted to shut down the entire project. Asher's mother, on the other hand kept on with it and finished the experiments alone.\n\nJackson couldn\u2019t just let Asher be exposed to such a risky factor and left Siara with his son for good. While he kept looking into Siara\u2019s business from the shadows, he desperately tried protecting Asher from what Siara might bring upon. 11 years later, Asher sets off to his own adventure and enters the Eclipse Tournament in Hupest.
