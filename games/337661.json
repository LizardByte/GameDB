As that pilot, you sign up to work for an astro-mining corporation and embark on high-stakes mining missions, earning commission to fund the survival of your family and friends in a merciless profit-driven world. As your career continues, you'll delve deeper into the corporate underbelly and uncover the harsh realities and ruthless capitalist secrets of the company you work for and their competitors.", "summary": "Hailing from one of the many slum communes of Mars, a young pilot is given a chance as a mining pilot for an upcoming corporation. The chaos of unregulated mining in the outer asteroid belt has our pilot flying dangerous missions to collect precious metals, salvage debris, and explore space in order to earn enough to help their community back home. With fellow pilots, CEOs, rival corporations, and freedom fighters, everyone has their own agenda, but what path will our pilot choose?\n\nExplore over 20 mission locations, discovering their riches and secrets. You'll find, mine, break down, and haul precious resources from asteroids into your cargo, earning commission, but will you use your pay to help your community, yourself, or something more? As you converse with your bosses, colleagues, and rival factions, you'll discover more about the world, but be wary: actions have consequences: what you do, or fail to do, in a mission will dictate future missions and the direction of the story", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aracore-astromining-ventures", "videos": [{"id": 144798, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xN6dJaJauqQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN6dJaJauqQ", "title": "AraCore Astromining Ventures - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xN6dJaJauqQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
