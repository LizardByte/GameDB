Well now you can!\nBullet hell\nAll the bullet are physics based (no hitscan) so you can dodge most of the bullets (with a bit of skill)\nBullet time\nJust somewhat standard slowing down of time. Really helps with dodging bullets and also shooting down enemies while in air. Are you asking why would anyone do that - because it's cool!\nMelee\nBecause sometimes you just want to punch someone in face with mace (or sword or axe).\nDashing\nSkip short distance frontward. Help with platforming. Also good to get out of hard to handle fighting situations.\nBossfights\nMore enjoyable to fight with than your common foe.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-gravity", "videos": [{"id": 41368, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "F-B8YsN0SMY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-B8YsN0SMY", "title": "Project Gravity - announcement trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-B8YsN0SMY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
