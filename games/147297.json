These three men are the only reason the Chernobyl disaster didn\u2019t devastate all of Europe for generations to come, and Liquidators is the only game that lets players experience how each of them managed to contain this nuclear catastrophe. You traverse the radioactive bowels of the blast site, carefully orienting your every step based on the readings of your Geiger counter. Each liquidator has their own set of skills, from stamina to crawling in vents, that gives players a variety of ways to approach the hazardous challenges between them and the valves that will drain excess water destabilizing the reactor core. Whether they all make it out, or more importantly, succeed at all, is in your hands.", "summary": "Chernobyl, USSR, 1986.
