There is a nuclear submarine and Fisher must prevent the takeover.\n\nThe third and final mission, Vselka Submarine, shows that Alekseevich's men have taken control of the submarine and Fisher must access the onboard computers to locate the status of the nuclear warheads.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-mission-pack"}
