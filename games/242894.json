In addition teams of knights in armor must also protect their own base from attacks. Also hindering the player's progress is that there is only a single bomb on the map. The graphics come in hand-drawn form on lined A4 paper, and look like someone has doodled them. There is a two player co-operative game mode available for use on a single Xbox 360 console for 2-player split-screen games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/almost-total-mayhem", "videos": [{"id": 86858, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "nQt38PlL-pY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQt38PlL-pY", "title": "Almost Total Mayhem (1/14/2011)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nQt38PlL-pY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
