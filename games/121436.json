Of course, because it\u2019s SRB2Kart, it has a Sonic twist that really shows the classic charm that a lot of us know and love from the good old days.\n\nWe have 100 jam-packed maps for you to bump, explode, and sparkle your way through, from luscious beaches, to Eggman\u2019s dance floor, to England on a good day. All lovingly crafted by many different people. You\u2019ll notice almost every aspect of the game has an immense love and inspiration from the classic sonic games. From the items such as Ballhog, which literally throws bouncey explodey balls at people, to the maps which are bursting with that Sonic feel.\n\nOf course, you'll only start off with a few cups available, but you can unlock more by playing offline/online matches. Alternatively, you can immediately jump into challenging yourself and race us personally in Staff Attack mode! Don't worry, we'll go easy on you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-robo-blast-2-kart", "videos": [{"id": 29161, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gAqQ68-Cx0w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAqQ68-Cx0w", "title": "SRB2Kart v1.0 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAqQ68-Cx0w/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6171, "name": "Sonic Robo Blast"}]}
