Work is her distraction. While this is not her first time waking up in the early hours slumped over her desk on the top floor, this would certainly be one to remember. Her journey to the ground floor would be interrupted at every level by glimpses of her past, every memory she had tried to suppress, each thought that kept her up at night; a second chance at choices that had left her with nothing but 'what-ifs'.\nFrom every bitter-sweet, tear-jerking blast from the past, to her darkest regrets. Unravel the mystery of Alice's past, find the key to her trauma, and guide her through painful decisions.\nThe only lingering question- who is our mysterious guide through our tour of Alice's highs and lows?", "summary": "Descend into the haunting depths of the human psyche in this horror RPG adventure.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/going-down--1"}
