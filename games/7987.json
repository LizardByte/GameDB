I'm so excited about my new invention - the Gametron 5000 Moneymaker. It pays you money for playing video games - the more you play, the more you make. The first game is... let's see... Robin Hoek of Logwood Forest, where Robin robs from the rich, gives to the poor, and rescues the bea-u-ti-ful Maid Moron from atop yon castle... The next game is Out West, where Three-Fingered Hoek and his faithful sidesaddle, Stimpy the Kid (that's me!) make their way through a dangerous frontier town to find Mr. Horse and... uh... borrow him. And that's not it - heavens, no! The final game is Space Madness. Oh my, Space Commander Hoek has come down with Space Madness, and his spaceship is going to smash into the Earth! Luckily brave Space Cadet Stimpy (that's me again!) is there to save the whole planet! Oh Reeennnn... are you ready to make oodles of money? Money? Don't just stand there, man!
