The campaigns are interwoven, with Decepticon stages leading directly into corresponding Autobot stages. The plot takes place between the eighth and ninth chapters of *War for Cybertron*, expanding on the Decepticons' use of Trypticon, a powerful weapon that threatens the Autobots' evacuation efforts. The Autobots' preparations are interrupted by Trypticon\u2019s devastating orbital blasts, forcing them into action while the Decepticons work to use the weapon against them.\n\nIn the Autobot campaign, Sideswipe leads a search-and-rescue mission after a blast from Trypticon devastates the area. He fights off Decepticon forces to rescue Autobots, eventually saving Ratchet, who has vital information for Optimus Prime. Meanwhile, Bumblebee and Ironhide infiltrate Kaon to steal data on Trypticon. Despite facing heavy Decepticon resistance, they succeed in retrieving the information but are intercepted by Megatron. Ironhide later escapes from captivity and rescues Bumblebee, and the two return to Optimus with the stolen data.\n\nAs the Autobots continue their mission, Air Raid is tasked with shutting down Trypticon\u2019s power supply by navigating dangerous tunnels and fighting off Decepticon forces. After a series of intense battles, Air Raid successfully disables the energy flow to Trypticon. Meanwhile, Bumblebee scouts ahead to protect the Autobots' supply convoy from Decepticon ambushes. His efforts lead to a tense chase and the destruction of Decepticon anti-aircraft weapons, allowing the convoy to proceed. With Trypticon neutralized, the Autobots prepare for their final stand.\n\nIn the final battle, Trypticon\u2019s orbital blasts damage the Autobots' ships, and the massive Decepticon weapon crashes to the surface. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Ironhide fight through Decepticon forces to reach Trypticon, who has transformed into robot mode. After intense combat, including avoiding Trypticon\u2019s powerful energy blasts and missile swarms, Optimus and his team focus their fire on the monster\u2019s vulnerable mouth, eventually bringing it down. Though the threat of Trypticon is over, Optimus knows the war is far from finished, and the Autobots' fight continues.\n\nIn the Decepticon campaign, Megatron takes great pleasure in the destruction caused by his new superweapon, Trypticon. He orders Starscream and Skywarp to finish off any remaining Autobots, though Starscream protests, prompting Megatron to force him to clean up orbital debris instead. As Megatron continues his rampage, he hunts down fleeing Autobots, mercilessly gunning them down. He eventually confronts Ratchet, and after an exchange of insults and blaster fire, Megatron kicks the wounded medic off a high ledge, watching him fall.\n\nStarscream, frustrated with Megatron\u2019s orders, is sent to deal with some orbital debris and later tracks down Autobots in the wreckage. He joins Thundercracker in destroying an asteroid before engaging swarms of Aerialbots and later confronting his old teammate, Jetfire. Megatron scolds Starscream for abandoning his post and for not guarding Trypticon, sending him to deal with the Energon relays while Thundercracker handles a larger cruiser. Starscream\u2019s bitterness grows as he returns to Trypticon after his mission.\n\nSoundwave, accompanied by Barricade, is tasked with defending the Datacore from an Autobot infiltration. While navigating through an overrun highway, Soundwave faces Aerialbots and an Autobot Destroyer. After downloading information from the Datacore and preventing an escape, Soundwave intercepts Autobots Ironhide and Bumblebee, and with a fusion blast from Megatron, eliminates the threat. The mission is a success, and Soundwave is praised for his efficiency.\n\nSkywarp leads a Decepticon assault on Iacon, wiping out Autobots and sabotaging energon relays. He takes pleasure in eliminating enemy forces and providing cover for Thundercracker, who is damaged. After planting explosive charges and targeting weak points in power stations, Skywarp faces off against a series of Destroyers and anti-air defenses before making a dramatic escape from an expanding fireball. Meanwhile, Barricade drives through the highway to Iacon, clearing roadblocks and engaging Autobot guards, ultimately allowing Starscream to take control of the Council Chamber. The Autobots are on the run, and the Decepticons prepare for the next phase of their invasion.", "summary": "Transformers: Cybertron Adventures features separate campaigns for the Autobots and Decepticons, but instead of being a third person shooter like War for Cybertron, this game is a rail shooter, utilizing a gameplay similar to Time Crisis series. Players must defeat a group of enemies in one area from a cover point. After all enemies are defeated, the character will move along a pre-defined path to another area, and so on. Occasionally during gameplay the character will transform into vehicle, and the player must control them to reach one point, destroying obstacles on the way. Offline co-op is also featured. The game delivers only 6 levels and a couple challenges.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/transformers-cybertron-adventures", "videos": [{"id": 142793, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "p0R6-BCUgUo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0R6-BCUgUo", "title": "Transformers: Cybertron Adventures (Wii) - Intro (HQ)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0R6-BCUgUo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 142794, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cfEsraRqRmc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfEsraRqRmc", "title": "Transformers: Cybertron Adventures (Wii) - Playthrough - (1080p, original console) - No Commentary", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cfEsraRqRmc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3197, "name": "Transformers"}, {"id": 8564, "name": "Transformers: War for Cybertron"}]}
