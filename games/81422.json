There are three mission types: Scud Defense, Jet Defense and Tomahawk Offensive. The defense-type missions are reminiscent of Missile Command -- jets and missiles appear on the screen, and the player must defend cities on the ground by directing defensive fire with the mouse. In the Tomahawk Offensive missions, the situation is reversed -- the player is given a target and must hit it by maneuvering a missile around defensive fire, launching it towards the ground as soon as it is lined up with its intended target.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sand-storm", "videos": [{"id": 20331, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "b-3oPgxg2sw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-3oPgxg2sw", "title": "Sand Storm (DOS) - Game Play", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b-3oPgxg2sw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
