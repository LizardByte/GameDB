{"id": "3H1L8Tu8F3I", "snippet": {"title": "Little Runmo The Game \u2013 Teaser Trailer (2023)", "description": "Hello there, as you've probably already seen, Little Runmo THE GAME is finally becoming a thing. This fangame is based on the fictional videogame \"Little Runmo\". It is an amazing animated film made by the animator and composer Gooseworx. Btw. All things that I mention are also in the description below. Anyways, I've been working on this thing for the past few months, the idea came to me a few years back actually,  but recently I just felt like it had to be done. So the game's art style is based on the original but isn't directly hand-drawn,  it is made with a pixel art style and that mostly comes from me not having the experience and time to make a whole game with the tweened animations from the original. Gooseworx is currently doing her own thing and working on the newest project \"THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS\", and while Gooseworx is the original creator of Runmo, I never actually got to contact her about the game so she doesn't even know it exists. I just hope Gooseworx is ok with this project of mine that takes a big chunk from her creations, also my only source of proof of Gooseworx maybe being ok with fangames is some random guy on Reddit that claimed Gooseworx has nothing against fan projects. I just hope she doesn't get big mad about this...  If anybody wants to help in any way they are free to do so, but I am not going to employ anyone, in general, I want to work on this alone so I won't pay professionals for commissions for the game, I will do this without spending a dime, a true solo dev experience you could say, even tho I am not considered a game dev at all since I've actually never released or really finished a game in my life. Alright so this is already a ton of text for just some little(Runmo) information I have right now so here are some fax about the game/development just summarised:\n\n- The game will be only available on Pc (maybe mac)\n\n- I don't want to remake the actual story from the animation since everyone has already seen it, it doesn't make much sense and it would be boring to play through, also it would be the hardest thing ever for me to recreate the whole video.\n\n- The game engine used is Godot, it is free and open source, also the only reason I was able to even start this thing, check it out if interested.\n\n- The controls will be fairly easy and simple but will have some depth to them, moves and abilities will only be the ones that can actually be seen in the original video(excluding the punch). I based the game feel on Super Mario World, Celeste, and Mario Odyssey since they are probably the best platformer games out there and feel amazing.\n\n- This is my first game ever, I've only ever made some template games by following tutorials but I never released them.\n\n- I come from an artistic background, I am learning about the basics of programming for the past 3-5 months, so there won't be any code-heavy things in the game, I am still learning tho, and try to improve every week.\n\n- I am not working on this game full-time since I am a student and have a lot of other things to do, but despite all that, this is still the primary project that I want to work on and actually finish.\n\n- If anybody is interested to share stuff or maybe help, there is a discord link below.\n\nFor now, I can say that the player movement is pretty much 80% done, the game already feels incredibly good to play(in my humble opinion). There are really cool mechanics that aren't directly seen in other games, I think? I forgot if I mentioned this already but I am working on this completely alone so progress toward the final game will be on the slower side, the demo tho will hopefully release during the next 1-2 months. The demo will have you control Runmo in a big playground tutorial-themed level that lets you get a feel for the controls and interact with some mechanics that will be in the final game. The demo will help me improve on what I have right now and make it hopefully more fun for you guys, the gamers\ud83d\ude0e I think that is all that needs to be said for now. Gooseworx if you see this. I love all of your animations and you're one of the best creators this platform has.
