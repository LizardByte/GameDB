Go! Gooble!! is an unofficial endless runner fangame based on the Super Mario series.\n\nEw! A toxic Gooble had made it past a time where Mario cleaned up Isle Delfino and was recently found on the Delfino Plaza. The police unleashed the Fluddroid and tried to make it spray water at the Gooble, which resulted in a wild goose chase through the island!\n\nGo! Go! Gooble!! fits you into the...sludge of the last Gooble in existence, who must survive as long as possible as many dangers try to pop you with gradually increasing difficultly. Choose one out of seven colors for the Gooble, and aim to be the very best in both local and online high score tables!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
