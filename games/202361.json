You play as Katatsuki, a young boy who shut himself in. Like most fangame protagonists, Katatsuki refuses to leave his room and prefers to explore his dreams instead of reality.\n\nPhysicality is a very traditional fangame, so many of its aspects are related to events/locations/themes in the original Yume Nikki. It features bright, childish and colorful themes along with dark, violent and bizarre ones. It has three endings.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/physicality"}
