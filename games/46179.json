These lights desired domination, and so tried to destroy each other, creating a new darkness and a white light in the process. The white light, desiring peace, locked the other lights and the new darkness in crystals, encased itself in a diamond, and created Alpherion.\n\nApprentice magician Saria is summoned by her teacher to consult a fortuneteller. The fortuneteller alerts Saria to dark wizard Gadou's incoming forces by capturing the great wizards of Alpherion. The fortuneteller gives Saria items so she can go and defeat Gadou.", "summary": "Twinkle Tale is a 1992 Sega Mega Drive shoot-'em-up developed by Studio Ducks and published by Wonder Amusement Studio exclusively in Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 73248, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "f55z988wECc"}]}
