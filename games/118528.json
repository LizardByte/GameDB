They both lived together in peace and harmony. The core of their culture and technology was the milk \u2013 they actually found a way to harness infinite and absolutely clean energy from this miraculous substance. The cows which gave the milk were their most important possession.\n\nUnfortunately, there came a time when the Annunaki became greedy and wished all the milk for themselves. This naturally led to a civil conflict between the Landers and the Annunaki \u2013 it was a bloody and terrible war which led to the dying of all the cows. The so precious milk resource was depleted as a result of the war, and there were no more cows to produce it. So the Landers were on the brink of total extinction with no hope of saving their great civilization.\nHowever, the wise and powerful sages of the Landers remembered and ancient prophecy which spoke of a powerful device which was said to be able to generate infinite amounts of milk.\n\nSo the Landers sent their most powerful warrior on a mission to retrieve this device. Traces of it were located on mars, so this was Spiro\u2019s first destination. Time went and passed and the hero of The Landers never came back or sent any kinds of communication back to the people. A decision was made \u2013 the civilization could barely muster its last resources to build a single interstellar ship with a single Lander as the pilot. You are this last pilot, and your ship is the last remaining hope of your civilization.\n\nYour mission \u2013 to locate the device, bring it back and start to rebuild!", "summary": "Moo Lander is a 2.5D platformer with lots of environmental puzzles and resource management. You take control of the Lander and your mission is to locate and obtain enough milk \u2013 the most important resource in the universe. The milk itself is found only on the ancient planet of the mighty alien Cows. You progress through the game levels by going through many hostile creatures \u2013 both flora and fauna, and at the end of each level is a boss battle with a unique Cow. Your ultimate goal is to send enough of milk to save your people.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moo-lander", "videos": [{"id": 47334, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iMOqABN08Ks", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMOqABN08Ks", "title": "Moo Lander Showcase 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iMOqABN08Ks/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47336, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "N8xZtd4CDso", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xZtd4CDso", "title": "Moo Lander Multiplayer Tournament - PAX/EGX 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N8xZtd4CDso/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47356, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5crE73yldXA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5crE73yldXA", "title": "Moo Lander Demo Trailer PAX & EGX ( 2020 )", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5crE73yldXA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47335, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "GX6inCvwpvM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX6inCvwpvM", "title": "Moo Lander Cinematic Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GX6inCvwpvM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
