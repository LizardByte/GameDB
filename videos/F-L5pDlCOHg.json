{"id": "F-L5pDlCOHg", "snippet": {"title": "Dropzone Longplay (C64) [QHD]", "description": "Game Info\n---------------------------------------------------\nDeveloper: Archer Maclean\nPublisher: U.S. Gold\nYear of Release: 1984\n\nGame Review & Impressions\n---------------------------------------------------\nReleased in 1984, Dropzone is the first C64 game released by the late Archer Maclean. Archer sadly passed away on December 17th 2022, and despite releasing comparatively few titles for the system, those he did release were to an incredibly high standard.\n\nLike a lot of other titles, Dropzone is far from an original idea. It borrows heavily from Defender, the classic Eugene Jarvis coin-op, for most of its ideas, but calling it a simple clone does both Archer and the game a disservice. A quick perusal of other games published in 1984 reveal a line-up which, by comparison, were still relatively primitive. Even the first games from combined C64 programming powerhouses Tony Crowther and Jeff Minter were either lacking in playability, or required at least a couple of doses of a fairly potent hallucinogenic substance to really appreciate. Dropzone was pretty much perfect right out of the gate,  benefiting from Defender's solid design principles, but playing to the strengths of the Commodore 64 itself.\n\nThe game's objective is to simply set as high a score as possible, which requires the player to rescue a series of space-faring scientists -- blue, rotating things trundling across the planet's surface -- from a plethora of alien invaders which spawn into existence at the start of each round. Saving a scientist requires the player to fly into them, attaching the scientist's pod to the player's jetpack, then taking them to the near-by moon-base. Only a single a scientist can be carried at once, and the aliens will start to target the remaining egg-heads while you have your hands full. They'll try to assassinate the poor guys with android units, either by dropping them on to the planet surface or, more irritatingly, dropping them on to the rescue pad of the moon-base and allowing them to destroy a scientist you'd previously rescued. The round ends only when all scientists are either rescued or destroyed, and all invaders have been dealt with.\n\nIn terms of armaments, your jetpack comes equipped with a laser blaster with auto-fire for shooting down enemy craft, smart bombs for clearing out all enemies on screen, plus a cloaking device which grants invulnerability for a short duration. The points you earn will replenish these items, plus award bonus lives at regular intervals; these are great features which offset the game's difficulty and, with practice, seasoned players should be able to rack up some impressive scores.\n\nThe reason why Dropzone remains a C64 classic is due to the fact everything is so polished. It feels like a lot of time and effort went into the game, with everything being tuned and refined to perfection. The graphics, scrolling and other technical aspects are equally impressive, and it's easy to see why Zzap!64 awarded the game a coveted Gold Medal in the magazine's third issue. It's one of a select few games which remained relevant throughout the entirety of the C64's commercial lifespan, and it's still a fiendishly addictive experience today.\n\nInformation & Trivia\n---------------------------------------------------\n - Game has no ending\n\nVideo Notes\n---------------------------------------------------\n - Completed 20 waves before ending the game\n\nChapters\n---------------------------------------------------\n00:00 Attract mode\n00:30 Gameplay\n16:51 Wiping out\n21:36 Game over & high score", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-L5pDlCOHg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-L5pDlCOHg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-L5pDlCOHg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-L5pDlCOHg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F-L5pDlCOHg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dropzone Longplay (C64) [QHD]", "description": "Game Info\n---------------------------------------------------\nDeveloper: Archer Maclean\nPublisher: U.S. Gold\nYear of Release: 1984\n\nGame Review & Impressions\n---------------------------------------------------\nReleased in 1984, Dropzone is the first C64 game released by the late Archer Maclean.
