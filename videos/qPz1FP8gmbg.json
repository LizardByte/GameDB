More Lion King content is here!  You all have been asking and asking me to do this.  I had everything ready to give to you guys, just had to keep the anticipation up for a bit before finally presenting them to you.   The games all this week will be on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, after this week, the trilogy of games will finally be complete!\n\nThis Friday, It's the DVD game you've all been waiting for.  Timon & Pumbaa's Virtual Safari 2.0!  This adventure takes us on top of an elephant named Gurdie through the Pride Lands.  As far as Im concerned, this is the last of the Safari series other than that one Aladdin game that mentions Timon as the guide.  Also I think theres only 2 photo endings that go along with the left and right options alone each.\n\n\n0:00 - Intro - The Pachyderm Safari\n0:24 - The Oasis\n1:11 - Riding Atop Gurdie\n1:29 - The Mouse\n2:09 - Tier 1 Left Or Right - Pride Land Plains\n2:26 - Tier 1 Ambiance\n2:41 - Left Option #1: Termite Hill\n3:03 - Right Option #1: Gurdie Flings Dirt\n3:25 - Elephant Jokes Anger Gurtie\n4:20 - Please\n4:47 - Tier 2 Left Or Right - The Boulder\n5:00 - Tier 2 Ambiance\n5:16 - Left Option #2: Wildfire\n5:53 - Right Option #2: Rocky Passage\n6:37 - The Bridge Across The Abyss\n7:20 - Dropped Off In The Jungle\n7:45 - Tier 3 Left Or Right - Vine Paths\n8:12 - Tier 3 Ambiance\n8:27 - Left Option #3: Part 1 - Left Vine\n8:49 - Left Option #3: Part 2 - The Geyser Fields\n9:07 - Left Option #3: Part 3 - A Cameo Appearance\n9:19 - Left Option #3: Part 4 - A Great View Of Africa\n9:53 - Left Option #3: Part 5 - Light Speed\n10:09 - Left Option #3: Part 6 - Grinding Through The Pridelands\n10:23 - Left Option #3: Part 7 - Splashdown\n10:39 - Left Option #3: Ending - Talking Gurtie\n11:16 - Right Option #3: Part 1 - Right Vine\n11:35 - Right Option #3: Part 2 - Hyena Outpost\n11:47 - Right Option #3: Part 3 - A Nod To Mickey\n12:03 - Right Option #3: Part 4 - Pumbaa's Fun Facts\n12:34 - Right Option #3: Part 5 - Light Speed\n12:50 - Right Option #3: Part 6 - Grinding Through The Pridelands\n13:04 - Right Option #3: Part 7 - Splashdown\n13:21 - Right Option #3: Ending - Talking Gurtie\n\n13:57 - Casual Playthrough\n\n25:05 - Pictures From Left Ending\n25:24 - Pictures From Right Ending\n\nJoin My Discord - https://discord.gg/8wGjBtMm\nFollow My Twitter - https://twitter.com/ArbAlec\n\nEven Though the DVD saga for The Lion King is over, The Circle Of Life will forever continue.\n\nHave A Great Day.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPz1FP8gmbg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPz1FP8gmbg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPz1FP8gmbg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPz1FP8gmbg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPz1FP8gmbg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lion King II Simba's Pride: Special Edition - Activity - Timon and Pumbaa: Virtual Safari 2.0", "description": "NEXT - Shark Tale - DWK Game - Fish Eat Fish\nTHEN - Shark Tale - DWK Game - Place Your Bets \nLATER - Chill Out Scooby Doo - Set Top Game - Shangri-La Showdown \n\nAnd we're back ladies and gentlemen!
