As a result, she's often isolated by girls of the same generation. She becomes too focused on others' feelings, and becomes unable to open her mouth. Mio has been told that she \"has a good intuition\", but she's never really paid much attention to those words.\n\nOne evening, she got spirited away during the twilight into the realm of the dead and becomes lost in a secluded country of perpetual night. A world in which beings that are non-existent in the world of the living come and go, Mio meets various \"lives\".\n\nThe young girl was invited into a chinju (Shinto tutelary god) school, in which its attendees protect the world order by hunting down youkai (Japanese ghosts, demons and other supernatural creatures) that disturb the peace within the realm of the dead. Mio then gets embroiled in an incident that shakes up both the world of the living and the realm of the dead.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ouma-ga-toki-kakuriyo-no-enishi", "videos": [{"id": 34601, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "aYYIX94uZ_o"}, {"id": 76726, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "9lLhLu2RaU4"}, {"id": 76727, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "a7uGFH0vjwY"}, {"id": 76728, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aFRHtrmvMA0"}, {"id": 76729, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ASMIyXCYsA0"}, {"id": 76730, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0uUZdUbKcqg"}, {"id": 76731, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CHw3Gue0LhU"}]}
