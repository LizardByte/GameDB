First gnome\u2019s barely arrived, and here\u2019s a second one already!\n\nWithout even asking permission, the entire line grabs your candy one by one and rushes off in all directions. Simple persuasion is unlikely to get them to leave. You need strong defenses and proven tactics!\n\nThese gnomes will do anything to get your candy. Smash them, throw them, zap them \u2013 do whatever it takes!\n\nNah, none of this is fatal. The creatures pouring out of the portals are just soap replicas of the little misers, who want to cram their storehouses full of sweet caramel candies. So they\u2019re taking them from you. Without asking!\n\nWhat a mess! Our hero\u2019s grandfather has gone missing, and a terrible disease spreads across the gnome world. What if this is all connected?
