There are three different weapon systems with a single mega-weapon for each and don\u2019t forget that classic 80s games feature - a giant boss to shoot it out with at the end of each level. Today it\u2019s all about cool retro without the frustrating loading times, so get started and get a friend to join you in a two-player battle against hordes of enemies in Space Blaze.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
