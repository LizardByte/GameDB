To complete a \"deck\", the player must collect all dots (called ports) and go into the teleportation chamber (the rectangles on the map), while dodging pursuits from Questors, which can be destroyed after collecting an energizer port.\n\nThe gameplay was difficult and frustrating, because I had to restart in a new level when I got caught by Questors. Only a perfectly finished level would advance me to the next deck. I only managed to complete 3 decks in this long play. Hope you enjoy the video!\n\nPS: The # of lives is stored at $602E. You can get infinite lives by changing $6A6B from CE to AD.\n\nCredits:\nCover art - www.giantbomb.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CXd7LriN-N8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CXd7LriN-N8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CXd7LriN-N8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CXd7LriN-N8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Spectre longplay w/ cheats (Apple II - Datamost)", "description": "Spectre (https://www.giantbomb.com/spectre/3030-50782/) was an action adventure game published by Datamost in 1982 for the Apple ][.
