You tee up your ball, and drive it 200 yards down the center of the fairway, leaving a 150-yard approach shot. After taking the approach shot, the ball stops rolling 3-feet from the pin. On the green, you sink the relatively easy putt, and you start your round with a birdie. While most golfers never have days like this, they can with HOLE IN ONE GOLF. Get out on three different courses and try to get the lowest score possible. However, the courses are located in rural areas, so you never know when birds, squirrels, or bears will come onto the course and mess with your shots. Try to play the round of your life with HOLE IN ONE GOLF.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hole-in-one-golf"}
