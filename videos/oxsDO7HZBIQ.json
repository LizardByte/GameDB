Scott is supporting us in developing new games, which will be released for free on GameJolt in addition to being sold in the official bundles.

I actually recorded my video \"The Flumpty Canon\" knowing this announcement was coming, in order to retcon Flumpty's once-canonical death and subconsciously prepare people for the possibility of one more game. (Secretly, the \"One Week at Flumpty's 3\" April Fool's Day animation I made was also very subtle, intentional foreshadowing.)\n\nIs this One Week at Flumpty's?\n\u2014 Nope. ONAF3 is a new project that will stay loyal to the short-form structure of the first two games with practically nothing resembling lore. A couple mechanics from the cancelled OWAF plans may be reworked and carried over, though.\n\nIs it being made with Clickteam?\n\u2014 Nope. Although Clickteam is associated with the project, I am developing the game independently with GameMaker Studio.\n\nAre you sure ONAF3 will be finished?\n\u2014 Yes. It probably won't be ready for release anytime in the next few months, for various reasons, but my heart is in it this time around and I hope it shows in the final product.\n(Edit in 2021: In truth, the reason I was sure the game would be finished is because I had already finished it before this video was posted.)\n\nWhat was it like when Scott contacted you?\n\u2014 It still feels like I'm in a dream, ha. I did a double-take when I saw his email address and had to confirm it was the real deal. Funny thing is, when I found the email he sent me, it was in my trash folder. Really made me question my use of automatic email filters.\n\nI think that's all I can say. Don't expect more news on this for a while, but it's been super cool and even overwhelming to see the response so far.
