He deduces that something bad must have befallen the absent Lucan, as his flying machine is primed and ready for a trip. Cornelius decides to undertake the journey his uncle was planning. A raven, soon after introduced as Hermes, accompanies Cornelius from thereon throughout the game; Cornelius decides this must be Lucan's familiar. \n \nCornelius crashes in Avalon, ruining the flying machine. He begins his quest to find his uncle, soon encountering hostile wizards who are none-too-helpful in aiding him. On his journey through Avalon, he meets allies including Twigkindle the brownie king and Percival the knight, the latter of which joins Cornelius in return for his aid in finding the Grail. The two soon acquire the Grail, and eventually reach the castle Joyous Garde, the centre of villainy in Avalon. After an epic battle with the resident baron-wizard Bertilak, Cornelius finds and frees his uncle Lucan, only to confront the game's main antagonist, the Overlord. The Overlord demands Cornelius hand over the Grail, but when Cornelius refuses, the Overlord leaves without a fight. Lucan, who had been kidnapped by the Overlord's minions, reveals that his power is weak in Avalon. After the battle, Cornelius wants nothing more than to return to the mundane world with Lucan, but it is revealed they must find a specific portal to do so, so their quest must continue through a magical gateway into Greece. \n \nArriving in Greece, Cornelius continues to travel looking for a way back home, but encountering yet more hostile wizards and evidence of the Overlord's misdeeds. He stumbles upon Ariadne, angering her by his intrusion into her home, but besting her in combat and forcing her to flee. He eventually arrives in Delphi, defeats the tyrannical wizard that keeps the city in anarchy, and consults the Oracle on the Grail. It is revealed that the Grail grants immortality, and explains why the Overlord demanded it of Cornelius in Avalon. The Oracle also reveals that the Golden Fleece of Colchis must be retrieved for the Grail to work. Cornelius travels to Colchis and defeats the dragon that guards the Fleece, taking it for himself. After killing the ruler of Colchis, King Aeetes, he unwittingly releases the witch Medea who escapes back to the mainland. Cornelius arrives in Sparta to find the city in ruins by the hand of the Overlord. He finds Ariadne and Lucan sheltering from Medea, who turns out to be a servant of the Overlord. Cornelius defeats Medea a second time, and forces her to flee to the Labyrinth in Crete. He soon catches up and defeats her, at the same time finding a magical gateway to Albion beneath the maze. \n \nIn Albion, Cornelius, Ariadne and Lucan encounter Sir Lancelot, loyal knight of the deceased King Arthur. He reveals the Overlord usurped and murdered Arthur, hunting his loyal surviving knights over Albion. Lucan reveals that finding Merlin, Arthur's royal wizard, may be the only way to stop the Overlord. Cornelius arrives in Broceliande, the last known whereabouts of Merlin, to find his tower empty. They continue their quest onto mainland Albion and Salisbury Plain, where Lucan is slain by the Overlord and the remaining protagonists flee. Cornelius continues his quest, gathering Arthur's loyal knights and attacking Camelot, freeing Ariadne and Lancelot and retaking the castle. Cornelius and his allies eventually meet the Overlord at Dinas Emrys, discover that he is Merlin, defeat him, and return to the mundane world.", "summary": "Magic and Mayhem comes from Mythos, the guys famous for the creation of X-Com.
