New and Improved! is out NOW as a free update to the game on Steam.\n\nCheck out this video to learn everything about New and Improved! \n\n---\n\nmyPOPGOES is an official Five Nights at Freddy's spinoff game, releasing as the latest entry in the POPGOES series for the \"10 YEARS\" anniversary event! In this game you play as Bonnie Glade (a central figure in the POPGOES lore) on her 10th birthday, playing with a LCD toy given to her by her father.\n\nMost of myPOPGOES' gameplay is based on a \"survival\" resource management game housed in the toy, where you try to keep a cute and pixelated Popgoes the Weasel alive by giving him food, entertainment, and Dat Taste (the most refreshing drink in the Candy + Popgoes Universe). This game mode is expanded in the Steam release with special challenge modes and rewards. \n\nThis new version of myPOPGOES also includes five totally different game modes like Fishing and Longest Popgoes, each with their own gameplay styles, though they are all nice and simple (and only use three buttons to play!).\n\nmyPOPGOES also features a plethora of unlockables and customisation options, like playable characters, stickers, toy skins, character sheets, and diary entries. It's a cute, casual, colourful, fun collection of games.\n\nAnd it can get a bit creepy too.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's by Scott Cawthon\nPOPGOES by Kane Carter", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3CoYMXJPCO8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3CoYMXJPCO8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3CoYMXJPCO8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3CoYMXJPCO8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "myPOPGOES: New and Improved!
