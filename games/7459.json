Fourteen single-player missions are part of a six-day battle in Southeast Asia, with an enemy AI designed to follow authentic squad tactics in response to your decisions on the battlefield. Issue orders to your fellow soldiers with a context-based command system, while calling for the support of UAV surveillance drones and aerial strikes when needed.\n\nUtilize cover to protect your squad from attacks as you attempt to take out the enemy's defensive positions with explosive devices and heavy munitions. As you progress, you'll be able to expand your offensive arsenal by collecting the weapons from fallen foes. In addition to the single-player campaign, SOCOM 4 also includes competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. Both the PlayStation Move and traditional Dual Shock controllers are supported as well.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/socom-4-u-s-navy-seals"}
