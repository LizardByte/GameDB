The first button causes the character to attack by blowing or spitting(?) something out of its mouth; this can be used to knock enemies back, set of bombs, destroy enemies by knocking them into bombs, etc. The only mode of vertical movement is with ladders. You can also drop bombs with the second button; exactly when is unknown.\n\nA similarly designed mole creature would later appear as the boss of Level 5 in Decap Attack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/calorie-kun-vs-moguranian"}
