New moves, new enemies, new recruits, new environments, and the return of an old foe await, along with the same over-the-top sense of humor and adrenaline-pumping combat of its predecessor. The game will also feature two-player co-op action both locally and online.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 55505, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dOG_DemrIkU"}, {"id": 62384, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "crS8qIvdrCY"}]}
