Every level takes place in a new solar system. The gameplay is largely similar to Scorched Earth and Worms with destructible environments, but with different mass and gravity for each planet that affects every missile. By surviving as long as possible the player earns points and money. There are about 50 different weapons for the space ship and there is an editor to customize all weapons as well. Afterwards these weapons can be shared through e-mail. The game can be played in single-player, head-to-head, over a local network or over the internet. Up to ten players simultaneously are supported.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warheads"}
