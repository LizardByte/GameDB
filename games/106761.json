There is usually only one possible combination which will yield victory in the number of moves given for each level, and it will not be the first one you try, and it is sometimes the last one you would ever think of.\n\nAfter each group of levels, a new type of object will be added to the game, including sliding blocks, button-activated walls and portals.\n\nSwipe to move, and the Discoball will keep rolling until it hits something; and if the Discoball exits the side of the screen it loops back in the other side.\n\nYou can still create your own levels too, but in this free version you cannot upload them or download levels from other players, just create and save them for later, and let your friends or family have a go on them! (on your own device of course) :)\n\nLoopWorlds was originally based on the bonus levels in the Dizzy game Kwik Snax, but it has been greatly expanded upon and is now an epic evolution of it\u2019s predecessor :)", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/loopworlds-free"}
