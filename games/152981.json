This is not the end though \u2013 every item will have its affect on the airplane, by changing its statistics like speed, braking or turn values, but if you don`t like to sacrifice this gorgeous propeller for the more powerful one you can simply turn off the statistics before a match!\n\nYou will have an opportunity to choose between 9 animal characters. Each one of them will have its own special weapon not available for the others. Choose between predators like the shark, the tiger, the lazy lion or the muscular rat. You can also choose some clumsy hippo, crab or crocodile, but this is not everything - we have got you covered with some sleepy tortoise and even the gangsta pig!\n\nEnjoy the game by playing with AI or bring the friends of yours by playing in local multiplayer mode. You can play up to 4 players locally to find out who is the best pilot in your room!\nNot getting enough challenge by playing locally? Try the online multiplayer with up to 8 players fighting for the best pilot title! Show them who is the best!", "summary": "Animal Rivals: Up In The Air is a party game with ridiculous graphics.
