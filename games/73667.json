A bus came to pick them up, and they were on their way.\n\nWhen they arrived, Little Critter tried to set up the beach umbrella, but was lifted up into the air by the strong winds, and his visor fell off. The lifeguard blew his whistle and motioned him to come back down, and Little Critter and the umbrella landed down onto the ground.\n\nHe decided to fly his kite instead, but it accidentally landed onto the mother cow's head.\n\nAfter his kite was a disaster, Little Critter bought hot dogs for himself and Grandma to have for lunch, alongside soft drinks, but he unexpectedly tripped over a ball, and dropped the hot dogs into the sand. So he washed them off with the water (but seawater), before he and Grandma ate them.\n\nAfter lunch, Little Critter found a nice seashell for Grandma on the sand, but there was a crab inside.\n\nAfter escaping from the crab, Little Critter tried to blow up his seahorse floatie, but didn't have enough air. At each attempt, his swimming shorts fell down exposing his frontal furry bottom and his face turned red. When he pulled them up, the air fizzled out of his seahorse. He then landed on the ground with a big thud. Since he did not have enough air, Grandma helped a little.\n\nLittle Critter told his grandma to take him way out in the deep water but not too far.\n\nLittle Critter put on his fins and mask, and showed Grandma how he can snorkel.\n\nLater, Little Critter digs a hole for Grandma, and he covered her up and tickled her toes.\n\nThat evening, Little Critter built a sand castle for Grandma, but a big wave came and washed away the castle. Little Critter became disappointed about his sand castle being ruined and there was nothing he could do about it. He thought about building it again, but it would have been too late to make another one on that day. So therefore, he was forced to give it up. Grandma felt bad for her grandson and noted about Little Critter's sandcastle sympathy. However, she managed to comfort him and said, \"That's what happens to sandcastles\". (That is, as spoken on page 10 read by Little Critter --\"Grandma said, 'That's what happens to sandcastles'\".) She then suggested they build a new one next time. This put a smile on Little Critter's face to which he accepts about making a new one next time (maybe next year's summer or on their next visit to the beach).\n\nLater that night, Grandma and Little Critter went back to the bus. On their way home, Little Critter was very tired, so he fell asleep and told Grandma he would watch for their stop.\n\nThe bus dropped them off at home, and they realized they had a good time at the beach together and Grandma held Little Critter in her arms and they went to bed. (That is, to which Little Critter reads --on the last page-- \"We had a good time at the beach. Just Grandma and me\".)", "summary": "Just Grandma and Me was the very first Living Books PC CD-Rom game from 1992 based on the 1983 book of the same name written by Mercer Mayer.
