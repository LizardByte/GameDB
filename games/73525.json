The main story and most of the gameplay remain the same as in the original version. The remake has updated graphics (especially noticeable is the more \"serious\", realistic style of character graphics, as opposed to the \"super-deformed\" anime style of the original), better event management, alternate scenarios, and more animations. This remake is based on the original console version and therefore does not feature adult content present in the PC releases.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eve-burst-error-plus"}
