It is a port of Kaneko's 1988 arcade shoot-'em-up Heavy Unit. Humans have developed an artificial planet, \"Le Tau,\" which is being attacked by aliens, and only the Heavy Unit transforming ship can stop them. A and C shoot; rapidfire is an option. B drops a bomb, which you have an unlimited supply of but must collect as a powerup. Among the various powerups is one, labeled T, that transforms your ship into a mecha and back, which plays identically, except its bombs will home in on enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heavy-unit-mega-drive-special"}
