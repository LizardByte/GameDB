It contains five stages that are unlocked by finishing first in each race. There are three cars which are unlocked by winning complete rallies. Between the races the car can be set up and enhanced by spending points in three categories: handling, acceleration and top speed. If the car takes damage from collisions during the race it can be repaired at the end of a stage. The game uses simple controls that are limited to accelerating, reversing and steering left and right.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/colin-mcrae-rally-04--1", "videos": [{"id": 84274, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "DYJEhGvxXKA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYJEhGvxXKA", "title": "Colin McRae Rally 04 (J2ME - Java) (8bit) (Codemasters) (Synergenix)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DYJEhGvxXKA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
