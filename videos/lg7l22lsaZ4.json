This video clip will transform you into a robot and puts you in the middle of a cat-centric world of colorful chrome.  \n \nThis was a great little VR music experience. Not as fun as Old Friend but still worth a try. It\u2019s just crazy to shoot rainbow kittens through the air on the beat of the music and also be able to see yourself as a robot is a really strange experience. I would definitely check this title out. In my opinion it\u2019s a bit  too short for 2 bucks tho. So it\u2019s up to you if you wanna get it. \n\nSteamVR: http://store.steampowered.com/app/575420/Chocolate/\nOculus Home: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1810750645607190/\n\n\u25ba Did you like this video?
