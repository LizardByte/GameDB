The powerplant's built in intelligence mentor program, or I.M.P. for short, will help you generate the necessary amount of voltage to fulfill your quota. I.M.P may have developed a little too much of a personality for the powerplant's liking, but don't worry! It's still more than capable of keeping you on track.\n\nIn this game you'll be tasked with using different systems to generate power. Each system works differently and can be upgraded to increase your efficiency. Discover each of the power plant's mechanisms, and uncover the story behind your less than friendly companion.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/instruction"}
