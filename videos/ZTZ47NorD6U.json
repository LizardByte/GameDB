In this #game  you may just have the chance to reboot the grandest experiment ever gone wrong. That experiment? The Universe itself.\n\nYou will find yourself inside an amazing single mechanism, impressive in its scale. Taking control of its silent resident Artificial Intelligence named HAWKING, you will be able to visit many locations filled with a variety of technical devices.\n\nSolve spatial #puzzles change the fundamental laws of physics to activate all the systems of this incredible mechanism and launch a process called TOTAL RELOAD!\n\nGame Features\n\nThe game world of TOTAL RELOAD consists of many locations connected by special devices for fast movement called Quantum Transporters. Each location has different energy sources that you have to combine into a single network with Quantum Transporters. Some energy sources are located in hard-to-reach places, and to get there, you'll have to use wires to temporarily supply power to various objects: moving platforms, sensor grids, energy filters, and closed doors.\n\nIn TOTAL RELOAD you have to learn to \u201cthink with wires,\u201d or in other words, understand that by temporarily supplying power to various objects you can get to previously inaccessible locations.\n\nThe plot of the game will be presented in an unusual way. At the start, you will take control of the body of the main character - an Artificial Intelligence named Hawking, while the #ai mind will function independently and realize that the body is now controlled by someone else. Therefore, Hawking's mind will periodically communicate with you through text comments that will appear on the screen at certain moments. With the help of these comments and wall drawings you will learn the plot of TOTAL RELOAD.\n\nThis is a #story about loneliness and difficult challenges posed to oneself, a story about the search for absolute universal knowledge. In a sense, this is a metaphorical narrative hidden under #science fiction about the game developers themselves, alone trying to complete a difficult task and overcoming various intellectual obstacles. The game will also contain references to the works of real-life personalities, for example, to the songs of the rock band Muse and the book by Robert Heinlein.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2412090/Total_Reload/\n\nhttps://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/total-reload-635f1c?lang=en-US\n\n#indie #indiegame #indiegames #indiedev #gamedev", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTZ47NorD6U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTZ47NorD6U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTZ47NorD6U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTZ47NorD6U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZTZ47NorD6U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Total Reload: Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Ever had something turn out so disastrously that you wished you could just reset and start all over again?
