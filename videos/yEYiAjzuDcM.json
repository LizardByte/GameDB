It is believed that this two-player board game originated as a popular form of recreation with both royalty and peasantry. But by the mid-13th century BC, Senet had evolved into a more religious ritual. Some depictions from this time period forward show the game being played not by two people, but rather as a deceased player competing against an invisible adversary, interpreted by some to symbolize the deceased players own soul.\n\nThe board has become a metaphor for the afterlife with pawns moving across the board just as a soul moves through layers of the netherworld after death. Reaching the final space and leaving the board is the goal of the game, just as reaching Horus and leaving the netherworld was the goal for the Egyptians after their death.\n\nPlayers compete against the game AI, taking turns, as each tries to move their seven pawns across and off the game board, successfully completing their souls journey through the underworld realm of Osiris. Four casting sticks serve as dice, allowing throws between one and five. Although gameplay is fairly straightforward, various rules govern movement of the pawns. As an aid to formulating a winning strategy, the game automatically flashes all the players pawns eligible to move, given the board position and number thrown. Senet is imbued with profound symbolism, and it is not unusual for one side to gain an overwhelming lead, only to lose in the final moments of play.\n\nThe game board consists of 30 squares, arranged in 3 horizontal rows of 10. Pawns move from left to right through row 1, then drop down and move from right to left through row 2. Dropping down again, pawns move from left to right along row 3 and finally, off the board. The game uses the rules developed by Timothy Kendall in his 1978 work, Passing Through the Netherworld :The Meaning and Play of Senet, an Ancient Egyptian Funerary Game.\n\nThe game includes five special squares, governed by their own rules, each containing a hieroglyphic. Square 15 is the House of Rebirth; square 26 is the House of Beauty; square 27 is the House of Water: square 28 is the House of the Three Truths; square 29 is the House of Two Truths; and square 30, the last, is the House of Horus, the Egyptian falcon-god and lord of the sky.\n\nEgyptian Senet is a challenging game that combines luck and strategy, features authentic photos of ancient Egyptian temples, plus artistically crafted graphics and animation of an ancient stone game board and pieces, set in an echoing, tomb-like chamber. Ritualistic music plus sound effects of stone pieces moving recreate the atmosphere of predynastic Egypt.
