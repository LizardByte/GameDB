All resources come from a simulated ecosystem, with thousands of plants and animals simulating 24/7. Work together through the player-run government and economy to build the technology to stop a meteor on a collision course with the planet, without polluting the world and killing it off in the process before that even happens.\n\n\nConstruct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet.\n\nAs your civilization grows, you\u2019ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world. Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands.\n\nDiscord server: http://discord.gg/eco\nFacebook page: https://www.facebook.com/EcoVideoGame\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/EcoGlobalSurvival/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ud_refZuQoA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ud_refZuQoA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ud_refZuQoA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ud_refZuQoA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ud_refZuQoA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Eco Official Trailer", "description": "Get Eco direct from the developers: http://www.strangeloopgames.com/eco/\nGet Eco on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/382310/Eco/\n\nEco is an online game where players must collaborate to build a civilization in a world where everything they do affects the environment.
