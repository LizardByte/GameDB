Well, I can't say I necessarily \"found\" this one recently, as I had known about it for quite some time, but it was brought to my attention that there weren't many videos for it, so I decided to get to work. What's it about? Well, considering that even a relatively uncultural (?) fellow like myself has heard of Les Mis\u00e9rables (Known in Japan as \u3042\u3041 \u7121\u60c5 or Ah Mujou, which is where the play on words \"Arm Joe\" comes from), you probably can say more about this than I can. However, I will say this for those who really want to know.\n\nArm Joe is another game made by Takase using ASCII's Tsukuru series \"Fighter Maker\" engine that is based off of the French \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" musical by Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg, which in turn is based off of Victor Hugo's novel of the same name that originated during the 1860s. Being a very successful musical internationally, it was also popular in Japan, and we all know fighting games are also popular in Japan, so it was only a maaaaatter of time before the two came together. It features generally all the important characters including older \u00c9ponine and Cosette, but given that Japanese touch and super powers. Yay?\n\nThe game features large, nicely animated sprites, countering moves, various specials, and a practice mode, as well as a \"Hyper Mode\" where characters quickly begin to die (and die differently if their health runs out, by coughing blood) but have infinite special power. All the characters apparently have voices except for Marius oddly enough, but I guess that's okay. I just call him the \"strong, silent guy\". It's a free download, so I will put a link to it: \n\nhttp://www.vector.co.jp/download/file/win95/game/fh392218.html\n\nEnjoy.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19ING9kPgEU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19ING9kPgEU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19ING9kPgEU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19ING9kPgEU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19ING9kPgEU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Les Mis\u00e9rables [Arm Joe] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Check out collectibles for popular and obscure series that you know and love at Entertainment Earth!
