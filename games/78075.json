As a prize, he was awarded the title of Barravento Master.\n\nBut a taste of challenge remained in the air. Every ten years, with a maximum delay of one or two years, due to difficulties with the police, a new challenge takes place.\n\nNow it is a challenge that involves all the great masters of capoeira in the country, and that maintains the terrible tradition of leaving only one master alive, who will be the new Barravento.\n\nA new challenge begins and it is up to you to participate, since only the best are accepted. Although being defeated means dying, remember that this is your only chance to become the next Barravento.", "summary": "Barravento: O Mestre da Capoeira is a capoeira fighting game developed by Hitek, where you participate in a life-or-death challenge involving all the great masters of capoeira in Brazil in becoming the next Barravento Master.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barravento-o-mestre-da-capoeira"}
