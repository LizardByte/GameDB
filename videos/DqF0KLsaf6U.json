Players wield classic METAL SLUG weaponry, leveraging skill trees, perks, and a super attack-fueling adrenaline system to outwit and demolish flanks of the series\u2019 signature villains.\n\nPaired with gorgeous pixel art and fluid animation which faithfully channels the series\u2019 timeless aesthetic, Metal Slug Tactics is a natural extension of METAL SLUG\u2019s beloved visuals. Each mission\u2019s heated battle is energized through original music by Tee Lopes (Sonic Mania, League of Legends, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge, and Streets of Rage 4\u2019s Mr. X Nightmare DLC among other titles). Metal Slug Tactics is both a respectful homage to an all-time classic and an imaginative new way to celebrate the renowned series.\n\nMusic by Tee Lopes\n\nTrailer by https://mathematic.tv/\n\n\u00a9SNK CORPORATION ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. \u00a92021 DOTEMU ALL RIGHT RESERVED.
