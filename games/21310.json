The story once again focuses on the war between the kingdoms of Rolandia and Burnstein; as opposed to the first game, the spotlight here is on the latter, as the player takes control of a young knight named Wein Cruz. Dreaming of becoming an Imperial Knight, the highest rank in his country, Wein gradually begins to see that not everything is the way it seems, and has to recount events from his own past, face injustice, and solve moral dilemmas concerning duty and friendship.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/growlanser-ii-the-sense-of-justice", "collections": [{"id": 2302, "name": "Growlanser"}]}
