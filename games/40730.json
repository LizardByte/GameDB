The Atari system maze is deadly, he cannot touch the maze walls, if he does his 02 code will mix with the 2600 code and destroy him!\n\nObjective:\nIncrease your score! Gather Bullets (white dots) to shoot the O2 zombies for 10 points! Gather hidden vitamin tablets (red dash) to slightly protect you against O2 zombies for 1 point! O2 zombies and maze walls may kill you instantly if touched (you may be able to brush by them if you have some resistance given by a vitamin tablet but don't count on it every time)! O2 zombies take bullets out of your inventory when they reach a bullet before you do! They take a point out of your score if they reach a vitamin tablet before you do! You can only carry a maximum of 6 bullets at any one time! O2 zombies are sent back to the Graveyard (the center of the maze) whenever one is hit by a bullet, they will not hurt you when they are blue for a short time after they return to the Graveyard.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/k-dot-c-s-crazy-nightmare"}
