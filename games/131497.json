Officially announced on April 18, 2012, Pok\u00e9mon Tretta was rolled out nationwide in Japan in early July, phasing out the majority of retired Battrio machines. The arcade machines became fully operational on July 14, 2012 with the release of the first set. The machines are also available in Taiwan in Traditional Chinese and in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Hong Kong in English.\n\nLike its predecessor, Pok\u00e9mon Tretta focuses on three-on-three Pok\u00e9mon battles that require special tiles, called Tretta, that depict one of the various Pok\u00e9mon species in order to play. Unlike Battrio however, Tretta incorporates searching and capturing Pok\u00e9mon in various locations. Pok\u00e9mon caught in-game are dispensed for players to use in other battles, or to add to their collection.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-tretta"}
