To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3\u00d73 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3-d-tic-tac-toe", "videos": [{"id": 15463, "name": "VR", "video_id": "cQiKut1p_vc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQiKut1p_vc", "title": "Classic Game Room HD - 3D TIC-TAC-TOE for Atari 2600 review", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cQiKut1p_vc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3008, "name": "Tic-Tac-Toe"}]}
