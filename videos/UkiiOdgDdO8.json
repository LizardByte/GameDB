The footage represents a work in progress and does not reflect the final version of the game.\n\nARTIUS: Pure Imagination is a momentum-based 2D action platformer where players embody four unique artists fighting to preserve creativity in a world on the verge of artistic extinction. Inspired by the high-speed flow of Sonic the Hedgehog, and the expressive chaos of Pizza Tower and ANTONBLAST, ARTIUS brings a fresh take on movement-driven action.\n\nDevelopment is ongoing, and more updates will follow as we move toward release.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://artius.pvicvg.com/\n\n#gamedev #indiegames #platformer #pixelart #sonicthehedgehog #pizzatower", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkiiOdgDdO8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkiiOdgDdO8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkiiOdgDdO8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkiiOdgDdO8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkiiOdgDdO8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ARTIUS: Pure Imagination - Trailer", "description": "\ud83d\udd17WISHLIST NOW: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3599920/ARTIUS_Pure_Imagination/\n\nAn early look at ARTIUS in its pre-alpha stage.
