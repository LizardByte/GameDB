The players have to kill all enemies in each level to complete it. The levels are stationary and the screen will only scroll vertically when the player climbs over the upper platforms. Some enemies move about the level (like dinosaurs, bears and bats) while others are stationary (like spore plants and snowmen). In some levels there are eggs which will spawn enemies regularly until destroyed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tork-and-kral"}
