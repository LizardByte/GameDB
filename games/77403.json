My Goddess). The game follows the story of Keiichi Morisato along with all three goddesses - Belldandy and her two sisters, Urd and Skuld. The four of them won a lottery trip which landed them on an uninhabited island shrouded in mysteries. The trip, however, was a trap devised by Marller and Hildr, which made all three goddesses lose their magic. The good thing is that is is retrievable, and it is somewhere on the island. In this third-person 3D adventure game you explore the island and solve various mechanical puzzles while trying to restore Belldandy's, Urd's and Skuld's magical powers.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
