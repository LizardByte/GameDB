The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War. The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia in order to seize its rich Ragnite deposits.\n\nWhen Imperial forces launch an attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of late Gallian national hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life alongside the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin's adopted sister Isara and using Belgen's prototype tank from the first war, the Edelweiss, they escape to Gallia's capital, Randgriz, and subsequently join the country's militia forces. Welkin is given the rank of lieutenant and assumes command of the newly-formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non-commissioned officer. Initially, members of the squad question Welkin's qualifications due to a lack of combat experience; however, he quickly earns their trust and loyalty with his tactical genius. Welkin and Alicia soon become romantically engaged.", "summary": "Set in a fictitious continent reminiscent of the 1930s, Valkyria Chronicles depicts Europe divided in two and ruled by two super powers: the Empire and the Federation. The Empire has set its sights on invading a small neutral country called Gallia, situated in the middle of the two superpowers territories, in an attempt to secure invaluable natural resources. Within this struggle a hero named Welkin, and his fellow soldiers of the Federation's 7th Platoon, are fighting back against the invasion and the Empires attempts to unify the continent under its power.\n\nDuring the ensuing war the Federation discovers that the Empire possesses a secret weapon, known as the \"Valkyria\" - an ancient race with special powers thought to exist only in legends. With this new discovery the fate of the Federation's ability to turn the tide of the war, and the hope for a better future, hang in the balance.\n\n\u201cCANVAS\u201d graphics engine: A unique engine that produces breath taking images that look like watercolour paintings in motion.\n\n\u201cBLiTZ\u201d tactical battle system: Experience strategic manoeuvring of units combined with conventional RPG gameplay, all layered on top of the moment to moment action afforded by real-time controls as players command each squad member and tank in battle.\n\nEpic storyline: Players will immerse themselves in the epic struggle for freedom, as the fate of the world lies in the hands of Welkin and the members of the 7th platoon.\n\nCustomisation: Over 100 customisable characters allow players to create a variety of platoons to suit each battle\u2019s needs.\n\nBeautifully rendered battlefields: Players explore 30 different environments, using unique terrain features to gain advantages in battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/valkyria-chronicles", "videos": [{"id": 6268, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cpsALQWRSTM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpsALQWRSTM", "title": "\u6226\u5834\u306e\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\u3000\u300c\u50d5\u305f\u3061\u306f\u9283\u3092\u3068\u308b\u300d\u7bc7", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cpsALQWRSTM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
