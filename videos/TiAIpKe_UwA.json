The storyline of Save the Earth takes place two years after Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee. The story involves mankind getting hold of Godzilla's DNA, known in the game as \"G-Cells\". The Vortaak learn of this, once again returning to Earth, controlling a vast army of monsters, including their ultimate weapon: SpaceGodzilla. The player faces down many controlled monsters in different locations. In the climax cut-scene, Godzilla confronts Spacegodzilla in a final duel. Godzilla blasts off Spacegodzilla's shoulder crystals causing a black hole to form. Spacegodzilla is sucked in and apparently killed, forcing the Vortaak to retreat while Godzilla lets out a roar of victory having saved Earth yet again. This time around, new monsters are added as well as more detailed arenas including hills, elevated highways, and waist-deep water. Another addition is Challenge Mode, in which the player must attain goals other than simply defeating their opponent.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TiAIpKe_UwA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TiAIpKe_UwA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TiAIpKe_UwA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TiAIpKe_UwA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Godzilla: Save the Earth (PS2 Gameplay)", "description": "Godzilla: Save the Earth (PS2) - Monsters: Godzilla 2000/Godzilla 90's vs. King Ghidorah/Mecha-King Ghidorah\n\nMuch of the original content was deleted from the game due to time constraints in development.
