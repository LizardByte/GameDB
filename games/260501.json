Proto-slaughter, tight skirmishes, casual combat, and various puzzlery await, all splotched with purple for the eyes to feast on. This is a mix of short void vignettes and extensive gothic/cavernous menageries, so maybe there's something for everyone here.\nThis set is comparable to late Sunlust, Fractured Worlds, and its very inspiration. Difficulty settings have been taken into account, and we've done our best to make HNTR/HMP enjoyable experiences while still being somewhat challenging.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/violetshift"}
