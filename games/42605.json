If you are lucky, you might even score an Ace. If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return. Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do. When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance. This is the real challenge of any tennis game.\n\nThe title was released as \"Great Courts 2\" in France and Germany, while the rest of Europe saw it released as \"Pro Tennis Tour 2\". An Atari Jaguar port was announced in November 1993, but was never released for unknown reasons.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jimmy-connors-pro-tennis-tour", "videos": [{"id": 51678, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "g3nOp1oxsV4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3nOp1oxsV4", "title": "Jimmy Connors Pro Tennis Tour (DOS)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g3nOp1oxsV4/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 51679, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7vMOBQHn6E8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vMOBQHn6E8", "title": "Pro Tennis Tour 2 | Amiga", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7vMOBQHn6E8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
