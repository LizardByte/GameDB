Gamers can select from touring an Asian landscape, camping in the mountains, or spending time on the beach in a tropical location. Players getting ready for vacation can call up their travel agent and book either a pricier hotel or more budget-friendly accommodation for their family. Rich Sims can skip the agent and just purchase a house in their vacation spot of choice. Once the trip begins, characters can climb ancient ruins, participate in The Lumberjack Games, and make friends with fire dancers (or Bigfoot!) to learn new social interactions and unlock new achievements. Each of the skills players learn can be shared with friends back home. Additionally, searching each area can reveal rare jewelry and artifacts which can be used to decorate the home or offered as presents.\n\nEvery Sim needs a little rest and relaxation from time to time. Escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life by visiting far off locales and going on tours (complete with cards that help randomize the trip), lounging on the beach, roughing it in the middle of the forest on a camp-out, and much more - either alone or as part of a group.\n\nAfter all, who doesn\u2019t feel great after a nice, relaxing vacation?", "summary": "Whisk Sims away from their everyday routines and take them on exciting trips to three exotic locations in The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, the sixth expansion pack for The Sims 2! Whether relaxing on a lush tropical island in a luxury suite, camping with the family on a pristine mountaintop, or exploring the culture of the Far East, Sims will engage in new activities and experiences as they relax and rejuvenate. Transform them from bumbling tourists to savvy international travelers as they learn new customs including local greetings, dances and more to take home and teach to their friends.
