Some of the surprises that the player finds includes a movie theater that is always closed, the opportunity to play the role of a temporary school teacher, and having portraits of unique non-player characters that show up while talking to them.\n\nInspired by the stories of Kenji Miyazawa, the story covers nine chapters and surreal environments.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ihatovo-monogatari", "videos": [{"id": 36855, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "WDiy9mPImDE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDiy9mPImDE", "title": "SNES Ihatovo Monogatari", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WDiy9mPImDE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
