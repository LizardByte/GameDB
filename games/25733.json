He tells Morkin about the time when the land was green and full of life, but it was suddenly plunged into an eternal winter, bringing famine and war. Luxor reveals how Doomdark, once a wise advisor, became a tyrant by seizing power through fear, sorcery, and violence. Doomdark now draws his strength from the winter itself, and during the Solstice, he will unleash his full power against the Free people. That is why they have to hurry, because th solstice approaching fast.\n\nAt the Tower of the Moon, where Luxor, Rorthron and their allies discuss the looming threat of Doomdark, his military preparations, and the possibility of striking at his stronghold, Ushgarak. Despite the overwhelming odds, Rorthron emphasizes that they must not give in to fear and despair, for even Doomdark, once flesh and blood, can be defeated.\n\nLuxor is revealed to be the heir to the House of the Moon, the Moonprince, and is given the powerful Moon Ring. This ring grants Luxor the ability to command and see through the eyes of his followers, as well as spread hope to resist Doomdark\u2019s fear. The plan is to rally the Free peoples, strike at Doomdark\u2019s forces, and possibly attempt to destroy the Ice Crown, the source of Doomdark\u2019s power which is kept in the Tower of Doom.\n\nIt is Morkin, Luxor's adopted son, who is the one destined to resist Doomdark\u2019s ice-fear and must undertake a dangerous mission to the Tower of Doom. The revelation of Morkin\u2019s true lineage, half-Fey and half-human, makes him the only one capable of enduring the Witchking's ice-fear. Despite the risks, Morkin volunteers to go on the perilous quest to destroy the Ice Crown, knowing it is crucial for the fate of Midnight.\n\nAs dawn breaks over the lands of Midnight, the sun is weak and a cold mist spreads from the north, signaling the approach of Doomdark's ice-fear. Luxor the Moonprince, accompanied by Morkin and Corleth, set out on their respective missions: Luxor sends Corleth to gather the Fey for battle, while Morkin journey to the Tower of Doom. Luxor then heads toward Corelay, rallying the Free people with a call to arms. His cry of defiance against Doomdark spreads hope, and the ice-fear retreats, but the Witchking Doomdark senses the presence of the Moonprince.
