In Alter Ego, you can find out. In this text-based interactive fiction, you choose what happens next. It's in the style of choose-a-path books, but with over a thousand multiple-choice questions, it's much longer and deeper than traditional gamebooks. Alter Ego starts at birth and ends at death, including two substantially different versions, depending on whether you choose to be male or female.\n\nWill you grow up to be confident and happy? Will you fight with bullies, or befriend them? Will you find a date to the senior prom? Will you marry and have kids, or start your own business and become a millionaire? The choice is yours. If you enjoy interactive novels, you'll love Alter Ego. This game will change your life. (official Text) \n\nDeveloper's Comment: \"Alter Ego was originally written by Peter J.
