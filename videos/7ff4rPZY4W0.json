This is a walkthrough for a NickArcade game which was made in (or at least, copyrighted) 2004 and was available online on Nick.com . I actually didn't really watch this show (YTV surely aired it but I just haden't seen it,) but this game is actually pretty fun once you learn how to play it. The graphics have also held up surprisingly well - I've forced the game to use OpenGL for your viewing pleasure. If I had one complaint, the audio mixing is pretty poor.
