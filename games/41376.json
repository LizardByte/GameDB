Most are based around gambling.\n\nSOFEL's Gokuraku Yuugi: Game Tengoku (\"Paradise Play: Game Heaven\" - no relation to Rhythm Heaven) is a mini-game collection that provides eight different types of game framed as different stations on a TV.\n\nThe games are variations on:\n\nBingo\nRoulette\nDice\nSlots\nBlackjack\nPoker\nConcentration (a.k.a. Memory or Pairs)\nSpeed (a.k.a. Spit)\n\nThe Bingo and Dice games have no scoring system in-game; rather, they are simulations of a randomization process that players can use with their own physical scoring systems at home (such as bingo cards or Yahtzee/Dice Poker sheets).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gokuraku-yuugi-game-tengoku"}
