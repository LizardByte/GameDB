Driven by conquest, a race more advanced than Humans - and far more brutal - has waged a war against all sentient beings. They will destroy anything in their path, as they have done for thousands of years. The OVERLORDS, a bloodthirsty race bent on power and destruction, have annihilated every inhabited planet in their wake. Sidrial, one of the last planets standing, is the last outpost between Earth and the Overlords. With most of Sidrial destroyed, a new breed has risen to fight back against the tyrants. As the Sidrilian Rebel Forces fight back and struggle to join with others against the OVERLORDS, new alliances will be forged and the future of entire galaxies will depend on their success.\n\nIn Sidrial, you make your escape from some sort of prison that seems to be devoid of life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 81638, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iYSTps-8TB0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYSTps-8TB0", "title": "Sidrial w/ 3D spatial sound in ioquake3 \ud83c\udfa7 (OpenAL Soft HRTF audio) Vaporware Quake 3 TC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYSTps-8TB0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 81639, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AEBGREP7M0o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEBGREP7M0o", "title": "Quake 3 Arena-Sidrial Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AEBGREP7M0o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
