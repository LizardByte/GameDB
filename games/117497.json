This game is about soviet partisans and their activity during World war II. It\u2019s focused on harsh reality in those times, when many people became reluctant heroes, and every feat required its price, and sometimes this price was extremely high.\n\nThe game shows the war from a new, poorly explored angle. However, it is not a historical simulator, Partisans offers a unique interpretation of those times\u2019 events. The game shows partisans\u2019 everyday life, which is full of cold, hunger and wounds. Still there is a room for joy as well. Players would have to make tough choices, for example, they\u2019ll have to decide whether to help civilians and betray their position or to walk past and stay unnoticed. The game give opportunities to prove oneself in a fight, to overcome the superior forces of the enemy using cunning and mother wit , and to leave the field when the situation is really bad.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/partisans-1941", "videos": [{"id": 26590, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "IEHsHJ9a4p8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEHsHJ9a4p8", "title": "Partisans 1941: Gameplay Video - With ENG subtitles", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEHsHJ9a4p8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
