Red death rains like blood. Monsters from beyond lurk in the shadows, spawning their evil offspring. Fight them with light and fire, find a sanctuary. Survive this unholy night.\n\nThe controls guide the player character, and a flashlight that illuminates the ground ahead. Press fire to use the gun. Gunfire will only strike an illuminated spot, or at close point-black range near the player character. If you let the monsters or their firepower hit the player character you will lose a life.
