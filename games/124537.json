Aided by a ragtag group of volunteer soldiers-of-fortune and a small loyal following, he aims to establish his kingdom once more. When reason and diplomacy with the outcast deity fail, the Aesir god Loki prepares to make a final bid to halt the ambitions of the heretic. What will become of the world should he be unable to succeed?\n\nYou are Blitz Ymir, a disconnected servant to the Aesir. The god Loki has offered you a limited freedom if only you were to complete a simple task in his name. When past obligations become personal choice, will you choose to live a menial life or continue to take up the sword in the name of the gods?", "summary": "Balmung Cycle Part I: The Messenger and the Heretic is a free RPG Maker game developed by Magi, inspired by Norse mythology.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/balmung-cycle-part-i-the-messenger-and-the-heretic", "videos": [{"id": 143972, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "sxJEPKhh7yI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxJEPKhh7yI", "title": "The RMN Catalogue #00471 - Balmung Cycle Part 1: The Messenger and the Heretic", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sxJEPKhh7yI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
