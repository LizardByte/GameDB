The group was active during the seventies, particularly in the disco/pop music.\n\nThe game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/singstar-abba", "collections": [{"id": 592, "name": "SingStar"}]}
