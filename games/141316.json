Alone. At night. Sound scary? Don\u2019t worry, the paintings are of cute dogs! But maybe DO worry because they\u2019re also haunted\u2026\n\nCollect the keys to make it through each exhibit, but make sure to keep an eye on the artwork: the paintings like to move around. Ghost dogs will also pop off their canvases when you\u2019re not looking to give you a big ol\u2019 lick.\n\nThese dogs ain\u2019t your grandpa\u2019s poker playing kitsch - they\u2019re works from the greats, from renaissance classics like \u201cPup With A Tasty Bone\u201d and Paw Vinci\u2019s \u201cThe Doggo Lisa\u201d to modern masterpieces like \u201cAmerican Dogthic\u201d, \u201cThe Howl\u201d, Pawcasso\u2019s \u201cPup Before A Mirror\u201d - this gallery has something for everyone!
