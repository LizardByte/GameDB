Discover mysterious tomes, written in different race's native tongue. These can be transcribed at various portals around the island. Holding the items in your hand when near the portal will cause them to 'react', meaning a tome can be transcribed after a few seconds when opened. Learn various spells, and summon legendary Guardians to aide you in Battle. Seek out the epic weapons of fallen Heroes once lost to the Island. You will need Guardians to take down the 4 big bosses you learn of from the notes in the Prison cells beneath the island.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/draconic-order-vr"}
