A place for peasants to relax, travelers to rest and heroes to plan their next daring adventure. But what of the unsung heroes of it all - the tavern keepers?", "summary": "In Tavern Keeper you manage a tavern, building, bartering, cooking and cleaning your way to success in a humorous fantasy world. Starting out with a shell of a tavern in the backwaters of the kingdom, you build rooms, place items, stock the larder and hire staff to satisfy the demands of the oddball locals and misfit heroes that stumble through your door. Run your business well and you'll progress to larger taverns with more demanding patrons where you'll need to expand your offerings to include new meals, drinks, rooms and services.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tavern-keeper"}
