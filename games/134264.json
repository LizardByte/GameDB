Lay a star tile on any open space.\n2. A single gray star on every tile in play will be charged.\n3. Any star tile that has all its stars charged will be ready to explode (i.e. sent back to the night sky). Exploding a star tile will charge all adjacent tiles by 1. Chaining exploding tiles will increase the multiplier as well.\n4. Play continues until all tiles have been placed -- sunrise!\n\nScoring\n\n* Every charged star is worth 1 point.\n* Every exploded tile is worth the number of stars on it x the current multiplier."}
