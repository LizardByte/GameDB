Airplanes on fire, commuter aircraft low on fuel, mid-air collisions, emergency rescues, and military exercises all need your immediate attention. Manage your world in \u201cGod Mode\u201d as you tower over large metropolitan airports, tropical islands, and towering cities. Path your aircraft to safety, avoiding air traffic, fierce thunderstorms, and perilous landscapes. Get those planes refueled, repaired, and back in the air as fast as possible. You will need nerves of steel as you zoom down to \u201cToy Mode\u201d to fight raging aircraft fires, man the guns and missiles of the battleship, and the worst task of all\u2026Luggage sorting. But don\u2019t waste any time, the skies are full of emergencies that only you can manage. Did we mention the Alien Invasion? Welcome to Final Approach.\n\nRoom-Scale VR: Never before has a game used the full capability and power of Room Scale Virtual Space! The sky is full of aircraft of every shape and size, from F16s to Blackhawk Helicopters, WW2 Spitfires and barnstorming bi-wings. We even threw in predator drones and stealth bombers for free!\n\nFinal Approach gives you complete control of the skies around the airports and islands as you tower over the world in what we call \u201cGod Mode\u201d. Using the HTC Vive or Oculus Touch motion controllers, reach up and grab an aircraft, drawing paths from one side of the room to the other to get the aircraft to their designated runways. In addition to managing the aircraft, the player can use zoom points throughout the game to get up close and personal with various aspects of the terrain. Scale down to real world scale, where you can fight roaring fires with water hoses, interact the guns and missile launchers of battleships, sort luggage, scare of seagulls with air horns and solve puzzles required by the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-approach"}
