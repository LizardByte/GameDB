Fans of the original game will notice new features and gameplay improvements, including new melee animations, the ability to check your watch and ammo supplies on the fly, and new full-body player animations.\n\nAnd those who favoured the more survival-horror oriented gameplay of the cult prequel \u2018Metro 2033\u2019 will find a new way to experience the campaign thanks to the introduction of two unique Play Styles \u2013 Survival and Spartan. The former transforms Last light from a more action-oriented stealth combat experience to a fraught, slow burn fight for survival.
