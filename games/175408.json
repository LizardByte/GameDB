The patterns are made of colored circles, and the object is to place identically-colored \u201cpins\u201d from the bank on those circles by touching the pin of the correct color and then touching the grid location where they want it. It requires very simple motor skills, yet engages the mind and the brain in several ways.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
