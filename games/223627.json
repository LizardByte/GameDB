{"id": 223627, "name": "Dummy Defense", "slug": "dummy-defense", "summary": "The spin-off of SimplePhysics. Protect your dummy from explosions, boulders, spiked walls, and more!\nUse the blueprints editor to design a structure that will protect your dummy, Melvin, from some random danger. You'll have to work with the available materials. Most of the time you'll use wood, sometimes you'll use concrete, but you must always use your most important asset: your brain.\nA wise person once said: \"An engineer is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar.\" In Dummy Defense, your design must not only be strong enough, it must be cheap enough to win. Building cheaper structures will earn you more stars on a level.\nCreate your design in seconds with the blueprints editor. If you make a mistake, simply tap the Undo button. Zoom in and out by pinching the screen and pan the view using a two finger drag.\nWhile testing, you can see how the strain is distributed across your design. Areas that are under immense strain are colored bright red, while other areas are colored green. This allows you to find and fix problem areas in your design.\nThe slow motion slider lets you slow things down so you can see how your design is failing, and it is also incredibly fun to watch explosions destroying your design in slow motion.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dummy-defense"}
