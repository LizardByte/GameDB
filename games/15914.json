The all mighty protein powder has been stolen, so it's up to Tony and his muscle-bound crew to catch the thieves. Choose from a variety of perfectly molded superstars and bring these terrible villains to justice. As the thieves attempt escape, they will smash through walls while making a variety of poses. You must match these poses to fit through the holes and catch up to the thieves. The protein powder will be yours again! Flex your muscles by yourself or with up to three friends in turn-based macho excitement. Posing for a few minutes not enough? Enjoy Endless Rush mode until your muscles bulge and explode! Muscle March will also be the first WiiWare title to offer a polar bear in tight swimwear!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 10571, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Zd-5UYmmDsk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd-5UYmmDsk", "title": "MUSCLE MARCH Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zd-5UYmmDsk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 10572, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "T8BcndMxu44", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8BcndMxu44", "title": "Muscle March debut trailer [HQ]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8BcndMxu44/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
