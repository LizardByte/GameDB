You work for Timmy Thom's Fast Sandwiches and tonight your job is to deliver sandwiches from 4pm to 11pm. Your next stop is an interesting location. It is some sort of crime research facility where evidence from crime scenes around town is processed and stored.\n\nWhat you didn\u2019t know, was that three very strange dolls were recently brought there for processing and storage. These dolls aren\u2019t ordinary; they have a mind of their own. Your night is about to take a turn for the worse, and it will be one of the strangest and scariest nights of your life.\n\nEmily Wants to Play Too is a survival horror game about a sandwich delivery guy that gets locked inside an evidence processing and storage office building by living dolls. The dolls have \"work\" to do here and are gathering new friends. They didn\u2019t expect you to show up, so don\u2019t get in their way. Throughout the night you will be looking for an exit out of the office. At some point, Emily will join in on the fun, along with the dolls\u2019 new \u201cfriends\u201d. You better play their games or else!
