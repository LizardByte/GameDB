The fps is like 3-4 (not the mouse cursor). I could pump more juice into the Amiga to speed it all up, but then the dialogues would speed up as well and not last long enough to be read. But, at this default speed, the walking speed is pretty accurate to real life anyway.\n\nEverything can be controlled from the keyboard if wanted. You can move by either clicking on the ground to spawn an arrow to where you will move, or clicking the arrows with the mouse, or just use the aszx keys. I chose to use the aszx keys for most of the game. The rest I use the mouse for so you can more easily see what I'm doing.\n\nIF you wait long enough, Robin can sort of get on with his life on his own, which often was annoying as he all of a sudden decided to walk/run to this and that place. It was often I didn't even have to wait, he just started to do his own thing while I was already busy with him doing something else.\n\nI could only find one longplay of this game on YouTube, and that dude did it the goodie two-shoes way (IMO) as he didn't kill that many guards, only cared about winning the game when he had almost maximum heroism (a few pixels off max, and the bar can't be filled all the way anyway) and of course showing as much as possible of the game. It's a good longplay, that I improve upon. As the game can be played however you want and all you need to do to win the game is to have at least 50% heroism when you take over the castle, you don't need to kill the dragon or recruit any of the Merry Men, and other stuff.\n\nI decided to play a more mean and reckless Robin Hood, killing a bunch of guards, not always having my men on missions to gather gold so I can't give it to the poor. I even shot the Sheriff in the BACK.\n\nSome of the things I settled for:\n\n* Rescuing Will Scarlet so I got him and his horn.\n* Befriending Little John.\n* The ring from Maid Marian.\n* The monk robes from Friar Tuck.\n* The crystal ball from Aelfston\n* The dragon's \"fire\" skill.\n* The feather from the swan.\n* Killing the dragon.\n* Very short archery practice.\n* And get just enough heroism to win the game.\n\nSome things I forgot to show, and other things I just didn't want to include in this longplay can be seen in the \"extras\" video here: https://youtu.be/zAdQTaNJLd8 (showing the ring, death by the dragon, part of the church/monastery being built, picking up and using the toadstool/mushroom, cheats, and more.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:59 - Game starts\n46:17 - Killing the Sheriff and taking over the castle\n50:32 - Alternative ending", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nfirIeZmNc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nfirIeZmNc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nfirIeZmNc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nfirIeZmNc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4nfirIeZmNc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay [136] The Adventures of Robin Hood", "description": "\u25ba Subscribe: http://tinyurl.com/iamironclawsub\n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/IronclawFTW\n\u2665 Please comment, rate, share, subscribe... ;)\n\nGame release year: 1991\n\nA good game, but seems to run slow (due to the low frame count in the animations) and the controls are a bit unresponsive.
