Each of the 8 playable units in this hack has 1 base HP and 0 base everything else. To compensate for this, additional restrictions are in place. Everything is locked at 100% hit, and growths are fixed. Weapons have had to be slightly altered to fit in with this style.\n\nFE4\u2019s ring system is present in this hack, but the rings present all have explicit downsides, giving them more strategic use. P-Down, D-Up may help you take a hit despite your abysmal stats, but your damage output takes a heavy blow. Ring bonuses also stack.\n\nThanks to the hack\u2019s short nature, you can use weaker versions of Filia\u2019s Might and Nini\u2019s Grace wherever they may help you, without fear of needing them later.\n\nThese two mechanics alone lead to very CQ-esque statstacking.\n\nThis hack consists of 5 relatively short maps, each with a unique look and song. Enjoy the game\u2019s gradual shift from puzzle to traditional FE as your options expand."}
