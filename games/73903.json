His father was a famous explorer and adventurer, but he died after a mysterious accident during one of his journeys to Tibet. One day, Yakumo meets a girl who calls herself Pai. She tells him that she belongs to an ancient powerful race of immortals, called the sanzhiyan, the three-eyed ones. It appears that Yakumo's father worked together with Pai, and that Pai's biggest wish is to become a normal human again. Since then, Yakumo and Pai work together, but they must be aware of other sanzhiyan - powerful demons with their own evil plans.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3x3-eyes-kyuusei-koushu"}
