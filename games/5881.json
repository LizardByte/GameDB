To gain the 3-D effect, some detail gets sacrificed. Usually this is no problem, but occasionally you'll have a tough time recognizing an object. You move from area to area to engage a new group of enemies. You'll conveniently find crates for cover and barrels to help you pull off big explosions. Locking the enemy in your crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red, doesn't guarantee a direct hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice. A shotgun will normally provide a kill on the first shot. If you have an automatic rifle, your shots are relatively inaccurate even if your aim is true.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kill-dot-switch", "videos": [{"id": 4332, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "M8HCJkip138", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8HCJkip138", "title": "kill.Switch PS2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M8HCJkip138/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
