Their intentions are presumed hostile.\nOne last defensive position stands between the aliens and Earth. This base is situated on the moon, just to the south of the Sea of Tranquility.\nThe lunar base is under partial computer control but the actual task of destroying the alien ships is your responsibility.", "summary": "Ciphoid 9 has been designed to exploit the graphic capabilities of the Commodore 64 to the full. All scenes are in hi-resolution multi-colour graphics and particular attention has been paid to perspective and visual effects to make ciphoid 9 the most realistic 3-dimensional space game yet.\nYou will see the hi-res screens scrolling to show different sectors of the lunar base. The alien fighters execute complicated flight paths as they try to evade your phaser bolts. You will see the ships phasers and nuclear shells get larger, as they hurtle towards you, just as they would in real life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ciphoid-9", "videos": [{"id": 139336, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fJxmZs-2QT8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJxmZs-2QT8", "title": "C64 Longplay [1219] Ciphoid 9", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fJxmZs-2QT8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
