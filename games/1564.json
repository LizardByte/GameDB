For the next 25 years, he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the \"Evil Seed\", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake.\n\nThree years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them, three sacred weapons join once again.", "summary": "SoulCalibur is a weapon-based 3D fighting game developed by Project Soul and produced by Namco. It is the second game in the Soul series, preceded by Soul Edge (1996). Originally released in arcades in 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware. In 1999 it was ported to the Dreamcast with improved graphics and new features. The North American version was released in September 1999 as a launch title for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console. It became available as a downloadable title on Xbox 360's Xbox Live Marketplace in 2008.\nThe title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system. Soulcalibur is widely regarded as one of the best Dreamcast titles and is one of the most critically acclaimed fighting games of all time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soulcalibur", "videos": [{"id": 3094, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "iXDL0lm8diQ"}], "characters": [{"id": 11127, "name": "Ivy"}, {"id": 11126, "name": "Nightmare"}, {"id": 11129, "name": "Yoshimitsu"}, {"id": 11131, "name": "Rock"}, {"id": 11130, "name": "Siegfried"}, {"id": 11122, "name": "Maxi"}, {"id": 11120, "name": "Kilik"}, {"id": 11121, "name": "Xianghua"}, {"id": 11132, "name": "Seung Mina"}, {"id": 11123, "name": "Mitsurugi"}, {"id": 11134, "name": "Edge Master"}, {"id": 11125, "name": "Sophitia"}, {"id": 8511, "name": "Astaroth"}, {"id": 11128, "name": "Hwang"}, {"id": 11124, "name": "Taki"}, {"id": 11133, "name": "Cervantes"}, {"id": 3311, "name": "Narration"}]}
