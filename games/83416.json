Your driver, a farmer, wants to help you, and his personal memories and recollections provide an unexpected window into your own backstory.\n\nSo far, so good\u2026 until a chance slip-up exposes a pattern of deception, secret correspondences and cruel design. From there, the road is full of surprising turns that will challenge every assumption you\u2019ve made along the way. To complete your journey, you\u2019ll need to choose your friends wisely\u2014 never knowing if your worst enemy is your own subconscious mind.

As a hitchhiker with no memory or destination, you catch a series of rides across a strange and beautiful landscape, tracking the mysterious disappearance of a person close to you. Your drivers range from stoic farmers to off-duty waitresses, and each one has a story to tell. Clues appear, alliances emerge, and nothing is quite what it seems.\n\nAs your journey continues, you must decode the events of your past while confronting the dangers that lie ahead.
