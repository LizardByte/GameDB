The races take place in some of the world\u2019s most beautiful winter settings, including the Canadian Rockies, Minnesota Lake, Iowa Farmland, Maine Forest, Yellowstone Park, Scottish Highlands, German Village, and Japanese Field.\n\nVaried terrain elements present challenges and opportunities, including Moguls, Ice, Mud, and Turns. How you take a turn, or whether you choose to ski over the moguls or choose a landlocked course around them, are all bits of strategy that can move you to the front of the pack, or send you to last place depending on your skill.\n\nYou can either compete in the official \u201cRace\u201d mode, or enter the \u201cPractice\u201d mode which lets you improve your skills on any of the eight different tracks.\n\nGame controls are all keyboard based. Up Arrow to accelerate, Right Arrow to turn to the right, Left Arrow to turn to the left. Brake or Stop just by lifting your finger off the accelerator key. Options are available to modify your point of view (3rd person far, 3rd person close-up, and 1st person), resolution (up to 640x480), and level of detail (low, medium, or high). You can also toggle on/off the digital statistics (time, lap indicator, and speed) on the HUD."}
