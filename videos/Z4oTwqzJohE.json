This monitor allowed you to interact with the fish in a lot of ways: such as talking to them, poking them to make them swell, feed them and also have them turn into musical notes that you can press to make music; you can draw a fish of your own on the screen too and it will immediately start swimming around with the others.\n\nThere\u2019s no official information on how many units were made but judging by the times a Sega Fish Life has been seen, we can presume there weren\u2019t many.\n\nThanks for watching!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z4oTwqzJohE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z4oTwqzJohE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z4oTwqzJohE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z4oTwqzJohE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Juppon Gatana - Sega Fish Life [Exclusive Close up] (ENG)", "description": "Press here for more information!\n\n\u221a  Versi\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol del Video: https://youtu.be/lE75UeWSmZ8\n\n\nReleased in June, 2000.
