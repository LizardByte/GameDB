She apparently the best Maid in the area and the fact that she chose you to be her master/mistress should honor you. The first day goes almost like a dream: your maid prepares amazing food, cleans the house, preps your bath, and even flirts with you a bit! Lucky you!\n\nThe second day, however, ends up showing you the true nature of the world you now reside in. You are visited by a noble woman and, almost out of the blue, her maid and yours start FIGHTING! You are told that the Maids are the true power of the Nobles and that the Maids are not only trained as servants, but also as Soldiers and Guardians. By moving into the mansion, you signed yourself to represent your maid in the never-ending Maid Games.\n\nThe battle between the maids ends in a draw and the noblewoman gives you one week to train your maid up to par. If she loses, you lose the maid AND your fortune! However, she can't just train the entire week! She STILL has to perform her duties as a maid and keep the house clean and keep you fed! If she doesn't, then she will be taken away and replaced!\n\nWill you be able to keep your newly obtained rich life and your maid?!", "summary": "It's your lucky day! You won a special lottery!
