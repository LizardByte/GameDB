The survey was...odd, to say the least, but some of the things were done fairly easy, though I didn't think it would go through.

Of course it may not start off deadly right away, but, uh...yeah, things are gonna escalate. But can you blame him? He really didn't know what he and his friends (fiends? Frienemies?) were going up for.\n\nWell, what can he do now?
