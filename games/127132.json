Sam has just returned from his bathroom break and discovers that Max is dead, his brain removed. Enraged, he goes to the Moleman Cultists, who are awakening after having been knocked out, and begins furiously questioning them. Using some pointers given to him earlier by Flint Paper, he learns from them that they were knocked out by General Skun-ka'pe, who somehow has gotten out of the Penal Zone, who then removed Max's brain from his body. Sam takes Max's body with him and begins driving around the streets, narrating his trip in noir-style...\n\nOutside a pet store, Sam finds one of Skun-ka'pe's minions working as a sign spinner. After gaining information from him, Sam travels between the ex-minion, a European tourist and Frankie the Rat before gaining enough clues, the Rhinoplasty toy and a note reading \"Doctor Norrington\", to narrow down the location of Skun-ka'pe to the Museum of Mostly Natural History. Upon arriving, he sees flashing lights in the museum planetarium and goes there. Inside, he sees Skun-ka'pe and some of his minions engaged in a firefight with, surprisingly, Papierwaite, who should be over 120 years old. Also in the room is Max's brain, alive and well inside a jar fitted with a voice speaker and filled with some of Grandpa Stinky's demon broth. Upon spotting Sam, Max accidentally makes his presense known. Skun-ka'pe and Papierwaite, having found a common enemy, enter an alliance. Sam flees into the museum while Skun-ka'pe and Papierwaite send minions into the museum and set up machinery connected to the Devil's Toybox.", "summary": "Episode 3 of an epic 5 game saga.\n\nIn Episode 3, freelance shamus Sam gets steamin' mad, when someone snatches his little buddy's noodle, gunning for control of its inner powers.
