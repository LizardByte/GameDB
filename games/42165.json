From there other chickens are released and you must come down from above to turn them into an egg. Once they are an egg you can capture the egg and a point is scored. If you take too long they will once again return to a chicken and will need to be defeated from above. As the levels progress more chickens are released from the base. \n \nDon't be a chicken! Rule the roost!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
