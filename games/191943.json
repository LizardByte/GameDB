Four bright flames that will forever change the very fabric of the Web. An unstable place, with a canvas that is painted from willpower. It has a reality that is far too flexible. Without an anchor, who knows the terrors one would become?\n\nThe laughter never ends. Bouncing off the hollow walls, tainting the weak and strong alike.\n\nEdmund found himself entrapped. He does not know where he is. He does not know how he got there. Edmund knows he is in a most terrible place and that he must stop at no end to fight his way through.\n\nWith nothing but the clothes on his back, Edmund must punch and kick his way past anything that stands in his way. He cannot hold back. Edmund must smash heads, snap arms, and break legs. Anything to shatter the foe. Even the slightest hesitation would mean defeat. And defeat in this terrible Web is a fate much worse than death.\n\nEdmund will do anything to see her again. One last time.", "summary": "Edmund is entrapped in a most terrible Web.
