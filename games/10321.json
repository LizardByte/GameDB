Without losing many words it tells a savagely hilarious story. Journey into the Stone Age and face the most challenging task of this era: The search for fire!\n\nThis story's hero is the lovably chaotic Neanderthal Ungh who dozes off during his very first night watch. The next morning, the catastrophe ensues: the fire's gone out and Ungh is banished from his village. Now you have to help Ungh finding a new flame, searching every corner of the Stone Age world. No matter if he has to search the insides of a dinosaur, smoldering volcanoes or even through time itself, there is no place Ungh wouldn't look for new fire.\n\nOne click or swipe and your environment comes to life. A small dash of logic and you'll be able to solve any puzzle and there will be no limit to your exploratory spirit while interacting with the game's world: fire coconuts from a mammoth's trunk, turn into an animal or save the fair maiden from the Octo-Boss' grasp.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire--1", "videos": [{"id": 5939, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "clMPRsQqnHI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clMPRsQqnHI", "title": "FIRE - Official Trailer [PC & Mac Release] ENG", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/clMPRsQqnHI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
