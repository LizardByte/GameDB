The goal is to follow enemy fighters back to their base and destroy the base. I'm very impressed to see a 3D shooting game created for the Apple ][ back in 1981. Hope you enjoy the longplay!\n\nThe game uses half track protection, from track 1.5 to E.5. It probably uses 4x4 data encoding as well based on how quick the game is loaded.\n\nPS: The ammo is stored at address $6C49 and you can get unlimited ammo by changing $6FAD from 1 to 0. Fuel is stored at address $6C46 (minor) and $6C47 (major), you can get unlimited fuel by changing $6F83 from 4 to 0. You can also avoid losing fuel due to damage by changing $6FAC from 2 to 0.\n\nCredits:\nCover art - archive.org\nDisk image - 4AM", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHyAgvJ_0lQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHyAgvJ_0lQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHyAgvJ_0lQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHyAgvJ_0lQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Hadron Level 1-4 longplay (Apple II - Sirius Software)", "description": "Hadron (https://www.mobygames.com/game/apple2/hadron) was an action game published by Sirius Software in 1981 for the Apple ][.
