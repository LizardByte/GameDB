And also some new mechanics and secrets :))\n==============================\nUpdate March 2015:\nThis is not the official \"New Super Mario Bros.\" - line!! It's a remake of Super Mario Bros.3 on \"New\" engine...\n\n\nYou can also call it \"New\" Super Mario Bros. 3\n==============================\nUpdate September 2011:\nIn the first chapter you will see that the world 5 in NSMB3 is the ICED world of SMB3!

I WAS NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE NSMB WORLDMAP :/\n==============================\n\nHello everyone!\n6 months have passed, and I'm finally finished with the remake!!\n\nThis is a complete hack - based on Super Mario Bros. 3 (Nintendo, 1988/89)\n\nAll levels from the SMB3 game were renewed and added in this one!\nAnd the best! All levels have 3 STAR COINS (which are good hidden)\n\nThe most of the renewed courses are also expanded versions from the original!! \nThat means, when a normal level in SMB3 ends, mine will maybe have some more areas or rooms - as an extra!\n(i.e. when \"pipe x\" was not enterable in the \"original SMB3\", you may enter it in NSMB3:)\n\nPS: Please remember, don't download this when you don't have the ORIGINAL \"New Super Mario Bros.
