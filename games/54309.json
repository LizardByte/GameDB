Some of the jewels have letters, and the main goal of each level is to spell a phrase at the top-left of the screen by matching these gems.\n\nBlack pearls can only be removed when they reach the web edge or center. There are two mini-games that appear between levels: a hunt for hidden pieces of an object in a scenery, and a sliding-tile puzzle.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rainbow-web-2"}
