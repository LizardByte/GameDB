Each new spell school has its own distinct playstyle and progression, as well as custom spells, catalysts, vendors and armour.\n\nInfusions for all weapons have been completely overhauled, making every weapon viable.\n\nAll bosses have been revamped somehow, and some are even completely new.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-souls-iii-the-convergence"}
