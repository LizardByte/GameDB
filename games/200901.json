The N-Gage version is still an isometric four-character strong action RPG where all have got a set of unique passive and active abilities, but now there are more characters to choose from, including the past villains from the other side such as Toad or Scarlet Witch and some of the new heroes can fly too. Rise of Apocalypse is slightly less linear with more optional objectives. Now there's a currency system which means you can also purchase equipment, mostly usable items, like smelling salts or energy packs in the camp, though there are also equipable items such as belts, body armour and gloves.\n\nThe game could be played by up to four players online, and as a new feature, there's a turn-based player versus player mode in smaller locations, where more characters could be purchased with in-game currency. Additional quests could be unlocked through Nokia's online service called Arena.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-legends-ii-rise-of-apocalypse--1", "collections": [{"id": 8709, "name": "X-Men Legends"}]}
