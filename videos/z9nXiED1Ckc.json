Both Speed Busters: American Highways (also known as just Speed Busters) and Speed Devils are racing games in which the courses feature hazards such as dinosaurs rolling boulders, and UFOs in exotic locales including Louisiana, Louisiana Tornado, New York City, New York City Winter, Mexico, Nevada, Aspen Summer, Aspen Winter, Canada (Supposedly northern Quebec), Canada Light Winter, Canada Heavy Winter, Montreal Industrial, Hollywood, and Hollywood Disaster. The console version's career mode allowed a player to rise a racer through the ranks of a fictional racing league. Colorful rivals would challenge you to accomplish certain feats during races, making accompanying bets using prize money from competition.

Starting in Class D, they are Jack, Ms. Penny Parker, Alfanso, and Luigi. Class C has Vanessa, Blue Bullet, James, and Tex. Class B has Billy-Sue Bayou, Cora and Antonio Martinez, and Jake.
