The game was developed for the Stop AIDS campaign in 2001 (a joint prevention campaign by the Swiss Federal Ministry of Health and Swiss Aids Federation) in Switzerland. The player has to protect a couple having sex by shooting condoms at sperm cells and HIV viruses to catch them. The condom gun is located at the right side of the screen and can be moved up and down with the mouse, while sperm cells and HIV viruses are entering the screen on the left side. The goal is to catch as many sperm cells and HIV viruses as possible within 90 seconds. The game is immediately lost if a HIV virus reaches the other side of the screen. For each catch the player gets points, while each shot costs points.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/catch-the-sperm"}
