Graphics were drawn in real-time on a monochrome 13\" point plotting X-Y display, the screen being updated by the program 40 times a second (that is, in a normal in-game situations with 2 to 4 balls moving at once). However, for time constraints, the table and its pockets weren\u2019t drawn by the computer graphics, but were rather drawn manually onto the display using a grease pencil.\"\n\n- Norbert Landsteiner for masswerk.at", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pool--5"}
