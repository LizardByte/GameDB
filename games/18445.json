The goal of this remake is to keep the original game-play as untouched as possible while adding some new features such as networked multiplayer and real-time 3D rendering. In case you\u2019re not yet familiar with the original game goal, it\u2019s quite simple: Bomb all other players from the screen. Either by collecting flame extras to increase the bomb radius or by picking up bomb extras in order to have more bombs to drop you\u2019re able to surround your enemies with your bombs, or blow them away with clever bomb chain reactions.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dynablaster-revenge"}
