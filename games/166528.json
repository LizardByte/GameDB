The plot revolves around a war between two factions of toy soldiers, the Gorgonites and the the Commando Elite. The player takes the role of Archer, the leader of the Gorgonites, who has to cross five levels while facing the Commando Elite's soldiers.\n\nThe goal is simply to find the goal without dying; in one instance within a hidden time limit. However, during the first four levels Archer is completely defenseless and has to dodge the enemies. The last level introduces two new gameplay mechanics: a bow which stuns enemies and simple switch puzzles. The levels are side-scrolling, but there are junctions.\n\nThis game is unrelated to the PlayStation and PC release of the same name.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/small-soldiers--1", "videos": [{"id": 54382, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iTdKQxcPNmA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTdKQxcPNmA", "title": "Small Soldiers (GB) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iTdKQxcPNmA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
