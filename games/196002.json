It's where dreams are literally made. But sometimes dreams need a little help, and that's where you come in. They say a private eye never sleeps, but to crack these cases you'll need to be out cold.\n\nDreamsettler is an early '00s internet simulator in which you solve cases for an array of strange and endearing characters as a Sleepnet Private Investigator. From hunting down elusive soup recipes to unearthing global conspiracies, you'll need to explore countless pages, download apps and master minigames to close your cases and solve Sleepnet's mysteries.\n\nYou'll start small, with little more than a bare-bones Dreamsettler template page, but before long find yourself caught up in a plot that will determine the very future of Sleepnet and sleeptime computing at large.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 66130, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "ufMl2DlWX7w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufMl2DlWX7w", "title": "Hypnospace Next: Discover the future of Hypnospace", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ufMl2DlWX7w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
