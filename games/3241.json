The story can also be perceived as symbolism for corporations or monopolies getting carried-away, and forgetting all sense of their origins, or otherwise destroying their own foundations from within, when nothing but the next job/production is all that can be seen in life.", "summary": "Cookie Clicker is a Javascript-based browser video game written by French programmer Julien Thiennot, better known as \"Orteil\". The point of the game is to bake cookies as fast as possible, to have a large number of cookies, and to have a lot of milk; notably, however, there is no true end to the gameplay. At the beginning of the game, the player bakes cookies solely by clicking on a giant cookie, gaining one cookie each time it is clicked. Once the player has enough cookies, they can use them to buy items that will bake more cookies automatically. The seemingly endless gameplay makes it a game that can last an indefinite amount of time.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cookie-clicker", "videos": [{"id": 1797, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "0afJ_M9clCU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afJ_M9clCU", "title": "\"Winning\" Cookie Clicker", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0afJ_M9clCU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
