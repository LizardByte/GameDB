Her country has been ravaged by shadowy creatures who corrupt the soil, preventing crops from growing -- and since this same phenomenon has been occurring in PopoloCrois as well, the king now seeks her counsel.\n\nHer expert opinion? Prince Pietro should visit Galariland personally as an ambassador for PopoloCrois, to see the damage first-hand and learn all the ways the Galari people are fighting back. But once he's there, he finds there's no way home, and his princely name holds little sway over the long-suffering people of this new world.\n\nIt is up to you, as Prince Pietro, to make a life for yourself in Galariland while seeking a way home, doing everything you can in the meantime to cultivate the earth and new friendships alike.\n\nA fantastical fairytale adventure awaits!\"", "summary": "The fairy tale world of PoPoLoCrois meets the farm living of Story of Seasons in this cross-over RPG. It features classically-styled turn-based combat and towns full of lively and interesting NPCs who contribute to a heartwarming narrative that veterans or newcomers to either franchise can enjoy.
