The Prince then rings a gong, seeming to describe some sort of time for meditation. The King and Queen perform a synchronized dance as a response, but in the process, leads to the King kicking and spilling a bucket of black paint. It scatters everywhere, forming black holes wherever it lands. The first destination for the spills are in the middle of a road, where it sucks in cars driving toward them, but it then cuts to the paint hitting the sky itself. All of the contents of the sky are sucked in, leaving nothing left.\n\nThe work going entirely to waste angers the Queen, leaving the condition of her relationship with the King questionable in nature. The King asks the Prince to roll several katamari in order to replace the stars in the sky and make the Queen happy again, before promptly dropping him into a tutorial stage.", "summary": "Roll your Katamari into a ball of galactic proportions in this cosmic endless runner.
