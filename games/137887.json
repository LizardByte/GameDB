Keeping all of your favourite aspects of TTRPGs and bringing them to the big screen, VoxStory is the modern way to enjoy roleplaying.\n\nVoxStory remains true to the tabletop style of gaming, the roll of the dice determines your actions, the Gamemaster will still set the story, atmosphere and scene, but with VoxStory you won\u2019t just have to imagine it, you\u2019ll be able to watch it like your very own movie.\n\nWith world creation, the possibilities are endless, you can customise every aspect of your world or use a pre-populated world if you\u2019re short of time. Players can join your world with their own custom characters, gather round, connect to a large screen, such as a TV, and watch your adventure play out.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/voxstory"}
