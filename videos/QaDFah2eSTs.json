We are Team 91Act, a passionate and dedicated team specializing in Action game development. We are excited to introduce to you BlazBlue Entropy Effect, the latest spin-off in the BlazBlue series. Authorized by Arc System Works, this Action Roguelite game stands out with its distinct and innovative designs. \n\nAct x Rogue is a fantastic gameplay formula. With years of experience, expertise and passion, we have designed a distinctive character-based Roguelite customization system. Players can continuously evolve their combat skills by activating the exclusive Potential Skills of their characters in challenges, and by blending skills of seven elements (Umbra, Ice, Electricity, Toxin, Light, Fire, Blade). The abilities and skills of each of your well-trained characters can be passed on to new characters, setting the stage for fresh experiences.\n\nAs you delve deeper into the game, the world\u2019s hidden truth will gradually unfold. Along your adventurous journey, you will encounter others like you, who are lost in this world. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether they are companions or enemies. You can also collect Phenomena Fragments and piece them together into a complete story. This will help you solve some of your puzzles and venture further into your exploration. \n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see you in our game, and we truly hope that this game will be a pleasant surprise for you all. \nThe game is aimed for release within this year!
