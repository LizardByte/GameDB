But now mankind has discovered the egg of Guayota within Mount Teide, and it is only a matter of time until Gaurodan returns from the sky to fight the beast and punish us for awakening his ancient enemy.\n\nFly around the Canary Islands as Gaurodan, and destroy cities, armies and colossal creatures in your path throught this frantic shmup, created for the lovers of classic games that require mastering.\n\nYou'll need some mastering to play this game because controls are not the usual: you have two buttons to shoot air-air and air-ground, and you can't stop moving in the air. Guarodan is inspired by early titles like Defender, Choplifter or Sky Kid in terms of gameplay, and has a similar production style to other arcade games like Commando, Gyrodine or 1942.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gaurodan"}
