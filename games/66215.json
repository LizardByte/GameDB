Just when they think that they are empty-handed, Pochi finds a ring with the same seal as the one on the locked door, which turns out to be one of King Solomon's Treasures, with the rest hidden somewhere around Japan. Rami now travels around Japan to go through all the leads on the rest of Solomon's Treasures, with Dr. Pon tracking her every move.", "summary": "Rami-chan no Ooedo Sugoroku: Keio Yuugeki-tai Gaiden is a 1998 video game for the PlayStation.
