The storyline expands upon the settings and events of the T-virus outbreak in Raccoon City and concludes with the fate of the city and its infected population.", "summary": "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a survival horror video game and the third installment in the Resident Evil series. Like its two predecessors, it is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, the gameplay is improved by features such as auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows Jill to avoid enemy attacks. The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis", "videos": [{"id": 33156, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4wlTtmr7TW8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlTtmr7TW8", "title": "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis Trailer 1999", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4wlTtmr7TW8/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 73138, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "w4NQHEd65Fs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4NQHEd65Fs", "title": "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis Full walkthrough HD [HARD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w4NQHEd65Fs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
