The player must continuously monitor the onscreen temperature and fuel gauges; if the ship overheats, its weapon is disabled, and if it is depleted of fuel, the vessel itself explodes. The player must battle through waves of enemies, which attack with varied formations and flight patterns. When a wave is destroyed, a new one appears. At the end of each sector, the player flies through an asteroid belt and can obtain extra fuel by shooting fireballs. After this, the mother ship is met, where the player docks and refuels for the next sector. Also, the player is rewarded various bonuses for accomplishing certain feats, such as, shooting all enemies in a specific order or shooting all enemies without missing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/astro-blaster", "videos": [{"id": 89775, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ggPjKH5t1jU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggPjKH5t1jU", "title": "Astro Blaster (version 3) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ggPjKH5t1jU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
