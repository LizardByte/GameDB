These changes do not move away from the spirit of the original game, so there aren\u2019t new gameplay features like Flight Cancel...however Time Travel Overhaul is incorporated with permission purely because it was the original game designers\u2019 intent for No Loading Time Travel to be featured. This has also been tweaked and polished to be as closely representative of how Sega would have made it work themselves.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-cd-restored"}
