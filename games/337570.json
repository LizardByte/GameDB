Players start as a lone bubble-popper and gradually build a cat army to automate their bubble-popping empire.\n\nThe core gameplay loop involves popping bubbles to earn cash, recruiting quirky cats with unique abilities, investing in upgrades, exploring to discover rare cats, and ascending to gain permanent upgrades.\n\nPlayers can choose between a relaxed idle playstyle where their cat army handles everything or an active clicker approach chasing high combos. The game features various cat types (Unicats, Devilcats, etc.) with distinct abilities and synergies, an expandable map, over 400 achievements, and multiple prestige mechanics that provide meaningful progression.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bubblebyte", "videos": [{"id": 144774, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Db_zp66OHIU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db_zp66OHIU", "title": "BubbleByte \ud83e\udee7\ud83d\udc31 |  Steam Release Trailer \ud83d\ude80", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Db_zp66OHIU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
