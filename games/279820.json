The player shoots alien vessels to try to stop an alien invasion. The player controls a small space ship in the bottom half of the screen which can move in 4 cardinal directions. Moving left to right on the top half of the screen are the invading alien vessels, which fire randomly upon the defending player. If your ship is hit, it is destroyed. When the player has destroyed all ships, they move to a higher difficulty level with faster moving ships that fire more frequently. The player has a total of 3 lives. When all are lost, it's game over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monolithic-laser"}
