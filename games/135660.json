Have you ever wanted to face your fear of heights? Perhaps you wanted to become a pilot and test your critical thinking skills. Looking for a breathtaking experience? Try our game Extreme Escape. \n \nYou are the pilot of an experimental balloon that has suffered a serious accident. You\u2019ve just lost power and your life support system is damaged. The balloon is leaking and you\u2019re falling down really fast. Get out of this situation by repairing all devices and regaining control over the balloon. \n \nThe capsule contains plenty of tools and equipment necessarily to fix the air ship and land safely. The onboard computer shows emergency procedure codes that you can follow using your tablet. Additional help becomes available once the radio is reset. It is a room-scale experience. In a smaller space you can use a teleport or just pull yourself in the capsule using your hands.", "summary": "Extreme Escape is an escape-room puzzle game with an action component.
