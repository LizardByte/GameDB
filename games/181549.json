Like in the arcade game the objective is to sink as many submarines as possible by dropping depth charges from a boat on the surface. What's difference is that the boat automatically moves from right to the left and all the player has to do is to press a single button to drop the depth charges. The boat makes three passes along the surface and the objective of the game is simply to score as many points as possible. More points are earned by hitting submarines at higher depths and upon reaching 600 and 900 points additional passes are given.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/depth-charge"}
