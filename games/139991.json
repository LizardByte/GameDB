Driving from Kyoto into the mountainside and back. You need to be on schedule and are requiered to precicely stop the train at stations. You get evaluated by stoping as close to the hold line as possible (< 50 cm) and being neither to early, nor to late (<3 seconds).\n\nYou can get panalized, which reduces your time evaluation. For example driving to fast, or breaking to hard.\n\nThe evaluation earns you medals, unlocking information for points of interest within walking distance near the stations you are driving to. All of them are pictured and the locations are marked on a simple map.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/japanese-rail-sim-journey-to-kyoto"}
