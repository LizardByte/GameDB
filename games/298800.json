It\u2019s not even developed by Capcom, but instead Sun L, the developer responsible for the Game Boy ports of Gargoyle\u2019s Quest II and Street Fighter II. Tenchi wo Kurau follows a similar storyline to the previous entries, but reshuffles things in interesting ways. Rather than starting with Zhang Fei, Liu Bei, and Guan Ye\u2019s blood oath, you begin only as Liu Bei. The initial hour of gameplay involves finding his companions, joining up with the army, and destroying the Yellow Turbans.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tenchi-wo-kurau--1"}
