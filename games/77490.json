Commonly displaying neon or ultraviolet lights, extravagant paints and stainless or golden exterior parts, on both on the exterior and the interior. Dekotora may be created by workers out of their work trucks for fun, or they may be designed by hobbyists for special events. They are sometimes also referred to as Art Trucks. Truck Kyousoukyoku - Ai to Kanashimi no Rodeo: Taking inspiration from the hugely popular decotora truck games. As a truck maneuvering maniac, your goal is to race against competing truckers any which way but loose. Drive on sidewalks, search for shortcuts, discover secret roads and plunge headlong into traffic with no reservation. You are, after all, a maniac. Upon winning races, the player gets a can of aerosol to paint designs and emblems on the body of the truck. The sides, top, back, and head of the vehicle are open canvases for you to drop paint and swirl a menacing symbol or a nature panorama. Preset designs may be chosen or you can create your own doodles which help you help your truck emote. The action is hot and the paint jobs add to the ambience.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/truck-kyousoukyoku", "videos": [{"id": 137220, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "F_xDH4pOBKw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_xDH4pOBKw", "title": "Truck Kyosokyoku Arcade", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F_xDH4pOBKw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
