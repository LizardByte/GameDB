When the robot is hit, it will break down and dump the girl out. The girl cannot shoot enemies, and will die after 30 seconds if she cannot restore the robot, which requires special items. The game often requires shooting at or jumping on certain unmarked spots repeatedly, either to uncover secrets or even to make progress in a stage at all. In order to reach the true ending, two loops of the game must be beaten.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/miracle-ropits-adventure-in-2100", "videos": [{"id": 39743, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rlY__MvVPF8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlY__MvVPF8", "title": "NES Longplay [892] Miracle Ropitt: 2100-Nen no Daibouken", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rlY__MvVPF8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
