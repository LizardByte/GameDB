Train the crew for different roles: divers that search the wreck while trying to stay out of the way of sharks, scientists that conduct research and examine historical artifacts and engineers that take care of the mechanical operation of your ship or submarine. Real-life shipwrecks are present in the game, including the Titanic. Of course, you have a rival for most of the game who is known as 'Evil Eddy' - the richest man in the world - and the goal of the game is to beat Eddy by becoming rich enough to purchase the ultimate submarine: the Sea Rogue.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sea-rogue"}
