Each level's goal is to find an artefact which will lead the way to the next world. Most enemies can be killed by jumping onto them. It is important to hit them from above. Touching an enemy's side or contact from below are lethal for the hero. After collecting 50 gems of any kind you will be granted an extra life. Each level is concluded by a statistics screen. It will display the number of collected items and killed enemies, opposed to total numbers. Upon reaching the maximum possible numbers, an extra bonus is granted.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/solid-gold"}
