Percival Quentin Jones is driving a car with the unconscious Ben Jordan to his flat in London. It is 30th December 2004 and only two days are left until the dark ritual of Cardinal Genovese will be performed. This ritual is tightly connected with relics of the past collected by his Knights of St. Anthony in places visited by Ben Jordan in previous cases. \n \nJust like the previous titles the genre is a classic icon-based point-and-click adventure with voice-overs. The player controls Ben Jordan in London and Paris most of the game, but also Ben's Grandfather, Arthur Jordan, while he was accompanied by Percy Q. Jones in the land of Romania to fight vampires in 1926. There are several puzzles and time-based sequences, where protagonists should think quickly to achieve the desired result or they can even die.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ben-jordan-paranormal-investigator-case-8-relics-of-the-past", "collections": [{"id": 3427, "name": "Ben Jordan: Paranormal Investigator"}]}
