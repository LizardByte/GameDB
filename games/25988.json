Everything starts with an unscrupulous property shark who wants to purchase the kids' housing complex and the parents lack the money that is needed to prevent the pending sequestration.\n\nIn the house of their leader Mikey the group makes an unusual discovery. They find a treasure map which is supposed to lead to the hideout of \"One-eyed Willie\", a pirate.\n\nMikey can convince his friends to go for a treasure hunt. This starts in an abandoned restaurant. The evil Fratellis have settled in there. So after all Goonies, except for Chunk who is supposed to call the police, have entered a system of catacombs through a manhole in the restaurant, the adventure really begins. So the kids do not only have to beware of mean traps and bats, but also of Mama Fratelli.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-goonies--1"}
