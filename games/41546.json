The goal is to survive while defending the ship against two main threats: enemy space ships that fire while flying over the canyon sideways in the screen and laser guns in the canyon to intercept the ship. The player's ship has a sight which will change its position according to where the threat comes from, moving to the top of the screen for the enemy ships and to the front of the player's ship for the laser guns. The player's ship is also equipped with a magnetic shield which is destroyed if hit, but regenerates after six seconds. \n \nAfter 10 enemies are destroyed, a spaceship base appears on the screen and the player must avoid destroying it. If the player touches the spaceship base, a bonus of 100 points will be granted, the magnetic shield takes half a second more to regenerate and the enemies become faster and better armed. In the beginning the enemies will fire single missiles, after the first base they'll fire groups of missiles, after the second they'll fire a \"rain\" of missiles and after the third they'll fire homing missiles. Further in the game, friendly ships will also appear and must not be destroyed. \n \nAfter the player reaches 2000 points an enormous meteor may appear which can only be avoided (with a 100 points bonus for the feat). After 5000 points the speed of the meteor increases, as does the bonus points awarded (150). Finally, after 7000 points the ship loses its magnetic shield. The game is over if the ship is hit without its magnetic shield of if crashes in the canyon walls or the meteor.", "summary": "Exojet + is shooter game released in 1983 on the Magnavox Odyssey. \nReleased in Europe", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/exojet-plus", "videos": [{"id": 35259, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kvnqFumN_lE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvnqFumN_lE", "title": "Jopac - Exojet - Videopac - Odyssey", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kvnqFumN_lE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
