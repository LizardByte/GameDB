The administrator of Arkham, mayoral candidate Quincy Sharp, soon takes advantage of Batman's defeat of the Joker at Arkham and claims the credit himself for bringing the asylum back under control, perhaps saying Batman was working under his orders. This is partially to salvage his image, in tatters after the single worst asylum riot took place at a crucial time when Sharp was trying to convince the people of Gotham City to vote for him.", "summary": "\"Batman: Arkham City -- Armored Edition contains all of the content from Batman: Arkham City, including all available downloadable content, and introduces Battle Armored Tech (B.A.T.)
