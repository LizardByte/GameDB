The few surviving pockets of humanity are fighting a losing battle, barricaded behind makeshift walls, with dwindling supplies and hope.\n\nThis is when you begin to play your part. You\u2019re rescued half dead and nursed back to life by the kind people of Urban Shelter but it soon becomes clear you\u2019ve not arrived at the best of times. The survivors are frightened, weak and either very old or very young. They need a bold hero desperately to break out of the cold embrace of death outside their walls. Are you their savior? Or their worst mistake?\n\nYou need to rebuild and strengthen the Shelter, explore the stories of all sorts of disturbed characters that might become your best friends or worst enemies, play your cards right in the faction power struggles and when time comes, have enough resources and allies for the mother of all battles.", "summary": "Urban Strife is an old-school TBS, where you lead a team of makeshift, slightly deranged militia in an effort to keep the small community of Urban Shelter alive, amidst a zombie pandemic. With what\u2019s left of human civilization divided into factions fighting over the scraps, you will need to broker alliances and fight factions wars, fortify and rebuild your community and forge a future against the ever-present threat of the zombie horde.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "videos": [{"id": 37616, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "FLyFBaJq-p8"}, {"id": 55600, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "tLugVtv020M"}, {"id": 55601, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "z0Kl3nW2L4c"}]}
