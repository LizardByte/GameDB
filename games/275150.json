As you know we had one of our guys over there checking the place out and setting up equipment around the main building, but he hasn't checked in and won't respond to our radio calls. I'm worried something may have happened to him, or worse, the equipment. You'll be taking supplies with you, such as a backup generator incase power on the island isn't as sustainable as we thought. I'll also be giving you extra cameras to set up in the building, feel free to not use them if it's not necessary. As you know we don't exactly have the money or permission to be there so you'll be left on the island for five nights to not attract any unwanted attention. It's also imperative you find our missing employee as not only do we have limited numbers, but we also don't want to get sued by one of our own. Pickup will be the exact same place we drop you off, be ready at 0600 sharp on Friday. Get prepared, get well rested, and I'll see you first thing on Monday to send you off.\nBest of luck,\nGreg", "summary": "Five Toons at Night is upcoming Five Nights at Freddy's and Five Nights at Treasure Island fangame", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-toons-at-night"}
