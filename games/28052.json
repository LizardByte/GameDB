It draws on Irem's R-Type and Konami's other shoot 'em up Gradius, while adding the tentacle mechanics of Irem's other shoot 'em up XMultiply.\n\nIn the game, players pilot a ship called the Flintlock in order to save a blue haired princess named Irene of the planet E-Square from an evil lord named Klaus. Each stage is punctuated with a cutscene of the princess crying for help as she is tortured. In the ending, the Flintlock sends the orb back through the atmosphere of the planet, where it morphs into a naked fairy.\n\nThere are different gameplay mechanics between the original Japanese release and the overseas releases.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xexex", "videos": [{"id": 105348, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "MuYHMr52Pr4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuYHMr52Pr4", "title": "Xexex (\u30bc\u30af\u30bb\u30af\u30b9).
