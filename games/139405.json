Other demigods were sent as Watchers to inform the gods of Kayra's actions but were not to act on their own otherwise.\n\nWanting revenge, Kayra attempted to create an army resulting in 4 races imbued with a portion of Kayra's own power.\nThis power became the goddess of each race, protecting and guiding them at times. Dwarfs with earth, Elves with water, Orcs with fire and Humans with air.\nBut these new races weren't just given power. Kayra's anger, greed and dominant nature had been passed on as well. They weren't willing to be controlled.\nKayra feared these new creations and attempted to destroy them but Kayra's power couldn't destroy the portion of itself given to the races.\nKayra began creating more creatures to stay in control. Ancient and powerful, these creatures could not be stopped and fought among each other as well as the 4 races.\nMany creatures created during this time never became known to others and remain hidden throughout the world.\nDuring this age of struggle Kayra died.\n\nThis lead to a divide among the Watchers, with the one who discovered Kayra dead being blamed by the other Watchers and punished by the gods due to their known history and hatred for Kayra.\n\nAfter Kayra's death, the races warred for control against each other for centuries growing more isolated till their goddesses urged them towards peace.\nThe kings of each race met, and though none had any intention of associating with each other afterward, a peace treaty was made and honored.\n\nThe Dwarves eventually unearthed a new threat, an Abra. An ancient and deadly creature from a deep underground lake.\nThis lead to a union between the races that lasted long after the Abra and many later dangers were defeated.\n\nCenturies passed and Humans became the dominate race, with kingdoms reaching every corner of the world. The other races and their history slowly forgotten.\nWith the death of the King and his sons, the human kingdom split along two ideologues with those who didn't fit in either group hiding from the resulting wars.", "summary": "Kayra Online is a MMORPG based on Turkic mythology.\n\nThe game currently has no English integration and is only available in Turkish.\nThe game will be entering a closed beta near the end of October.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
