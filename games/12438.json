The player releases the ball (which is stuck to the paddle at the beginning of the game) and it will travel down the corridor until it hits a wall or similar obstacle and bounces back towards the player. At this point, the player will need to hit the ball again. If he does not, the ball will hit him and he will lose a life. The game will continue from where the player stopped, and the ball will once again be attached to the paddle.\n\nWhen the ball is travelling down the corridor, the player must walk and follow it. The object of the game is to reach the end of the corridor.\n\nObstacles such as moving elevator-style doors make navigating the corridor difficult and success relies on the player's quick reactions and forward planning. Collectable power-ups make progress easier. The colour of the corridor changes after every four levels, and there are fifty levels in total.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-light-corridor", "videos": [{"id": 90257, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "uP0gfld8hhA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP0gfld8hhA", "title": "THE LIGHT CORRIDOR (AMIGA - FULL GAME)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uP0gfld8hhA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
