Like in the first game, every wrestler has a variety of moves, which can be selected during the match in a turn-based fashion. Each move is then displayed as a picture.\n\nThe second game strengthens the preparation element: wrestlers have statistics and can learn new moves, depending on the player's choices. The player can also choose to set the matches on auto if he feels that the playable wrestler has learned the best moves.\n\nThere is also an exhibition mode that allows the player to put play as any wrestler against any opponent in a single match, or a three-match mini-tournament.\n\nThe losers of the decisive tournament battles remove parts of their clothes upon defeat; however, there is no explicit nudity or sexual situations in the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wrestle-angels-2-top-eventer"}
