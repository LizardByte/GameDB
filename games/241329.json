The letters just keep falling and you have to make a word out of them before they fill your screen! If you're not quick enough the letters will turn into stone and you can't use them anymore!\nSome letters have bombs which will clear a nice chunk of the board. If that's not enough, collect gold coins and buy some help! You can destroy the bottom row, freeze time or increase the lives of every tile on the board.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/word-wreck"}
