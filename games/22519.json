After discovering a gruesome murder, your interest in something greater than the routine of 80s Liverpool is awoken.\n\nYou explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
