The virtual host Bob continuously presents new letters in a pool. Players select a letter to place in their own collection each turn. It is up to the players to create words with their collected letters. Forming words scores the players points, the first player to reach 200 points wins the match. Players score more points for words that use all of their letters. If a player can't make any words from the letters in the pool he or she can opt to reshuffle it completely but losing a turn.
