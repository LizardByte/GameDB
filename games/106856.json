She is reflecting on childhood memories of her mother and a day trip they once took to a neighboring city.

As Miriam thinks back on these events, her emotions surge as if experiencing the trip for the first time once again.", "summary": "A Memoir Blue is an atmospheric journey through the memories of Miriam: a champion swimmer, who on the day of her greatest success dwells on her childhood memories of her mother and a special trip they took.\n\nExperience this personal story through a beautiful mixture of 3D animation and hand-drawn 2D. Interact and play with dreamlike objects in tactile ways that will surprise and delight players as they dig deeper into what was really happening that day.\n\nA gorgeously illustrated story of magical realism, A Memoir Blue shows that the past is a puzzle worth solving.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-memoir-blue", "videos": [{"id": 62398, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2uwLG_-69EQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uwLG_-69EQ", "title": "A MEMOIR BLUE | Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2uwLG_-69EQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
