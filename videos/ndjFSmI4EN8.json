This 1980 arcade smash hit came with some surprising changes to the Atari 2600 including a row of buildings instead of mountains and only one button, but it still has a unique charm and remains highly enjoyable to play today.  Defender, which is one of the best arcade video games ever created, is similar in style to a horizontally scrolling space ship shoot-em'-up, or SHMUP.  It does not have power ups or mega super hyper weapons or insane bullet hell madness or end bosses, but it does have fun and addictive gameplay.  Even on the Atari 2600, which butchered some arcade ports, Defender holds up to hours of gameplay with exciting action and explosions, smart bombs, landers, swarmers and mutants.  It is still one of the best titles on the Atari 2600 and this review shows Defender gameplay in all its glory.  Classic Game Room reviews the best new and classic video games and hardware from all video games consoles.  Old school fans of retro video games will find many CGRHD reviews to enjoy.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndjFSmI4EN8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndjFSmI4EN8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ndjFSmI4EN8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Classic Game Room HD - DEFENDER for Atari 2600 review", "description": "Classic Game Room HD reviews DEFENDER for Atari 2600 VCS video computer system.
