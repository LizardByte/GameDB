It stars the title character, a young purple dragon named Spyro and his dragonfly friend, Sparx, and is the first game in the Spyro the Dragon series. The first game was massively popular at its initial release and Spyro would later become one of the most recognizable, popular and respected gaming icons for the PlayStation gaming console. Spyro's best friend, Sparx the dragonfly, acts like the player's health meter and assists in gathering gems. The various dragons Spyro unfreezes along the way are also key characters in Spyro's progression through the game. Gnasty Gnorc is the main antagonist, who froze all the dragons of the land in crystal.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spyro-the-dragon", "videos": [{"id": 22148, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DoCmdGpa6Kw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoCmdGpa6Kw", "title": "Spyro the Dragon - Trailer - 1998", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoCmdGpa6Kw/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 322, "name": "Spyro the Dragon"}]}
