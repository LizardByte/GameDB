Each table has its own details and gameplay elements.\n\nEach table has different \"locations\" that you play, which determine which Pok\u00e9mon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select your starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game.\n\n\"Catch Mode,\" when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you can attempt to capture a Pok\u00e9mon. Once you activate \"catch mode,\" you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pok\u00e9mon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pok\u00e9mon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.\n\n\"Evolution Mode,\" when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pok\u00e9mon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pok\u00e9dex. Once you select a Pok\u00e9mon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pok\u00e9mon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pok\u00e9mon.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-pinball", "videos": [{"id": 28292, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "hwPYSWIn9-0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwPYSWIn9-0", "title": "How to Catch Mew - Pok\u00e9mon Pinball GBC (TAS)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hwPYSWIn9-0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
