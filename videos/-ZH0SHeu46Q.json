No? How 'bout creepy crawlies that shoot out toxic green goo that is liable to melt your face off? This spidery fella will only do his best! Though, this one isn't too tricky if you're fast on your flinging, just watch to not move your cursor off the screen and lose your grip!\n------\n\nMario Galaxy is the Mario title that turned everyone on their head! This game is absolutely gorgeous! It's amazing how much detail and splendor they fit into this title! And now you can see it in silky smooth 60 fps! Woo-hoo!\n\nThere's just so much about this title that is awesome, I can't really even figure what to focus on talking about here! Let me just say that this was essentially the Wii/'cube generation's Mario 64! The control is super tight and responsive, the visuals were eye popping for its time, and the game brought a new sense of play about with it's gravity defying physics! And did I mention that most of the music is fully orchestrated? When you think of gaming masterpieces THIS one should always make your list!\n\nOne other cool feature was that you could get a player two to play along with you by shooting star bits at enemies, collecting items, and helping out in general! This was PERFECT for those who weren't the most gaming proficient or just somebody that wanted to hang out with you, giving them at least a little input on your gameplay! You can always shoot and collect on your own, though.\n\nI think I'll just leave my description at that and let the game speak for itself!\n\nSee you in space!\n----\n\nThis game was captured on... the original Nintendo Wii! I'm normally using the Wii U for my captures right now, but it kinda got knocked outta commission when the AC Adapter died at random. It's alright, Nintendo has a year long warranty and they're helping me out with that. Meanwhile though, I set up my capture device to get as good a capture as possible of the Wii! I used the output on the Wii U as a template to set the aspect ratio and everything, 'cause usually stuff will be a wee bit egg shaped on a straight up capture from the Wii. Anyway, all's looking good and I'm really happy with how it all turned out! Oh! And of course it's all being captured in 60 frames per second!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZH0SHeu46Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZH0SHeu46Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZH0SHeu46Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZH0SHeu46Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZH0SHeu46Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "20.
