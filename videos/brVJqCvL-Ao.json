{"id": "brVJqCvL-Ao", "snippet": {"title": "Retro 90s Dungeon Crawler Indie RogueLike Action! -- Devil Spire -- #01", "description": "Devil Spire is an Indie, FPS, Hack and Slash, Action RogueLike / RogueLite Dungeon Crawler, all about the 90s Retro look, but this time, packing Procedural Generation of the dungeons as well!\n\nVisually, the game reminds me of Elder Scrolls: Arena, or Daggerfall, with the many different dungeon environments to adventure through, and the devs mention King\u2019s Field as a major influence. \nSo, Devil Spire is very retro in both look and feel. \n\nBut it is the Gameplay that is the focus in Devil Spire, as there are many different classes to play, making each game feel different. \nDevil Spire has 7 different classes, ranging from a warrior Deserter, to a mage like Blasphemer, a rogue like Scoundrel, an archer like Raider, or even The Depraved, who starts with nothing save a ring and some trash. \nYou can even be a Mad, mad man with a big weapon, which seems to be Devil Spire\u2019s take on the Barbarian. Cool!\nPlus, you can you put in your stats, both when you create your character, and when you lvl up, and can find different magic spells, as well as buy gear in the village prior to ascending the dungeon tower.   \n\nDevil Spire gives you meaningful character choices to make even before you step into the dungeon, which is always nice to see in an RPG. \nI recommend buying some lantern oil, some empty bottles to fill at the well, and a healing option, and maybe a mana potion as well if you\u2019re a caster, as mana does not seem to regenerate aside from lvling up.\n\nAnyway, if a Retro RPG Dungeon Crawler with Procedural Generation and Perma Death appeals to you, you might like what Devil Spire is offering. I know I do. Give me a watch and see if you do too?\n\nNote: This is the Devil Spire Beta, an early, early access version prior to the game\u2019s launch 02/02/22, so any bugs encounters here will be addressed by the game launch.  \n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1861290/Devil_Spire/\n#DevilSpire #Roguelike #DungeonCrawler", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/brVJqCvL-Ao/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/brVJqCvL-Ao/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/brVJqCvL-Ao/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/brVJqCvL-Ao/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Retro 90s Dungeon Crawler Indie RogueLike Action! -- Devil Spire -- #01", "description": "Devil Spire is an Indie, FPS, Hack and Slash, Action RogueLike / RogueLite Dungeon Crawler, all about the 90s Retro look, but this time, packing Procedural Generation of the dungeons as well!\n\nVisually, the game reminds me of Elder Scrolls: Arena, or Daggerfall, with the many different dungeon environments to adventure through, and the devs mention King\u2019s Field as a major influence. \nSo, Devil Spire is very retro in both look and feel. \n\nBut it is the Gameplay that is the focus in Devil Spire, as there are many different classes to play, making each game feel different. \nDevil Spire has 7 different classes, ranging from a warrior Deserter, to a mage like Blasphemer, a rogue like Scoundrel, an archer like Raider, or even The Depraved, who starts with nothing save a ring and some trash. \nYou can even be a Mad, mad man with a big weapon, which seems to be Devil Spire\u2019s take on the Barbarian.
