What is Sengoku Turb? It was a near-launch game for the Dreamcast and was also dubbed the first RPG on the system (the spine card refers to it as a \"Full Polygon Multi-Character Wartime Role Player\") and was a successor to the 1992 PC-98 shareware title of the same name. Developed by qnep, it actually got a lot of (brief) coverage back in the day as the DC was hotly anticipated and many were wondering which titles would get released overseas, but most opinions on the game were that it was too bizarre and repetitive to have any lasting appeal, and it was quickly forgotten about... overseas anyway.\n\nIn Japan, the game was a bit of a cultural phenomenon thanks to Bio_100% (who worked on the original iteration of the game) and its two main designers, Masao Masutani and Yoko Kuroyanagi. Masao originally developed the game and the absurd concepts behind it while Yoko designed the characters and is best known for partially spear-heading the Tamagotchi craze (she designed Tamagotchis too). The DC game is actually pretty faithful to the PC-98 game and is an evolution of the surreal world presented years prior, and this title, a fan disk, was created just shy of a year later in time to delight fans for the 1999 Christmas holiday as a stocking stuffer. Don't worry though... this wasn't your average fan disk -- besides including several (mostly bizarre) mini-games, it has a wealth of extra content from fan art, a variety of downloadable VMU icons made by fans, a music player, Internet extras, various topics covered by Mr. and Mrs. Hakase (Hitsuji and Nanoray), a 55 page script covering various details not covered in the main game (involving the Neko Paketto Race and others), additional character bio details, and even an exclusive \"Episode Zero\" which takes place before the start of the game (where Doppa instigates the war between the Cat and the Sheeps, sending Gertrude and Alice-B into battle) and has slightly simplified mechanics from the main game! While ST is an abstract game that's not for everyone, if you WERE a fan, you would've gotten your money's worth.\n\nThe game consists of 16 different menus to toggle through with mini-games ranging from 1-4 players and genres including Rail Shooter, 3rd-Person Run-n-Gun, Racing, Arcade-style, and real-time ARPG. These games are very simple and straight-forward (though I'll say the racing game has difficulties that are unlocked through repetition and is kinda bad, the 3rd Person shooter has three powerups with two modes depending on if you use the D-Pad or Analog as well as charge shots for each and is actually decent, the rail shooter is very short, and \"Newn Kipp Diving\" has more than one loop), but I'll cover Episode Zero and more of what the game shines light on. Episode Zero doesn't have a lot of dialogue and is only twenty stages but briefly goes over how things escalated between the cat and sheep kingdoms (due to false information perpetuated by Doppa to get them to hate each other). A tiny exchange alludes to what they've heard (not explained) and Nietzsche's servants saying they should begin the attack. Nietzsche asks \"What about Alice-B?\" (you can choose to play as her at the halfway point, but Gertrude at Lv6+ curb stomps Alice by a mile due to a five way attack that has a much faster cool down and better range) and Getrude can tango with the cats without Alice's help. At the end, a minor character (Mumu-chan) has a shuriken stabbed in her back as she dies exclaiming that it hurts and she encountered all sorts of enemies (but DID NOT implicate the cats), but they blame them anyway.\n\nWhat's more important than what's said in this extra content is what ISN'T said. First, we learn that the sheep nation cannot consume the fairies, giving the Cats the advantage (they have things they can consume, but they are not as plentiful and are usually protected by fairies). We also learn that the Neko Paketto were originally near the Sheep Kingdom and could've aided in preventing the war but didn't (they can be found on Stage 6 and 10). It is also hinted that Hitsuji and Nanoray have dabbled in science and may be Jino's biological parents or have a familial connection. This is due to Jino having Nanoray's build and one red eye with Hitsuji's blue eye, they also share the same full name of Ray-Spex -- Jino Ray Spex and Nano Ray Spex. Jino's age is also slowed down due to temporal conditions in space and she is approximately 30 years old... the Neko Paketto also pair them together and calls the Hakases aunt and uncle.\n\nAt any rate, this is some footage to digest of the game in action. We'll have some minor supplemental info in the comments.
