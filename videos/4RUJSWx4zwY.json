Will you be able to survive it?\n\nEscape from Chernobyl is not an easy typical mobile game. It is hard and it takes time and tactics to learn and overcome. This game is also best experienced by playing with headphones.\n\nDive into the darkness and the dangers of the Chernobyl power plant in this continuation of the Radiation City adventure. Unravel the mystery left unsolved: find what happened to Lauren and the story of the nightmare at its source.\n\nNavigate the accurately recreated Chernobyl power plant complex from the destroyed Unit 4 reactor to the outskirts of the complex at their natural scale.\n\nExplore the full area in a seamless experience from open world exploration to the maze-like corridors of each building and the nuclear unit buildings. Scavenge them for weapons and gear to give you the needed edge to overcome this tremendous challenge.\n\nRadiation with anomalies and zombies are just parts of the dangers trying to kill you at every corner.\n\nFight the deadly zombie infested area and the experimental abominations crawling the complex with improved controls and a wide range of melee and fire weapons. Tone your skills in a new combat system based on natural physics and real motion and plan your fights and try to survive using a new noise based stealth system.\n\nEnjoy the amazing graphics powered by Metal in this open world survival : unprecedented detail, physically based rendering, dynamic shadows and post processing.\n\n\nAvailable on iOS devices on the Apple AppStore on the 9th of August:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/escape-from-chernobyl/id1336364774", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4RUJSWx4zwY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4RUJSWx4zwY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4RUJSWx4zwY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Escape from Chernobyl Extended Trailer", "description": "True horror is back at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
