Game characters speak a fictional language reminiscent of Ukrainian or Russian. The population is largely white, and the country's churches are Eastern Orthodox. Novistrana is rife with political turmoil, with many differing political forces vying for power representing a range of ideologies. The ideologies of Novistranans are generally influenced by their class or career. Police brutality and political corruption are prevalent.\n\nNovistrana has its own national anthem, which is sung in a fictional language. Similarly, the alphabet used in Novistrana is fictional although it draws heavily from the Cyrillic alphabet. \"Novistrana\" can be translated in Russian and some Eastern European/Slavic languages as \"New Country\". In other Slavic languages it could be translated as \"New Party\".", "summary": "Republic: The Revolution is a computer game produced by Elixir Studios, founded by Demis Hassabis , a former programmer of Lionhead Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. It has since been released for the Mac OS X by Feral Interactive. It is a depiction of grassroots political action, where one attempts to put their preferred government in power. It is set in Novistrana, a small, fictional, post-Soviet country in Eastern Europe.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/republic-the-revolution", "videos": [{"id": 131643, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "12MFHuOB3_w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12MFHuOB3_w", "title": "Republic: The Revolution (2003) - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12MFHuOB3_w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
