I'm VAL, your helpful and efficient Space Station AI!\n\nAccording to my records, this Station hasn\u2019t been used at all in the last 17 years! How very strange. Furthermore, it would appear that you are the only rational life form in this Sector. Well then, CONGRATULATIONS! I hereby officially pronounce you Commander of this Space Station! Hopefully you will enjoy more success than your predecessor who, according to the logbook, er\u2026 ran into some wormlike Aliens\u2026 Oh, nothing to worry about!\n\nTo keep the same thing from happening to you, there's a lot you're going to have to do. Amongst others, there\u2019s the development of further Sectors, maintenance of the three vital Main Decks as well as the customer acquisition and entertainment of our extraterrestrial visitors, who provide us with sufficient Energy for our plans for global improvement. Oh, and before I forget \u2013 it's probably just a bug in my security protocols anyway \u2013 but my sensors are showing just loads of enemy creatures in all of the other Sectors\u2026\n\nSo, what are we waiting for?

Let us join forces to conquer space.\"", "summary": "Spacebase Startopia captivates with its original mixture of economic simulation and empire building strategy paired with classic RTS skirmishes and a good dose of humor.
