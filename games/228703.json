But something has destroyed the balance in that world, and animals have started to attack humans. A female warrior named Bizantira, accompanied by the yellow bird Diel, decides to find out the reason behind these occurrences and to discover the truth about humans and mebu.\n\nThe game is a very basic Japanese-style RPG, with minimal story development and simple gameplay mechanics. The player controls Bizantira as she wanders around the top-down world map, exploring the world and visiting towns. There is no navigation in the towns; locations (such as weapons shop, inn, etc.) are selected through a menu. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective.\n\nThe game's story is based on a fantasy novel of the same name by Hiroe Suga.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/akatsuki-no-bizantira", "videos": [{"id": 80764, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "j65mFbG5dR0"}]}
