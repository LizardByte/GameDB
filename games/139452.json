Despite being a direct sequel to Mario Forever, gameplay is radically changed from its predecessor, now more reminiscent of games like Galaxian and Space Invaders than 2D platformers like the original Super Mario Bros.\n\nAfter his defeat on Mario Forever, Bowser rebuilt his army and made it strong again, then proceeded kidnapping Princess Peach, but this time to another planet in the space. Mario then teams up with Luigi, Toad and Samus, to save Princess Peach once more from the hands of Bowser.\n\nEach character has their own skills and a slightly different space ship, with a variety of weapons and upgrades unlockable throughout the game. There's 8 different galaxies the player must clear, each with their own stages and bosses, before reaching Bowser's location and being able to rescue Princess Peach.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-forever-galaxy"}
