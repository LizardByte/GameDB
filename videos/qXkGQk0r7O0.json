While the levels are short, there are plenty of challengies ahead if only due to precision jumping skill requirements.\n\nThe game has some nice levels in that it mixes up different styles of gameplay in order to to be too boring.  Stand out levels are the minecart and the downhill sled.\n\nMost anoying level must be the volcano where you have to aourun the lava rising and then chuck presents at the dragon boss which was a pain as you have to wait for one to expload before throwing another which requires timming while jumping.  The bosses were generally easy apart from the final boss which takes a while for me to get a rythem going .\n\nMore effort could have gone into adding speech to the intro/outro, but i guess they didn't want to have to record multiple languages. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qXkGQk0r7O0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qXkGQk0r7O0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qXkGQk0r7O0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega-CD Longplay [079] The Smurfs", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed By: /Y\\ad/Y\\atty\n\nThis game gives the impression is going to be an easy kids game simply by being a Smurfs game.
