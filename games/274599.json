Upon reaching a threshold, you enter an Overheat state with heightened attack speed and movement speed, as well as a chance to burn enemies with your normal attack.\nAn actively-firing exoframe can be manually halted and cooled down by holding down its corresponding skill button.\nIf allowed to peak, excess Heat will trigger an Overload, rendering you unable to perform any action for a time in addition to initiating an extended cooldown on all skills.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/otherworld-legends-synthia"}
