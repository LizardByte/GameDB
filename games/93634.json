Reports of space hippies, mutant flies, and sherbet pirates have been coming in throughout the week, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nHow you can help:\nEarth defense forces are engaged in preventing giant insects from eating the surprisingly delicious city of New York, so orbital farms have been relying on freelancers and mercenaries to keep the sherbet flowing. You can join the fight by downloading Sherbet Thieves.\n\nThis will install a twin-stick sherbet defense simulator (patent pending) that can be used to remotely operate the jetpack-equipped hayseed mercenary, Proton Joe.\n\nOnce you start the simulator, Crop Circle Local 518 President and alien conspiracy expert, Farmer Dan, will provide you with further instructions!", "summary": "Sherbet Thieves is a 2D indie game that combines twin-stick shooting and defense mechanics.\n\nAs jetpack mercenary Proton Joe, the goal is to prevent sherbet pirates, space hippies with the munchies, and other aliens from stealing sherbet from Farmer Dan\u2019s orbital farm. The player is paid in moonshine depending on how well they did at protecting the sherbet. Between levels weapons and upgrades can be purchased with this moonshine.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels, 19 story-mode levels, and a never-ending survival mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sherbet-thieves", "videos": [{"id": 52809, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HjsUmlHKRx0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjsUmlHKRx0", "title": "Sherbet Thieves Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HjsUmlHKRx0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
