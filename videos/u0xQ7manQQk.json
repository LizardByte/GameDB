{"id": "u0xQ7manQQk", "snippet": {"title": "Road Construction Ahead (PC, 1996) - All Video Files", "description": "NOTE: Each of the video clips are labeled by their respective original names.\n\nRoad Construction Ahead is practically an educational PC game from 1996, published by Simon & Schuster Interactive (most known to YTP folks like me as the publishers of I.M. Meen). The game is said to be based off of a Fred Levine Production video from 1991 that's also called \"Road Construction Ahead\".\n\nI just happen to have a physical CD-ROM copy of this game in my computer game collection that I've kept for so many years, and while I did try installing the game, it doesn't work, since I have a Windows 10 and this game was built for Windows 95 computers. Maybe one day when I have the time I could get VirtualBox to run it on there. So, I decided to do a little bit of file digging inside the disk to see if I could find anything. Then I came across the game's \"MEDIA\" folder. It contained a LOT of audio files, as well as a handful of video files. All of the video files were in a .MOV format, so unlike the audio files where they had no file extension, the video files didn't need to be converted to play properly. After compiling the video files, the end result is 17 minutes of video footage from the game's disk.\n\nI don't think YouTube has documented much of the game, so here you go.\n\nSound clips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28B7VhvXNXg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0xQ7manQQk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0xQ7manQQk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0xQ7manQQk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0xQ7manQQk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u0xQ7manQQk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Road Construction Ahead (PC, 1996) - All Video Files", "description": "NOTE: Each of the video clips are labeled by their respective original names.\n\nRoad Construction Ahead is practically an educational PC game from 1996, published by Simon & Schuster Interactive (most known to YTP folks like me as the publishers of I.M.
