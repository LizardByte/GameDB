Leaves fall, and spirits rise from the fallen leaves to begin their journey home. Guide them by changing how the wind blows or by rebuilding the ground. Each spirit can be sacrificed to perform one of four actions -- build a bridge of leaves, create a blowing cloud, dig tunnels, or block wind currents in an area. Use your actions wisely or you will run out of spirits. In each level it's up to you to find your own creative solution on how to get the spirits to the goal.\n\nhttp://www.spacesofplay.com/spirits\n\nTrailer by Kert Gartner\nhttp://kertgartner.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xsiwROHN35c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xsiwROHN35c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xsiwROHN35c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xsiwROHN35c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xsiwROHN35c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Spirits Game Trailer - PC, Mac, Linux, iOS", "description": "Autumn is coming.
