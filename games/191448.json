Management rights are distributed among holders of SNK tokens. Holders manage the Cryptosnake game and SNK's financial risk, ensuring stability, transparency and efficiency. For this, the management system providing polls and administrative voting will be built in 2022. The number of votes is proportional to the number of SNK tokens that the participant sent to the address of the voting contract. In other words, the more SNK tokens a voting participant contributes, the more he influences the final decision.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cryptosnake"}
