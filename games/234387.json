You jump in to save it, and the next thing you know, everything turns black.\n\nWhen you open your eyes and realize you're now just a wandering soul, you're approached by three cute demon girls. You expect to be their next meal, but instead, they sweep you away to a quaint, little cafe where you're greeted by the cat you just rescued! Apparently the cat is the owner of the establishment, and as thanks for saving his life, he's offered you a position to work for him as a waiter. He promises to bring you back to your body, but only if you do a good job\u2014so get cracking!\n\nLuckily you'll have your cute coworkers to guide you, that is if they're not already planning some mischief of their own.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-sweet-devilish-maids"}
