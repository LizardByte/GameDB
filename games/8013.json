You can race as 10 different characters on 16 unique tracks. The racing action takes place in four different modes: Extreme, Grand Prix, Sprint, and Time Trial. Extreme has players trying to earn cups in a series of races, where the ultimate goal is to win first place in each race. Grand Prix stages races on the same tracks, but players are awarded points based on where they finish. Doing well in the races in both modes allows you to upgrade your vehicle. Both the Sprint and Time Trial modes allow for competition without the bloodlust of the other two modes. If you want to compete against another person, you can via a link cable. Race with a hyperactive bird in WOODY WOODPECKER RACING.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/woody-woodpecker-racing"}
