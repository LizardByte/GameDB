During the attack, the ChronoSphere was damaged causing it to malfunction. This malfunction created a time bubble around the island which resets itself every 15 minutes. With each reset, the bubble grows. If unconstrained, it will engulf the whole planet. Eventually, the entire universe will be trapped in a time loop.\n\nDo you want to \u201cProtect our Past\u201d or \u201cFight for a new Future\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s time to decide whose side you\u2019re on.", "summary": "Time is your weapon in this online PVP first-person team shooter.
