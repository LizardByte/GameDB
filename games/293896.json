They have noticed a threatening drop in the level of positive energy on Planet Earth, one of the driving forces of the realm of energetic beings who live in symbiosis with the realm of material beings and who, if they become unbalanced, will suffer the negative effects through excesses or shortages of energy in our world.\n\nWhen they ask for your help, they will tell you that, many years ago in our human time, they installed \"positive energy\" channels in various monuments throughout Planet Earth.\nSurprisingly, when they came to inspect their positive energy sources, they realized that they were deteriorating much faster than expected. They were being covered by a layer of negative energy, unbalancing their realm and threatening our existence.\n\nJoin Bivolt and Risoluminosa and discover what's going wrong with the world's monuments.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blackout-uma-aventura-energetica"}
