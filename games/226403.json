However, after gunning down the Omega Metroid, she looked around, finding no exit before the subzero temperatures knocked her out cold (pun somewhat intended). When she woke up, she found herself in her regular power suit, in a different area of the station. While she was all there in one piece, there was one problem\u2013the milk wasn\u2019t! And Samus knew better than to fail Adam\u2019s orders at 3 AM.\n\nThis contest hack continues the tale of Samus\u2019s venture to get Adam a glass of milk, this time as a hack of a game few have ever attempted making hacks for. Will Samus get through okay and recover the milk once again? Find out in Samus Goes to the Fridge to Get a Glass of Milk II!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
