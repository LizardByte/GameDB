As she peers deeper into the mystery, her perception of reality slowly crumbles around her, leaving her to question every intricacy of her surroundings.\n\nUnder the neon lights of a cyperpunk dystopia, the ruins of the Chung Sing building hide a bloody mystery illuminated by both the traditions of Chinese folklore and the innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei-Lin must explore this complex, piecing together the stories of 14 lost souls, and discover the truth of her own family curse. With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, Sense hopes to return the horror genre to its roots; celebrating the slow, fearful creep of dread instead of turning to action and jump scares. Mei is not a trained agent; she is a programmer and not a soldier; the ghosts \u2013 the glitches of reality \u2013 are spirits and not spectral zombies; and the scares are from within, not from the horrors around.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sense-a-cyberpunk-ghost-story", "videos": [{"id": 29376, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9qdq2jMwjbs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qdq2jMwjbs", "title": "Sense: A Cyberpunk Ghost Story Trailer 2 [2018]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9qdq2jMwjbs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
