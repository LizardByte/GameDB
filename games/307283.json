Firing at 600 rounds-per-minute, the Gustav provides accurate single shots, whilst also offering great control in continuous fire.\n\nA powerful pump-action shotgun, the Trench Gun first saw use by US Forces during World Wars I & II. Fed with 12-gauge shells from its 6-round tube magazine, it sacrifices range and fire rate for extreme damage in close quarters.\n\nThe Double 1866 is a double-barrel pocket pistol designed in the 19th Century as an easily concealable backup gun that can be drawn at speed. Despite only featuring a single-action trigger and producing a very low muzzle velocity, the D.1866's unique traits make for a powerful weapon at close range.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sniper-elite-5-trench-warfare-weapon-pack"}
