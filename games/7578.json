Each survivor has a fatal flaw in their character, and in an attempt to crush their spirits, AM has constructed a metaphorical adventure for each that preys upon their weaknesses. To succeed in the game, the player must make choices to prove that humans are better than machines, because they have the ability to redeem themselves. Woven into the fabric of the story are ethical dilemmas dealing with issues such as insanity, rape, paranoia and genocide.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 6621, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wuIdKnIc7PM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuIdKnIc7PM", "title": "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream - trailer #1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wuIdKnIc7PM/sddefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 6967, "name": "AM"}]}
