Developed by TomSmizzle, this physics-based indie game has simple controls and an even-simpler objective. However, this makes it a really short experience as it doesn\u2019t have any fail conditions, so you\u2019re bound to get things right even if your movements are wonky. This game can feel incomplete due to its short length.\n\nGalactic Beacon Brigade has a simple premise: reconnect the galaxy with your mouse cursor-looking spaceship. To do this, you have to fly the ship between the two pulsing points on the screen by using either the W, A, and D keys or the arrow keys to steer the ship. However, space doesn\u2019t allow for precise turning, so expect your ship to float past and start hitting the sides of the screen like a pinball.by activating the beacons!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/galactic-beacon-brigade"}
