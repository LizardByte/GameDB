Now home to the lawless and brave, things are slowly rebuilding. Immigrants from Sol's other planets arrive seeking a new life. Freelancing bounty hunters are all that remain to uphold a new, tenuous sense of order.\n\nNone knew that the bombing of Ganymede's capital had awakened something long in hibernation. A mysterious force emerged capable of corrupting machines, turning them into hostile killing machines.\n\nJupiter Moons: Mecha puts you in the pilot seat of a bounty hunting mech. Take on the industrial muscle of the Taka Construction, outsmart the elite swiftness of the Gendai Spec and fight beard to beard with a group of mech pirates.
