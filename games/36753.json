Few dared participate in such a sports festival, yet some teams were brave enough to do so. Those teams were the Nekketsu High School team led by Kunio, the Hananzono High School team led by Riki, and the union team brought together by Gouda.\n\nAnd so, the festival kicked off with just four teams.", "summary": "Reihou Academy Student Council proposed a friendly athletic meet-up to apologize for the wrongdoings done by student council president Yamada.

Instead he is plotting to crush the other schools, and reinstates The Double Dragons despite them being expelled for their kidnapping of Mami.\n\nNobody hesitates to participate. Nekketsu High School, led by Kunio, Hanazono High School led by Riki and Interschool Union led by Gouda all announce their participation in the competition.
