It is the sequel to Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, where Kamek and the Toadies have kidnapped all the babies in the world in search for the star children, a group of seven babies who possess powerful stars in their hearts. While the game is heavily derivative from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, including general gameplay, themes, and graphics, the game primarily differentiates itself from its predecessor by taking advantage of the Nintendo DS's dual screen to display levels while introducing multiple babies to carry on Yoshi's back, who all have special abilities that are required to complete levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 20865, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "bQDvtHBc-54", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQDvtHBc-54", "title": "Yoshi's Island DS (NDS) Longplay [164]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQDvtHBc-54/sddefault.jpg"}]}
