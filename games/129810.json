It thus contains themes and language not suited for the faint of heart.\nThe current version of Clover has been in the works for over 4 whole years with effort worth thousands of hours by over 40 contributors, and with an estimated play time of over 100 hours, Clover is sure to bring you moments filled with joy, frustration, laughter and suffering!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-clover", "videos": [{"id": 37921, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0RympaeJSUc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RympaeJSUc", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon Clover Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0RympaeJSUc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
