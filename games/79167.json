However, the club\u2019s existence is in danger with one of the student council president candidates, Satsuki, vowing to close all clubs that don\u2019t do anything. Since their club is in this list, they do their best to save it but there\u2019s no other way but to participate in the student council president elections and defeat her. Yuuki is persuaded by Chisato to run in the election. At first he isn\u2019t interested at all, but since the club members are trying their hardest, he too wants to win to save the club.", "summary": "Love, Election & Chocolate is a romance visual novel that puts the player in the shoes of a male student named Yuuki Oojima.
