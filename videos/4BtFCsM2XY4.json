Since then, the protagonist has been looked down upon as V.E was now a Stray Summon and his/her new boss at the same time.\n\nCertain day, an unknown summon beast appears at their workshop and injures V.E, making the main character angry. After chasing the summon beast, he/she meets a mysterious girl named Murno, and after saving her from Bostaph's men, he noticed that the summon beast was Murno's guardian beast. Afterwards, as an apology for the trouble caused, Murno would have to live with them, helping V.E with the house chores; her guardian beast would become the protagonist's partner, and the protagonist makes a vow to protect Murno with the help of his/her new partner.
