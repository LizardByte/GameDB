A player must keep the defense from enemies coming from three lines, killing them by blades. To start the blade, you must print the words that are shown separately for each ready to use projectile. It should be noted that the game has 10 missions with different playing tasks and two game modes. Wordkiller is very easy to learn, but  only masters can go through all the missions in all the modes. So, the game is suitable for both new and experienced PC users. By the way, fans of bloody deaths and spray of limbs will also like Wordkiller, as it has spectacular murders in different settings. Combining business with pleasure, Wordkiller is a good alternative to keyboard simulators available in the market.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vD1S64hm2Dw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vD1S64hm2Dw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vD1S64hm2Dw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vD1S64hm2Dw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vD1S64hm2Dw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Word Killer: Revolution (Trailer Story) EN", "description": "Wordkiller is an unusual mixture of a keyboard simulator and an arcade game, in which a user is motivated to learn to print faster and make fewer mistakes in the form of a game.
