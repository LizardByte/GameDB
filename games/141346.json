The celestial lords await them observing their fighting style to fight you, the player, on your own level!\n\nEach hero travels deep into the crust of their planet, Teiresia, in the name of each of their warring factions. They seek what it would mean to serve, to honor, and to claim glory. Deep in the Sistine Divide, lies a miracle mineral, the Petrago. A place where many heroes on both sides meet their end outside of the Domini-Valkan conflict. Shambling back to life, these heroes join the teeming horde known only as the Slain. Where once Petrago promised an end to the bloody conflict, it now threatens the whole planet. No longer does Petrago fuel the war that ravages the face of Teiresia; the mineral's soul revival properties serve only as a purgatory of endless battle that serve no nation.", "summary": "Yomi Domini is an action-adventure game that tracks your tendencies while progressing through the level.
