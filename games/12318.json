Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-shuttle-a-journey-into-space", "videos": [{"id": 110836, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BhCxJDjNrrs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhCxJDjNrrs", "title": "Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space for the Atari 8-bit family", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BhCxJDjNrrs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
