{"id": 43568, "name": "Quest for Sleeping Beauty", "summary": "The Sleeping Beauty legend dates from medieval times, and first appears in print as Sleeping Beauty in the Woods in the late 17th century. The version with which most modern audiences are familiar is based on a tale published in Germany by the Brothers Grimm in the early 1800s, popularized as a ballet in 1890 and later as a movie by Walt Disney. \nQuest For Sleeping Beauty is not the developer's first foray into the fantastical. Spiral House's past projects include Ghost Master and Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare. \nIn order to ensure an entirely child-friendly game, with a PEGI rating of 3+, the developer has created a \"combat system\" based entirely on immobilizing, scaring or avoiding enemies, with no blood or violence."}
