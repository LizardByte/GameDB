We spread across the solar system but, as the centuries passed, the billionaires that saved mankind retained their stranglehold on our lives. While most of us barely clung to life, the wealthy lived in luxury, extending their lives and augmenting themselves with superpowers. They made themselves Gods.\n\nWhen the putrid beasts and terrifying shambling monsters emerged, we dubbed this new threat \"The Corruption\". Once again, our self-appointed Gods intervened and, in their image, they created Enforcers. Once-regular people were granted superpowers to fight The Corruption and became the fists of the Corporatocracy. Even now they patrol the solar system at the behest of their creators.\n\nYou have joined the ranks of the Enforcers and must do whatever is needed to maintain order and ensure humanity\u2019s future. Welcome to the fight!", "summary": "An alien threat looms in a new comicbook-inspired Action RPG!
