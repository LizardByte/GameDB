While it does not have any new levels, it does bring several new modes:\n- Survival: comes in 2 or 5 minute variants, try to get the highest score within the allotted time without dying!\n- Endurance: the game will end when your time runs out. Get the highest score possible and keep your timer up by collecting yorbs!\n\nThere are also nice new QOL features:\n- A brand new set of sound effects by @doricdream498! No more crusty fake NES sounds.\n- Different resolution supports, with a handful of fun window borders. Most of these are based off Arcade, Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition, and the classic Super Freaks games, but there's a nice Dig Dug inspired one by @milesgames944.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhNQuCVuxDQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhNQuCVuxDQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhNQuCVuxDQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhNQuCVuxDQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FhNQuCVuxDQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Freaks Arcade v4.0 [DOWNLOAD LINK IN DESCRIPTION]", "description": "ITCH: https://superfreaksdev.itch.io/super-freaks-arcade\nSFGHQ: https://www.sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/super-freaks-arcade.2239/\n\nJust in time for SAGE 2024! \nSuper Freaks Arcade 4.0 is the biggest update yet.
