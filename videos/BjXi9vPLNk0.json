As a team sport, Echo Arena rewards players that work well together; with the incredible social expression offered by the Oculus Touch platform, you\u2019ll be able signal for a pass with a shout and a wave just as you naturally would, while throwing and catching the disc becomes a valuable skill to master. Even better though, Echo Arena is also full-contact sport: make a fist and use a swift punch to an opponent\u2019s head to stun them, or grab onto another player\u2019s back and catch a ride down-field. And of course, after you score a goal you can flaunt it with your own victory dance.\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/LoneEchoGame\nFollow Us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/LoneEchoGame\nFollow Us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/LoneEchoGame\n\nhttp://www.loneecho.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BjXi9vPLNk0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BjXi9vPLNk0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BjXi9vPLNk0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BjXi9vPLNk0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BjXi9vPLNk0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lone Echo - Echo Arena", "description": "In Echo Arena \u2014 the fast-paced competitive multiplayer mode for Lone Echo \u2014 you\u2019ll join a team of up to four other players and face off against the competition in a zero-g clash of robotic glory as you glide, boost, and punch your way to scoring goals in a breathtaking virtual arena.
