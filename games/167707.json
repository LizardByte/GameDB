You can punch holes in an object, slice it, apply forces and heat to it, set it on fire, and smash it with bomb explosions. Once water starts rushing inside the object, it will start sinking and, if you're lucky enough, it will start breaking up!", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/floating-sandbox", "videos": [{"id": 124577, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LkYAFKVdZec", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkYAFKVdZec", "title": "Floating Sandbox Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LkYAFKVdZec/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 128221, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LkYAFKVdZec", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkYAFKVdZec", "title": "Floating Sandbox Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LkYAFKVdZec/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
