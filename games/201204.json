It's a traditional fangame, but there are two unique elements to this game. First is that you can't wake up once you've entered the dream world. Secondly, a timer appears limiting your time in the dream world. You're given two minutes to explore and collect effects. The game ends when the timer reaches zero.\n\nYou play as a girl named Sazanami, who is staying in a hotel/dorm with what appear to be her two classmates.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ryokou-chuu"}
