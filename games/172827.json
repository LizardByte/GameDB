After leaving Sophie\u2019s hometown of Kirchen Bell, the pair discovers a huge tree identical to one that Plachta had seen in a dream, and as they get closer, a mysterious vortex pulls them inside. Sophie awakens alone in a curious new world called Erde Wiege, and it\u2019s not long before she hears about an alchemist named Plachta that lives on the outskirts of town. Shockingly, when Sophie arrives at the atelier, she meets a young alchemy enthusiast named Plachta, and even though the alchemist shares the same name as her friend, she doesn\u2019t recognize Sophie. What other surprises await Sophie on this journey? As the adventure continues, Sophie meets aspiring alchemist, Ramizel Erlenmeyer, who willingly agrees to help her in her time of need. The narrative elegantly unfolds with a charming new visual style that combines the art of the Mysterious sub-series with the high-quality graphics and animations featured in 2021\u2019s Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy.", "summary": "The latest entry in the series follows the beloved alchemist, Sophie Neuenmuller, shortly after her adventures in 2016\u2019s Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book.\n\nThe Limited edition comes with:\n- Game: Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream Game\n- Japanese Import Atelier Sophie 2 Art Book\n- Japanese Import Atelier Sophie 2 Extra BGM\n- Japanese Import Original Art B3 Fabric Poster\n- Japanese Import Sophie's Whale Necklace Keychain\n- North American Pre-Release \u201cMy New Look\u201d Costume Download Code\n- North American Collector's box", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atelier-sophie-2-the-alchemist-of-the-mysterious-dream-limited-edition", "videos": [{"id": 55474, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "k4JDtJ5Z5nQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4JDtJ5Z5nQ", "title": "Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k4JDtJ5Z5nQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
