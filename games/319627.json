Attending the Kotohira Middle School as a student with an ear for music, the player engages in interaction with seven female students who play in the school band. Some girls specialize in vocals and others wield instruments in the pop section. Music provides the glue for possible friendships and amorous maneuvers. A supporting cast of other characters including classmates, teachers and your uncle also supply additional interaction and bolster the storyline. The bulk of the interaction leads up to the school festival where you and band members hope to create beautiful music together.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/canary-kono-omoi-wo-uta-ni-nosete--1", "videos": [{"id": 131365, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "qDse0L0L4ac", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDse0L0L4ac", "title": "\u30ab\u30ca\u30ea\u30a2\uff5e\u3053\u306e\u60f3\u3044\u3092\u6b4c\u306b\u4e57\u305b\u3066\uff5e", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qDse0L0L4ac/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
