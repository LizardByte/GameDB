There is a wide variety of different units, including jets, helicopters, tanks, etc. Whenever a unit approaches an enemy unit, it can perform an attack, assuming that its weapons remain in range. Attacks are displayed as separate screens, graphically displaying the results. The player can choose to give up when it is clear that there are no chances for victory. Either way, a successful invasion of the opponent results in Game Over.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/angel-army", "videos": [{"id": 115524, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "aALCsTi0r5o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aALCsTi0r5o", "title": "[191]\u3000PC98\u7248\u300e\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u2606\u30a2\u30fc\u30df\u30fc\uff08Angel Army\uff09\u300fOP\u3000MOVIE", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aALCsTi0r5o/sddefault.jpg"}]}
