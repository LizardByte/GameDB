The protagonist is Sun Wukong, the King Monkey, one of the most popular characters in the Chinese culture.\n\nAfter completing the first stage, the player can play the other six in any order. Each of the stages revolve around elements, such as fire and water. After each stage, the player gains a new weapon, much like in the original Mega Man series, which was extremely popular at the time.
