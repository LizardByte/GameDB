In the application, the owner of the house said that some dark figure was watching him from the forest, and strange sounds were constantly heard in the house, as if someone or something was crawling along the walls. Police officer Harry Whippet went to this challenge. Nobody saw him again. Only a week later, footage from a police officer's body camera was found.\n\nThis is a monster that lives in the dense dark forests of a small town. Rootman tortures and kills everyone who wanders into his domain. The legend speaks of murders, cursed artifacts, and the supernatural behavior of trees. It is said that its roots go deep into the earth, and Rutman's body consists of twisted gnarled branches and roots. No one knows how old he is and where he came from, but the townspeople are still afraid of him. He has the ability to manipulate surrounding trees and plants, using them to trap his victims. It is said that, once in its grasp, the roots tightly wrap around the body, squeezing the life out of the victim. The town lives in fear of Rootman, never going too far into the forest for fear of encountering the monster. It is said that on quiet, moonless nights, Rootman's whisper can be heard through the trees, reminding the city of his omnipresent presence and of the danger lurking in the forest.", "summary": "Realistic first person bodycam horror.
