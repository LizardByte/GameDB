One day he went out of his cave and saw a pterodactyl flying around. \"That will be my dinner\", - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...", "summary": "You control the \"Big Nose\" character, who is running through many islands to find his dinner, because he is very hungry. Along the way, Big Nose collects bones, that he can use to buy items from the various shops that include spells, upgrades to his abilities and items.\n\nThis game is also very difficult because you cannot restart from where you left off once all your lives are gone. It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club. There are also many pitfalls, traps and deadly lava/water since Big Nose can't swim.\nIt was followed by a sequel in 1992.\n\nA Master System and Game Gear version called Dinobasher was completed, but never published.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 53506, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Af08AJMIhKs"}, {"id": 53507, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "s1-5P9DeVy4"}]}
