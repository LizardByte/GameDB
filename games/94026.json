As usual for the beatmania series, the player is given seven piano keys and a turntable, and must play along with the notes that scroll down the screen to play the music. All of the game modes from the previous title have returned: Arcade, Expert, Class, Beginner's, Free, Training, and Gallery. The game also includes support for Internet score ranking (now discontinued) and custom-made Arcade courses."}
