It features no scope options but is arguably best-in-class for ironsight usage and is capable of firing fast, accurate shots at medium range, with great overall stability.\n\nYou will also receive the striking British Dazzle weapon skin, available for all weapons, pays homage to the dazzle camouflage design used on British tanks during desert campaigns.\n\nFinally, both Karl and Monika receive new character skins. The British Bomber skin for Karl gives him a distinct aviator look while the Air Auxiliary skin for Monika reflects the uniforms worn by the women\u2019s air-corps whose job was to transport new or repaired planes to active military airfields throughout the UK.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sniper-elite-5-death-from-above-weapon-and-skin-pack"}
