They were called the Legendary Dogs, and they often wandered around the region. One day, they decided to hide in the Brass Tower in Iris City. At that time, it was a city full of tourists from many regions where legends from all over were shared. The Brass Tower was built in honor of Lugia, a foreign Legendary Pok\u00e9mon. It is said to be the Pok\u00e9mon of memories, and people who entered the tower would often recall forgotten memories. The Bell Tower was built in honor of Ho-oh. It was rumored that when it shows its rainbow-shaped wings, the person who looks at it becomes immortal.\n\nOnce, the two Pok\u00e9mon happened to be in their towers at the same time. They faced each other, and their fight caused a fierce storm. Lightning struck the Brass Tower and it caught fire with the Legendary Dogs inside. They sadly lost their lives and their souls rest in the Burned Tower.\n\nOne of the three Pok\u00e9mon dropped a crystal shard that made certain Pok\u00e9mon change shape, but only a good trainer could handle it. Maybe that trainer can free those souls.\n\nMeanwhile, foreign Pok\u00e9mon are immigrating to Johto. They're hiding from other Pok\u00e9mon, as they haven't yet adapted to the region. Professor Oak gives you a Pok\u00e9dex to research them.", "summary": "Pokemon Crystal fan remake with next-gen improvements", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-cuerpo-de-cristal", "videos": [{"id": 118524, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "msed25Wix2U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msed25Wix2U", "title": "Lugia forma Recuerdo vs Ho-oh forma Arcoiris", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/msed25Wix2U/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
