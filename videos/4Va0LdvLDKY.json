{"id": "4Va0LdvLDKY", "snippet": {"title": "ODS Robot Challenge - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) Longplay", "description": "ODS Robot Challenge is an educational game released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997. The game tasks you with matching patterns, shapes, colors, numbers, and dominoes. The difficulty increases every level, with 40 levels total. Blit the robot tells you the challenge, and then another robot cheers when you clear each board.\n\nThis longplay clears all 40 levels in the game. After finishing level 40, the game puts you on level 16, and your score continues to increase. When you make a mistake, your score decreases. This includes levels where the cards are upside down and you have to make mistakes to see what pattern is on each card.\n\nI wanted to upload this because Ohio Distinctive Software was a big part of my childhood and I couldn't find any footage of it on Youtube. Fortunately this game along with many other Ohio Distinctive games has been preserved digitally and can be found archived online. \n\nOhio Distinctive still operates but seems to be out of software publishing. Their facebook page suggests that they shut down during covid and reopened selling items such as mugs.\n\nIf you played this game please comment and let me know the when and where. My mother worked for the marketing firm that Ohio Distinctive used, so we ended up with discs of many of their games. I'm guessing that if anyone else played these games it would have been in a school setting but I'm not sure.\n\nThis session was recorded on December 9th, 2022 using DOSBox running Windows 3.1.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Va0LdvLDKY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Va0LdvLDKY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Va0LdvLDKY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "ODS Robot Challenge - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) Longplay", "description": "ODS Robot Challenge is an educational game released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997.
