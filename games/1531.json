Jak loses and tries to turn into Dark Jak, though fails to do so due to the eco instability, subsequently dealing him great pain. Phoenix witnesses Jak's attempt to transform, stating there are more people like Jak and prepares to shoot to kill him. At this point Daxter manages to run Phoenix off by shooting at him with the Hellcat's tailgun, but also shoots their own ship, causing a fuel leak, forcing Keira to crash land on to Brink Island.", "summary": "Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier is a 2009 platform game developed by High Impact Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game is the sixth and final game in the Jak and Daxter series.
