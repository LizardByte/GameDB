Sure, we conquered the Solar System, and went far beyond. We looked for life beyond Earth, and boy we found it. And, was it worth it?\n\nNah. All we found out is the rest of the universe is a dirty mess of blood and crime. Gone are the days when we dreamt of flying cars and robotic assistants: flying cars are what drug smugglers use to run away, and your robotic assistant just murdered your wife, get it?\n\nSo here we are, five guys, and a job no-one wants to do. Do you have a dictator who just went crazy on Saturn VII? Here comes the KillSquad to murder him. And his family, just in case little Nicky wants to be like daddy one day. Got a rogue planet not paying your taxes? We sure can handle that. And that alien race who just conquered your home planet? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll kick them out. But it ain\u2019t gonna be cheap. Nor clean. There will be blood everywhere. And yes they\u2019ll hate us. But we will get the job done.\n\nWhen the rest say no, we say yes. When the rest talk and negotiate, we shoot and bomb. We\u2019re a KillSquad. Who sends us? That\u2019s none of your business. If you hired us, consider the problem solved. If they hired us, consider yourself dead.\n\nThe universe is dirty. We\u2019re just the cleaning squad.", "summary": "Hack and slash? Check. Twin-stick-shooter?
