Two versions were released - a non-SoundLink game and a SoundLink game. Little is known about this SoundLink version outside of surviving videos, but it was distributed in two halves in August 1997 and had a similar announcer and redone soundtrack as the previous Satellaview entry. At least the first week rearranged a few courses, and replaced two with new locations called \"Forest I\" and \"Forest II\". Presuming no areas were repeated, this likely means the SoundLink version had twice as many courses total. In addition, it can be seen that the player cannot choose between Grand Prix and Practice modes in the SoundLink version; as it was a live broadcast, the player is forced to play each course in a timed Practice mode, and then the Grand Prix race.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-f-zero-grand-prix-2-dai-2-shuu", "videos": [{"id": 58956, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "urp8aF71YMY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urp8aF71YMY", "title": "BS F-ZERO \u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea2\u3000\u7b2c2\u9031", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/urp8aF71YMY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
