The crew is scattered throughout the territory of the alien planet, most of the equipment is damaged. You play as a ship's artificial intelligence. Your task is to build a city and recover resources to find a team and return to your home planet.\n\nCreate more complex inventions and buildings: they will give you a lot of possibilities. Copper ore can be used to make wire, then make an electrically conductive cable, and then an assembly machine. So keep progressing.\n\nLook for copper and iron ore, timber and crystals, granite and oil. You have to build installations, conduct electricity, improve the performance of systems. With each step you will pump the city and create improved materials.\n\nMove from simple technologies to microelectronics, chemical reactions, creation of explosive substances. Build a factory or a whole network of factories. More technologies \u2014 more opportunities and chances to find the ship's crew.\n\nGradually, you will open up more territories for the construction of new factories. No doubt your city's growth will attract unwanted guests, but what can't you do to save the crew?\n\nFight with them on your own and develop the reflection of attacks. Building solid walls is just the beginning of the journey. Create mines and powerful cannons, fight with chemical weapons and armoring drones.\n\nReFactory is not just about building production sites. This is a world that lives by your rules and develops in proportion to your mistakes. Wrong resources distribution will halt the development of the city, and outdated technologies will not repel an attack. Think a few steps ahead and keep the factory safe.\nConsider a number of factors to design interaction processes: electricity conduction, copper recycling, economic strategy ... New information is introduced gradually, so that soon you will begin to navigate intuitively.", "summary": "Welcome to ReFactory!\nThis is a sandbox strategy game where you have to build an automated factory on an alien planet. This is an amazing world that will work according to your laws. That story begins in space."}
