It is the fifth game in Samurai Shodown series and the seventh of the official chronology. It was SNK's first attempt to bring one of their franchises into the 3D realm. It received relatively no distribution outside of Japan, and is thus not very well known. After having released two semi-prequels in the Samurai Shodown series on the 16-bit Neo Geo, SNK announced that they would be producing a new arcade hardware platform, this one 64-bit and with extensive 3D capabilities.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-shodown-64", "videos": [{"id": 38553, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "F2MbhtWQzTU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2MbhtWQzTU", "title": "Samurai Shodown 64: Intro Neo Geo Hyper 64 SNK", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F2MbhtWQzTU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
