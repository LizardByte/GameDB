{"id": "n0-pdxDHvJ8", "snippet": {"title": "The King of Fighters XI playthrough (PS2) (1CC)", "description": "60fps available!\n\nPlaythrough with the Art of Fighting team. KoF XI is one of the highlights of the series. The game has a huge character roster, and the PS2 version features several extra characters who were never in the arcade version. These characters include Robert and Mai, who's sprites have been taken from Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.\n\nThe game features the same character swapping option KoF 03 had, but has more options. Quick shift lets you swap characters during a combo, whilst saving shift lets you swap characters whilst under attack by the opponent. Being able to use these shifts depends on the new skill bar meter, which is a new gauge that's separate to the super move gauge.\n\nAnother new feature is the \"dream cancel\", which lets your team leader cancel a super move into their leader super move, something which can be seen when Ryo fights Magaki in this video.\n\nThe game features two bosses. Shion is the first, who usually isn't that difficult, but I really made a mess of the fight and had no health left at all when I beat him, and I only won because I did a random super and hoped for the best.\n\nMagaki is the final boss and is the worst KoF boss ever. For some reason SNK decided that for the final boss the game needed to become a shoot 'em up rather than a fighting game. I have no idea how I was able to beat him even after re-watching this video, and I nearly reset the game when King went out so quickly. Magaki makes '94 Rugal look easy.\n\nIn addition to the extra characters, the PS2 version also has a few other extra features, such as some new backgrounds and a gallery mode. The European version -which is what I'm using for this video -unfortunately had a few bugs in it, which is annoying. The Euro version was published by Ignition Entertainment, who delayed the game more than once, yet STILL managed to leave a couple of glitches in. You can see some of the bugs here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnCcnDWIi7Y", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n0-pdxDHvJ8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n0-pdxDHvJ8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n0-pdxDHvJ8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "The King of Fighters XI playthrough (PS2) (1CC)", "description": "60fps available!\n\nPlaythrough with the Art of Fighting team.
