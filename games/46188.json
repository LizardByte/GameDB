Each player controls the team captain of one of the teams. The original coin-op cabinet was set up with two joysticks and one screen, with both players sharing that same screen; if either player's team captain falls off the screen, he is quickly able to catch up and get back into the action.\n\nA version for the Sega Genesis, retitled Pigskin Footbrawl and endorsed by coach Jerry Glanville, was released by Razor Soft", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jerry-glanvilles-pigskin-footbrawl"}
