He is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy and other Disney characters who help him on his quest.\n\nIn the original and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts, the command menu had four commands: Attack, Magic, Items, and a fourth context-sensitive slot that varied depending on what the player had targeted, where they were, etc. The command menu has been updated to include \"Attack\", \"Magic\", \"Items\", and \"Summons\" in the fourth slot, which was originally located as a sub-category beneath the \"Magic\" menu. The original fourth command has been replaced by the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button. The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II, utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora, as opposed to the original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera. Overall, the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re:Chain of Memories, to create a more consistent play style throughout the series.\n\nIt was released in North America, Europe and Australia for the first time as part of the collection.\n\nKingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories\nMain article: Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories\nKingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories is a direct sequel to Kingdom Hearts, and its ending is set about a year before Kingdom Hearts II. The game follows Sora and friends, exploring a mysterious castle. There, Riku explores the basement levels and fights the darkness.\n\nThis version of Chain of Memories was released in Europe and Australia for the first time as part of the collection, as it was previously released in North America in December 2008.\n\nKingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\nMain article: Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days\nThe story takes place near the end of Kingdom Hearts, continuing parallel to Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. The story is told from the perspective of Roxas, following his daily life within Organization XIII and his relationship with fellow Organization member Axel; it also introduces a fourteenth member, Xion, who becomes friends with the former two.\n\n358/2 Days does not appear in playable form, and instead features the Nintendo DS game adapted into 2 hours and 50 minutes worth of cinematic retelling, and features Trophy support.", "summary": "A limited edition release of the HD remaster compilation Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX, packaged on one disc in a collectible hardback art book case.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kingdom-hearts-hd-1-dot-5-remix-limited-edition", "videos": [{"id": 38301, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "W8w0zV4tx2s"}]}
