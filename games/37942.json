It was developed by Kan's and published by Yutaka in 1995.\n\nThe characters were designed by Kotobuki Shiriagari.\n\nThe game starts with an animated/cinematic intro sequence. A Japanese man and woman portrayed in the distinct business man/woman (\"Kaisha-in \u4e8b\u52d9\u54e1\") satire comedy Kotobuki Shiriagari \"Heta-Uma \u3078\u305f\u3046\u307e\" style, turn up at work but they can't understand the greetings their co-workers are saying. Suddenly a silver-haired devil turns up mumbling something. The man and woman say: \"He just said \u3057\u3064\u308c\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059, didn't he?\", prompting the start screen to launch. Logos Panic pits players to scramble Japanese Kanji in a sort of Tetris puzzle style scenario; kanji must be correctly put together in time, simultaneously as new kanji pop out at the bottom of the screen. The game ends when the player can't assemble appropriate sentences in time. At the beginning there are only eight selectable characters but as the game progresses, another three will eventually appear. It uses a password system to allow players to pick up and play at their leisure.\n\nLogos Panic is about garbled versions of greeting words. Goaisatu \"\u3054\u3042\u3044\u3055\u3064\" or greetings are the words used in the game being 'garbled' and pretty random, not just greetings. They are puzzled over the greetings \"aisatsu \u3057\u307e\u3059\". The two players have to create words that appear in red, yellow and blue at the sides of the screen, aspects to consider are players and the blue line to pay attention to, in order to correctly put the katakanas in their correct grammatical place.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/logos-panic-goaisatu"}
