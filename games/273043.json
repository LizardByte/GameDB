It is a Bustout type game, except much more advanced. Steve Bjork brought out a Bustout style game from his own company called Bash a little bit earlier, that introduced the bricks that have to be hit more than once, indestructable bricks, and brick that drop special energizers (like fat paddle, slow ball speed, magnetic paddle, etc.), but he didn't take it as far as the official Arkanoid, until this version sold on cartridge through Radio Shack came out. Then, he added the aliens coming onto the playing board from the top, and the laser powerup where you can shoot the blocks.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arkanoid--6", "videos": [{"id": 140713, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "l1FD60dORmM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1FD60dORmM", "title": "Arkanoid for the TRS-80 CoCo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l1FD60dORmM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
