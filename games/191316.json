There is no inherent goal in the game and your choices don't really matter. It's a simple introduction to our main cast.\n\nWith a relatively shallow plot and one ending, this game was something we thought about for a few years and now we finally made it (it's a bit rough and not entirely done/polished, but it is still playable).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/teenage-dirtbag"}
