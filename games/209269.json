The twist here, Dr. Light knew of Dr. Wily's trip through time to reprogram Mega Man. Now free from Wily's control, Mega Man, i.e Quint, sets out for revenge.\n\nThe game adheres closely to Mega Man 2 and 3 but moves at a much quicker pace. The whole game is built around Quint's seldom seen abilities, like Sonic Dash, ducking, and ledge grabbing. It's an interest twist of the tried-and-true NES formula. Though still in beta, the game spans fifteen stages (8 Robot Masters, an intro stage, 6 fortress stages).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quints-revenge"}
