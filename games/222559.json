They're a race with with the body of a human and ears of a beast, said to be descendants of the cat-shaped youkai known as the \"Kinme (golden eyes)\". For this reason, the Maozoku are despised by humans. Humans are told of an old legend in which cats are an outcast of the 12 signs of the zodiac. Calling cats \"Juuza (13th sign of the zodiac)\", the humans scorn them.\n\nHaving been caught in the middle of the humans' conflicts, the curse of the Kinme that had been lying within the head of the Maozoku, Ryuubi, gets amplified. As result, Ryuubi became cruel and wicked; hijacking the Enshou Forces and attempting to use them to slaughter thousands upon thousands of humans. However, due to Kan'u and her fellow Maozoku's life-risking efforts, they were able to stop Ryuubi. Thus, Ryuubi returned to his original form of a child, and the curtains close on the Battle of Guandu.\n\nFrom then on, half a year passes.\n\nSousou rose in power, dominating the Heibei province with his unrelenting power. The Maozoku now live quietly deep within the mountains of Sousou's country, in a region called Kyoto... much like old times. However, it was not to last, as Sousou razed their peaceful times because of his desire to suppress the Wuhan (proto-Mongolic nomadic people). Taking advantage of Sousou's absence, the humans of Kyoto rebelled and brutalised the Maozoku. The Maozoku continued to be on the receiving end of the humans' irrational acts of violence. Unable to retaliate, they were chased out of their village.\n\nIn the time of upheaval, the wheels of fate of the Maozoku and the humans were sure to circle once again...", "summary": "A sequel to Juuzaengi: Engetsu Sangokuden.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/juuzaengi-engetsu-sangokuden-2", "videos": [{"id": 76751, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "5zhWQMDsbFc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zhWQMDsbFc", "title": "\u5341\u4e09\u652f\u6f14\u7fa9 \u5043\u6708\u4e09\u56fd\u4f1d2 \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5zhWQMDsbFc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
