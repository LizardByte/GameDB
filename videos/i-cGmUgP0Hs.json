The \"Super Lounging Music\" is almost too relaxing;\"Oh yes, It's like no gravity, dippily, Super relaxing and Lounging kind of sound\", according to one of the two fold out manuals included. But the frantic, hysterical urgency of some of the mini-games and the \"Mixing Hour\" stages (where you play around with music from the game) will keep you glued to your tee vee for days. \n\n\n\nDevice:\nPlaystation Classic\nBleemsync 1.2\nOTG\nSandisk Cruzer Blade 128 GB\n\nCapture:\nEzcap 284 hd video capture", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-cGmUgP0Hs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-cGmUgP0Hs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-cGmUgP0Hs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-cGmUgP0Hs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i-cGmUgP0Hs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Planet DOB [Psx] - Trailer", "description": "DOB is a Japanese Future Project combines many different Music Styles ranging from Ambient, Indie, Pop to Drum'n'Bass (sometimes in one song).
