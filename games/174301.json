Star*Burst combines dazzling 3D graphics, animations and effects with classic puzzle heritage and new social features, in a fresh and fun game experience. Players must catch streams of brightly colored gems, as they flow down the conveyor deck before falling into the pit and being destroyed. Paddles will only hold five gems, so act quickly to match three or more gems on your rack and create Burst patterns to score! Bursts are formed by matching rows \u2013 horizontal, vertical, or diagonal \u2013 of the same color. Ultimate Star*Burst match-makers can build a large \u201cX\u201d with 5 gems for each diagonal and warp ahead 45 levels! Can you find the elusive Pegacorn?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-star-burst"}
