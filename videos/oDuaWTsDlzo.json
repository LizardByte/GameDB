{"id": "oDuaWTsDlzo", "snippet": {"title": "Sunday Longplay - The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Dungeon (NES ROM Hack)", "description": "Hack by arnpoly: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7358/\n\nThis week on Sunday Longplay, Zelda Month in honor of the release of Tears Of The Kingdom continues with a ROM hack of the game that started it all! Welcome to The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Dungeon!\n\nThis hack completely transforms the game into a giant 255-room randomly-generated roguelike dungeon, so it's different every time you play it. You can also choose to play with either 1st or 2nd Quest mechanics (2nd quest makes the Stalfos shoot sword beams, makes the snakes tougher, and adds red bubbles to permanently take away your sword accompanied by a single blue bubble to give it back).\n\nFeatures include:\n\nRoguelike Gameplay: Every playthrough is different and it is all included directly in the ROM file. No external randomization programs needed, just load and play!\nDynamic Enemy Loading: Normally the overworld and each dungeon has a specific set of enemies available. In Ancient Dungeon, new enemies are loaded dynamically during every room transition. This means there are no restrictions in the combinations of enemies you may encounter in the dungeon.\nAdditional Item Abilities: Some items have new functionality specific to Ancient Dungeon. Some changes are basic, like the Stepladder, which makes new water rooms available. Others have brand new functionality, like the Recorder, which now both defeats Pols Voice and forces Peahats to land.\nIn-game Timer: A built-in timer keeps track of your runtime and is shown at the end of every run, win or lose.\nSeeds: You can choose a custom seed value and play the game in seeded mode, which gives you the same randomized layout every time. This is perfect for setting up races!\nCustom Palettes: New palettes have been added that change periodically through the dungeon, providing a touch of variety.\n=======================\nFull Sunday Longplay Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcZithGR1z9D4UdD1-k0zsxoXmyD_Yj0K\nOriginal Zelda 1 Playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCL7770xRS8&list=PLcZithGR1z9DUN5eNAhFh9bggjD84xab8\nSubscribe and ring the bell for more content! https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=MetalSmasherGaming\nBackup Channel #1: https://www.bitchute.com/channel/InVB7p6lyXGX/\nBackup Channel #2: https://lbry.tv/@MetalSmasherGaming:e\nBackup Channel #3: https://www.dailymotion.com/MetalSmasher86\nMy Backloggery: http://www.backloggery.com/MetalSmasher86\nHelp Translate my Videos!: http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?tab=2&c=UCvzwp5nrPwmamBOPSwd4DNw\nGet TubeBuddy: https://www.tubebuddy.com/MetalSmasherGaming\nMy Cyberscore Profile: https://www.cyberscore.me.uk/user/2188\nMy Speedrun.com Profile: http://www.speedrun.com/user/MetalSmasher86\nTwitch: http://www.twitch.tv/Metalsmasher86\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MetalSmasher86-164602153573538/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MetalSmasher86\nSteam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalSmasher86/\n=======================\n#SundayLongplay #thelegendofzelda #ancientdungeon #ROMHack #retrogaming #gaming #YouTube #subscribe #comment #video", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oDuaWTsDlzo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oDuaWTsDlzo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oDuaWTsDlzo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oDuaWTsDlzo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oDuaWTsDlzo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sunday Longplay - The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Dungeon (NES ROM Hack)", "description": "Hack by arnpoly: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7358/\n\nThis week on Sunday Longplay, Zelda Month in honor of the release of Tears Of The Kingdom continues with a ROM hack of the game that started it all!
