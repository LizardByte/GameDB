The stage is cleared when all four chicks are caught within two minutes, but the game is over if you get caught by a Oni or run out of time. The gameplay is fast, although some mazes can be quite aggravating and some chicks quite elusive.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doka-chan-no-onigokko"}
