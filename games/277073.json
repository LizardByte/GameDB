Has a lot of custom graphics, though isn't exactly full of them. Not the best hack ever, by any margin, but I spent a very long time working on it, so I hope you enjoy it. Among its more original features are a new bonus game and several new or tweaked boss fights, with a new final boss, as well.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marios-return"}
