When the real world begins to mesh with fantasy, ordinary people seek to use mystic wishing wells to bring their desires into reality. Inspired by games such as Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi, Shenmue, and various Nintendo games, players will guide various protagonists though cities, dungeons, and an onslaught of evolving enemies. With literal ground-shattering special moves and flashy combat, players will brush off their armor and saunter back to town for a bite to eat with their friends when all is said and done - just like the genres that the game is based on.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-waves"}
