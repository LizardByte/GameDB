Once the meter is full, the player will literally catch fire and their stats will max out for a brief period of time, allowing the player to score goals better, steal the puck more often, etc. \n \nThere is five difficulty settings and adjustable options such as period time times and cheat options such as \"Big Head\" mode and multiplayer capabilities for either head-to-head action or co-op play. Chicago Blackhawks announcer, Pat Foley, lends his voice talents to the game for in-game commentary.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nhl-open-ice-2-on-2-challenge"}
