This game focuses on the connection and mechanics of the dreams, both shared and not shared, between Yarn and Nyla, and how these two sisters influence one-another.\n\nThis game was created for the 2017 Dream Diary Jam, in celebration of Yume Nikki's 13th anniversary. This is a game that follows a similar structure to Yume Nikki, as you explore through dreams and collect Stuff, but is otherwise a self-contained, original project.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/you-and-me--1"}
