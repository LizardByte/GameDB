Couple of months later both were sure that the time for an own small family has come.\n\nAlthough those are happy news Sqrxz is consequently short of money and a growing family requires a solid financial base. Picking up a newspaper and reading the job offers, a single add caught Sqrxz\u2019s attention. An expedition in search of ice marbles needs a brave explorer. After all, he has gone trough a deep jungle to rescue Yve and made it back. This sounds like a job for Sqrxz!\n\nAfter meeting Dr. Branxz, who looked a bit creepy and shady, the deal has been set up and Sqrxz is brought to a mysterious island... full of shiny ice marbles. \"Not a single one should be left there\", Dr. Branxz said, that just one missing marble will result in a pay refusal and not taking Sqrxz home. If you think Dr. Branxz didn't do his homework, he very well did: His spy satellites spotted exactly 354 marbles. Challenging, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThis footage is from the PS1 version.\n\nDeveloped by Retroguru\nDownload: https://www.sqrxz.de/sqrxz-4/\nBIOS Used: Polymega BIOS\nAlso available for Amiga, Android, AROS, BittBoy, PocketGo, Caanoo, OpenDingux, Dreamcast, GameCube, GP2x, Linux, Mac OSX, Motomagx, MorphOS, NetBSD 6, 3DS, Pandora, PlayStation Classic, PlayStation Portable, Raspberry Pi, Symbian OS, TI Nspire CX, Wii, PC, Wiz and GCW Zero.\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #polymega #polymegagameplays #ps1 #psx #psone #playstation #theforeseenarcade #homebrew #homebrewgames #retroguru #sqrxz #sqrxz4", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CYU8hVvBKE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CYU8hVvBKE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CYU8hVvBKE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CYU8hVvBKE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_CYU8hVvBKE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Polymega Gameplays - SQRXZ 4 (Homebrew) [PlayStation - Extended Set]", "description": "After Sqrxz saving Yve in Sqrxz 3 - Adventure for Love, it was truly a happy moment.
