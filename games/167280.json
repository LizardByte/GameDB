The good King McBeard's castle was taken over by his brother, the evil King Smudge and his Naughty Knights. It is up to you to help McDuff find where the Good Knights have been hiding and convince them to help take back the castle from King Smudge. Players can choose to play a game where they will only have to rescue two of the knights to win or a full game where they must find all six knights to storm the castle. Players must solve a variety of puzzles and challenges before they can save King McBeard. And if you win, the good McDuff will be knighted and join the other Good Knights in the castle. It contains elements of early learning for children including art, creativity, critical thinking, reading comprehension, imagination and role-playing.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 54441, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "41BDWi82Xnw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41BDWi82Xnw", "title": "Great Adventures by Fisher-Price: Castle Full Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/41BDWi82Xnw/sddefault.jpg"}]}
