While Hard Drivin' isn't exactly a good racer, its fully 3D track rendered on 16-bit hardware was and still is sort of impressive. By the time its sequel Race Drivin' was ported to the Saturn in 1995 though, it was already a five-year-old game. With its dated flat-shaded polygons and incredibly choppy framerate, it could hardly compete against the likes of slick new 3D racers such as Namco's Ridge Racer or Sega's own Daytona USA. Needless to say, it's abundantly clear why this game stayed in Japan.\n\nCheck out my other Race Drivin' videos below:\n\nSuper Stunt Track - http://youtu.be/1WRaY57D0BY\nOriginal Track - http://youtu.be/XDWg3pdGwUQ\nAuto Cross - http://youtu.be/ZMmxxF-zxqE\n\nEnjoy the video?
