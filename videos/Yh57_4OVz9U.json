The second thing you should know -- please, pay attention -- is that the Complete Pack is currently on sale for almost half price! Get it quickly, because the sale ends June 2 at midnight PT.\r\n\r\nThe Tomb of Sammun-Mak is the second episode of The Devil's Playhouse created by Telltale Games. After discovering a pair of skeletons that look like them at the end of The Penal Zone, Sam & Max also find a projector and four film reels nearby. The skeletons turn out to belong to their great-grandfathers Sameth and Maximus; they use the projector and reels, which somehow show their ancestors' last escapade. (Other than to switch between reels, players control Sameth and Maximus for the entire episode. The reels are not actually played through chronologically.)\r\n\r\nThe Devil's Playhouse is the third season of the video game series by Telltale Games, available for PC, Mac and PS3 (via PlayStation Network). It will be released episodically, as with the 2 previous seasons. Unlike previous seasons, The Devil's Playhouse is not co-published with GameTap.\r\n\r\nThe Devil's Playhouse features direct control and optional hotspot highlighting as well as real-time shadows. New gameplay features include psychic powers for Max and a reference notebook for Sam.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yh57_4OVz9U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yh57_4OVz9U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yh57_4OVz9U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Sam And Max - The Devil's Playhouse: Episode 2 Trailer & **Complete Package Discount** - PlayJamUK", "description": "Telltale has released the Sam & Max Complete Pack, which crams the first two seasons of the episodic Sam & Max series along with the currently 'airing' third season, The Devil's Playhouse, all into one package.
