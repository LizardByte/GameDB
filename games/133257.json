Using your mouse, swap two items to create a straight line of three or more of the same item. The object is to make matches over the tan tiles to clear them. When all the tiles are removed, the level is done. You must do this before the time runs out or you will be fined $500.00. After this, you can use the money you made to upgrade the restaurants decor and/or menu to get your establishment to a five-star level. Later in the game, you are given bonus items to help you.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/apple-pie--1"}
