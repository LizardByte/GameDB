It is a behind-the-wheel driving simulation where the driver speeds down the computer generated road past other cars, hitchikers, trees, cows and cacti. Occasionally a plane will fly overhead towards the screen. One must avoid crashing into these objects and complete the race in the alloted time. The player can crash as many times as he wants before the time runs out and players were treated to two different crash animations. The first was a simple cracked windshield effect, the second was a crash where the car explodes into car parts that fly through the air.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/speed-freak", "videos": [{"id": 101431, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XLu9eqTl30M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLu9eqTl30M", "title": "Speed Freak - (1979) - Arcade - gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLu9eqTl30M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
