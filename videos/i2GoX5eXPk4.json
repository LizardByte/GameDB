Today I have decided to show everyone a new Neo-Geo game I purchased back in March, but never had a chance to make a video on it until now. Thanks to DavidG. at the Neo-Geo.com forums I now have a way to play this incredible Neo-Geo MVS game on my AES console using my old Pranslation MVS-AES converter! You rock bro! The game I'm talking about is none other than Last Hope: Pink Bullets!\n\nThe story of Last Hope is pretty simple. The Evil Empire is rushing toward earth getting ready to destroy it, and they have broken through all our lines of defense. There is nobody else to stop them other than YOU! You are the Last Hope!\n\nLast Hope is made by NG:Dev Team which is comprised of 2 awesome people (Tim and Renee Hellwig), and the music is composed by the talented Rafael Dyll whom made the music for the Soldner X games and the upcoming GunLord for Neo-Geo! The game has 6 stages which all look original, and it utilizes the Neo-Geo in ways that no other game has ever done. \n\nThe graphics are extremely nice! Beautiful amount of deep rich color in every stage gives the game a Pulstar feel. Lighting effects that reflect onto the ship being lit up by bright lights, or darkened in black areas are unique to this shooter on Neo-Geo. This game does a fantastic job at showcasing how good the color was on the Neo-Geo! The end bosses are not near as detailed nor do they really move much like a boss from Pulstar, but for NG:Dev Teams first game ever on the system I think it looks pretty damn good! 8/10\n\nThe music in Last Hope: Pink Bullets is superb! I'm very happy that Rafael Dyll composed the music in this game as he is the best music composer I have ever heard on the Neo-Geo system! Every song in the game fits perfectly and such catchy tunes that I usually find myself humming right along with it as I play. Not only is the music great, but it's also near cd quality and in stereo! All the other Neo-Geo games before Last Hope PB (and Fast Striker) use either stereo midi, or mono digi sound. The music on this MVS cart has to be heard to be believed! 10/10 \n\nThe sound effects are also pretty damn good. Each enemy has different sounds when being defeated, and the weapons have a powerful sound when coliding with the walls or enemies in the path. There are plenty of voices in the game telling you what weapons your picking up, or when you get a 1up which all come through loud and clear. I really like the sound effects to the game. 9/10\n\nThe controls are refined from the original Last Hope a tiny bit in that it seems easier to pilot through tighter areas without getting killed which means the hit box must be smaller. Also the enemies now die when hitting the projectile that sits in front of the ship and it can actually protect you from things other than tiny ass bullets! :) Yay! Sadly the game lacks Memory Card support compared to the original Last Hope. :( Also the game is still quite hard and only gives you 6 credits to finish it. Only real hardcore shooter fans will beat this one! :D  8/10\n\nNote about the video: I have wanted to make this video since March 2011, so I'm very grateful that my Pranslation converter is now upgraded to play this awesome game! Last Hope on my AES is one of my most cherished games on the Neo-Geo, and this title is an upgraded version of that game with different gameplay and upgraded music! In the video you will notice that I had to edit a few spots as I died and started over, so I just started to recapture the video in the spot I died to save on time. 15 minutes is not much on YT. Also the sound/music goes out of synch a tad after about 1 minute of each stage due to video capture problems with my capture device. :(\n\nBottom Line: Last Hope: Pink Bullets MVS Neo-Geo cart is a fantastic game that shows off many new things that the Neo-Geo has never done before and I applaud the NG:Dev Team for making this possible for the Neo-Geo fanbase! The games unique Graphics/Lighting Effects and awesome Digital Stereo Music are incredible examples of what this old 16 bit system can really do when you get talented developers behind the wheel. It is surpassed graphically by Pulstar and a few others when it comes to end bosses, but overall it is truly a game all Neo-Geo owners should be proud to have in their collection of Neo-Geo games! This unfortunately comes at the cost of 399 Euros, and is available only in very tiny quantities at NG:Dev Teams website. Overall 8/10\n\nThis game is in 240p, and uses Digital Stereo CD QualitySound! =D", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i2GoX5eXPk4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i2GoX5eXPk4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i2GoX5eXPk4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i2GoX5eXPk4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Last Hope Pink Bullets for Neo-Geo MVS", "description": "Hello and welcome back YouTubers!
