Each player has a personal score, which at the beginning of the game is 0. A question is presented, after which a frame appears on the screen indicating that you can press the button and answer. If the player knows the answer, he/she can press the red button. The player who presses the button earlier than others (and will not have a false start), gives an answer. If the answer is correct, the question price is added to the player's score; otherwise - the price is substracted from the score. In the latter case, other players can try their luck and press the button to answer.\n\nThe game can also have a final round in which each of the players makes a bet. A question is asked, time is given for thinking, and each of the players submits their answer to the host. After that, the correct answer is announced, and each of the players receives or loses money according to their bet.\n\nGame winner is the player with the highest score after the last question.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sigame--1"}
