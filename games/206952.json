She continues training to keep in top form since no one knows when they'll strike again, but she hasn't had to fight in more than a month. Just when she's starting to get bored, her staff puts forward a wonderful idea that'll allow her to help her country without fighting. She can become the tourism ambassador for a town that's been struggling in the wake of the destruction caused by Jakou! There's no one better than famous superstar Haruka to kick-start the economy and help tourism flourish once more!", "summary": "Haruka finally catches a break after Jakou\u2019s attack on Japan relents. At the same time, without any enemies to fight, her life as an FUW pilot has become a bit boring. Luckily, her staff has a great idea: become a tourism ambassador to help the economy recover!"}
