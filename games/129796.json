Dangerous insects lurk in the shadows. Ancient rusty automatons keep digging towards the core of the world with the same relentless persistence they had in the day they were abandoned. In the middle of all of this is you - the last guardian of a mysterious ark, with your only weapon - the bombs that your suit produces.", "summary": "Bombing Quest is a single player bomberman fantasy RPG, where the ancient machines of a civilization long gone, awaken you as the last protector of a mysterious ark.
