Players follow the dance moves of a stylized on-screen figure, as music video clips play and other characters get down in the background. The Kinect camera add-on detects players' whole-body motions, and the software computes the accuracy of their movements to the beat of the current song. In addition to the follow-the-leader single-player challenges, a \"Freestyle\" mode allows players to express themselves with their own custom moves, and multiplayer modes let two dancers go head-to-head. The game's soundtrack includes a variety of 40 popular songs, with contemporary and classic dance hits from artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Gwen Stefani, Kool & the Gang, Lady Gaga, Lil Wayne, and others. Routines were developed with professional dancers.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dance-paradise"}
