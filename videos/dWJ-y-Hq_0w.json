In my spare time I'm trying to create my first game as a solo game developer. I even have a free demo to play already! \n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/3160950/Vampires_Fable/\n\nMy game is Vampires Fable, and it's a stylized 3D online cooperative game for two people, combining arcade and puzzle game elements. I pay very close attention to the storyline, which is an important part of the gameplay. \n\nIf you are interested, I encourage you to download the free demo version of Vampires Fable from the Steam platform. \n\nYour opinions are extremely important to me! After playing the demo, please share your impressions. These will help me continue to improve the game to make the full version of Vampires Fable even more engaging and satisfying. You can join the Discord server where you can find another person to play with, share your opinion, comments and feedback: \ndiscord.gg/chJwWZsF4g\n\nIf you would like to support me in the creative process, I would be happy to have a coffee :)\n\nbuymeacoffee.com/lacrimanoctis", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWJ-y-Hq_0w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWJ-y-Hq_0w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWJ-y-Hq_0w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWJ-y-Hq_0w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWJ-y-Hq_0w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Vampires Fable -  Trailer #1", "description": "Hey!
