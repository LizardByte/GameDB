If you press F1 to start, you will see the first screen with all the letters and symbols randomly presented and numbered from 1 to 30. If you move the blinking cursor with your joystick down (in the direction of the red arrows), the second screen will appear with the same letters and symbols also numbered 1 to 30, but in a different order. You will also be confronted by a horrible tune. While the tune is playing, you will have to memorize the positions of the letters and symbols of both the screens by looking at their corresponding number (use your joystick to move the cursor in the direction of the arrows to let the other screen appear) or just write down the thirty letters and symbols of one screen on a piece of paper. When the tune stops, all the letters and symbols of both screens will change into little squares and a timer will count down from 1000 to 0. You have to memory match the same letters (or symbols) by pressing fire when your cursor is on the correct square. When two letters (or symbols) match, you will get 1 point and the two matching letters (or symbols) will stay on screen. When the two letters (or symbols) don't match, they will change into little squares again. If you manage to match all the thirty letters and symbols before the timer reaches zero, you will be confronted by another horrible tune and the game will end. If you do not manage to match all the thirty letters and symbols before the timer reaches zero, you will still be confronted by the same horrible tune and the game will end. When the game has ended you are still able to move the cursor and change squares into letters (or symbols).", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iq-180", "videos": [{"id": 126471, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mLOXvoQCg7w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLOXvoQCg7w", "title": "IQ 180 - Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mLOXvoQCg7w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
