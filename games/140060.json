However, I am a fair man and I have devised a number of tests to see how skilled you really are. Now you can die a so-called hero. \n \nEndless: my forces will attack relentlessly and in random waves. The longer you survive, the closer to death you will be. \n \nBomber: you only have bombs at your disposal, nothing else. If you fail to plan your attacks properly, my ships will rip you to shreds. \n \nImpact: I have knocked out your weapons and left you defenceless. But I enjoy toying with my prey so I have left your ship\u2019s boosting abilities intact; you will need to rely on them. \n \nTwin-Gun: can you think and act at the same time, pilot? You need to fly your ship with motion sensor control, while using the dual analog sticks to fire your weapons. \n \nMy war fleet is waiting, pilot.
