{"id": "Etky7KhR5sI", "snippet": {"title": "Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD Edition - Launch Trailer", "description": "Created by the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, METAL GEAR SOLID HD Collection showcases some of the most popular METAL GEAR SOLID titles in true HD for the first time. The compilation comprises five seminal games including METAL GEAR SOLID 2: SONS OF LIBERTY, METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER, and METAL GEAR SOLID: PEACE WALKER in full HD, and also contains the two games that started it all: METAL GEAR and METAL GEAR 2: SOLID SNAKE, which were originally released for MSX more than 20 years ago. As such, METAL GEAR SOLID HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise.\n\nThe METAL GEAR and METAL GEAR SOLID series are the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. Within the METAL GEAR SOLID HD Collection, users control a number of legendary characters from the METAL GEAR SOLID universe's elite Special Forces units who are sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and into the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, the player will find their abilities pushed to the very limit -- but there lies the secret behind the series' popularity: the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid confrontation where possible, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.\n\nThe METAL GEAR SOLID series is also known for its inter-linked storylines, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made the series what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business -- with the METAL GEAR SOLID HD Collection a stunning celebration of one of gaming's true giants.\n\n\u00a9 2011 Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Etky7KhR5sI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Etky7KhR5sI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Etky7KhR5sI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Etky7KhR5sI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Etky7KhR5sI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD Edition - Launch Trailer", "description": "Created by the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, METAL GEAR SOLID HD Collection showcases some of the most popular METAL GEAR SOLID titles in true HD for the first time.
