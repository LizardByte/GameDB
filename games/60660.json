Mothra can walk north, south, west and east, but the screen locks after going up so Mothra cannot go to places that went offscreen. Mothra can only survive 5 hits of minimal damage, and there are only three lives. However, there are hidden power-ups that restore health that need to be shot with web to be revealed and become obtainable. It is possible to get extra lives by scoring 30,000 points.", "summary": "Monster's Fair pits Mothra against some of Toho's other monsters, including Godzilla.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monsters-fair", "videos": [{"id": 38165, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LU_ATeoI3UE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU_ATeoI3UE", "title": "Monster's Fair (MSX Mothra Game, Gameplay Pt. 1)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LU_ATeoI3UE/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3301, "name": "Godzilla"}]}
