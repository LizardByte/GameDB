The game's rich otherworldly soundscapes are composed from recordings taken aboard space shuttles.\n\nThe goal is to reconstruct an image by stopping rotating circles cut out from the image. For each level, the animated pieces draw increasingly complex patterns. The challenge is to be attentive to image juxtapositions in order to stop each circles movement at the right moment.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oko"}
