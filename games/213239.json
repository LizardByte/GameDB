Sonic arrives to reinvigorate the world and perhaps still be able to fight back the evil Doctor and hopefully somehow get back to his own time.\n\nEpoch existed in two editions on two platforms; originally for DOS (later Windows) and Game Boy Advance (not as an official product of course!) The DOS/Windows one was \"cancelled\" after having a good deal of it completed. The GBA version was a revival which attempted to reuse as much as it could from its previous incarnation and finish the job. While the GBA version is \"finished\", it was a rush job, more for the sake of filling the gap of the previous version's incomplete status, and did not completely honor all aspects of the original story."}
