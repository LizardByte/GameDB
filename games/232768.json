This would be similar to what happens when locking the two games together with Sonic & Knuckles' Lock-On Technology. It would essentially be Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles, but it would have been contained in a single cartridge and thus probably would have had a cheaper price. It is unknown whether it would have had a port allowing for Lock-On Technology so compatibility with other cartridges is also unknown.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-limited-edition"}
