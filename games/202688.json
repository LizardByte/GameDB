As the Allied Forces focus on ending World War II hostilities, Captain Butcher gets the green light to begin a top-secret campaign known as Operation Vulcan.\nVanguard \u2014 Special Operations Task Force (S.O.T.F. 001) \u2014 only delayed the inevitable with Operation Phoenix, as Axis scientists and leaders fled to the South Pacific. The four core forces from Vanguard \u2013 Hellhounds, Sentinel, Barbarian, and Shadow \u2014 were strong, but none of them, even within the Pacific, had enough intel on this uncharted island known as Caldera.\nEnter S.O.T.F. 006: Trident.\nWith their respective elite backgrounds combined, and the winter trade winds at their back, all three members of Trident and Captain Butcher charted a course for Caldera. Unbeknownst to them, the Axis were prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft on sight with anti-air guns stationed on Caldera\u2019s beaches, taking down Butcher\u2019s pride and joy while splitting him from his newly recruited forces.\nDespite counterattacks, Trident survived and regrouped with Captain Butcher, who happened to land right on whatever the Axis were hiding\u2026\n\n\u201cIt was a simpler time then, but the work is never done.\u201d \u2014 Captain Butcher, Call of Duty: Warzone Pacific\nDeep underneath Downtown Verdansk, the CIA\u2019s most elite task force uncovers a German World War II bunker on August 24, 1984, after dealing with Stitch.\nFollowing the sounds of a potential intruder within the tunnel system, they find a bunker with intel from a bygone era, along with the familiar voice of Captain Butcher mocking the task force for their lack of stealth.\nIn charge of the secret British Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II, Butcher created multiple Special Operations Task Forces (S.O.T.F.) \u2014 including the original group, Vanguard (S.O.T.F. 001) \u2014 to ensure the total elimination of Axis forces that escaped following the war. Adler, Woods, Mason, and Hudson stand down to hear this story, one that echoes their mission of eradicating Perseus once and for all\u2026\nAnd they learn that it all started in the Pacific.", "summary": "Prepare to rise on a new front \u2013 Vanguard heats up in the Pacific with a new Battle Pass and new weapons, Operators, maps, and more.
