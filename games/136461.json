The Heike hope to defeat the Genji by releasing vengeful spirits to disturb the Earth's natural flow of energies and to terrorize the land. The boy that Nozomi met is revealed to be the human form of Hakury\u016b, the White Dragon God said to protect Ky\u014d, whose powers have greatly weakened due to the presence of the onry\u014d. Nozomi discovers that she has the power to seal the onry\u014d as Hakury\u016b no Miko, and she allies herself with the Genji in order to seal the onry\u014d, restore Hakury\u016b's powers, and return home to her own world.", "summary": "A combined remake of the original game + Izayoiki that includes the additional content from the collectors edition.\n\nFull Voice, Redrawn Stills, more than 40 new stills added,\nAdds Love ED after stories and a DLC route for Fujiwara no Yasuhira.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "videos": [{"id": 39266, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "60VRGILONR4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60VRGILONR4", "title": "\u300e\u9059\u304b\u306a\u308b\u6642\u7a7a\u306e\u4e2d\u30673 Ultimate\u300f\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u7b2c\u4e00\u5f3e", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/60VRGILONR4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39267, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2KTJzupU1oI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KTJzupU1oI", "title": "\u300e\u9059\u304b\u306a\u308b\u6642\u7a7a\u306e\u4e2d\u30673 Ultimate\u300f\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5f3e", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2KTJzupU1oI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
