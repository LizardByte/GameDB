There are many different types of units to choose from, some specializing in powerful short-range attacks, some wielding far-reaching magicks, and still others equipped with bows, enabling them to bring down aerial foes. Deploy units in strategic locations to take full advantage of their traits. Each time an enemy breaches your defenses and reaches a map's exit, your party will lose crystals. When all your crystals are gone, the game is over. CRYSTAL DEFENDERS R1 comes complete with a plethora of exciting stages, each varying in layout and difficulty. Can you defend them all without losing a single crystal?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crystal-defenders-r1", "videos": [{"id": 76237, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "smNcyqwRmcE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smNcyqwRmcE", "title": "Crystal Defenders R1 - WiiWare Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/smNcyqwRmcE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
