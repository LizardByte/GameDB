{"id": "YJSngap-Rcw", "snippet": {"title": "Fight Crab - Official Weapons Trailer | Summer of Gaming 2020", "description": "Fight Crab is a physics driven 3D action game in which you control a giant crab and wield a wide assortment of weapons in order to take out other, equally giant enemy crabs.\n\nIf you think the idea of a crab fighting game is stupid, then you clearly haven\u2019t watched this Fight Crab trailer. The homicidal crabs featured in this Fight Crab gameplay trailer lay waste to each other with swords, sais, and drills. In this fighting game, crabs must battle to the death. Sometimes, those Fight Crab gameplay deaths can get a little absurd- especially when one crab is impaling another with a lightsaber or chainsaw. But that\u2019s Fight Crab, and the first rule of Fight Crab is not to talk about Fight Crab.\n\nTo learn more about The Fight Crab game stay tuned to IGN.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be collecting YOUR video comments for our Summer of Gaming coverage.
