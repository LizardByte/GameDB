Its gameplay is varied between stages. In one stage, you might be guiding a near-sighted swallow to eat some insects, while on another stage you'll be tasked to memorize all the shown animals in a correct order. Essentially, the stages are minigames with puzzle or puzzle-like elements included. The stages are presented in a non-linear format, so you can enter in these stages anyway you like. There are 3 difficulty settings to choose from when beginning a new game.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hugo-the-secrets-of-the-forest", "collections": [{"id": 909, "name": "Hugo"}]}
