Please enjoy.\n\nLINK TO COMMUNITY DISCORD SERVER:\nhttps://discord.gg/Sucp6JeFzN\n\nLINK TO OFFICIAL TWITTER ACCOUNT:\nhttps://twitter.com/exdrv\n\n----\n\nHello everyone, my name is Riley, and on behalf of the XDRV development team, I'd like to present what we've had in the works for several months now: EX-XDRiVER.\nFor people that have known me previously, you may know that I have had the ideas and concepts created for this game since 2020---but our team was only pulled together in December of 2022! Since then, we've made incredible progress in turning those ideas from a proof of concept to a working prototype. \n\nWith a fast-paced, bright, and energetic neon theme, and incredibly hard-hitting electronic music, EX-XDRiVER combines the steering and controls of racing games with the precision and dynamic movement of arcade rhythm games. Flurries of note patterns with anything-goes effecting---combined with a drifting mechanic that rewards you for following the course---will keep you pushing for faster course clear times and higher scores.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this announcement teaser for our project, and get amped up for future news as this project develops!\n\nPlease check above for links to our associated social media pages/boards!\n\n----\n\nTEAM XDRV\n\nRiley  |  Project Lead, Lead Design, Sound Director, Backup Programming\ntari  |  Developer, Programming, Game Design, Charting\nYokamaa  |  Developer, Programming, Visual Design, Music\n\nSpecial thanks to the individuals whose names are listed at the end of the video, I appreciate you all so, so much for your invested interest and contributions to this project. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKk57Jxcwec/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKk57Jxcwec/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKk57Jxcwec/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKk57Jxcwec/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKk57Jxcwec/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[XDRV] EX-XDRiVER Public Announcement", "description": "Welcome to EX-XDRiVER, a hybrid rhythm-racing game being developed for PC.
