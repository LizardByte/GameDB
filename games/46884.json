It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability. \n \nOpposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen. \n \nYou must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds. \n \nSounds easy? Wait until you meet the Scroll's friend, the Asteroids.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
