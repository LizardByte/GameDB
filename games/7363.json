Decimate your enemies using an intuitive, turn-based battle system which allows you to target individual body parts, as you protect the world from demons and seek revenge for your father's death. \n \nCombining action and strategy, Last Rebellion adds a twist to battles and field exploration with a character switching function. Players can jump between Nine and Aisha at will -- each possess unique, customizable skill sets, so it is important to assign skills to both characters that suit your play style. Match the two characters well and you will be better prepared for what's lurking in the shadows of Junovald.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
