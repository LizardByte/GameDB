Move a vacuum through a maze in order to suck up dollar bills that are strewn throughout the screen. After several bills are vacuumed up, the vacuum will increase in size. After several size increases, the vacuum will become full and will not be able to vacuum up any more bills, so the money must be deposited in the vault in the center of the screen before the vacuum can start gathering up money again. The difficulty level increases by having the vacuum fill up quicker, causing the player to make multiple trips to the vault during a level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clean-sweep--1"}
