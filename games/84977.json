In a once-peaceful galaxy, invading Darkbot forces are cruelly capturing small, blue critters. Flying from planet to planet, help Armillo rescue them and take back his home: a series of spherical 3D worlds featuring all manner of obstacles and enemies. Your main weapon against the Darkbots is Armillo\u2019s roll, which lets you navigate paths, dodging or wrecking anything in your way. Jump and boost your roll to destroy tougher enemies, or collect power-ups to gain special abilities. Along the way, solve cheeky puzzles and grab orbs, which you can spend on bolstering Armillo\u2019s powers for improved Darkbot routing. And that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need, as you battle multi-stage bosses in their own worlds. Within every level, track down a hidden Parallel World, where you\u2019ll be challenged to speed run through a 2D zone. You\u2019ll need lightning reflexes and your best, old-school platforming skills in these special stages \u2013 especially as you\u2019re pushed to beat each stage against the clock! With snappy action, vibrant graphics and puzzles to stretch your mind, Armillo is rolling to defeat the Darkbots in this riveting 3D platformer,", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/armillo"}
