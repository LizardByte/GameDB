The gameplay is similar to the NES version of Side Pocket, although the player has less lives, the two-player mode does not have lives (although a 20-second time limit between shots is added), and of course, the game contains nudity. There is an English version of the game called Pocket Gal 2, which was released in 1989. Also in 1989, a version of the game was released titled Super Pool III. This version of the game does not contain nudity, and it was released in North America by I.Vics. A sequel to Pocket Gal was released in 1993 called Pocket Gal Deluxe. The gameplay of Pocket Gal Deluxe is similar to the Sega Genesis version of Side Pocket. In Pocket Gal Deluxe, the art style is much more realistic than Pocket Gal.\n\nEach of the 4 stages is hosted by a corresponding girl, who's only function (not that I'm complaining) is to strip when the level is cleared. Additional points and shots can be gained by pocketing balls in order, in computer-predetermined pockets, clearing special bonus tricks between stages, etc.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
