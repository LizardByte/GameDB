They are guarantees we make to one another, knowing that guarantees are fruitless; their existence contradicts the fleeting, temporary nature of our universe. Yet, they live on in the face of this futility.\n\nSo, what happens when the promises you make to yourself go cold? When your promises to others are left empty?\n\nPTK follows the journey of a post-college snow leopard after returning to his childhood home. After a year of wishful thinking, living in the footsteps of his past and the childhood promises he has yet to fulfill, he's convinced there's nothing more for him here. Then, disaster strikes.\n\nJoin him in a story of deep self-discovery, reunion, and light-hearted romance as he grows with a vibrant group of individuals brought together by unlikely circumstances.", "summary": "Promises to Keep (PTK) is a queer, furry, safe-for-work (16+) visual novel.\n\nPTK follows the journey of a post-college snow leopard after returning to his childhood home.
