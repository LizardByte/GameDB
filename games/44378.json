The four characters can be controlled by one player as a party, or by up to four players, each choosing an action during battles.\n\nThere are four different character classes available: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Hero. The latter can be selected only if he is the only character in the party. Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. Various treasure is scattered around the dungeon; the player also has the option of buying certain equipment. In some places, fountains can be found; drinking from them will affect the party in different ways, positive or negative.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tunnels-of-doom"}
