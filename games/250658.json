Billions of procedurally generated holes, every game and device is different. Play to the center of the Earth and see what you find along the way. Replay with all new holes.\nHow deep can you go?\nTouch and drag to shoot. Tilt to add some spin. Put the ball in the hole.\nPlay anywhere on your Apple Watch.\nInstantly try or share Deep Golf with its AppClip. Even save the AppClip onto an NFC Tag.\nI hate ads too. So there aren't any. You can upgrade to play with much longer courses, and use any ball before unlocking it with holes-in-one.\nUpgrade to also play with some fun Physics. Bouncier? Stickier? Mixed with a Square golf ball? Upgrade to mix and match.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deep-golf"}
