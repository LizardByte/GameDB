It's a side by side split-screen one or two player game where you roll a marble along a path across multiple screens to a finish line. The game uses paddle controllers, and it is the first game where each player uses two paddles to control the game: one is used to control the marble's vertical movement and the other is used for horizontal.\n\nThe goal of Marble Craze is to navigate through each level within the time limit and in later levels, without falling off the edges. There are bonuses, hidden areas, ramps and a lot of other stuff to keep it interesting. It's got 18 levels that go from very easy to insanely hard, and several in-game songs that push the Atari 2600's sound chip to its limits.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marble-craze"}
