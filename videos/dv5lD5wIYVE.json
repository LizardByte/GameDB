The gameplay mostly consists of rental Pokemon battles in the HP Platoon facility, with a Battle Swap ruleset very akin to Pokemon Emerald's Battle Factory. The protagonist, Tawila, aims to see all there is to see in this realm, and show off in battle along the way. You'll be faced with brand new moves, abilities, stat spreads, and more, spanning all 9 generations of Pokemon. All of the playable Fakemon are lovingly designed and sprited by over 20 different artists.
