If you want to rampage through the city, ignoring traffic regulations and destroying everything in your way, you just found a right game for you. Delivering your passengers on time is the only thing that matters, and anything stopping you from that is your enemy. Plow at full speed through traffic jams, crash through the buildings, outrun the police patrols, level the whole city if you want to. The game features 5 buses, 5 cities, 6 lethal weapons, and 6 different types of missions.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-bus"}
