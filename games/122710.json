The idea of the game is loosely based on games like Luxor, Zuma and Puzzle Bobble. The twists that make Zaz stand out from other games of this type are that the balls have to be picked from the path (insted of being randomly assigned for the player) and that the player's \"vehicle\" is also attached to a path which is different from level to level.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zaz--1"}
