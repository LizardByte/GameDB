Each character is represented by their deck of specialized cards, which provide the means for interacting with the world and other characters. Complicating things is the environment deck, which adds additional effects or third parties onto the battlefield. The game can be played solo or multiplayer (either local or online across platforms). The base game contains the 10 heroes, 4 villains, and 4 environments from the Sentinels of the Multiverse basic set. Variant versions of some heroes and villains are unlockable bonus content. 6 additional heroes, 10 additional villains, and 6 additional environments are available as DLC and the publisher plans to eventually add all of the content from the physical game's expansions to the digital game.", "summary": "Calling all Sentinels! Do you have what it takes to defend the Multiverse? Compose a team of comic book heroes, each with their own playstyles, backstories, and grudges. Pit them against a variety of maniacal and formidable villains. Defeat your enemies and save the Multiverse!\n\nSentinels of the Multiverse is the award-winning game in which players join forces as heroes to combat a dastardly villain in a dynamic environment.\n\nThe digital version of Sentinels of the Multiverse plays like a comic book come to life! Control an entire team of heroes in single player, or head online and join heroes from around the globe in multiplayer. This is cooperative card-battle like you\u2019ve never played before!\n\nThe rules of the game are deceptively simple: Play a Card, Use a Power, and Draw a Card. What makes Sentinels of the Multiverse unique is that each card has special abilities that can create powerful combos or even change the rules of the game!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-the-video-game", "videos": [{"id": 13625, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RWQ5ipk5inw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWQ5ipk5inw", "title": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: The Video Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RWQ5ipk5inw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 13626, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "z2ftlDHH42M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ftlDHH42M", "title": "Game Play Preview - Sentinels of the Multiverse: The Video Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z2ftlDHH42M/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2692, "name": "Sentinels of the Multiverse"}]}
