{"id": "Q9zM-zvGrMg", "snippet": {"title": "Murderous Pursuits - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "Murderous Pursuits is a kill-or-be-killed Victorian stealth-em-up for 1-8 players in which you must hunt and kill your quarry before your hunters do the same to you, all while avoiding witnesses.\n\nWhile the game is certainly funny, unfortunately nobody's actually playing it, as the servers have been a ghost town after its launch in 2018. And with it being an indie game, this is especially painful, since AAA games filled with predatory monetization practices get all attention from PC and console gamers these days. While the only piece of DLC is the Deluxe Edition upgrade (unless you count the OST as DLC), its 8.99 price tag is a bit of a turn-off. While it does go on sale often, it doesn't make a difference as people aren't playing it online, even to this day. On the bright side, the game DOES let you play against offline bots, as you see in the video, so at least that's some good compensation, I suppose.\n\nMurderous Pursuits (C) Blazing Griffin\nSteam link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/638070/Murderous_Pursuits/\n\n#murderouspursuits #steam #steammultiplayer #steamonlinemultiplayergames #online #onlinemultiplayer #steamindies #blazinggriffin", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9zM-zvGrMg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9zM-zvGrMg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9zM-zvGrMg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9zM-zvGrMg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q9zM-zvGrMg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Murderous Pursuits - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "Murderous Pursuits is a kill-or-be-killed Victorian stealth-em-up for 1-8 players in which you must hunt and kill your quarry before your hunters do the same to you, all while avoiding witnesses.\n\nWhile the game is certainly funny, unfortunately nobody's actually playing it, as the servers have been a ghost town after its launch in 2018.
