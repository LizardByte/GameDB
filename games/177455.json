You alone have the ability to use Leximancy, a hitherto unimaginable power driven by something as fascinating as it is enchanting: language.\n\nLeximancy is an endlessly fun branch of magic, but it is also a risk of buttock-clenching magnitude. Years ago you caused things to happen, and ever since then you've been banished to the school basement with the other failures- I mean learners.\n\nYour life as a humble basement-wizard is interrupted as Academy Elementinia is attacked by someone with a baffling agenda and a huge set of fireballs.\n\nDon your trusty hat, ready your lexicon, become the outcast that saves the school. Or if you don\u2019t vibe with heroics, at least cause some more things to happen. After all, you're out of the basement now. Let's see what you can do.", "summary": "Do you like silly hats?
