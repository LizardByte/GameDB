It has no known origin, and has been altering the surrounding landscape into an unlivable wasteland.\n\nYour Council has been sending groups of prisoners into the structure for decades with the stated intent of investigating and destroying it. This is the sole opportunity for wards of the state to have their crimes forgiven, scores reset, and citizenship fully reinstated.\n\nNone have ever returned. But you, and the six others who have been 'volunteered' alongside you, are determined to be the first survivors!\n\nRead minds. Form alliances. Break them. Find true companionship. Make true enemies. Become the person you always wished you could be, or succumb to your darkest urges.\n\nAnything is possible in the uncharted depths of the Spire.", "summary": "Dark fantasy set in a brutal dystopian world.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-inverted-spire"}
