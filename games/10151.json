The warp tunnels can warp a ball from one tunnel to another. The ball is launched from the center of the pit by the automatic launcher in a random direction. There also bounce domes, off of which the ball will be deflected, but over which players are free to move.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/speedball", "videos": [{"id": 25451, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "W559P--ypVE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W559P--ypVE", "title": "Speedball gameplay (PC Game, 1988)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W559P--ypVE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
