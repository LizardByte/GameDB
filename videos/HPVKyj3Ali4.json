Players traverse a variety of environments, moving through forests, cities, caves, and wilderness to advance through the game's story. Utilizing swords, engaging in melee combat, and employing stealth are key to overcoming hostile enemies. For most of the game, players take on the role of Rajendra Chola \u2014 the Tamil Chola emperor of South India who succeeded his father, Rajaraja Chola I, and ascended to the throne in 1025 CE. The prologue follows his journey of overseas conquest, where the Chola Navy crossed the ocean and launched an attack on the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. \n\nMusic composed and arranged by Chandar Karunakaran\n\nStudio Head & Creative Director: Abraham K\nStudio Producer: Mohanraj K\nGame Developers: Yuvaraj M, Manivannan K & Vinnava S, \nArtist: Dennis Praveen & Sudharshan AJ\nEnvironment Art & Cinematography: Praveen Kumar S & Vijay A\nAnimator: Om Sanas\nQA Specialist: Manish Tak\nMarketing : Tapasya B & Joshua Ragland T \nHR: Prianka M\nSelect Motion Capture: Super Alloy Interactive Las Vegas NV, Eric Jacobus\nDialogues: Prakash Bala, Prakash Manokaran & Meenakshi Sundaram \nSubtitles: Salesh Dipak Fernando, Dhevapriya\nAudio Director: Chandar Karunakaran\nLogo Design: Anooja Anil\nVoice Artist: Rajendra Chola - Dude Vicky\nSangrama - Karthikeyan K\nMawiza - Yogeshwari\nNPC - Tamilselvan A, Pradeep Kumar, Naveen Vox, Aravind Sekar, Janarthanan Angappan, Avinash Shivan, Yadhava A.K.A Yaddy boy.\nAdditional Voices - Arun E, Vignesh N, Akash K.\nVoiceover Coordinator: Jabesh David J\nAsst Voiceover Coordinator: Ganesh P \nVoice Recorded in: the mystics room, ck studios\nmusic composed, arranged, and programmed by: Chandar Karunakaran\nKosai Nagaran: Sivakumar C, Ramakrishnan V, Linceshwaran R, Aadesh K, Sabari P, Narasimman P, Deenasarathi P, Harunishwar SK, Raja RA, Thiruaruran S, Sakthi M, Dinesh P.\nOrchestral Traditional Percussion, Violin: Karthik Vamsi, Chandar Karunakaran \nChorus: Pradeep Kumar, Naveen Vox, Avinash Shivan\nSound Technical and Artistic Advisors: Abin Pushpakaran, Vishnu M Namboothiri\nAudio Studios: The Mystics Room, Blu Academy, CK Studios\nRecording Engineers: Vishnu M Namboothiri, Maniratnam\nSoundtrack Mix: Abin Pushpakaran \nSound BTS Camera Crew: Somasundaram, Lalit Prasad, Aswin Alpha, Janarthanan Angappan, Tamilselvan A \nSound Design - SFX, Foley: Chandar Karunakaran \nSpecial Thanks to: Sharan Curunathan, Boopathy Sivakumar, Kavya Mohan, Venkata Subramanian, Arvind Neelakandan - Epic Cames, Bala Anna, Karthik V\nstudio babies: Maverick Abraham, Meghna Mohan\nCame would not be possible without the support of Lokesh Ravichandru.\nAdditionals: Unreal Engine\n\nPLAY NOW\nhttps://ayelet.studio/steam\n\nVISIT GAME SITE\nhttps://unsungempires.com\n\nFOLLOW AYELET STUDIO: \nhttps://ayelet.studio\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/aphSXHHj5H\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ayeletstudio/\nX Platform (Twitter): https://twitter.com/StudioAyelet\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/ayelet-studio\n\nJOIN AYELET STUDIO:\ncareers@ayelet.studio", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPVKyj3Ali4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPVKyj3Ali4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPVKyj3Ali4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPVKyj3Ali4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPVKyj3Ali4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Unsung Empires: The Cholas - Prologue Part 1 - Official 4K Gameplay", "description": "Unsung Empire: The Cholas is a single-player narrative-driven 3D action-adventure game developed by Ayelet Studio featuring sword-based combat and platforming elements.
