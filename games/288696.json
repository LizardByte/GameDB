In the darkness, an unknown fear attacks you.\n\n\"Night Hike'' is an outdoor program that increases people's tolerance for darkness, senses they don't normally use, and a sense of solidarity with others by walking on mountain trails at night without lights.\n\nKeita Iizuka, a budding reporter, is drawn to the unfamiliar term \"night hike\" and joins an outdoor tour in a deserted camp on the outskirts of the Tokyo metropolitan area.\n\nScenarios branch through a \"choice card\" system. An immersive sound production stirs your imagination.
