When the aliens have located the ideal spot for their raiding, they send anything they have... directly to the property of the hobby desert farmer Pedro El Moral. Your job is to help him to get rid of the aliens.\n\nThe game is basically a side-scrolling FPS, where you stand on a fixed position and the environment scrolls 360\u00b0 around you when you move your mouse, which offers 9 levels and 3 difficulty settings.\n\nArmed with a multi-functional weapon (primary mode is a gun, secondary mode is a magnetic alien-sucking lasso), your job is to shoot down the UFO's, capture ammo for the gun (with the lasso), capture aliens with the lasso too and put them into Tequila bottles, and of course, protect the hemp. You also have a shield, which protects you from the UFO's weapons, but shield and weapon can't be used simultaneously.\n\nWhen you run out of ammo and/or a huge invasion force is coming, you have the opportunity to create the Alien Tequila. That means, that you transform an alien filled Tequila bottle by \"liquefying\" the alien to get an \"alien juice\", which you can use as ammo. It results in a score reduction, but the ammo is much more powerful then normal ammos.\n\nFinally, while the game is a singleplayer game, it offers an online-highscore for \"multiplayer\" competition.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-tequila", "videos": [{"id": 136586, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Yv4mv-PWLjs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv4mv-PWLjs", "title": "[Gameplay] Alien Tequila", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yv4mv-PWLjs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
