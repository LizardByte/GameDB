The setting is peaceful, yet dire, given the circumstances. Parents carrying their children struggle to keep pace with the rest of the group. Your character fades into view. Suddenly, gunshots are fired in the distance! Your family crouches to avoid danger. There is brief pause and silence. More shots are fired and the caravan begins to run. Panic ensues and eventually your character makes way to the front of the group. A military vehicle appears ahead and soldiers fire in your direction. Now alone, your character turns down the nearest path. Thus, the game begins.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/salaam"}
