The main drawing point with this one is that there are close to 100 teams you can choose from. Plus, the traditional baseball stats are not used; rather each player has a set rating for strength and speed, and that is all you get to go by. A neat addition is the power meter, which can help your team get ahead if used properly.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kyuukyoku-harikiri-koushien", "videos": [{"id": 125022, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "7lcaRW2QEVA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lcaRW2QEVA", "title": "Kyuukyoku Harikiri Koushien (Japan) (NES)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7lcaRW2QEVA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
