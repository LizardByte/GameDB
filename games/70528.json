Mona and Froderick will explore many interesting locations, such as Dr. Legume\u2019s Home for the Sanity Challenged, an Executioner\u2019s Practice Grounds, Mortus Labs, and, the scariest of all, a tavern full of disgruntled sports fans low on beer! Help Froderick free Mona by dressing as a little girl again, making his own zombie, and getting pummeled almost to death by the local hooligans, the notorious Belfry Boyz.
