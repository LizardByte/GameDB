Death agrees to resurrect you so that you may carry out your quest for revenge. But there is a catch. Death requests that you pay back your revival debt in souls. Every adversary killed on the road to vengeance grants you a soul that can be used to unlock various new guns to use, as well as whiskey - a mixture used during combat for short boost.\n\nViewing the action from top down perspective, navigate the hazard filled areas swarming with demons, skeletons and swarms upon swarms of bullets to reach each of the ominous bosses culminating in a fight against the Man in Red.\n\nShoot your way through enemies, dodge through numerous traps, unlock new guns and whiskey boons as well as colorful outfits in this western noir tinged shooter.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/undead-west"}
