The player's task is to defend Earth from the alien race Znark who are leaving their doomed home planet Argos. In the first round the Argonians attack Earth's defense satellite from a base on Saturn. The player has to launch missiles from the satellite and destroy all aliens as they swirl around the screen.\nIn the second round, the task is to defend the last surviving city on Earth which is being attacked by jet bombers. The player attacks them with two anti-jet guns on the ground and has to kill them off before the city's protecting force field is destroyed. In the third round, the Argonians attack the city streets with missiles, bombs, spaceships, and paratroopers. \n\nhttps://retro365.blog/2023/07/05/argos/\n\nEnjoy and please remember to visit my blog at https://www.retro365.blog where I post new articles every month.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYXkCdC_4WM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYXkCdC_4WM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYXkCdC_4WM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYXkCdC_4WM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYXkCdC_4WM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Argos - Datamost, 1983 - Apple II (4K)", "description": "A short presentation of Argos, developed by Ron Lowrance and published by Datamost for the Apple II in 1983.\n\nArgos\u00a0is a shoot 'em up game made up of three stages, each with different gameplay.
