It was released for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1999 and released for the Sega Dreamcast the following year. It is the second game in the Legacy of Kain series. Unlike the first game, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, Crystal Dynamics did not develop it in conjunction with Silicon Knights and instead developed the game on their own. Soul Reaver is a sequel to Blood Omen, and subsequently was followed by three more games, one of which, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2, is a direct sequel. In 2001, two years after its initial release, Soul Reaver had sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nMore @ Wikipedia:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Reaver Sprawd\u017a m\u00f3j Twitch: www.twitch.tv/cosmaty\nSprawd\u017a m\u00f3j Twitter: www.twitter.com/deluxczlowiek\nSprawd\u017a m\u00f3j Instagram: www.instagram.com/cosmatypl\nSprawd\u017a m\u00f3j TikTok: www.tiktok.com/@cosmatypl\n\nJe\u017celi podoba Ci si\u0119 to co widzisz rozwa\u017c wsparcie rozwoju kana\u0142u: https://paypal.me/cosmaty\n\nCheck out my Twitch: www.twitch.tv/cosmaty\nCheck out my Twitter: www.twitter.com/deluxczlowiek\nCheck out my Instagram: www.instagram.com/cosmatypl\nCheck out my TikTok: www.tiktok.com/@cosmatypl\n\nIf you like what you see consider supporting the development of the channel: https://paypal.me/cosmaty", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pXdIGNea2ZI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pXdIGNea2ZI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pXdIGNea2ZI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver [trailer]", "description": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, also known simply as Soul Reaver, is a third-person adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Eidos.
