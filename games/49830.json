While most use Gaia for good, there are those who would use it for evil. You take the role of El, who must journey around the world in hopes of stopping those who want to use Gaia for evil. Along the way, you will encounter new friends that will aid you in the quest. Ultimately, you will encounter monsters, and if you're lucky, you'll be able to convince the monsters to join you. When a monster has joined the party, it can be summoned to help in battle. While the monster will not gain experience, it can be combined with other creatures to create a more powerful monster.
