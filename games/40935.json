Spending too much time during this section will allow Freddy to capture random character, until all but one selectable character is left, so choose a character quickly! When a character is selected, all the other characters are deemed captured by Freddy and must also be rescued.\n\nEach character has a different Soul mater and Power meter rating, as well as unique abilities. Soul represents the player's health and if it runs out, the player dies. Power is used up every time the player uses a special ability.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-nightmare-on-elm-street"}
