Sensible Soccer 2006 returns with a modern take on its trademark zoomed out camera and truly intuitive control system, which delivers total 360-degree control over your players' kicks and movement. Visually, the game has a distinctive new graphical style, which includes cel-shaded players with the classic enlarged heads, designed to appeal both to fans of the series and appeal to a new generation of gamers. The trademark top-down view allows you to see the build up play better than you can in any current football game. This gives the player a huge degree of tactical awareness and control that has never been bettered.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensible-soccer-2006", "videos": [{"id": 54036, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qE9va_mhRbc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE9va_mhRbc", "title": "Sensible Soccer 2006 ...
