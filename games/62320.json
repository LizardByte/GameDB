It also has a two-player co-op mode. Players shoot with 3 different weapons and have lots of different power-ups to help fight off the Huggables. It is only available on the iPad, thought to be caused by the fact the game was too small for an iPhone/iPod Touch screen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-bears-go"}
