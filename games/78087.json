It adds an animated intro, voice-overs, and two mini-games.\n\nThe story is based on the manga/anime series Ah! My Goddess, depicting the adventures of Keiichi, a Japanese teenager who accidentally summoned the Norse goddess Verdandi (misspelled \"Belldandy\" in the romanization) and made a wish for her to stay with him forever, which led to all kinds of troubles. What's more, other powerful beings out there are seeking to harm Keiichi's divine girlfriend, so a simple date ends in an unexpected way...\n\nThe game is a \"digital comic\", meaning that the adventure elements are reduced to the bare minimum: being able to choose dialogue lines or make other decisions from time to time. The mini-games are a timed exercise of putting puzzle pieces together, and a card-matching game against two female opponents.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aa-megami-sama--1"}
