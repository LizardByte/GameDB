One heist will have you stealing boats full of fish, another might have you stealing valuable works of art, and yet another may require you to kidnap an prized chef. However, it is the job of a penguin to figure out the way that they want to execute their heist. Loud or silent, lethal or non-lethal - there is no right answer... there is only the way you play!\n\nThe Base\nTo support all your heists you are provided with a base that exists in the most remote parts of Antarctica. In your base you have the possibility to construct new buildings, purchase new weapons and items for your heists, and find the perfect looking outfit for your penguin.\n\nTactics\nJust like old-school games you are required plan your heist with your team and choose the right loadouts and approach.
