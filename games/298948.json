If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, you lose. When you win a stage, the game will take you back to the title screen / level select, but will save your score. Aim for the highest score!\nSCORING : All bricks are worth the same - 1 point. If you destroy a brick with your power wave, though, you will get 2 points.\nEDGE and POWER WAVE: The Bloxx Empire is edgy. Striking a brick on its edge will grant you an edge point and charge your power wave, but the effect on your ball can be unpredictable. Watch out!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hachinoid"}
