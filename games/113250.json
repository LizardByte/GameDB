It's simple, challenging, and extremely addictive. To unscramble each puzzle, just drag letters left and right (never up or down), but watch out: it's not as easy as it seems! Each letter you solve and pin in place is a new clue for the surrounding words. Puzzles range from bite-sized fun to brain-busters you can spend a whole afternoon chipping away at, just like a weekend crossword puzzle.\"", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "videos": [{"id": 23642, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cPQDFl2t3e8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPQDFl2t3e8", "title": "Crossgrams: a new kind of word puzzle game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cPQDFl2t3e8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
