{"id": "5XhUWrxuE1E", "snippet": {"title": "Classic OS9 Games: Pathways Into Darkness Gameplay", "description": "From Wikipedia:\nPathways into Darkness is a first-person adventure video game developed and published by Bungie Software Products Corporation in 1993, exclusively for Apple Macintosh personal computers. Players assume the role of a Special Forces soldier who must stop a powerful, godlike being from awakening and destroying the world. Players solve puzzles and defeat enemies to unlock parts of a pyramid where the god sleeps; the game's ending changes depending on player actions.\n\nPathways began as a sequel to Bungie's Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, before the developers created an original story. Jason Jones programmed the game, while his friend Colin Brent developed the environments and creatures. The game features three-dimensional texture mapped graphics and stereo sound on supported Macintosh models. Pathways was critically acclaimed and won a host of awards; it was also Bungie's first major commercial success, enabling the two-man team of Jason Jones and Alex Seropian to move into a Chicago office and begin paying staff. Bungie's Marathon Trilogy is set in the same universe as Pathways.\n\nMusic used in video:\nGeto Boys--Damn It Feels Good To Be A Gangsta\nMarathon OST--Landing", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XhUWrxuE1E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XhUWrxuE1E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XhUWrxuE1E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5XhUWrxuE1E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Classic OS9 Games: Pathways Into Darkness Gameplay", "description": "From Wikipedia:\nPathways into Darkness is a first-person adventure video game developed and published by Bungie Software Products Corporation in 1993, exclusively for Apple Macintosh personal computers.
