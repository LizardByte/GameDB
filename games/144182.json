To advance, a player clicks on a machine which produces a piece of colored candy. The player is allowed to move to the next space that shares the same color as the candy which was just drawn. Some spaces are sticky and if a player lands on one, they will lose one or more turns. Some pieces contain special candies which will cause a player to warp to different areas on the board, which may be either ahead or behind of the player's current space. \n \nIn addition to playing the classic board game, this game offers the player side trips to explore 8 different areas, each with fun activities: \n \nGingerbread Plum Trees: Help Plumpy (the last of the Plumpa trolls) collect plums for pies. Do this by clicking on him to tickle him so he'll surrender a plum. \n \nLicorice Castle: Lord Licorice has a telescope mounted atop his castle through which you can view the whole of Candy Land. \n \nPeppermint Forest: Mr. Mint, the royal lumberjack, tutors you in how to make freeform music on a hodgepodge of instruments. \n \nGumdrop Mountains: Jolly, the official Gumdrop Mountain Greeter, enlists your help to restore color to the Gumdrop Mountains. Do this by selecting gumdrop colors that Jolly can place in his spoon-shaped catapult to launch toward the mountain. \n \nPeanut Brittle House: Help Grandma Nut grow candy by planting seeds of chocolate chips, caramel chunks, etc. in mounds and watering them. Also, help her redecorate her house. \n \nLollipop Woods: Princess Lolly offers the opportunity to help decorate lollipops with designs that come from a coloring machine that the player can control. \n \nIce Cream Sea: Create an enormous ice cream sundae and then request that the fairy set it adrift on the ice cream sea to be devoured wholesale by a whale. \n \nMolasses Swamp: Gloppy, the curator of the swamp, is just happy to see the player. Children will have fun interacting with the surroundings.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/candy-land-a-childs-first-game-comes-to-life"}
