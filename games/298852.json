Time is extremely slow here, and you can interact with and change almost nothing, as if the world is frozen. It's home to a single, bizarre villain named Drain Face - a creature who was once human, turned into a mutated monster that survives only off of the rainwater that falls in the rainy parallel world.", "summary": "Your goal is to travel through three large areas in the rainy world while dodging Drain Face and his abilities. This is the neutral ending, though you are still killed and you become the next Drain Face (big lore). There's also a good ending, where you collect the souls of your victims (which are represented as glowing glass balls), use them to defeat Drain Face and move into the afterlife with the victims. And lastly, a bad ending, where you actually find your own car in the parallel world's version of the river, along with your body floating inside it. If you have collected the victims' souls by this point, you can physically throw them to smash open the window of your car, which wakes you up in the real world, giving you an unfair second chance at living while destroying the souls of your victims. An ugly, immoral loophole.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/floodbound--1"}
