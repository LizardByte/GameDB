Set in a dynamic urban environment teeming with life, Spyfall puts you and your friends in the middle of a thrilling game of deception, strategy, and survival.\n\nIn a city alive with NPCs, five players take on unique roles. One becomes the relentless police officer, tasked with uncovering spies hidden among the bustling crowd. The other four assume the roles of citizens\u2014spies with a mission. Their goal? Complete covert tasks across the city without raising suspicion and, above all, avoid getting caught.\nThe police officer must use sharp observational skills and quick thinking to separate players from NPCs and bring the spies to justice. Meanwhile, the spies must stay one step ahead, blending seamlessly into the environment, avoiding detection, and fulfilling their objectives.\n\nWith its immersive city setting, full of roads, towering buildings, and interactive elements, Spyfall challenges players to think creatively, adapt to the chaos, and outsmart their opponents.\n\n\n\nWill you play the part of the perfect spy and escape unnoticed, or will you become the ultimate law enforcer, exposing the traitors among the crowd?\n\nThe city is watching. The game begins.\n\n\n#mb_studio #spyfall", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7VipSPM20Tc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7VipSPM20Tc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7VipSPM20Tc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7VipSPM20Tc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7VipSPM20Tc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SpyFall - Official Reveal Trailer", "description": "SpyFall Steam Page : https://store.steampowered.com/app/3334280/SpyFall/\n\nMB Studio Discord : https://discord.gg/AKS5yQbqE8\n\nWelcome to Spyfall, a pulse-pounding multiplayer game where trust is scarce, and the stakes are high.
