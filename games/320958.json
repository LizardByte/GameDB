A man embarks on a strange adventure in pursuit of absolute power and truth. He becomes the protagonist in the story, a player. In this world, anything is possible. Many things have no explanations. Just accept the present and solve the problems. In this confusing and difficult journey, perhaps something can be understood until the end, or maybe there is still no knowledge or gain, and all the efforts end up in vain. But in any case, one cannot stop here. The road will keep extending. Keep moving forward and fighting. No matter what lies ahead, there is no fear.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wrong-door"}
