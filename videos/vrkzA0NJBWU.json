Use a combination of exploration and word puzzle gameplay to reshape reality and guide Tom through the course of three painful but transformative days of his life.\n\nYou play as Tom, a lonely, average guy with a tendency to see the negative in everything. A messy bed beckons him to give up, and an empty inbox insists that no one cares about him. Everywhere he looks, the world shows him what he lacks.\n\nUntil one day, he forgets to shut his window and lets a little bird into his life.\n\nAs the player, you play through three very different days of Tom's life, exploring his neighborhood and interpreting his thoughts through word puzzles. As his perception changes, his worldview widens, allowing Tom to see the unexplored, hidden dimensions of his life.\n\nMusic by Trevor Kowalski\n\nLinks:\n\nWebsite: https://www.frostwoodinteractive.com/unwording\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frostwood_int\nEmail: armaan@frostwoodinteractive.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vrkzA0NJBWU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vrkzA0NJBWU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vrkzA0NJBWU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vrkzA0NJBWU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vrkzA0NJBWU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Unwording - Reveal Trailer (Old)", "description": "WATCH THE UPDATED TRAILER HERE - https://youtu.be/7GZq96NeTE8\n\nWISHLIST ON STEAM - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1974250/Unwording\n\nUnwording is a narrative puzzle game about happiness, gratitude, and the power of our thoughts.
