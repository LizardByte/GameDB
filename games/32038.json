Shoot, slide and execute your way through 28 levels of incredibly British action and humour as you persuade the world to \u2018Vote BunnyLord\u2019. Use reasonable force unreasonably in a dynamic mix of run-and-gun gameplay and cover-based shootouts. \n \nThe intuitive quick-snap cover system lets you slide, roll, and dive into cover, dodging enemy fire before fighting back with tackles, executions, and hundreds of bullets. Choose between 9 different heroes, each with their own distinct gameplay style and crime-murdering abilities. Blast the city\u2019s scum through doors with Cletus\u2019 shotgun, slice them in half with Kimmy\u2019s katana dash, or simply bash crime in it\u2019s terrible face with Ronald\u2019s hammer. \n \nGo ham on primary objectives and (sometimes random) secondary goals but be prepared for unexpected mid-level events that turn the tables on the anti-heroes in an instant. SWAT teams, gun-toting elderly, helicopter gunships, pandas, pugs and suicidal samurais stand between you and election victory. \n \nNOT A HERO: SUPER SNAZZY EDITION introduces the \u201cME, MYSELF & BUNNYLORD\u201d Campaign, letting you play as the BunnyLord himself! Use unreasonable force reasonably to fix his space-time-continuum mishaps and restore balance to the universe in this new adventure featuring 3 all new missions, with new baddies, settings and challenges.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/not-a-hero-super-snazzy-edition"}
