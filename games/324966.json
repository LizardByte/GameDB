Your task is to find Dr. Glassman and infiltrate the offices of Wyerd through an experimental portal. But an equipment failure prevented the mission from being completed so easily. In a terrifying world, Hen, the almost unarmed but brave Bailey - and you.\n\nGlassman finally pulled you out of another dimension - but along with you, the monsters inhabiting Hen. And they, without delay, seized the laboratories and killed the scientists - fortunately for you, not all of them!\n\nYou were not alone in your idea to force Wierd to close the complex - the terrorists came with this idea. Their goal is to kill everyone: monsters, scientists, soldiers, you... The base is occupied by soldiers and terrorists, everyone is fighting each other. You don't know what to do anymore, just move on...\n\nBut you were captured - and isolated from the outside world. The search leads you further. Finally the surface! But not for long. Glassman dies tragically. But Weerd's offices are somewhere nearby.\n\nScientists have helped you again - and teleported you to a point near the offices of Wierd. Finally, you will be able to carry out your plan! Closer and closer to Wierd. But the offices are full of traps, everyone has turned against you - recent friends-security, marines and monsters. Monsters? You are already beginning to guess something...", "summary": "Retribution is a Half-Life mod made by Chain Studios in 2002.\n\nTell me honestly, how many sides have you been able to play as in the Half-Life universe? Gordon Freeman (original Half-Life), Adrian Shephard (Opposing Force), Barney Calhoun (Blue Shift), and other less significant characters. In all these games, we often saw a gentleman with a briefcase, in a blue jacket and tie. Who is he, what is his goal? Not a single game gave a definitive clear answer. Now we will finally find out everything, since we play from his point of view: a man named John Bailey.\n\nIt turns out that there is a struggle at the top. There are people standing above Bailey on the career ladder, and, as usual, their plans do not include saving the world from evil aliens from the world of Xen. Black Mesa is long overdue for closure - but a certain George Weird, the head of the entire system of scientific complexes, is preventing this. So the G-Man gets a job - a revolver in his pocket and off to look for Weird!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/retribution--1"}
