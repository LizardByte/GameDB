Your job is to navigate through some of the harshest environments and successfully land on drop pads spread throughout each location. Each landing earns you points with the more difficult the drop, the more points you earn to take your spot on the leaderboards. You'll start off with some easy landings on the moon and then progress through the caves of Mars, the meteor zone of Mercury, the volcanic wasteland of Venus, the ice caves of Pluto and then on to the hazardous asteroid cluster GC-12."}
