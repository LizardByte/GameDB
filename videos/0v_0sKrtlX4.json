The movements are very simple - Swipe Up, Down, Left or Right to move in the respective direction. This is the \u2018Move\u2019 part.\n\nThe objectives are very simple. The player needs to convert all the other pieces on the board to the same color as itself. And you can do that by simply jumping over a piece! This is the \u2018Jump\u2019 part.\n\nWhenever, a player jumps over a piece on the board, the piece changes it\u2019s color to opposite to what it is currently. This is the \u2018FLIP\u2019 part.\n\nAs easy as it sounds, the game keeps offering challenges in the form of special board tiles which can flip row, columns or even everything on the board, special portal tiles and even tiles that disappear once you have moved away from them!\n\nInspired by the classic games such as Othello, Checkers etc which require strategic movement of pieces across the board, jumping to capture or flip the enemy pieces, the idea for the game mechanics of \u2018Fliplomacy\u2019 was born.\n\nThe title of the game is a pun on Diplomacy. This is my simplified take on 'diplomacy' where you have to bring everyone on the same page and every move you make, could turn some pieces against you as well as turn some in your favour.\n\nThe visual style given to the game is such that the protagonist is given the role of an \u2018Diplomat\u2019 who is set out on a task to restore order to the board. Instead of capturing pieces, the game requires careful charting of path across the board to make all the pieces \u2018agree\u2019 with the Diplomat!\n\nThe tiles of the board are also designed to reflect the nature of a diplomat\u2019s life. Some special tiles reflecting the nature of decisioning, which flip rows, columns or everything on the board. Special portal tiles to paint their travelling needs. \u2019Handshake\u2019 tiles to finally seal the deal!\n\nEach of the puzzles offers a special challenge to the player to not just finish it, but also try to finish it in the minimum number of steps!\n\nWith a non-intrusive soothing soundtrack playing in the background and 150 puzzles to solve, the game offers hours of challenging gameplay for the players!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0v_0sKrtlX4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0v_0sKrtlX4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0v_0sKrtlX4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0v_0sKrtlX4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Fliplomacy - App Preview (Multiple Grids Showcase)", "description": "Fliplomacy:\niOS : https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1354991735\nGoogle Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samaria.fliplomacy.p\n\nMove, Jump, FLIP!\n\nThree words that describe the game very appropriately.\n\n\u2018Fliplomacy\u2019 is a Puzzle Game where the player controls the protagonist piece on a game board.
