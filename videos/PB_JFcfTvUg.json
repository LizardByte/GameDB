Shields can also be activated to intercept enemy shots. Firing lasers and using shields will use up energy, and if the player's energy runs out, their star base will explode. If the player does not destroy enemies or intercept their shots, their missiles will inflict damage to the player's star base. Shields will be rendered unusable on any part of the base that is hit by an enemy. The star base will be vaporized if the enemy shots penetrate the reactor at the base's core.\n\nThe player starts the game with three bases and will earn an additional one each time a level is completed.
