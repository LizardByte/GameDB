I don't know much about the plot, but who plays fighting and shmups for the plot anyway?  For the uninformed:  the Darius series is known for its fishy bosses (pun may or may not be intended :3), awesome music, and balls-busting difficulty, especially Darius Gaiden and G-Darius (the best one in mu opinion).  This game is pretty unique because it uses three screens.\r\n\r\nGameplay thingy:\r\nHad thoughts of going down the lower path and then go to Zone Z (there are multiple ways), but it desynced. -_-  Plus, I got stuck at Fatty Glutton due to no barrier.  1CC because of \"oh noes he continued this longplay sux!!1!1!\" (that might just be me being mentally unstable).  Since this game is unforgivable, I decided to semi-tool assist (record movie and abuse savestates to not show errors.)  Why unforgivable?  Die = have to start from a checkpoint (or beginning of a boss fight) with no upgrades (gauge resets, unlike Darius Gaiden, where you weapon goes down, from Wave to Laser to Missile.  Might as well quit).  I tool assisted (rerecord AND frame by frame advance) Fatty Glutton because it is just plain hard! X_X (I tried to play fair and restart from the beginning of the fight, but it was futile.)  I will call it right now:  this version of Fatty Glutton is more awesome than other versions (Darius Burst's version is pretty awesome, but only so because of the music.)  \r\n\r\nI kinda like the music.  Not the best of Zuntata (the madmen/madwomen behind Darius music), but it is an early game.\r\nMy favorite tunes:  Zone G, Fatty Glutton boss music (it caught on after reloading a kazillion savestates), Zone Iron Hammer, and Great Thing (am I the only who think it has a Ninja Gaiden vibe going on?).\r\n\r\nNo way in hell I'm going a longplay that shows all stages.  There's too many zones, man. X_X\r\nApparently, I was unaware of the auto-fire dip switch (I keep forgetting about the dip switches. -_-)\r\nIt would've made this playthrough a whole easier (and MAYBE Fatty Glutton.) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dw2PMdIpHdE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dw2PMdIpHdE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dw2PMdIpHdE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dw2PMdIpHdE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dw2PMdIpHdE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Longplay [208] Darius", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\r\n\r\nPlayed by: Tsunao\r\n\r\nThe game that started it all.
