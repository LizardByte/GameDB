Therefore a giant company named Dynatech was created to secure the demands of Earth through the discovery and development of distant worlds.\nYou run a business who wants to have a share of the huge profits that are to be made by this policy. To achieve this goal, you can buy facilities and spaceships from the Dynatech corporation. Your company must compete in the interplanetary market and sometimes in cooperation with the opponents to extract the raw material and develop customer products, food or machines."}
