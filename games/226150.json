A tragic event has deeply upset him altering his behavior. In the beginning, we don\u2019t know what happened. Ivan\u2019s mother is very worried about her son, she doesn\u2019t know how to help him and decides to ask a psychologist, Dr Alexander, for help. The psychologist is informed that Ivan loves storytelling, so he decides to go for a narrative therapy, in order to keep in touch with his suffering. Dr Alexander suggests they create a story session by session; this will make it possible for Ivan to explore his real problems without talking directly about them, since his suffering is still too intense for him to face it explicitly.\nIn this story the main character, Vain, represents Ivan\u2019s alter-ego.\nSo the game has two different narrative streams: on one hand, in the Dr Alexander\u2019s office, the boy-psychologist dialogues unfold; on the other hand you can follow Ivan\u2019s storytelling as it develops and flows with the help of Dr Alexander, which indeed is the player\u2019s key to explore Ivan\u2019s amazing inner world, acting as Vain.", "summary": "\u201cTales of Therapy\u201d is a turn-based combat system rpg game with original soundtracks and character art.
