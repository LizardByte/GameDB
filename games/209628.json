Some say it\u2019s because the game is highly addictive, some say it\u2019s because the market moves millions of dollars daily, some say those in power have been bribed, and others say\u2026 there\u2019s something else going on.\nAnd you? What\u2019s your role in this story?\nWell\u2026 That\u2019s up to you now.\u200b", "summary": "Eternum is a choice-based visual novel made in Ren'py with tons of romance, mystery, humor, and much more!", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eternum--1"}
