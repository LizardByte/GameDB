Throughout the flames and the billowing smoke of the devastated city small combat airships swooped, seeking out remnants of resistance. Huge metal and plasteel crawlers stalked throughh the remains of the city, turrents rotating, occasionally firing a burst of anti-personnel weaponry at some unseen opponent. In a few spots some small fighting still went on, but the outcome had been certain since that morning, when the defensive shields finally yielded to fleet bombardment.\n\nHalf-way around the planet, at invasion headquarters, a communications officer moved quietly towards a violet scaled humanoid watching a video screen and saluted.\n\n\"Your Grace, all task forces have reported in. Jhodleth has fallen. All resistance will be supressed by nightfall.\"\n\nThe Admiral was quiet for a while, watching the death throes of the last holdout of the native race, and the final step in the planetary conquest.\n\n\"Inform the Sauroidi Admirality. We will leave the planet to the colonists within the week.\"\n\nHe did not even turn his head.\n\nQuite a while later, in a room parsecs from the conquered planet, another sauroid glaced out across the dark room. Tiny lights shone on and within a huge translucent sphere in the center of the room in a seemingly random array. The lights were several different colors, and some of them blinked furiously. As the creature watched, one of the flashing red lights went dark for a second, then came back on as a steady purple. His Supreme Omnipotence, the Emperor of the Sauroidi, turned and left the room, smiling to himself.", "summary": "Andromeda Conquest is a strategy / conquest game in which one to four players build galactic empires by establishing and defending space colonies, managing resources, and battling other players for control of star systems. Before every turn, players receive resources from all their colonies. Those have to be used up during the turn or they are lost. Depending on the numbers of players the galaxy consists of 12 to 48 star systems.\n\nThe layout is grid-based, and the package includes a pad of graph paper for keeping track of ship and colony locations.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/andromeda-conquest", "videos": [{"id": 106082, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hkMcOVJ2mwk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkMcOVJ2mwk", "title": "Andromeda Conquest gameplay (PC Game, 1982)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hkMcOVJ2mwk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
