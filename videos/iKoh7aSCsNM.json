Here's the release of Harder Mario Bros. Meltdown to celebrate.\n\nHarder Mario Bros. Meltdown is a fully realised re-imagining of my 2019 hack, Harder Super Mario Bros. Wii. It's a full game hack that edits all of the levels to make them much, much harder. Except this time it's even harder than before! A lot of the time in this hack it will genuinely just feel like you're playing some Mario Maker kaizo levels designed by a nerd with too much free time (that's me).\n\nCan you survive as the Mushroom Kingdom heats up? Or will you struggle and meltdown?", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKoh7aSCsNM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKoh7aSCsNM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKoh7aSCsNM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKoh7aSCsNM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKoh7aSCsNM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Harder Mario Bros.
