Both paint score and kills are counted toward your total score at the end of each match.\n\nYou can group up with up to 7 friends or be randomly teamed up and matched against up to 7 other players to battle across a variety of different maps. Before a quick play match begins you are able to vote for your favorite map and team color. There is also a weekly leaderboard that you could compete with others to reach for a top ten spot each week.\n\nThe item shop includes over a hundred different character customization options. You just need to earn the in-game currency called Chips by playing matches and completing daily challenges to be able to purchase your favorite items in the Item Shop. You can also spend money to buy the in-game purchasable currency called Bukkits to be able to purchase your favorite items even quicker.\n\nThere are special limited time events that have limited timed items that are available for purchase to keep even after the event is over. Some events include a limited time map that you can only play during the special events as well!\n\nYou can host custom private matches with your friends or practice on your own and test your skills against some bots!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paint-chips", "videos": [{"id": 51925, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "E69pKJaqIW4"}]}
