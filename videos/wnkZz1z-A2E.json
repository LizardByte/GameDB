A version 1.1 has since been released. \n\nStandard mode doesn't feature any of the hypers or suicide bullets Advanced and Unlimited has but every difficulty is a completely different game on itself anyway.\n\nThe unseen stages are kinda secret and need some requirements met before you are able to access them. For example Unseen 1 you need to beat the first three stages bombing only twice or less. If you beat that and take the harder route in stage 4 you get to Unseen 2 and 3.\n\nThe scoring system is pretty simple in Standard. Collecting point items while not shooting turns them into gold which raises your multiplier for point items.\nYour multiplier goes down after dieing and bombing and also when the chaining meter runs out. Basically get it to 999x as fast as possible and collect tons of point items. \n\nThe RED gauge at the top is pretty much the same as it is in Dodonpachi Daifukkatsu Black Label. The higher it is the higher the rank gets. It raises while collecting point items and lowers during bombs and while collecting gold.\nMax Rank is -extremely- terrifying.\n\nFurthermore there are gauges in the bottom left. The purple one raises with point items collected and grants you an extra life if it's full. The yellow bar raises with grazing. Filling it up during stages gives you a point explosion and during nonspells it gives you a gold explosion. It doesn't do anything during spellcards. Filling up the life and bomb bars also gives you a screen clear.\n\nDownload for danmakufu 0.12:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?5vtnda22jm82qrm", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wnkZz1z-A2E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wnkZz1z-A2E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wnkZz1z-A2E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wnkZz1z-A2E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wnkZz1z-A2E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Phantasmagoria Trues (Danmakufu) - Standard Unseen Stages Route 1cc", "description": "Probably one of the best danmakufu scripts and Touhou fangames out there.\n\nIt's worth noting that this was done in version 1.0.
