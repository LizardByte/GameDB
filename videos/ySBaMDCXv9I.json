The game has been in development now for quite some time, but I'm happy to start promoting the page whilst I make the finishing touches.\n\nCryptid Farm is a multiplayer horror-farming game that I've been working on since early 2020. The game involves a simple loop of planting, watering your crops, and harvesting them whilst always at the peril of wandering cryptids.\n\nYou can find the demo and a development history on my itch.io here: https://fistflame.itch.io/cryptid-farm\n\nSpecial thanks to my editor and composer for helping make this trailer possible, you guys nailed it! Also a special thanks to the Cryptid Farm community for working with me to record this footage :D\n\nTrailer Credits:\nGameplay recording - FistFlame (Me)\n\nEditor - KoalaPupProductions\n\nMusic - Pompadoormat", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySBaMDCXv9I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySBaMDCXv9I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySBaMDCXv9I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySBaMDCXv9I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ySBaMDCXv9I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cryptid Farm - Steam Wishlist Trailer", "description": "WISHLIST NOW!!!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1892140/Cryptid_Farm/\n\nThis is the Steam Wishlist trailer for my game Cryptid Farm.
