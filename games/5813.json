Somehow, it mysteriously reappeared near one of the moons of Jupiter. A team called S.O.A.R. (Special Operations And Reconnaissance) onboard the investigative Probe ship Seyfert are sent to investigate. A smaller shuttle lifts off from the Seyfert to investigate. Suddenly, the supership launches its turbo cannons at the Probe ship, destroying it. It then aims and fires at the shuttle. The weapon causes a large explosion, killing most of the troops and crew members aboard. Fortunately, a few of the team members of S.O.A.R., Patrick Tyler, McCoy, Sonya Hart and commander Jacob Ranshaw, were able to survive the blast and managed to board the ship. What will await them inside is just the beginning, if they can survive, rescue the other survivors and escape the bowels of the mysterious ship.", "summary": "Dino Crisis 3 is a survival horror video game released exclusively for the Xbox. It is the fourth and final game in the Dino Crisis series. Like the previous iterations of the series, gameplay revolves around fighting dinosaurs. Unlike the first three installments of the Dino Crisis series, the enemies in the game are not real-world dinosaurs, but new species created through advanced genetic engineering technology. The action takes place in outer space, on a starship, the Ozymandias.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dino-crisis-3", "videos": [{"id": 36006, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mMpogapL9nA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMpogapL9nA", "title": "#5\u3010XBOX\u3011\u300eDINO CRISIS3\uff0f\u30c7\u30a3\u30ce\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30b7\u30b93\u300f\u3053\u3044\u3064\u3089\u5f37\u3059\u304e\u308b\uff01", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mMpogapL9nA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
