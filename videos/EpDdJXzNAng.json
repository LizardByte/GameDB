I used \"BFME2 Widescreen Enhanced\" so its was finally playable. \nHere is a video explaining how to set it up to play in widescreen.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1r0m40mp7A\n\n\nIn-game menu is stretched but the rest is in proper aspect ratio.\n\n=============================================\nI recorded this at 1920x1080 because i have some problems with my monitor at 1280x720.\nI apologize in advance for those rough cuts in this clip.\nWindows Movie Maker sucks! Wax 2.0 sucks!.\nI couldn't get this vid done in those editors. \nSo what i did is: i cut whole gameplay into pieces that i wanted. Then joined them into 1 video and converted it to mkv.\nMKV Encode was: 10min 12sec, 4mb/s, 1080p, DXVA compliant; and filesize was 306,4 MB.\nAt first bitrate was 6mb/s, but youtube compression is so high, that it could be wast of time, so i end up with 4mb/s.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow little info about this clip. It starts with the menu; I then choose skirmish and decided to play as Dwarfs against Mordor forces on difficult level. \nThere is also 'brutal' difficulty level. But it takes a lot of time to beat it. \n\nAnyway, i like some ideas in this sequel, but i think i like more the first BFME.\n\nAs you can see, there is a little of preparation at the beginning of this vid. I build some mines, then a \"barracks\" to create dwarfs. \nI also wanted to show some graphics improvements over the first game. Not much, but still...\nAnyway, this vid is still about battle. Nothing fancy here, no heroes or Balrog in this battle, but...\n\nOh, everything is set to max (no AA), running quite good on Radeon HD4650, intel q9300 (3GHz), 4GB RAM at 1920x1080.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpDdJXzNAng/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpDdJXzNAng/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpDdJXzNAng/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpDdJXzNAng/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpDdJXzNAng/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth II [Gameplay HD] 16:9", "description": "Read Description!
