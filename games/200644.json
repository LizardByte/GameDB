The animation features Banjo, Kazooie and Mumbo Jumbo being chased by enemies from Banjo-Tooie, all using their models from the game.\n\nIn 2002, Rare was brought by Microsoft, which caused the cancellation of various games developed for Nintendo systems at the time, which would've included Banjo-Threeie. Despite any of this however, it's not exactly known if a game called Banjo-Threeie ever existed in a physical form.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/banjo-threeie"}
