Rockett, although excited, soon finds out that Ruben Rosales, who was also invited, will instead be at Max Diamond's party (which is on the same night), performing with his band Debaser. Miko makes Rockett promise to be at Nakili's instead, even if she is invited to Max's later on. Rockett promises and leaves for her next class.\n\nIn science class, Rockett sits with Ruben, who attempts to put a (fake) frog's leg in the acid. Rockett immediately freaks out, and Dana teases her for it. Depending on the player's choice, Rockett can either let the situation drop with Dana, become ashamed about her own reaction, or retaliate; Ruben will either try to calm down the fight, if one occurs, or, stand up for Rockett. Either way, things get out of hand, and the science teacher Mr. 'Clueless' Shuliss, decides to separate them, much to Ruben and Rockett's disappointment. Depending on the player's choice (after Rockett has been moved to another group) Mavis will tell Rockett about Ruben's feelings for her, and Ruben will then find an excuse to return and try to invite Rockett to Max's party.\n\nIn the girls' bathroom, Rockett meets up with Nakili and confides in her about the party, but Dana overhears her from the stall, and comes out to confront Rockett. Rockett shares that earlier she had a nasty run-in with Dana, and would much rather stay away from her. She also mentions that she'd love to go check out DeBaser at Max's party on Saturday. The CSG girls leave, and two new girls appear, whom Rockett has never met before, up until this point. The two girls, Arianna 'Arrow' Mayfield and Viva Cortez tell Rockett that they have been hearing all about her artistic talents and would love if she'd help design some halloween costumes for them. Once again, it's up to the player to decide whether or not Rockett should respond. Whitney appears and announces that they need to go to gym soon, or they will be late.\n\nIn gym class, the students are playing soccer, and Rockett has another run-in, this time with Nicole. After this, Cleve and Mavis appear, and after talking with them a bit, Rockett is called out onto the field. Rockett can either participate or sit out on the bench (this will earn her a detention), but in any case, Max is impressed with Rockett and he invites her to his big party right on the spot. If Rockett chooses not to participate in the gym activity, she will land herself in detention, and meet up with Ruben, as well as a new character, Wolf Dubois. If she played soccer, then afterwards, in the locker room, Rockett will meet up with Jessie, and witness Sharla bullying her friend. From then on, Rockett can choose either to defend Jessie, step in as the friendly referee, or leave the situation as is. After school, Rockett must decide whether to go to Nakili's Party or Max's.", "summary": "The second game in the Rockett Movado series of visual novels.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rocketts-tricky-decision", "collections": [{"id": 7244, "name": "Rockett Series"}]}
