The gameplay is split in two phases: planning and action. The first phase is planning your escape by plotting a vector path on a 2D map. Due to your power supply being damaged, you have to make a path while picking up spare batteries along the way. Once you make a path that makes it to the exit, you switch to the 3D Action phase and protect your robot companion who provides you energy as you both fight your way through the corridors.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/robros"}
