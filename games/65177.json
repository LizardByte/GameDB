To bring energy and activities back to the village, he uses the gem stones the Airus found in the mines to create a puzzle game. Welcome to the puzzle festival. The victor is getting his wish granted, so all the cats and even some of the monsters, such as Jingaoh and Iiankuk drop everything that they are doing to play. The rules are simple, just line up the gem stones around the bomb and blast them away before the screen chokes up. Every time you blast the stones away, you'll get a chance to send your opponents the annoying Donguri blocks. This is the chance where even the smallest of cats can defeat the big bad dragon.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pazuru-in-airou"}
