Please, support us: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lofturstudio/kofi-quest-alpha-mod-a-fantastic-comedy-rts?ref=ddrtvv\n\nA fantastic comedy RTS in a cartoon-style world. Form your army, equip your soldiers and explore with a funny story voiced in English.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe game\n\nKofi Quest: Alpha MOD is a not-so-serious adventure that brings together mechanics from Action RPG and RTS games. You\u2019ll control Kofi, a weak, lazy and unlucky videogame character that will be followed by a group of interesting (and pathetic) characters aiding him to live a great adventure.\n\nThe videogame introduces a world of comic fantasy in which the characters are aware of being part of a videogame. Kofi is an RPG character that spends his days lazing around without leveling up. His game is a total mess and every character around him plays better.\n\nYour camp (\"the Shelter\") will be your gathering point. It\u2019s where all the characters you recruit for your army will wait for you. You can talk to them and get them ready for a quest. \n\nEvery time you want to resume the main campaign, you can go to a new quest and thus continue the game story.\n\nWhen you finish a new segment of the campaign, you can choose between continuing right away or freely exploring the map you\u2019ve unlocked thus far in search of gold, treasures or side quests.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFollow us!\n\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/705340\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/lofturstudio\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/lofturstudio\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lofturstudio\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/RTYQSCc", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ULh5Zpq7pv0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ULh5Zpq7pv0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ULh5Zpq7pv0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ULh5Zpq7pv0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ULh5Zpq7pv0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Kofi Quest: Alpha MOD - Kickstarter Trailer - A fantastic comedy RTS", "description": "Live NOW on Kickstarter!
