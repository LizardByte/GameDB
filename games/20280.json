Watch out, villains - Starfy and his gruff-talking sidekick clam, Moe, are setting out on another astonishing adventure: to help a mysterious, bunny-eared visitor find his lost memory. There's nothing he can't handle! Jetting through powerful ocean currents, gliding over bottomless pits, swimming straight up glittering rainbows, plowing into packs of shadowy evildoers, it's all in a day's work for the legendary Starfy. And when danger strikes, Starfy can team up with his friend to shape shift into four unstoppable forms. Is a tangle of overgrown bushes blocking the way? Starfy can transform into Monster and torch it with his scorching Fire Belly ability! Is a small army of baddies guarding a treasure? He can shape shift into Rooster and let out a Super Gawk! Mix it up with some mini-games! Hook up with your friends over local wireless (existing connection is required) and face off in fabulous mini-games, Race to the ocean floor in Depth Chargers, hook the big one in Fishing Derby, rush to trace shapes in Sand Tracer, and shoot some change in Coin Slinger, or challenge yourself to see how many tasty octopus snacks you can cook up in Dumpling Master! You can also team up with a friend over Local Wireless and play levels from the main adventure together as Starfy and his sister, Starly.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legendary-starfy", "videos": [{"id": 136287, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "guOZaWPpB5k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guOZaWPpB5k", "title": "The Legendary Starfy Playthrough Part 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/guOZaWPpB5k/sddefault.jpg"}]}
