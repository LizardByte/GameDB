Core Punk MMORPG classes feature tanks, damage dealers, healers, and support. This variety will allow players to create truly unique team combinations that will help them on their quests throughout the game.\n\nEugene Kiver also talked to IGN about all the environments seen in the Core Punk trailer. The Core Punk game will feature environments based on 4 distinct punk cultures: mono punk, cyberpunk, steampunk, and a post-apocalyptic punk world.\n\nFor more information on Core Punk, be sure to stay tuned to IGN.\n\nThanks for checking out IGN\u2019s Summer of Gaming!
