Players summon units and cast spells using their pre-built deck. Summoned units can be moved around the board and attack enemy units and structures. The player who destroys an opponent's portal wins.\n\nIt is necessary to occupy resource tiles and build mines there to play more powerful cards. There are also other special effect tiles on the board that expand the range of possible play styles. Each player will find their own winning strategy.\n\nMap terrain and tile layout are different in every match, making Sollarion less repetitive, more complex and more entertaining than its competitors.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sollarion"}
