It is up to a covert organization, known only as Men In Black, to stop the invasion. You take the role of Agent J as he hunts down 12 different alien races, including the Skraaldians and the Fmeck. Luckily, J has a wide range of weapons to help him put an end to the alien menace; most notable is the Noisy Cricket. While most aliens are relatively easy to spot, some can change shape and will not reveal themselves until J gets close to them...so keep your eyes peeled. When a stage is cleared, you are treated to an animated sequence that advances the plot. Will the Agent J be able to save the world?
