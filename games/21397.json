Numerous options and driving aids allow you to customise the experience to suit your skill and preferences - from arcade style, to full technical simulation.\n\nOther improvements over the previous games in the series include high-definition graphics, full surround sound and support for the SIXAXIS controller. Players can choose to steer the cars by tilting the controller.
