His goal is to get the individual stones to the target square of the same color. Each time the player moves a stone in a chosen direction, that stone does not stop moving until it hits another stone or arrives at a position on the game grid from which it is no longer allowed to move in that direction. This principle forces players to devise clever solutions, such as strategically placing other stones in such places that the moving stone stops where it is needed.\nThis unique game mechanic, which won the original Guroku so many fans around the world with its originality, is expanded in the new Guroku Rainbow with two new types of stones.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/guroku-rainbow"}
