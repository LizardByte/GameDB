Starting with modest resources, your mission is to lead your forces through the ages of prehistory, upgrading your base, developing your troops, and mastering skills and technologies tailored to this primitive world. With each level, the challenges grow tougher, as enemies become more resilient and strategic, making every battle more intense and harder to survive. You\u2019ll need to adapt your strategy, strengthen your defenses, and recruit increasingly powerful units to stay ahead.\n\nContinuous improvement of your camp lies at the heart of the experience. After each battle, you earn science points, a valuable resource that allows you to unlock powerful upgrades. Using these points, you can reinforce your base fortifications, increase your warriors' strength, and unlock new abilities that will turn the tide in upcoming battles. Whether you choose to build an impenetrable defense, train a formidable army, or explore advanced prehistoric technologies, every decision will impact your future combats.\n\nFor a more personal touch, you can also customize your units and army with unique skins. These customization options add originality to your playstyle and allow you to forge an army that reflects your vision.\n\nThe ultimate challenge is to progress through the levels and overcome the ever-more fearsome waves of prehistoric enemies. As you advance, you\u2019ll unlock new units, from basic warriors to mighty champions, each with unique skills to turn the tide of battle. The enemy waves will grow stronger without relent, but with each level, you\u2019ll gain the tools and knowledge needed to overcome them and lead your army to victory.\n\nAnd the best part? The game is completely free. Everything is accessible without ever needing to pull out your credit card, thanks to a fair ad-supported system that fuels your progression.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lentrainement-des-guerriers", "videos": [{"id": 133772, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "kXmmF3PKGiI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXmmF3PKGiI", "title": "\ud83d\ude80 J'ai CR\u00c9\u00c9 un Jeu Mobile en 30 JOURS !!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kXmmF3PKGiI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
