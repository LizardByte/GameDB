This council was composed of divine beings and legendary heroes from every corner of the world, entrusted with the sacred duty of maintaining the balance between life, death, and the elements\u2014Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and Ether. These mighty guardians hailed from different cultures and mythologies, bound by a shared purpose to protect the realm from chaos.\n\nBut the balance was not meant to last forever. A mysterious force, known only as the Shadow of Dusk, crept into the realms, sowing discord among the council members. Ancient alliances were shattered, and once-loyal guardians turned on each other, driven by their desire to harness the boundless power of the Regal Realms for themselves.\n\nWith the council fractured, the world descended into chaos. Powerful beings from Indian epics, African folklore, Southeast Asian myths, Arabian tales, and Latin American legends rose to stake their claim to the throne of the Regal Realms. Deities, warriors, and mythical creatures from every corner of the world now battle for dominion, each seeking to shape the realms in their image.\n\nIn the midst of this war-torn world, the last surviving champions of the Old Order gather to fight for the salvation of the Regal Realms. These warriors, drawn from the myths and legends of diverse cultures, are the last hope to restore the balance. But only one can emerge victorious.\n\nAs a player, you are called to summon and command these legendary figures. From the strength of Hanuman, the Indian divine warrior, to the cunning of Anansi, the African trickster god, and the wisdom of Quetzalcoatl, the Latin American serpent deity, you will build your army and lead them into battle. Using a deck of cards that grants you control over troops, spells, and weapons, you must defend your tower and strike down your opponents in a series of epic battles.\n\nThe fate of the Regal Realms rests in your hands. Will you restore balance to the world, or will you become the new ruler of the shattered realms, reshaping it according to your will?\n\nThe stage is set for the ultimate clash of legends\u2014Epiko Regal: The Rise of the Elemental Champions.", "summary": "Epiko Regal is an immersive mobile strategy game that seamlessly blends collectible card gameplay with tower defense battles.
