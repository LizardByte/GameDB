Radac Tailor-Made was thus only given out to Bridgestone dealers, who would probably set it up in their shops so potential customers could play around. \n \nBesides illustrating just how pervasive Famicom culture was in the '80s, Tailor-Made is now one of the rarest Nintendo cartridges on the secondary market.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/radac-tailor-made"}
