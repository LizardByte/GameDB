A planet gets invaded by pickles. The player (alternating between playing a man and a woman) goes on a journey to find hidden weapons. The player needs to collect all the SaladShooters in the level to pass through the exit door. The player can then shoot salad at the aliens, and the aliens will faint. Junk food and pickles are collectible for points, and carrots are for health.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pickle-wars", "videos": [{"id": 109513, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PyO7ADlXHBY"}]}
