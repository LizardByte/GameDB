Now, however, humanity has just lost a war against the powerful Demon Empire and is being hunted down as slaves.\n\nThe last remaining hope for freedom is the ruined city of Niu Heym where, with any luck, at least some of your wards will be able to return to the humans' ancestral homeworld before the portal-gate closes for another thousand years.\n\nYou are an elf guide tasked with leading a small party of humans over a thousand kilometers west across all of Aphrodisia to the city of Niu Heym and the Portal Gate. With any luck, at least some of your wards will be able to return to the humans' ancestral homeworld before the portal gate runs out of rift charges. It is your job to try and get them there, but forces are acting against you, wishing to take some, or all, of your charges and to transform or enslave them.\n\nThis will be a long and dangerous trek\u2026 and you may not walk out on the same two feet! Are you up to the challenge?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-exile-of-aphrodisia"}
