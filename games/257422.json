It features an extensive dehacked patch with changes to weapons and monsters, alongside varied maps and gameplay. You'll be fighting through wastelands, abandoned facilities, hellish installations, ruined cities, frozen techbases and beyond...\n\nThe intended difficulity is UV but all other skills are implemented. There is something for everyone, including maps dripping with atmosphere, non linear keyhunts, short shootouts, frantic slaughter and a few true epics. Don't worry if you're intimidated, the largest fights have been inundated with powerups on the lower difficulties to allow the budding tourist to explore safely.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/uprising"}
