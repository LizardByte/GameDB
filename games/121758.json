The goal was to develop a highly maneuverable, highly advanced stealth war machine for impervious and mountainous terrain, that can deploy unhackable low-range drones to operate in high-risk environments. The program was a full success, and the Comanche special units seemed unstoppable in their missions.\n\nBut then the blueprints leaked through a whistleblower website, and so every group and power, who could afford it, built and modified the Comanche for their own purposes. A new era of helicopter warfare had begun.", "summary": "Comanche is a modern team-based online multiplayer helicopter shooter set in the near future.
