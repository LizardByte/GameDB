It was released by Alex Decker (myolden) in August 2022 and combines vanilla-style aesthetics with modern map design philosophies. Most maps are smallish in size, with a focus on easy-to-medium difficulty and fewer than 100 monsters. While level geometry and texturing is intentionally kept simple, the wad contains many instances of environmental storytelling as well as occasional doomcute detailing. Each level in the wad is named after a metal song that came out prior to 2000. The midi soundtrack is assembled from various sources from inside and outside the Doom community, containing no bespoke tracks.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nostalgia--2"}
