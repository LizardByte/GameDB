There's spelling errors throughout the entire game, as well as typographical errors that have the Edo era characters speaking very modern at unexpected times. The graphics were criticized as especially ugly in 2008 when the PS3 was gaining popularity, and the narrative is hard to follow as the text moves automatically with no text log. Everything is timed, and knowing what to do next is very difficult without a guide.\n\nAfter gathering all your information throughout the year, you have a trial, which can result in different endings.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oookuki"}
