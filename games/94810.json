As ruler of your own nation, you will strive to outmaneuver, out-fight, out-talk and out-produce up to 20 enemies in an intense struggle to rule the boot of Italy, Britannia or Gaul.\n\nGrow your cities by collecting resources such as wood and ore to increase your armies in numbers and types like building a Fletcher provides archers to your troops. Once you amass your troops you can declare war on your neighbors and proceed to capture cities to claim as your own. Combat is purely tactical in the sense you only select the type of troops, how many, in what formation and how to attack (hold for a few seconds then advance, advance for a little then hold, etc.). Once the battle begins you have no control of your armies. Combat is not the only option as you can form alliances with other nations and offer peace to a nation at war with you. Once you have conquered 40% of the map and it is at least 25% bigger than the next largest nation you are victorious.\n\nLegion is a single player game only. Some of the unique features include: historical accuracy in maps, uniforms and weapons that reflect the country you play in and large numbers of AI opponents with their own strengths and weaknesses.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legion--1"}
