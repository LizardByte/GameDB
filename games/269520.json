Nobunaga's Ambition takes place during the Japanese Warring States period. As the title suggests, The player is tasked with achieving the ultimate goal of warlord Oda Nobunaga; the conquest and unification of Japan. Selecting Nobunaga is optional, however, as the player is also able to choose from a variety of other regional daimyo of the time. Nobunaga no Yabou - Shouseiroku is the seventh title in the series, released March 1997 for Windows 95. This game introduces a new map, portraying the entire country on a grid.
