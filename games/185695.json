Opening Supply Boxes rewards the player with Research Documents that can be used to upgrade Blocks or to unlock new Blocks. As a player wins more battles their ranking will rise, allowing them to climb to the top of the ladder and become a legendary tank captain.\nA player can also make Blueprints of their original tank creations and share them with other players to download and use. They can show them off on social media as well.", "videos": [{"id": 62212, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3YM52a7ZcAk"}]}
