The ageing Battlestar Galactica managed to escape the attack, and set out to find a new home: a planet known as Earth. \nPursued by Cylon forces, Battlestar Galactica and the remaining Colonial Fleet were reunited with another survivor of the Cylon attack, the Battlestar Pegasus. Together, they struck back and destroyed the Cylon Fleet's Resurrection Ship. \n \nThe Cylons launched a massive counterattack in retaliation. Caught unprepared, the Colonials attempted to jump away to safety, but something went terribly wrong. The FTL drives of both fleets were overloaded, triggering an uncontrolled jump that threw them far off course. \n \nIn Battlestar Galactic Online, both the Colonial and Cylon fleets have found themselves stranded in an unexplored area of space. Heavily damaged and critically low on resources, both fleets must race against time to repair and rearm themselves while contesting for control of nearby systems rich in Tylium, metals, and water. The Colonial fleet is desperately searching for a way to escape and continue their journey to Earth before the Cylons regain enough strength to wreak their revenge and destroy humanity once and for all.", "summary": "Browser MMORPG based on the hit TV series.
