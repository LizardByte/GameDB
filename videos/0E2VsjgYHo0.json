The series was intended to introduce a new audience, such as casual gamers, to the Heroes of Might and Magic series. As part of that strategy, each installment of Chronicles was released as a low-cost episode containing a relatively short single-player campaign, and the difficulty level of each game was kept low. All Chronicles games are based on a limited version of the Heroes of Might and Magic III game engine, although the ability to play scenario maps and multiplayer games is not included in any Chronicles title.\nThe series consists of eight installments released in five retail packages and supplemented by two downloadable packages. The first two titles, Warlords of the Wasteland and Conquest of the Underworld, were released on September 27, 2000. The next two installments, Clash of the Dragons and Masters of the Elements, were released shortly thereafter on November 15, 2000. In the meantime, 3DO offered The World Tree as a free download, which would install on any system with at least two retail episodes. Similarly, Fiery Moon would install on any system with at least three retail episodes. Lastly, The Sword of Frost and Revolt of the Beastmasters were released together under the name The Final Chapters on June 1, 2001. All eight games were released through GOG.com in June 2011.\n\nEnjoy and Subscribe!\n\n#game #glitch #bugs #funny #epic #fails #videogame #compilation", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0E2VsjgYHo0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0E2VsjgYHo0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0E2VsjgYHo0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0E2VsjgYHo0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0E2VsjgYHo0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Heroes of Might and Magic III: Chronicles (2000) - All INTRO with Tarnum", "description": "Heroes of Might and Magic III: Chronicles (2000) - All INTRO with Tarnum!\n\nHeroes Chronicles is a series of turn-based strategy video games developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing and published by the 3DO Company.
