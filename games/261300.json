Will I wake up when I come home? ...\"\n\nThe following text is part of a report found in the belongings of journalist and photographer Carlos A. Chaves, who mysteriously disappeared on January 16, 2007.\n\nIn 1943, a mysterious disease victimized most of the people in a small village. The infected people (mostly children) were kept isolated in their homes, and to avoid seeing their own deformed faces their parents covered them with a cloth bag.\nFrom there a legend was born that, when looking in the mirror, the person would have his image stolen and in exchange, he was left with a deformed physique and a soulless body.\nIt was a way to prevent children from looking in the mirror.\n\nIn the same year the disease was fought by an armed group who invaded the village and killed the victims, and in the same way, they mysteriously disappeared.\n\nApproximately sixty years later:\n\nAdam moved to the Nevoeiro Village, together with his son Charles, in early 2000, shortly after divorcing his wife.\nNevoeiro Village seemed to be the most peaceful town in the world, and the most boring too.\nWhat was different about the tiny country town?\nAbsolutely nothing, until Adam woke up to find that his son had disappeared from his house and, with a terrible headache, realized that it was suddenly snowing in the middle of summer.\nWhen Adam goes outside, he finds the carport locked and an anomaly by the gate preventing any passage.\n\n- Could it be the devil? - he wondered.\nAnd who was that strange old man who had appeared in his house?\n- You asked for my services, remember? Two days ago, but you said you had such a headache... I think you spent some time sleeping and forgot...\".\n\"God, my head...\"\n- Have you seen Charlie? My boy...\n- Oh, yes... Charles... You said he was gone, but... how could he be out in weather like this? And the gate... It's just dead-ended....\n- Ha, yes... the devil! He wants to torment me... Don't you think?....\n\nCharles, where would my little \"Charlie\" be?\nIn the midst of a distorted world, Adam desperately searches for Charles, not knowing if he is dreaming or going insane.", "summary": "Vila do Nevoeiro R.E.L.I.D.O is an psychological horror game that tells the story of Adam, who has recently moved to the strange Nevoeiro Village shortly after divorcing his wife, and his son, Charles, who has mysteriously disappeared in the midst of a distorted world.
