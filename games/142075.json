The brick takes up 2 spaces when it's laying on its side and 1 space when it's standing up. This is important because you'll need to maneuver through some tricky mazes without falling off of the edge. Don't worry if you do, though, you have unlimited lives!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ao", "videos": [{"id": 44076, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hUePbU-t_SE"}]}
