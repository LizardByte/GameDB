The player controls Remy, a rat with a refined sense of taste. When Remy finds himself in Paris near the restaurant of the famous deceased chef Gusteau, he works on making his dream of becoming a chef himself come true, while helping out his fellow rats to procure food.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ratatouille--1", "videos": [{"id": 32850, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "duFlg4Y-yCc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duFlg4Y-yCc", "title": "Ratatouille video game trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/duFlg4Y-yCc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
