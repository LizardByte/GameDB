But in Metal Bringer, you instead collect \"disks\", which contain apps that are installed onto your Labor. These apps strengthen your character and powerup your actions in an easier and more intuitive way, making it all the more exciting and satisfying to mow down hordes of enemies as your character keeps growing stronger.\n\nNew Technologies - Both Visual and Audio\nThis game uses the same voxel art style as Samurai Bringer, but just like Samurai Bringer, it also implements a real time pixel art generating system, and will also feature the newest raytracing technology for beautifully lit environments.\nThe music too is made with the newest technology, as it is played in real time and changes according to the situation.\n\nPlayism:\nhttps://playism.com/en/game/metal-bringer/\n\n\u00a9 2023 Alphawing Inc.
