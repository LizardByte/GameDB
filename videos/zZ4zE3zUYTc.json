Imagination can be more real than our world. Will the doctor help? Immerse yourself in the stories of these characters.\n\nA game that aims to leave its mark on the genre of narrative-driven psychological horrors is ready to tell chilling tales of protagonists suffering from psychiatric disorders.\n\nSuspense: Madman's Dream lets you become, for a while, a creator, an observer, and a madman all at once.\n\nExplore the habitats of the characters: a hospital, a dungeon, an English house from the 1950s\u2014all through the eyes of several mentally ill individuals. Watch as their minds crumble before your eyes, tearing apart like an abandoned mansion. Wander through ever-changing environments, face fears and phobias head-on, and feel like someone is always watching you. Even when you think no one\u2019s there, chances are, someone is still staring at your back.\n\nYour goal is to direct the events and assemble all the pieces into a logical story, giving insight into the character's state of mind. To achieve this, you\u2019ll need to explore the world and piece together narrative and interactive elements in your mind.

This is exactly what can be found in the pages of psychiatry textbooks\u2014what might happen to a person suffering from such conditions.

I'm already flattered if you're reading this. My name is Oscar. I'm a former doctor, and I've had the experience of working with people suffering from psychiatric disorders in a mental hospital, including in the forensic psychiatry department, where individuals who committed terrible acts due to their illnesses are treated.\n\nI want you to understand how difficult this is. With mental disorders, people often don't even realize the severity of their condition. Some of the stories of the mentally ill amazed me deeply. Some of them have drifted so far from reality that their stories resembled science fiction movies or games.\n\nSince I left medicine for game development, I want to try to convey that feeling to you.\n\nSome elements may seem illogical from a gaming perspective, but believe me, they are logical if you refer to psychiatric textbooks.\n\nEnjoy the game!\n\n\n#horrorgame #indiegame #Suspense #SuspenseGame #SuspenseMD \n#TSSMD #tessermind", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZ4zE3zUYTc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZ4zE3zUYTc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZ4zE3zUYTc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZ4zE3zUYTc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Suspense: Madman's Dreams | Official Teaser", "description": "Steam - https://store.steampowered.com/app/3395810/Suspense_Madmans_Dreams/\n\nIt\u2019s time to dive in and feel the pain.
