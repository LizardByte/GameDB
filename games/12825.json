The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren't always clear-cut. You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy - this reduces the significance of the points system.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/whizz"}
