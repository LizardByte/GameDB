Are you up to the challenge?\n'Pigeon: A Love Story' is a 'slow game' in which you take on the role of a pigeon searching for their pigeon-shaped soulmate in the city of London, home of over one million pigeons. To keep the game as accurate (and difficult) as possible, both the scale of the city itself - and the pigeon count within it - have been made as accurate as possible.\nThis relaxing, meditative game with a loose objective is perfect for those looking for a moment of pigeon-based escapism. With soothing gameplay and a calming soundtrack, this is a game that's most definitely more about the journey.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pigeon-a-love-story"}
