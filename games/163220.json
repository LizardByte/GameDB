The majority of the known universe has been consolidated under the rule of a conglomerate known as the Metagalactic Collective.\n\nThe Collective is guided by a benevolent but enigmatic A.I known as \u201cThe Onemind\u201d, whose primary function is to ensure peace and prosperity for all. As a result of the knowledge and advancements it has discovered, Onemind has developed a large and devoted group of followers who treat it as a God.\n\nIn 11751 AD, the Onemind revealed a revolutionary new technology: Terraforming Capsules. These capsules cause a planet to spontaneously undergo millions of years of evolution in a matter of seconds. Even barren asteroids will develop an atmosphere, a thriving ecosystem, and vast underground resources when bombarded by these mysterious burrowing machines.\n\nThree planets (Terra Prime, Terra Simia, Terra Caldera) and one moon (Luna Praxis) in a sector of space called Dalarnia were chosen to undergo the first wave of terraforming experiments. News quickly spread of boundless riches being unearthed on these strange new planets. Any rumors of unexpected side effects, bizarre underground anomalies, or abominations in the depths were quickly suppressed \u2014 giving the impression of a utopian gold rush. Travelers from across the Galaxy flocked to the Dalarnian sector, hoping to strike it rich.\n\nAs one of these hopeful miners, you have spent your life savings to travel to Luna Praxis on the outskirts of the sector.
