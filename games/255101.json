Hopefully, she can win the contest too.\n\nThings don\u2019t quite go as planned, however, as her costume turns out not to be so unique.\n\nIn anticipation of Something\u2019s In The Air Redux coming in April, the separate purchase of the older Something\u2019s In The Air and Rachel Meets Ariane has been discontinued. Rachel Meets Ariane will be included as a bonus in the Somethings In The Air Redux game.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rachel-and-ariane"}
