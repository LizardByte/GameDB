Thus, similarly to VF series, there's no fireballs or other special attacks of that kind. But, unlike VF, there's no jump button, even if there's the possibility to jump over opponents for additional damage when they're on the ground. Also, a side-step dodge through the L and R buttons can be done, showing that the game also uses a 3D gameplay.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/goiken-muyou-anarchy-in-the-nippon"}
