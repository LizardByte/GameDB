Supaplex introduces a number of new elements that were not present in Boulder Dash, including bugs, pieces of base that randomly cause a life threatening electrostatic discharges, Ports, which limit Murphy's movement to specific directions, and terminals, which set off yellow Utility Disks.\n\nUtility Disks are explosive floppy disks and come in three different colors: Orange Disks work like Zonks, but explode when hit or when falling. Yellow Disks do not fall yet may be pushed in any direction, and explode when the Terminal is used. Red Disks can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/supaplex", "videos": [{"id": 20019, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "8dMF3jU-nwc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dMF3jU-nwc", "title": "PC Longplay [357] Supaplex", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8dMF3jU-nwc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
