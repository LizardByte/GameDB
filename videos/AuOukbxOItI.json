{"id": "AuOukbxOItI", "snippet": {"title": "Jishou no Chihei Mendako (The Flying Pancake Octopus in Blackhole) - Top route clear (Vulcan)", "description": "Jishou no Chihei Mendako, also known as The Flying Pancake Octopus in Blackhole, is a freeware game by the same creator as Cambria Sword. The title alone makes the game worth checking out, but aside from that it's also a pretty neat game.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this game - I wasn't expecting too much, even though it's by the maker of Cambria Sword which I really like, but it turns out to be a solid and very content-rich experience, with a bunch of branching paths and cool stages and bosses. There's no explicit connection to Cambria Sword, though there are obvious stylistic similarities, such as the space theme, the multi-part bosses based on prehistoric creatures, and the metal soundtrack (though the soundtrack here is decidedly more mellow than Cambria Sword's). This game doesn't label its bosses like Cambria Sword does, but instead you get names for each of the stages, indicating the real-life astronomical features they're based on.\n\nA quick primer on the mechanics: like Space Invaders and Galaga, you're limited to horizontal movement, no vertical movement. Pressing up will fire your shot, or your charge shot if you've refrained from firing for long enough. Pressing down will use your guard ability, which blocks orange bullets but not lasers and some other types of bullets. You cannot move while firing or using your guard ability. Using guard also cancels any charge you had accumulated. If you refrain from using guard for an entire stage and no-miss the stage, you get a 1-point bonus (yes, exactly 1 point).\n\nThe topmost stage on the map is rated (by the game) as the most difficult in the game, and with that final boss I'm inclined to agree. Coolest fight in the game, though.\n\nI tried several times before this to defeat the final boss using the Wide weapon, which I find best for scoring (since when upgraded it blankets the whole screen with shots), but ended up using Vulcan to get better damage on the boss. Cannon might have also worked well for this; I'm not sure whether Cannon or Vulcan has better damage output.\n\nI recommend checking this game out, but be advised that the first playthrough forces you into Practice mode, which is far easier and slower-paced than the main game, so don't come out of that thinking that's the whole game. Incidentally, Practice mode has its own set of branching stages, so if you really want you can replay that and check out the stages you missed. Easy mode and Normal use the same stages, they're just different stage 1 choices on the map.\n\nI'm exporting this from a Twitch highlight from a month ago (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/462234706), so apologies for the less than stellar video quality. 60fps apparently got lost in the export, probably because the stream was at 480p rather than 720p or above, but I think the video compression turned out alright due to the lack of scrolling in the backgrounds (which I also noticed when encoding my Battlantis 1-ALL).\n\nDeveloper's website: http://www2.tba.t-com.ne.jp/vagues/\nDownload the game here: https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/20679 -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/solunas", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AuOukbxOItI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AuOukbxOItI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AuOukbxOItI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AuOukbxOItI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Jishou no Chihei Mendako (The Flying Pancake Octopus in Blackhole) - Top route clear (Vulcan)", "description": "Jishou no Chihei Mendako, also known as The Flying Pancake Octopus in Blackhole, is a freeware game by the same creator as Cambria Sword.
