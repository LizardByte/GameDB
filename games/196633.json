The inclusion of animated Skits and a modified version of the battle system resembling that used in Destiny, were added. For the battle system, the team wanted to increase the overall battle speed and combo potential. Suzu Fubayashi, a non-playable supporting character in the original release, was also made playable as an optional party member.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tales-of-phantasia--1", "videos": [{"id": 66377, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "MHR6wdUBSgc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHR6wdUBSgc", "title": "Tales of Phantasia (PSX) Opening HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MHR6wdUBSgc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 269, "name": "Tales"}]}
