They pack a set of essential tools and row up the local waterways deeper into the wilderness. After a few days of rowing they feel that they are far enough to have a peaceful spot of their own. Fishing, foraging and hunting provide food. But how to turn pristine woodlands to arable land? Fell down trees, burn them and the ashes will make the soil fertile. Agriculture is a lot of work but a decent harvest will keep the family fed through the long dark winter. And then there are children! More nutrition is needed to keep the little ones fed. And as they grow, they learn skills from the parents and start contributing to the workforce. Eventually the offspring will be old enough to marry and to start families of their own.", "summary": "Raise a family in the pristine woodlands of ancient Finland. Manage your homestead, craft tools and items, barter for goods, live off the land. Continue as your offspring, start new homesteads. Plan wisely to survive in the wilderness where cold, hunger and accidents are your enemies.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ancient-savo"}
