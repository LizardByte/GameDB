Inside, they also find a reel of film and an odd-looking projector and turn it on. The film turns out to be from 1901 and about Sameth and Maximus, Sam and Max's great-grandparents, who are in the tomb and manage to steal The Devil's Toybox. When Max touches the projector, he and Sam are psychically transported into the movie. As they are about to leave with it, they are ambushed by Kringle and hide behind an altar as he holds them at gunpoint. They trick him into leaving using Maximus' psychic powers and go up the the tomb entrance, but are unable to read the hieroglyphics above it to open it and are shot by Kringle off-screen. Figuring that they came into the film in the middle of the story, Sam and Max switch to another reel and begin living their great-grandparents adventure.", "summary": "Episode 2 of an epic 5 game saga.\n\nAfter facing a pillaging primate from outer space in the series premiere, Sam & Max cross paths with even stranger characters in this episode -- their own great-grandparents!\n\nIn Episode 2 of the series, our heroes cross paths with an even more bizarre and dangerous pair of characters\u2014their own great-grandparents!
