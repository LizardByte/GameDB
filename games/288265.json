The player loses if the car hits one of them. Some versions have the speed/level increase gradually over time. A less common variant allows the car to freely move instead of switching lanes and the speed automatically set to maximum number (with the option to slow down using the down button). It is typically featured as a first or second game (on either \"A\" or B\" on letter-based selection, and \"1\" or \"2\" on older numbered selection).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/car-racing-game"}
