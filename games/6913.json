"storyline": "In the late 20th century, global warming consumes 75% of the world habitable land, forcing mankind to build new, raised cities above those that are now claimed by the sea. But the flooding has not only claimed land. Millions of people have been killed as well, leaving humanities workforce severely depleted and as a result, have created a robotic workforce to handle the workload. To govern how this robotic workforce is treated, the UN creates the \"New Geneva Convention\", part of which is clause 21, which forbids robots that can pass as humans from being created, which are dubbed \"hollow children\" by the population. To enforce clause 21, the UN creates specialist R.U.S.T crews. When a hollow child breaks into the headquarters of robotics company Bergen, after discovering he is a hollow child and having lived his life believing himself to be human, the UN suspect the Amada corporation to be behind its creation. As a result, a R.U.S.T crew is dispatched to bring Amada's CEO before the UN security council to give answers.", "summary": "The Machine Age has begun in the immersive and atmospheric squad-based shooter Binary Domain. Regain control of a futuristic Tokyo from an emerging robotic threat in the year 2080. The story starts when Dan Marshall and his squad are sent to bring the robotic community under control as they begin to infiltrate society and slowly take over undetected, leaving humans redundant in their wake. Fighting through the derelict lower levels of the city, players control an international peace-keeping squad that soon starts to question their surroundings and the choices they make. Are the robots becoming more human, or are humans becoming more like machines?\n\nThrilling encounters with these highly intelligent robotic enemies require you to think tactically, make challenging, real-time moral decisions and build up trust with your team mates in order to guide your squad to safety and success.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/binary-domain", "videos": [{"id": 6296, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Qp1SGtosGI0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp1SGtosGI0", "title": "Binary Domain: Official Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qp1SGtosGI0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 6569, "name": "Faye Lee"}, {"id": 3375, "name": "Mifune"}, {"id": 6568, "name": "Roy \"Big Bo\" Boateng"}, {"id": 6572, "name": "Major Philips"}, {"id": 6574, "name": "Kurosawa"}, {"id": 6575, "name": "Yuki"}, {"id": 6570, "name": "Charles Gregory"}, {"id": 6571, "name": "Rachael Townsend"}, {"id": 6576, "name": "Amada"}, {"id": 6573, "name": "Shindo"}, {"id": 4794, "name": "Cain"}, {"id": 6567, "name": "Dan Marshall"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
