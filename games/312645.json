To overcome them you will have various aids, although sometimes they can hinder you work, as can be changes in the size of the racket or the speed of the balls multiplier balls, barrier, fireballs, gravity, change visibility bricks ...\n\nYou also have a limited number of wildcards or 'jokers' to skip levels that can not be able to complete.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brick-breaker-demolition"}
