It has been in development for a around 5 years now. We do this in our free time so I can't provide a precise release date yet. It's going to be free.\n\nAt the moment of the release of this trailer, the game has all 9 Robot Masters functional. \n8 Robot Master stages out of the 9 are designed and the 9th \"secret\" one is still in the enemy tweaking/placement phase. (Almost done)\nAll enemies (except one) are functional.\nMusic has been redone for JetMan, TrinitroMan, NailMan and the Title Screen. We still have a few songs to re-do. Among them, one of the Wily Stage songs and a couple of other improvements are needed here and there.\nWily stages have most of their enemies placed but still require tweaks because:\n- We still need to implement the special weapons system and Rush.\n- Wily Bosses are still not implemented.\nWe also have to implement the menus, cutscenes and save/load feature.\nThe game still has many bugs we need to fix too.\nBut we've come a long way since the start of the project. I can't thank all of those who helped me enough.\n\nThanks a lot to Tasse MSX from the MegaMan 72 project for pointing me in the direction of the latest FRAPS software to capture the footage correctly and for overall support! ^_^\n\nEnjoy the trailer!\n\nTo follow our progress, I encourage you to check out the Facebook page of MegaMan Unlimited.
