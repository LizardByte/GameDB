A different character introduces each activity (except for Pluto, who doesn't speak) and briefly hints at what to do - the player interacts with most activities simply by moving the mouse over the screen to uncover hidden items, listen to sounds, explore color, etc. The graphics are pure Disney cartoon and quiet music plays in the background throughout the game.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-mickey-mouse-toddler"}
