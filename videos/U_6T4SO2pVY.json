Both modes are updated, although I mostly only had full-screen footage for this video.\n\nDownload this and all my other projects from here:\nhttps://pikhacker.github.io/\n\nJoin my discord if you havent in order to play with others or get help using this: https://discord.gg/WHSaSS5", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U_6T4SO2pVY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U_6T4SO2pVY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U_6T4SO2pVY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Pikmin 2 Multiplayer 2.0 (Pikhacks week Day 4)", "description": "After being in development hell for over 18 months, the long awaited update to the Multiplayer mod is finally released!\nNew full-screen mode allows you to play with people like normal, but with no split-screen needed!\nMany improvements are here, such as the new HUD, fixed sound effects, character select, name tags, and more.\nIf you have questions about how to use Full-screen mode, make sure you check the README, it has a code you need to use in dolphin's netplay.\nTo clarify though, by default splitscreen mode requires no codes and works on console or dolphin.
