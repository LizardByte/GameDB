The Globe is a giant brass cylinder full of gears, fronted by a clock face made of sliding and rotating plates comprising twenty-two Roman numerals, which represent the Major Arcana, with the Kabbalistic tree of life in its center. A voice welcomes the player and tells them the Globe is a gift, then explains that the player must unlock the secret of the drowned god.\n\nThe player initially must enter their name into the device, which then displays a series of past lives the player has lived. The name is converted into its numerological equivalent. Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called Kether and Malchut respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task. The motivations of the two organizations represented by the faces are murky, although it becomes clear they are acting in opposition to each other. Both masks refer to the player by their assigned number.", "summary": "Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages is a 1996 science fiction adventure game developed by Epic Multimedia Group and published by Inscape. The game propounds the conspiracy theory that all of human history is a lie and that the human race's development and evolution were aided by extraterrestrials. The player attempts to uncover the truth through the course of the game by traveling to a variety of different worlds, interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/drowned-god-conspiracy-of-the-ages", "videos": [{"id": 54936, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nlUphVjqjZo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlUphVjqjZo", "title": "DROWNED GOD: CONSPIRACY OF THE AGES - Debut Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlUphVjqjZo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
