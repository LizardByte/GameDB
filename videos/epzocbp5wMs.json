Well, it's not really a tech demo from what I now know, this is apperantly a base rom for 3rd parties to use for developing games off of it. Some notable things include 3d prerendered weights that look out of place in a Yoshi game, the bullet bills look really ugly, a giant shy-guy from early footage, question balloons (coming from the that drop health or a shy-guy), and you can zoom in on Yoshi.\nSome parts of the video are sped up; that's not edited, the emulator I was playing it on contained a hotkey on my Xbox 360 controller that could speed up the game.\n\nOriginal description of digression:\nI found this on Archive. Honestly, this is one of if not the most disappointing Tech Demo I've ever played. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I know this is just a tech demo, but compare this to the Luigi's Mansion Tech Demo seen in E3 2001. That Gamecube Tech Demo, while not found yet as a rom, there is so much effort put into it, and the creepy atmosphere is awsome! However, I don't believe the Luigi's Mansion tech demo would deserve a teen rating, probably a Rated Everyone 10 And Up rating would be accurate. Seriously, some adults need to grow up from the ending of the E3 Trailer. In fact, that scene, which is part of the Luigi's Mansion FMV, may be enough to get the game to only about an E10+ rating.\n\nTech Demo on Archive.org:\nhttps://archive.org/details/YoshiStoryGbaTechDemoa3\n\nDownload:\nhttps://archive.org/download/YoshiStoryGbaTechDemoa3/Yoshi%20story%20gba%20tech%20demo%20[a3].gba\n\nUnsubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaf_9IQ-4EJfOzhqXD-6MpQ\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
