On the radio, news broadcast details on how two families were slaughtered by their respective fathers. Much of the plot of P.T. is told through connecting-the-dots and radio broadcasts. However, some aspects of the plot are left to player interpretation and speculation. Later on, paranormal activity begins to occur, which includes the appearance of a manifestation of the mother from a murdered family, the corridor becoming endless and the lights glowing red. Mysterious broadcasts also emerge from the radio. After the protagonist solves the final puzzle, a cutscene shows him in Silent Hill, presumably unaware of where he is. He looks over his shoulder and continues making his way into the town.", "summary": "P.T. (Playable Teaser) is a first-person interactive teaser directed by Hideo Kojima and developed by Kojima Productions under the alias of \"7780s Studios\". It is a psychological survival horror that combined simplicity with an anxiety-inducing environment. The player must investigate the gruesome backstory surrounding the house, and solve puzzles to get to the end game where a cut scene will initiate, and reveal the official teaser trailer for Silent Hills. P.T is widely accepted as a game in its own right, as not only is it considered deeply engaging, but also enjoys significant replay value thanks to its cryptic nature. Due to the cancellation on Silent Hills, it is no longer available for download.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pt", "videos": [{"id": 5038, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MnMJ0urMz54", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnMJ0urMz54", "title": "P.T. - Gamescom 2014 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MnMJ0urMz54/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36500, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8vtrGF0ZTRc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vtrGF0ZTRc", "title": "P.T - Demo Walkthrough Part 1 PS4 Horror Gameplay [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vtrGF0ZTRc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
