Your job is to guard the precious gems and keep enemy creeps from trying to steal them. Build defensive turrets around the path so they will automatically defend the map so nothing will get stolen. Also you should try to upgrade them in order to become more efficient in combat. You can call a wave earlier in order to receive a bonus for that. Collect all the coins with your mouse and build more defensive turrets.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/keeper-of-the-grove-3"}
