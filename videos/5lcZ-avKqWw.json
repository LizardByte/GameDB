She was fond of her work and took great pride in what she did. However, she had an odd side to herself. Marcy wasn\u2019t one to take criticism very well, so she tried a to cope with it by ringing her bell. Every time she rang her bell would signify criticism which made her very, very mad. It became especially bad after she completed designing and constructing her new home, formally known as Suite 776.

When I first began developing games back in 2014, I never thought I would be able to build something to the extent of Suite 776. Throughout all these years of self-taught developing, I have gathered all sorts of knowledge, experience, and advice from all of my fans, friends, and supporters! To that, I am very happy to present to you all Suite 776, and I genuinely hope you all enjoy it.\n\nIt is my hope, depending on the success of this game, to develop additional updates to Suite 776 including VR support. I have always wanted to delve into the depths of VR, and I believe Suite 776 will be a wonderful place to start. We will see!\n\nThank you again to everyone who has followed me since day one! I will continue to learn, expand, and provide an even better game year-round!\n\nHappy gaming, everybody!\n\nFollow me on Facebook for early news & updates!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/turnvex/\n\nStan.T", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5lcZ-avKqWw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5lcZ-avKqWw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5lcZ-avKqWw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "New upcoming horror game - Suite 776", "description": "Check out the Steam page:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1197370/Suite_776/\n\n\nABOUT THIS GAME\n\nA pure terror with a twisted backstory; jumping straight into the horrors surrounding Suite 776.\n\nSuite 776 focuses on an intense environment or pure suspense, horror, and mystery.
