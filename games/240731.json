They come to visit you every day, seeking healing, novel experiences or in pursuit of more nefarious interests.\n\nBy providing them with different potions you influence the outcome of events. At first you know a couple of simple recipes but as you progress you unlock more by experimenting with available ingredients or by following hints that some NPCs can provide. No matter what horrible end befalls you, you get to keep all unlocked recipes on further replays.\n\nThe variety of potions and plot twists ensure high replayability. Some endings, recipes and game mechanics only become available after beating the game or successful completion of certain events.\n\nSimilar games: Strange Horticulture, Reigns, Potion Craft.", "summary": "The Witch's Cauldron is a narrative roguelike game about being a medieval witch.
