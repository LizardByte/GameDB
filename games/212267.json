During an intense battle, they were saved by a friendly pony-bot named Machina, a warrior serving Machineland. From there, the three protagonists go on to adventure across the lands, saving innocents and removing the machines that spread terror and destruction.\n\nDeveloped by a single individual known as Zaruku, it boasts mechanics and progression similar to old mascot platformers, but with attacks and special moves reminisicent of hack-n'-slash games. The sprites and animations are bright and colorful, and there are manga-like cutscenes to help immerse you in the world through dialogue and art.\n\nUnfortunately, the last time the creator has posted on their developer blog was December 25th 2014, and there have been no updates since. Due to this, it seems that SorcerLand may never see the full completion that the developer intended.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sorcerland"}
