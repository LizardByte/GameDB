The forces of chaos once again seek to destroy the world itself. It is a time of fear and darkness. It is a time for those with courage, to step forward and defend their beliefs, and their very existence.\n\nBlackMUD is a Diku/Silly based MUD, although it has become something far more than either. The world of Entia is a wonderous and challenging place. It boasts over 90 original areas, made up of 35000 crafted rooms (and growing), all designed around a comprehensive world theme and history.\n\nGood role-playing is encouraged and rewarded, although not required. With a wide array of races, cities, classes and sub-classes, BlackMUD offers the player a wide world of adventure and excitement."}
