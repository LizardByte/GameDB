{"id": 45978, "name": "Xtom 3d", "summary": "Xtom 3D is a 3D arcade shooter. You can fly any of three available aircraft: a jet-like airplane, a colourful UFO and a flying robot. Each aircraft has unique weapons and magical effects. You fly over various themes of 3D terrain (deserts, valleys, caverns, technological structures) in third person and have to shoot down enemy aircraft. Each level is concluded with a big level boss. On your way there you will have to collect power-ups and avoid enemy fire. As long as you are firing weapons you build up your mana bar, when full you can use a powerful magic blast that does a lot of damage."}
