Kumya believed it to be myth, but Q'orianka believed in it and so did Unuratu. Kumya thought that the people should trust their skills and wits instead of stories told to them as children.\nLara approached Q'orianka and asked about Sinchi Chiqa, a name she heard mentioned. Sinchi Chiqa was the first Emperor of Paititi, Unuratu's ancestor, and the creator of the Shield of the Age Maker. Q'orianka believed that the shield is what the rebels need as evidence, because on the shield is inscribed the ordination ritual which would prove that Unuratu is the next Age Maker, and that Amaru is the false god. The shield is hidden deep within a mountain, and only a Path of Huracan can lead to it. Path of Huracan is a trial to test the seekers of the shield. Lara pointed towards Jonah Maiava sitting with Uchu, and told Q'orianka that she will contact him when needed, and her to stay by him.\nLara passed the Path of Huracan, but the shield was not there, it seemed that Amaru was after the shield as well. Lara took an another path and came upon the Cult of Kukulkan, she defeated them and obtained the shield. Lara returned to Q'orianka, and she read the shield, but it was not what she thought it to be. The shield told that anyone can create destiny, and that would reinforce Amaru's position more that Unuratu's. Q'orianka didn't even want to show it to Unuratu, believing it may shake her faith, and decided to burn the shield.\nQ'orianka was impressed by Lara's courage and gave her bow to Lara.", "summary": "In \u201cThe Pillar,\u201d players will venture into the game\u2019s newest challenge tomb known as Path of Huracan to discover the truth behind the legend of the Maya apocalypse. To reclaim an ancient treasure, Lara Croft must defy the treacherous storms of an all-new challenge tomb, all while fighting the forces of Trinity.\n\n\u201cThe Pillar\u201d offers new customization options with the Tunic of the Shorn One outfit, which reduces damage from projectile weapons and allows additional ammo to be crafted. The Oathtaker\u2019s bow deals greater damage to armored enemies, and the A Thousand Eyes skill allows Lara to use Survival Instincts when moving through tree canopies or concealment walls.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-the-pillar", "videos": [{"id": 40570, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bSk-HliVHxw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSk-HliVHxw", "title": "Shadow of the Tomb Raider - The Pillar [ESRB]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bSk-HliVHxw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
