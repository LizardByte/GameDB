Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\nIt\u2019s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It\u2019s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control.\nDrifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can\u2019t get any better!"}
