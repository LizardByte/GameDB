Explore the expansive environment in the dark with nothing but your flashlight, map and wits to find your son through various clues. But lurking silently in the darkness is Slenderman, who wants to claim you as well.\n\nThis game quickly rose the charts as one of the more polished, refined and fun Slenderman horror games at the time. We were pleasantly surprised at the passion shown for the game in reviews and it\u2019s cult-like fanbase.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho Are We? #RedPistonInc\n\nWhy do Fortune 500 brands trust us with their customers and their money?
