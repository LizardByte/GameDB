The game also features cheerleaders, coaches, commentary by an insane play-by-play announcer called \"Manic Max\", and a crowd of fans who cheer or jeer at the players, based on their performance (the leader of whom is \"Joe Six-Pack\").", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/high-impact-football", "collections": [{"id": 4564, "name": "High Impact Football"}]}
