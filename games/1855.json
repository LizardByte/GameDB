It was to be published by Ubisoft, and was developed by the company's Montreal studio, with additional development by Ubisoft Toronto and Ubisoft Red Storm.\nDue to the death of Tom Clancy in October 2013, concern was raised that this game would become the last to bear his name. Ubisoft has since stated that they will continue putting Tom Clancy's name on future Tom Clancy titles out of respect for the late author.\nPatriots was cancelled in 2014 after it was announced in 2011. Instead, Ubisoft started development on a new Rainbow Six game called Siege.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-clancy-s-rainbow-6-patriots", "videos": [{"id": 32366, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pMz8PKe5RFU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMz8PKe5RFU", "title": "VGA 2011: Rainbow Six: Patriots Exclusive Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMz8PKe5RFU/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 127, "name": "Rainbow Six"}]}
