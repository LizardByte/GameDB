The object of the game is to destroy all Pirate Ships on each level by hitting them with your cannons or luring them into reefs or collisions with each other.\n\nYou control the white ship with your mouse. It can move one square at a time, straight or diagonally.\n\n-- Readme file --\nAhoy matey! Time to set sail for an ocean full of danger!\n\nYou control the White Galleon, and your goal is to eliminate all the Pirate Ships on each level. You can destroy them with your Cannons, or lure them into collisions with island reefs and each other. But beware! There are smarter pirates lurking out there, along with even more dreadful things. \n\nCONTROLS\n\nMove your Galleon by clicking on any of the 8 squares surrounding it. You will move into that square unless it's blocked by an island or shipwreck (or pirate, but you wouldn't want to go there anyway!).\n\nFire your Galleon's cannons by clicking directly on your ship.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nSeven Seas is a turn-based game. After YOU move, all the Pirates move. Then you get the chance to move again, followed by the Pirates, and so on. You can take as much time as you like deciding what to do.\n\nOn Easy level, you'll see red arrows for the first couple waves that show you exactly where the Pirates will go after your move. This will let you plan your strategy. Later, you'll have to trust in your own knowledge of the different Pirates to see you through!\n\nThe Pirates will try to collide with you. If they succeed, you'll lose one of the three lives you begin the game with.\n\nYou must do your best to sink all the Pirates on each level. When you've destroyed them all, you'll proceed to the next wave.\n\nFIRING YOUR CANNONS\n\nYou fire your cannons by clicking directly on your Galleon, or by pressing the '5' key on the numeric keypad. You'll always fire a broadside to the left and right of your ship. Your cannons have a range of 3 squares unless blocked by an island.\n\nTRICKING THE PIRATES\n\nNormal Pirates will always steer straight for you, whether or not there's an island, shipwreck, or fellow Pirate in the way. They'll be destroyed if they collide with an obstacle, leaving behind a shipwreck.\n\nShipwrecks can be fired over with your cannons, but otherwise block movement. Remember you can get the Pirates to crash aground on shipwrecks as well!\n\nWHIRLPOOLS\n\nThere are 4 whirlpools on each board, one in each corner of the map. Don't be scared! You can use them as an escape route when things get tricky.\n\nSail into a whirlpool and you'll be transported instantly to a random square on the map. Of course, you could always come up somewhere even worse than where you were before, so be careful!\n\nOn later levels, stormy seas will cause the whirlpools to appear and disappear at regular intervals. You'll have to time your approach properly to enter them! \n\nENEMIES\n\nHere's a list of all the foes you'll eventually encounter in Seven Seas:\n\nPIRATES: These are the basic bad guys. Not very smart, but there are lots of them!\n\nCRIMSON CORSAIRS: These red vessels are piloted by experienced pirates, and will never accidentally crash into an island, shipwreck, or other ship. You'll probably need to use your cannons to sink them!\n\nBLUE BUCCANEERS: These rare blue ships are captained by legendary pirate chieftains, and are armed with dual cannons just like you! Unlike other pirates, they're not interested in colliding with you, but in lining you up for their guns! You'll need to be very careful dealing with them, though they have a tendency to blow up other pirates in their mad hunt for you.\n\nSEA MONSTER: This terrible serpent from the briny deeps can't be destroyed. You must simply avoid it! If you're lucky, it may devour unfortunate pirates by accident.\n\nTHE FLYING DUTCHMAN: This mythical ghost ship hovers over the waves, piloted by a literal 'skeleton crew'! The Dutchman can be beaten, but it'll take all your skills to outmaneuver!\n\nTREASURE ISLAND\n\nEvery 10 levels, you get a chance at the Treasure Island bonus stage. \nYour goal here is to discover the buried treasure chest.\n\n-- Timestamps --\n0:00 Video intro\n0:21 Game tutorial\n2:00 Easy Mode (8 levels)\n8:02 Average Mode (6 levels)\n11:57 Hard Mode (7 levels)\n18:27 Easy Mode (19 levels)\n35:46 Average Mode (7 levels)\n41:12 Hard Mode (7 levels)\n46:18 Easy Mode (27 levels)\n1:04:11 Menu\n1:04:26 Video outro\n\n-- Game Credits --\nSeven Seas was created by PopCap Games.\nGame Design: Jason Kapalka\nProgramming: Richie Cresswell\nArt: Josh Langley\nMusic: Skaven (http://www.badzilla.net/~skaven/)\nSoftware Libraries: Brian Fiete\nBiz Guy:  John Vechey\n\n-- Settings and application information --\nGame runs on Windows 10\nSEVEN SEAS\u2122 DELUXE\nversion 1.13\nJanuary 29, 2003\n\n\nNeed more info?\n\nAsk on my Twitter (link on my channel).
