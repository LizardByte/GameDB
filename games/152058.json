In our project, we would like to direct your attention to a very important issue of our times - the extinction of wild bees, which despite their tiny size, has a huge impact on the entire Earth's ecosystem.\n\nGreetings explorer! You are going to spend quite some time in the laboratory - don\u2019t forget to go on a research expedition into the unknown. A world full of exploration, building and crafting awaits you!\nYou are the last hope of Earthlings.\n\nResearch both flora and fauna - standard scanning is not enough. Explore the world of genetics and experiment with various possibilities to even create a new plant genera. Mutating plants and species promotes new raw material discoveries and blueprints. Experiment to master new technologies and settle your base in new environments.\n\nThis new world can be beautiful but dangerous as well - an undiscovered fruit or a contact with previously unknown, even the most innocuous-looking animals can provoke a disease, for which you'll have to invent a cure. Some of them are tamable, some can only be feared and fled from - there is only one way to find out.\n\nFor optimal productivity, an explorer\u2019s life has to be comfortable! Take care of your \"workplace\", create the needed conditions by yourself and even decorate your base. Build drones, mobile laboratories, habitat, and research stations. Don\u2019t stop there - create multiple stations in optimal locations, safety, weather or raw material wise, and ensure safe travel between them - hoverboard is the best way to start.", "summary": "Honeycomb is a first-person open-world survival-sandbox where you become a bioengineer.
