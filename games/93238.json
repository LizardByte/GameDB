Your goal as the leader of a mercenary's guild is to simply profit by taking jobs from either of those forces.", "summary": "Rasetsu is a real time strategy with RPG elements that was released in 2001 for Microsoft Windows 98. It plays similarly to any other real-time strategy title with an isometric view and common point-and-click interface, and also toting somewhat of a Front Mission-esque as you'll often find yourself switching over from battles to intermissions (where you'll be able to talk to characters) and so on. The game features a techno soundtrack.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 48851, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "cYzufm8SLrQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYzufm8SLrQ", "title": "rasetsu OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cYzufm8SLrQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
