It includes a Home Run Derby mode, as well as a pennant race and all-star games.\n\nSuper Power League was followed by three Super Famicom sequels, and the Power League series is also present on systems like the PC Engine and PC-FX.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-power-league", "collections": [{"id": 3098, "name": "Power League"}]}
