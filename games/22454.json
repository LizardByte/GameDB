Choose your chimp, then prepare to tackle various classes in Academy Mode. Each 'class' is actually a mini-game. Your goal is to complete as many mini-games as possible from the 9x9 grid, and score as many lines as you can (sort of like Noughts and Crosses). Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just plain silly, like protecting a roast banana from oncoming apes, or flying through the sky delivering parachutes to plummeting primates.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ape-escape-academy", "videos": [{"id": 66242, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RDTqGaM8a2I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDTqGaM8a2I", "title": "Ape Escape Academy PSP Trailer - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RDTqGaM8a2I/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
