I think it was after every 6 levels you can choose which level set you want to move to. The game is a little different to other breakout games as you can power smash the ball to go over a group of blocks on the screen as well as nudge the game to make the ball bounce a particular way.\n\nAlthough not show in the video, after completing the game an Expert mode is available. This mode is pretty much a level select but you can only play on levels you have unlocked. To unlock all levels you would need to replay a few times and adjust your route to access all levels. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Za3RSfvDwGw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Za3RSfvDwGw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Za3RSfvDwGw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Za3RSfvDwGw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [506] Block Buster", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nBlock Buster, a budget breakout clone with a twist released by phoenix games.
