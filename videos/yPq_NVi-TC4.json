The more advanced it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes. We've created a house of cards. Remove just one, and everything falls apart.\n\nOn Black Friday, a devastating pandemic sweeps through New York City, and one by one, basic services fail. In only days, without food or water, society collapses into chaos. The Division, an autonomous unit of tactical agents, is activated. Leading seemingly ordinary lives among us, these agents are trained to operate independently in order to save society.\nWhen society falls, your mission begins.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\u2022 Take Back New York: Welcome to a next-gen experience in a persistent and dynamic environment where exploration and player progression are essential. Teaming up with other Division agents, your mission is to restore order, investigate the source of the virus, and take back New York.\n\n\u2022 A Living, Breathing World\nEnter a universe where time of day and weather conditions impact your gaming experience. Use the environment for strategic advantage to dominate fights and ambush your enemies. Utilize your gas mask to provide protection from the virus, and upgrade it to enter the most highly contaminated areas.\n\n\u2022 Urban Jungle\nNew York City is being overrun by hostile groups that are trying to take advantage of the crisis. One such group is the Cleaners, who travel throughout the city wherever the contagion levels rise. Wearing hazmat suits and wielding flamethrowers, the Cleaners leave nothing but ash in their wake.\n\n\u2022 The Agents of The Division\nTrained to act independently from any chain of command, the Agents are autonomous and adaptive, working alone or in small groups. They are the last line of defense, activated when all else fails to save what remains.\n\n\u2022 Gear Up\nHarness state-of-the-art technology, both networked and prototype, as a member of The Division. Loot fallen enemies and upgrade your gear. Customize your character and your backpack, your lifeline in the event of a collapse. Communicate with other agents at all times with your smartwatch and customize and level up your weapons. The choices you make will help to forge a recovery, or plunge the city deeper into chaos.\n\n\u2022 Game-Changing Skills\nChoose and upgrade your skills smartly and synergize with your teammates to increase your chances of winning in combat. Use the ECHO, a data collection tool that renders moments frozen in time, to learn valuable information about your immediate environment and find hidden loot, and to help uncover the truth behind the pandemic.\n\n\u2022 Social Seamless Multiplayer\nTeam up with friends to seamlessly take down your enemies and achieve group objectives. Raise the security and morale levels of the surviving citizens of New York to unlock and secure a base of operations, and fight through a city where danger can come from anywhere, and anyone, at any moment.\n\n\u2022 Revolutionary Companion Gaming\nJoin your friends in real-time gameplay on your tablet. The app gives you a bird's-eye view of the battlefield and the ability to aid your allies in combat by attacking enemies or identifying targets and raining destruction down on your enemies.\n\n\u2022 Snowdrop Engine\nPowered by the fully next-gen Snowdrop engine, Tom Clancy's The Division sets a new bar in video game realism and open world rendering. Experience a chaotic and devastating New York like you've never seen before.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Ubisoft Entertainment. All Rights Reserved.
