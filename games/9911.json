This precept among Humans seemed to be confirmed when the their army invaded your city, inflicting on you two dire losses at once: your family and your left hand. Yet the ones who helped you and took you under their wings were a family of their kind. Raina, the daughter in the family, had never been but patient with your recovery and adaptation in your new life. It never mattered to you that you never fit in, that somehow other magical people still gave you goosebumps and reminded you of the dreadful invasion, as long as Raina was by your side. But Raina has gone, swallowed by the growing darkness inside the Forbidden Forest. Her people decided to wait and consult the silent gods, whereas you know you might lose her forever if you do not act NOW. \n\nYou have to venture into the Forest, the Ruins, the Heights, the Waterarc, and the Cradle of Life--all of which have intricate puzzles to hold off anyone who dares to enter. In this journey, you will find magic in the most unlikely place; You will find gods' hand in the least expected form. \n\nNow that all hope is in your hand, will you be strong enough to bring Raina back against all odds?", "summary": "Go against all odds with Lev, the handicapped boy, in this twistedly beautiful puzzle adventure game.\n\nPlease look further on our Kickstarter Page: http://bit.ly/wftosks\n\nHave you ever felt that humans are so mundane because we have no magic? Have you envied the magical creatures and their abilities to control the elements of nature? We believe you do, and that is how Lev feels about himself, too. Being the only Human living in a society of magical creatures, Lev, lives his life as an outcast and has no friend but Raina. When Raina disappeared, Lev wasted no time to find her... into the forbidden forest.\n\nWe aim to tell a heartwarming story and reveal a magical world through our game, a medium to deliver a powerful narrative. How would a boy react through the loss of his loved one and eventually gain confidence with his new power? Could he embrace the truth behind the catastrophe that changes his life? You will find it on Winterflame.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/winterflame-the-other-side"}
