Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.\n\nBut then the Bunyip Elder found you and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever if you're up for a bit of an adventure!\n\nYou see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal, there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open!\n\nNow, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!\n\nDon't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!\n\nTY the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue HD\n\nMore ranks, more vehicles, more mechs, more EVERYTHING... in an open world Aussie Adventure. There might even be a few surprises!\n\nTY puts the BOOM in BOOMERANG! TY the Tasmanian Tiger\u2122 2: Bush Rescue\u2122 is the sequel to Krome Studios' charming Australian-themed videogame. This classic platformer, updated for Nintendo Switch\u2122, features more rangs, more vehicles, more bots, and more EVERYTHING... in an open-world Aussie Adventure.\n\nThrow boomerangs, bite, smash and glide your way around the Australian Outback and stop the evil plans of the wicked Boss Cass and help the good folk of the little country town of BURRAMUDGEE.\n\nThis sequel to the popular TY the Tasmanian Tiger is a game on a grander scale. In addition to classic platforming elements, you'll fight Aussie bush fires from a helicopter, drive around Southern Rivers while hanging on to the back of a four-wheel drive and use the bots to defeat enemies and solve puzzles - all while trying to find a variety of different collectibles. And now, only on the HD remaster, you can customize TY's looks, and best of all there are two brand NEW never before seen boomerangs.", "summary": "Explore 17 levels of the Australian Outback in their old-school 3D platforming glory\n13 different boomerangs including the Frostyrang, Flamerang and powerful Doomerang.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-hd-plus-ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-2-bush-rescue-hd-bundle", "videos": [{"id": 52739, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ogRN7pz0S6k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogRN7pz0S6k", "title": "Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue HD | Nintendo Switch Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogRN7pz0S6k/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 52738, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VVgrtF9Tx2E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVgrtF9Tx2E", "title": "TY the Tasmanian Tiger HD on Nintendo Switch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VVgrtF9Tx2E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
