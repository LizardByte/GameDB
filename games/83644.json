Then the player moves on to the tense battles, from which only one contestant can advance. Afterwards, the player proceeds to thrilling live shows, where the training sessions really pay off, and then progresses all the way to the finals, and to The Voice of Germany! In the multiplayer mode, players can compete with or against friends in six different game modes. Players can choose from 30 English and German language songs, including the original video clips, and use two microphones with up to eight players to measure themselves against their family and friends.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-voice-of-germany"}
