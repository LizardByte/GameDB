DDR X was announced by Konami in 2008 for Japan and on May 15, 2008 for the North American PlayStation 2. The arcade version was announced on July 7, 2008, July 9, 2008 in Europe, and July 10, 2008 for North America. Released to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dance Dance Revolution, DDR X sports an improved interface, new music, and new modes of play. The arcade release featured an overhauled (second generation) cabinet design with a widescreen display, e-Amusement and USB access, and an improved sound system. Despite such new design of its arcade cabinet, upgrade kit to change the edition of DDR on its first generation arcade cabinet from SuperNOVA2 (or earlier) to X is also available. The PlayStation 2 release has link ability with the arcade machine, multi-player support over LAN, and other improved and returning features such as EyeToy support. DDR X was called a \"truly global version\", with a multi-regional release by all three major Konami houses.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dance-dance-revolution-x", "videos": [{"id": 38032, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "L0kwOZCigmo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0kwOZCigmo", "title": "Dance Dance Revolution X", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L0kwOZCigmo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
