However, they lacked all of the essential elements of a great army to bring the war to a successful conclusion. This was due to the severe cavalry losses in Russia and the lack of Napoleon's subordinate commanders to successfully operate on their own. Shortly after Bautzen an armistice was agreed upon and both sides used the time to rebuild their forces. During this period Austria and Sweden joined the Sixth Coalition and the numbers tipped dramatically in the Allies' favor. \n \nNow you can refight the famous battles of the Fall Campaign of 1813 such as Leipzig and Dresden. March in the steps of the young French conscripts or lead the Prussian landwehr towards the French lines with Blucher's famous cry of \"Vorwarts meine kinder!\" All of the armies of the 1813 Fall Campaign await your command. \n \nCampaign Leipzig is the product of three years of research and design.
