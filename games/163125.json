Pokemon have been added, as have typing's, moves, and Mega Evolution. Take the original story from HGSS and expand on it, find that your rivals are much more in depth than they were, and travel your way through Johto earning badges from gym leaders that actually have Strategies this time and make your way to the first ever Johto Pokemon League. On your way you'll have to catch many Pokemon and stop Team Rocket though!\nIf you want an extra challenge, you will be given the option to randomize your file as well. Good Luck!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
