The game is very much like the original; the player controls the Thunder Ceptor (now colored light blue), and must shoot the incoming crafts (now colored from gray to green) as normal. There are now multiple obstacles, including large rods, and flying panels (like the Bacura from Xevious), and the obstacles can now be destroyed with the bombs, now no longer having to avoid them. As the name suggests, the game is playable in 3D, and is the only Namco arcade game to do so. The player would put their head up to the attached goggles on the machine for the 3D effect.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-thunder-ceptor-ii", "videos": [{"id": 89238, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "W3nMKkn5JBE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3nMKkn5JBE", "title": "Thunder Ceptor II [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W3nMKkn5JBE/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6951, "name": "Thunder Ceptor"}]}
