You'll notice I'm not shielding at all, for instance; M-ism disables shields and double jumps, as Mayday did not have those mechanics. Furthermore, M-ism alters the way damage, knockback and hitstun are dealt, meaning Mayday Luke here is playing nearly 1:1 with how he would have played in Mayday Version 8.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NiL-wK2s70M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NiL-wK2s70M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NiL-wK2s70M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mayday HD - Luke Fon Fabre Gameplay", "description": "Some more Mayday HD gameplay for y'all.
