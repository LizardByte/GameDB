Each faction has a unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. Choose what fits your playstyle!\n\nWet and dry seasons\nPrepare your settlement for recurring droughts. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable.\n\nRiver control\nBeavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. Put up dams and floodgates, dig canals with explosives, and redirect rivers to bring life back to the wasteland. Just be careful with that dynamite.\n\nLumberpunk\nTurn timber into sophisticated machinery \u2013 from water wheels and sawmills to engines and mechanized pumps. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world.\n\nBots\nSupercharge your colony with mechanized beavers! Power them up, maintain them, and you'll get extra efficient workers for almost any job. They will literally move mountains for you thanks to their unique ability to put up land blocks.\n\nVertical architecture\nCreate a thriving beaver settlement using a vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, construct platforms and bridges, and set up a power grid for your growing population.\n\nDay and night cycle\nBuild a multi-district city with efficient production chains and nighttime activities. Follow the lives of individually simulated inhabitants throughout their day and celebrate when the next generation is born!\n\nWellbeing\nAn evolved beaver's lifestyle is not just \"work, sleep and chomp on wood\". Satisfy the needs of your rodents with a balanced diet, decorations, monuments, and more \u2013 on top of keeping the colony alive.\n\nMap editor\nPlay on one of the included maps or create your own and share it with the community!
