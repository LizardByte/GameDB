A specialist squad of the police force known as S.T.A.R.S. has been investigating the case, and have determined that the pharmaceutical company Umbrella and their biological weapon, the T-Virus, are behind the incidents. Jill Valentine and the other surviving S.T.A.R.S. members try to make this truth known, but find that the police department itself is under Umbrella's sway and their reports are rejected out of hand. With the viral plague spreading through the town and to her very doorstep, Jill is determined to survive. However, an extremely powerful pursuer has already been dispatched to eliminate her.", "summary": "Resident Evil 3 is a remake of the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis released in 1999. It updates the story and gameplay for a modern audience. Like the Resident Evil 2 remake, the game uses over-the-shoulder third person point of view similar to Resident Evil 4 and later installments. Players will spend most of their time playing as Jill Valentine, although on some occasions they will assume the role of Carlos Oliveira, giving him more screen time as a deuteragonist.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-3", "videos": [{"id": 34752, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Wghn3tYYVNw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wghn3tYYVNw", "title": "Resident Evil 3: Jill Valentine Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wghn3tYYVNw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 73530, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "Pvwdy38_vlo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvwdy38_vlo", "title": "Resident Evil 3 | Announcement Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pvwdy38_vlo/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 15354, "name": "Carlos Oliveira"}, {"id": 15356, "name": "Nathaniel Bard / Mikhail Victor"}, {"id": 15362, "name": "Murphy Seeker"}, {"id": 15363, "name": "Mikhail Victor"}, {"id": 15359, "name": "Dario Rosso"}, {"id": 15364, "name": "Nathaniel Bard"}, {"id": 15353, "name": "Jill Valentine"}, {"id": 15358, "name": "Brad Vickers"}, {"id": 15360, "name": "Marvin Branagh"}, {"id": 15355, "name": "Nicholai Ginovaef"}, {"id": 15361, "name": "Robert Kendo"}, {"id": 15357, "name": "Tyrell Patrick"}, {"id": 10961, "name": "Nemesis"}, {"id": 5793, "name": "Additional Voice"}]}
