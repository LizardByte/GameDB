Gameplay consists of avoiding touching the walls with your mouse cursor to reach the end of the maze. These walls get closer together after each level, making the path the player must travel through narrower.\n\nInfamously, when the player is close to reaching the end of level 3, a picture of the possessed girl from The Exorcist flashes on the screen against the sounds of loud screaming."}
