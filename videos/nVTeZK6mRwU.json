The game is coming to Steam in late 2024.\n\nIn this gripping escape room adventure, players step into the shoes of Sam, a man devastated by the death of his wife and the mysterious coma that has befallen his daughter. With medical explanations failing and a friend's \"accidental\" gift of \"The Book of Rituals,\" Sam embarks on a perilous journey to save his daughter, confronting unknown forces along the way.\n\nThe game offers a rich, immersive experience filled with mystery and darkness, weaving a tale of loss, redemption, and the shadows of the past. Key features include open exploration, multiple endings, challenging puzzles, and an engaging narrative. Players' moral decisions and problem-solving skills will be tested, but they can take their time, thanks to the game's non-timed, replayable nature.\n\nEscape Tales: The Awakening will be available on Steam later this year. In the meantime, you can add it to your wishlist to stay updated on its release!
