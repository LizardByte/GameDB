When a tribe of echidnas sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds' power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Before it could destroy the world, Tikal, a young echidna who befriended Chaos, imprisoned it in the Master Emerald along with herself. Eggman releases Chaos and Sonic and his friends must act against Eggman's plans and prevent the monster from becoming more powerful.", "summary": "The Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was a pre-release version of the game distributed to stores and rental locations, it did not include any bonus content.\n\nHistory:\nThe Limited Edition of Sonic Adventure was originally distributed to approximately 400 Funcoland locations as a disc-only release to be used in Dreamcast kiosks promoting the upcoming release of the console. These discs included a trimmed down version of the game based on the Japanese release and had saving and network connectivity disabled along with other minor differences; they were known to be buggy.\n\nLater, a variant of the release was distributed to Hollywood Video as part of a pre-release promotion in which the game could be rented along with a console before it\u2019s official launch. This variant of the game allowed saving and included a case and manual. The disc, game manual cover, and spine of the case all state \u201cLimited Edition\u201d and the artwork differs slightly from the standard edition release. Due to it\u2019s exclusive distribution through a rental chain many of the original game cases were lost or destroyed and replaced in whole or in part with cases or manuals from the standard edition release, also many discs were tagged with a \u201cHollywood Video\u201d security sticker.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-adventure-limited-edition"}
