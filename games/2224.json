There is a strict prohibition against travel into the past, because of its potentially disastrous effects on the timestream and the catastrophic consequences for current civilization.\n\nZeke S. Vettenmyer, a Lieutenant in the Temporal Corps, has stolen an interkron, traveled back into the past, and subtly altered historical situations so that the outcomes of these events will be changed. The world as we know it will be destroyed as the effects of these changes ripple forward towards the present and cause massive disruptions in the timestream.\n\nYou are a private in the Temporal Corps. You have been selected to travel into the past and untangle Vettenmyer's twisted plot. You must pursue Vettenmyer across 3,000 years of history, going to the times and places that he has visited and reversing the changes that he has made which are currently threatening the future that defines your very existence.", "summary": "Timequest is an interactive fiction game for MS-DOS in which players use time travel to venture into the past and correct temporal disruptions.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 30030, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "E06IpXameAU"}]}
