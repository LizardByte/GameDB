You can practice only one operation type at a time (addition, substraction, product and division), or go for the random level.  \n  \nIt also offers leaderboards, so that kids can compete with partners and friends.      \nAlso, it has sounds to make playing fun to kids, since for them this is just a game.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/baraja-sistema-coral"}
