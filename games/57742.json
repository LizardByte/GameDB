You have to take gravity under your control to change the position of the blocks and win the game. But it's not as easy as it sounds, because if you change the gravity once, every object is affected by it. So there will be many blocks blocking your way to the goal, but also some which will help you. Only if you play smart enough and with intuition, you'll complete the tricky missions of the block heroes. \n \n- Stunning graphics and effects \n- Great game mechanics \n- Variety of game-play guaranteed by 6 different modes \n- Over 180 Level - A huge number of blocks types \n- funny characters with personality \n- And much more!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 17784, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "SYTCrnw5sOw"}]}
