Your tasks are simple: develop, assemble and configure the robot. Just give the right signal to make the circuit work. Replace broken items. Encrypt and decrypt the signal. All this awaits you here, in a puzzle using real logical operators.\nDo you like uncommonness? Do you like logic games? Want to understand how electronics work? If you answered yes, then download our app, this fascinating brain workout! Getting engineering knowledge has never been so easy and fun.\n\nIt's simple, you will choose the values   at the inputs of the circuit or replace the broken parts to get 1. Remember, 1 is \u201ctrue\u201d, 0 is \u201cfalse\u201d.\nThe game is created in the image of real logic gates, on which microchips are built. You can easily understand the basics of circuitry just by playing. The application is free to download, the passage is also free. Games for the development of logic, games for the development of memory occupied a dense niche in the learning environment. If you are fond of computer structure or robotics games, this logic puzzle will take its place on the shelf of your favorite puzzles.\n\nThe game offers:\nHundreds of interesting levels.\nMany elements that will not make you bored.\nMany solutions for each level.\nTwo game modes.\nThe story where you have to help the engineer with his difficult task. Our logic puzzle contains animated cut-scenes. We will not let you be bored;)\nBlack theme - save your eyes and battery.\nHelp for levels.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tfcsyVAbess/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tfcsyVAbess/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tfcsyVAbess/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Make it True", "description": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ViacheslavRud.Circuit\n\nThis application develops logic, where you will be given the role of assistant engineer.
