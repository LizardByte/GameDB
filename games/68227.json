The game was later re-broadcast several times. It is currently not possible to obtain and play the game in its intended form, as Satellaview service is no longer supported, some parts of the game used stream voice acting, which is not part of the game code itself, and the game was never ported to other consoles. As a Satellaview release, it was never released outside Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "videos": [{"id": 36742, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5aDReECT2wg"}, {"id": 36792, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Ta4ftAfHJz4"}]}
