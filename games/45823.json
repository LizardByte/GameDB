They eventually manage to knock him down only to have him stand up in the next second. Godzilla then destroys/crumbles a building (a few G-Force soliders can be seen running while the building crumbles). After, Godzilla begins to charge his atomic breath, after a few seconds the building is seen exploding and soldiers scrambling/running and attacking, Godzilla fires his ray up into the sky, then a black hit point shows up as the screen darkens, marking the end of the intro. There's no sound effects in the intro, only music.", "summary": "Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact is a sequel to the Dreamcast launch title Godzilla Generations. Both are based on the famous Japanese movies series around the eponymous Godzilla, a giant dinosaur-like monster.\n\nThe game is a rail shooter like the famed Panzer Dragoon, where you move on a fixed path but can shoot in all directions to take down waves of approaching enemies. The game also features a dodge and a lock-on mechanic. The gameplay is divided in two kinds of levels. The first style features Godzilla rampaging through a Japanese city and taking down all kinds of military devices which try to stop him. The second kind of level is a fight between Godzilla and other giant monsters from the various films.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/godzilla-generations-maximum-impact", "videos": [{"id": 38076, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tW5m6SxWX2I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW5m6SxWX2I", "title": "Godzilla Generations MAXIMUM IMPACT (1999) Playthrough / SEGA Dreamcast / iPlaySEGA", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tW5m6SxWX2I/sddefault.jpg"}]}
