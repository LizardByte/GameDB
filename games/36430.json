Adjustable difficulty levels make the game as simple or as detailed as you like.\n\nPC Gamer Editor's Choice (1997)\nFantastic story and excellent gameplay (Online Gaming Review, 1997)The Realms of Arkania TrilogyThe Realms of Arkania games (Blade of Destiny, Star Trail and Shadows of Riva) deliver a prime example of the classical European fantasy universe. Based on Germany's most popular pen & paper role playing game, it was also the first German computer RPG series to get widely recognized outside of its home country. To this day it holds a stable hardcore fanbase that loves the games for their comprehensive adaption of the pen & paper ruleset and the believable medieval fantasy setting."}
