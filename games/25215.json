The earth has been altered by a dramatic climate change. Sea levels have risen, making the air too toxic to breathe and the water unsafe to venture into. In order to survive in this environment, you will need to acquire or craft tools, build shelter, and learn skills.\n\nDiox is about exploration, scavenging, construction, crafting, and survival. Unlike many survival games that force a predefined path to acquire items with limited uses, Diox allows players to craft a wide variety of basic and complex items from prefabricated parts commonly found in and around the cities that have been left in ruin. Players have the freedom to find different ways to accomplish the same task, whether it is building, crafting, or combat. There are many different paths to achieve the same end.\n\nThrough character progression and customization, exploring, and crafting, there are endless possibilities for developing a powerful character.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diox"}
