The player must send Pok\u00e9mon discs into holes located at each of the four corners of the board to earn points. Which direction and the distance the discs are launched depends on the angle and force they are launched at. Each disc depicts a Pok\u00e9mon. While these discs can be sent directly into the holes, if they hit another Pok\u00e9mon disc in their evolutionary line, they will fuse together and evolve. If they hit an unrelated Pok\u00e9mon, they will simply collide and knock each other back. There are also special rounds where certain conditions must be met, such as getting all the discs into the holes in one shot.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pachirisus-click-clack-attack"}
