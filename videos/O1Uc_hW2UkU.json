{"id": "O1Uc_hW2UkU", "snippet": {"title": "Expendable Game Sample - Dreamcast", "description": "Original Air Date: November 1st, 2009 (Revised Today!!)\n\nExpendable (also known as \"Millennium Soldier: Expendable\" and \"Seitai Heiki Expendable\") is a shoot-em-up developed by the British development team \"Rage Software\" for PC, Playstation and Dreamcast in 1998, 1999 and 2000 (respectively). It was published by Imagineer in Japan and by Infogrames in the U.S. and Europe. Rage Software, who are best known for their Football/Soccer titles and arcade-style games offered owners of Sega's Dreamcast a nice, action-packed alternative to such titles as \"Contra\" and (more specifically) \"Alien Syndrome\".\n\nIn this story-lite game set in \"AD 2463\", Earth is overrun by a race of oxygen-loving aliens known as \"The Charva\" who have enslaved human settlements and their only hope lies in the \"Millennium Soldier\" project, a group of expendable genetically engineered super-soldiers whose only interest are killing and hunting from birth to sleep. While there were originally hundreds, only two of these elite killing machines have survived and its your job to guide them into battle, freeing areas and pushing The Charva back until the ultimate confrontation on their own home soil.\n\nThe game is more or less your typical action game with secrets to find and various weapon upgrades. Things of note include the hostages you can find on levels (or shoot for \"Mercy Killings\") and different key items needed to access new areas or progress through the game. With more than two dozen levels, nice effects, a decent soundtrack, and challenging two-player action, Expendable is a solid Dreamcast title to add to your collection. This is a video revised in higher quality and extended a bit to show some hostage rescuing and other weaponry.
