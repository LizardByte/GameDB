When Timmy discovers Chin has been kidnapped, the only person to save the day is Chin's sidekick, Cleft the Boy Chin Wonder, who just happens to be Timmy in costume. The player must release Chin from captivity by defeating enemies and overcoming obstacles along the way in this side-scrolling, action-packed videogame. Timmy's quirky Fairy Godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, appear throughout the 20 game stages to offer their own strange attempts at assistance. Cosmo and Wanda will supply Timmy/Cleft items to use in his journey -- some of which are key in defeating the captors. Throughout Fairly OddParents, gamers will move through several environments, including the Comic World, the Primitive Age, the Present World and the Future World.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-fairly-oddparents-enter-the-cleft", "collections": [{"id": 3991, "name": "The Fairly OddParents"}]}
