This is the time of the Maelstrom. In this ravaged world, the planet's dwindling resources have divided what remains of mankind in two: the urban freedom fighting 'Remnants' and the technologically advanced 'Ascension'. Now they must wage war against a new threat, the invasion of a savage alien race, the Hai-Genti, and each other in a desperate struggle for supremacy and survival. Through the game's missions, take command from different viewpoints and employ faction-specific tactics and weaponry to achieve your objectives. Complete with the ability to terraform landscapes and transform units, Maelstrom provides gamers with the power to harness the forces of nature in the most frantic, destructive, action-packed RTS game yet.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maelstrom-the-battle-for-earth-begins", "videos": [{"id": 4586, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WS_TEzziCOw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS_TEzziCOw", "title": "Maelstrom The Battle for Earth Begins - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WS_TEzziCOw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
