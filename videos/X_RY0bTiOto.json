{"id": "X_RY0bTiOto", "snippet": {"title": "Nevermind Official Trailer (2016 VR Edition)", "description": "Nevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced adventure thriller game that takes you into the darkly surreal world of the subconscious. As you explore the abstract world within the minds of trauma survivors and solve the cryptic puzzles lurking within, biofeedback technology monitors moment-to-moment indications of anxiety. If you let your feelings of fear get the best of you, the game will become harder. If you\u2019re able to calm yourself in the face of terror, the game will be more forgiving. Nevermind strives to create a haunting gameplay experience that also teaches you how to be more aware of your internal responses to stressful situations. If you can learn to control your anxiety within the intense realm of Nevermind, imagine what you will be able to do when faced with stressful moments in the real world. Nevermind explores themes of psychological trauma and PTSD and seeks to engage and educate players about trauma and potentially become a tool that may be used within a therapeutic context. Nevermind is currently available for Mac, Windows, and Oculus Rift. It can be found on Steam, the Humble Store, and Oculus Home.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X_RY0bTiOto/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X_RY0bTiOto/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X_RY0bTiOto/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X_RY0bTiOto/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X_RY0bTiOto/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nevermind Official Trailer (2016 VR Edition)", "description": "Nevermind is a biofeedback-enhanced adventure thriller game that takes you into the darkly surreal world of the subconscious.
