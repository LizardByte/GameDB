Described as their \"first game\", AoW spent quite a bit of time in development, having been premiered as early as Comiket 77, but was planned even earlier than that as the lone programmer, Nacht, had to first create assets and libraries before development could begin (and these libraries would be used to create smaller scale games in the meantime for mobile devices). Partnering with Gatta for graphics and Ren (of Bastet Tail) on music, it was ultimately finished and released at the end of 2011 (with a few patches released throughout the middle of 2012) at Comiket 81 and later through Melonbooks, but make no mistake about it -- it was released in extremely low quantities (a few dozen due to a fear of leftover stock at the Comic Market from larger scale publishing) and has since become a lost Doujin game. Its overall quality is made even more impressive due to its three-man team.\n\nThe game's story takes place in the experimental city called \"M.A.N.A.\"  (Which stands for Multiple Access Neuron Arithmetic), a huge network of nanomachines scattered across an unnamed region by the Japanese government. M.A.N.A. itself is a huge brain, a communication infrastructure, and a program that controls the very environment itself, but a mysterious hacker has created dangerous bugs in the network known as \"Muteless\", causing the government to call in a group of skilled warriors known as \"Debuggers\" to fight the Muteless and quell the spread of the virus. The main character is a well-to-do but bumbling rookie named Nao Amanogawa, ranked as a Class-D Debugger and code-named the \"Ace of Wands\" (a reference to the Tarot Card, her potential, and also a suit of cards with her being arguably the weakest and strongest, with the King, Queen and Jack of Wands also being referenced), who has to overcome incredible odds while getting to the root of the problem and saving M.A.N.A. \n\nShe is not alone however; she is also joined by Amavi Mikado (a senior Debugger who is stoic and only takes real joy in combat and, to a lesser extent, Nao's earnest efforts) and Rie Kushido (a close-quarters specialist who seems like a loner but is the resident tsundere) on certain missions and the game is a story-driven horizontal scrolling action game. While the story segments can be skipped, they are numerous and will break up the action quite a bit, so if that's not your cup of tea, then this game won't appeal to you as much. The game draws some  inspirations from \"Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\" and a little from \"Mega Man\" (especially with the \"retconned\" content) with an interesting futuristic meta not found very often in horizontal scrolling action games, so it gets some brownie points for that too.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively simple: Nao has a basic shot that can be angled almost 180 degrees, she can slash enemies at close range (or manually through a special command), a high jump ability (if she hits a ceiling above her with it, she will smack down and be invulnerable for a bit, no damage) and a sliding ability (she can shoot while sliding and is also invincible, unless she slides off a ledge). Various areas have firewalls that need a certain amount of enemies debugged before she can advance or various .exe (weapons or abilities) she can find that have a small cooldown (download) before she can use them -- most of these have a time limit, requiring you to blitz through areas to get the most use out of them. The main weapons range from rapid fire, wide shots, homing (WARNING: this weapon seems to crash my game on stages 3 and 5), a deadly lazer and the ultimate \"Formatter\", a weapon that eradicates all nearby enemies (but affects the world's \"M.A.N.A.\" density, causing a huge strain on the network by over 50%, so it is only used in emergencies). \n\nThere's also a radar and \"retconned\" weapons you can play with in the game's latest patch (1.07) during an omake stage which include a charge shot, and this can also charge several other test weapons (known as ????); they were part of planned content for an expansion, \"Ace of Wands 1.2\", which was never released. Most weapons consume her own M.A.N.A., and must recharge when it runs out.\n\nThe game's music is great (with some stock sounds) and the sprite work is exceptional; the various pixel locales are expansive and highly detailed, and there's even some lighting effects and use of particle effects and 3D used to great effect, and most characters are well animated. While the controls are a bit cumbersome and the game could be a little more challenging, you don't get Doujins of this type and quality this often. Juno Soft is still around, so the game can't be distributed right now unfortunately. This is a playthrough of the whole game. We will pin a little supplemental information in the comments.
