Suddenly he finds his life changing in unbelievable ways as his fate becomes entangled with his classmate Tetsuo Shironuma, upperclassman Zenya Okinaga and best friend Makoto Mita.\nSounds like your typical school boys' love setting right? Except that this being a Nitro+ production means that the story is also infused with horror of the most potent kind. Filled to the brim with Primal Fear and Body Horror, all heightened with a brilliantly creepy soundtrack, this is definitely not a game for the faint-hearted.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 48872, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "eERcySioYsE"}]}
