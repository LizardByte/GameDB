Dustborn is a third-person, single-player, story-driven, road-tripping action-adventure about hope, love, friendship, robots \u2014 and the power of words. Set in a vibrant and perilous post-infodemic America inspired by graphic novels, a band of misfits and outcasts must cross a divided continent to transport a mysterious package from California to Nova Scotia.\n\n...EXCEPT FOR US.\n\nWELCOME TO THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA\nThe year is 2030, three decades after the Broadcast. You play Pax: ex-con, outcast, con-artist, and Anomal with superhuman powers fuelled by disinformation. Your job: to transport a package across a divided America. But this is not a one-woman job. The fanatical Puritans are on your ass, the authoritarian Justice is in your way, and you\u2019re four-months pregnant. You need help. You need a crew. Joined by a motley mob of misfits with their own weird powers, you must overcome the many obstacles that stand in your way \u2014 through manipulation, subterfuge, and force \u2014 to reach your final destination and escape your troubled past.\n\nKEY FEATURES\nYOU JUST CAN\u2019T WITHOUT YOUR CREW - Recruit and manage a band of outcasts and misfits with weird powers, compelling personal stories, and conflicting personalities. Manage your headstrong crew through words and actions, and use their powers to fight your pursuers and overcome obstacles along the road, as you stand united in the face of overwhelming adversity.\n\nA ROAD TRIP ACROSS A DIVIDED CONTINENT - Take a road trip across the continent, from the Corporate Republic of Pacifica to the Free Nation of Nova Scotia. Explore new places, take on unexpected assignments, and recruit new crew members. See the beautiful sights along the highway, rendered in a colourful graphic-novel-inspired art style, as you traverse an America irrevocably changed by civil war, mass migration, and global warming.\n\nWIELD WEAPONISED WORDS AGAINST ENEMIES AND FRIENDS - Words have power. Like, actual power. Fight your pursuers with weaponised words, and use wordcraft in conversations to manipulate people with the power of disinformation.
