You\u2019re traveling in a car that then screeches up to the sidewalk next to the bustling crowds of people. You get out. And then you punch every fucker that stands in your way to the tune of punk! This is Zak Ayles\u2019 PUNK\u2019S NOT DEAD. It couldn\u2019t come at a better time. I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s a bit of a reaction piece to the IGF Awards last week , during which Andy Schatz said that indie games aren\u2019t punk-rock any more because they\u2019re successful and part of culture in general now. That\u2019s a very narrow perception to take, considering that there are TONS of developers still releasing little games that don\u2019t get seen by the majority. There are a few indie game successes, yes, and there\u2019s a larger interest in these games we class as \u201cindies\u201d nowadays compared to previous years, but indie games are very much punk-rock.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/punks-not-dead"}
