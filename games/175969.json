(also known by the informal name Peach's Castle) is a tech demo for Nintendo GameCube. In 2001, Nintendo sent various developers an interactive Tech Demo in order to show them the graphical capabilities of their new console as part of the Nintendo GameCube Software Development Kit. In this demo, the player controls a red arrow that can go through various places in Peach's Castle from Super Mario 64. In different rooms it shows different graphical effects, which includes the following: large textures, bumps and shadows, anti-aliasing, local lighting, projection textures, environment mapping, and maximum polygons.\n\nThe castle is referred to in the game as Peach Castel (castel is an old French word for castle).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/welcome-to-gamecube-world", "videos": [{"id": 62566, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jE85lOieDnw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE85lOieDnw", "title": "Princess Peach's Castle (Gamecube Tech Demo) Running on Hardware  - Normal Mode", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jE85lOieDnw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62567, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "I7OnwP1ylhQ"}]}
