What makes it unique is the challenge of shooting the incoming minions, while keeping that nerve-wracking flappy style jump when avoiding them. Aero Attack is an addictive game of discipline and skill, looking to make people feel nostalgic and sentimental, remembering the retro games everyone loved spending time on and emotions they stirred in us. \n \nAero Attack is quasiStudio's debut game. By the end of 2018, studio's co-founder Kresimir Tavas finalized the artwork designs, which his partner Renato Stanic swiftly turned into a 2D casual mobile game using the Unity game engine. Aero Attack was released for iPhone and iPad on February 25, 2019, and Android on February 20, 2019.", "summary": "Aero Attack is a retro shooter arcade game where you play as a pilot named Bob, tasked to defend the human race from various aerial minions.
