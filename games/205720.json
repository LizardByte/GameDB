Your character has to fight their way through a desert, town, and mechanical area filled with machines, humans, and bugs to fight. You use punches or a jump kick to defeat enemies as you advance upward. Some enemies will drop guns that you can pick up to use for yourself, making the game play more like a conventional run and gun. Once you defeat the boss at the end, the game will loop back to the beginning and repeat until you run out of lives.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 70416, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "MC1Ukf-ag4A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC1Ukf-ag4A", "title": "Commando+Ninja Emaki=Mighty Guy Arcade Game LONGPLAY 1cc Gameplay (\u30de\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30ac\u30a4 Nichibutsu 1986) MAME", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MC1Ukf-ag4A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70417, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "D_nN8tnx3rQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_nN8tnx3rQ", "title": "Game of the day 785 Mighty Guy (\u30de\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30ac\u30a4) Nichibutsu 1986", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D_nN8tnx3rQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
