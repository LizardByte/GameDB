The SR-91 uses the VAWS (Variable Armor and Weapon System) which uses the Optica Weapon Arms. The Arms shield the ship from top and bottom attacks, provides back-up fire and using its Arm System can be positioned to fire in various angles depending on the current weapon. The SR-91 uses one of three different pick-up weapons: the red \"Taikuu Laser\", thin red beams that fire straight forward; the yellow \"Ring Laser\", yellow rings which can be aimed in all directions and provide good coverage; and the blue \"Hansha Ball\", blue spheres that can be also aimed in all directions and bounce off the walls. The only other pick-up items are Speed Ups and Speed Downs. Extends were set at the first 70,000 points and was added with every 80,000.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rezon"}
