The game follows three friends, Ash (Ashley) J. Raimi, Barbara Romero and R.J. MacCarpenter during a Halloween party in their high school. Every thing feels like just another stupid school party until lights start to fail and weird things happen. Like, really weird sh*t. You play as a different protagonist in each game chapter and each character will add his or her own outlook on the events that took place in that peculiar night.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/killing-moon"}
