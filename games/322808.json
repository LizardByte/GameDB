One day, an SOS signal arrives from the base, which, having settled in Xena, was attacked, but when Gerald arrives at the place, he discovers survivors who share valuable information. In addition, he finds a new experimental sample - a purple crystal.\n\nAfter that, the trouble started. First, due to a failed experiment, a cascade resonance was caused, then, in addition to the alien attack, mercenaries from the Black Hawk organization descended on the base. Gerald has to solve all these problems with a lot of lead and blood.
