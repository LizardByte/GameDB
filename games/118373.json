The epic fantasy saga is finally available on mobile devices, offering a whole new angle to the franchise. Leaving the story of its PC ancestors untouched and comes indeed 100%-story free, the Premium Game will offer turn-based strategy and tactics instead of real-time. \n \nCRAFT YOUR FANTASY EMPIRE \nCreating an own Kingdom turn by turn is the main goal in the 13-Mission long adventure mode or the free game, where you are facing your AI-opponents on randomly generated maps. Choose between the Dark Elves, the Orcs or Humans as playable races and ally or fight six neutral factions. Send your troops to conquer cities, to claim mines or farms and to search for treasure. \n \nEXPLORE NEW LANDS \nYour race\u2019s hero will lead your army on their search for glory, treasures and valuable resources to exploit. Because your ever-expanding empire needs them to prosper. When you find new cities, you can muster new unique unitsand command them in any battle that lies ahead. \n \nBATTLE YOUR ENEMIES \nWhile your heroes explore the realms, you will meet your opponents on the battlefield and will exterminate them in simultaneous turn-based combats. Played out on hexagons, you\u2019ll send Archers, Catapults, Knights or Dark Elf Necromancers against beasts & enemies like Spiders, Shadow Nightmares or Barbarian Berserkers. While you plan your actions, so does your enemy. When you both execute your plans, you\u2019ll see who the better strategist is.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spellforce-heroes-and-magic", "videos": [{"id": 27210, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "yf33ECMy8XE"}, {"id": 27211, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "X0RZ2k8HKCY"}]}
