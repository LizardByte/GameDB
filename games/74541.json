At one time the land was a verdant paradise. \nThe Gods created a family of giants. Then they created a human family that even more closely resembled themselves. The Gods were extremely satisfied with the results and loved the humans above all. The jealous giants began to eat the humans. \nThe angry Gods decided to eradicate the giants, but that was the giants' trap. \nThey changed their own blood and flesh to cursed dust, and scattered it inside Di-bounce. Most of the cursed land has a strong magical power, and has become an area of scorched earth that no one can enter.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/merkava-avalance", "videos": [{"id": 16341, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "01mHnrBr6IQ"}]}
