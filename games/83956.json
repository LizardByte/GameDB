In Martha Madison: Forces, students use forces, acceleration, inertia, and friction to move giant ice blocks across a frozen landscape. Once the correct forces are applied, ice choppers are put to work, breaking the blocks into small bricks that Martha\u2019s penguin friends need to build new homes. Experience a free-play forces playground and create custom, playable levels in the game!"}
