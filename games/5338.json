Most of the systems you would expect such as sonar and periscope are featured and nicely presented in VGA. The game offers ten missions for both the Soviet and American side in a Cold War scenario, that grows progressively hotter. Nice to see that the two sides' submarines have their own graphic sets in the game, even with some pseudo-cyrillic labels on the Russian side.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
