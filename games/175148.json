This encounter between Major General T.J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson\u2019s Confederate Valley Army and Brigadier General James Shields\u2019 Division was one of \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson\u2019s few military defeats. Despite this, the boldness of his attack forced the Union high command to adopt a more defensive stance, fearing such an attack on Washington. This played a large part in the Union\u2019s subsequent failure to capture to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, ultimately prolonging the civil war.", "summary": "This is the first in a series of games from HexWar to be based on the 'Great Battles of the American Civil War' board games, which started with the classic game 'Terrible Swift Sword'.
