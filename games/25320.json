The four belligerent nations - Valessia, Ondora, Zaragos, and Galamonde - were locked in a ceaseless conflict that had spanned generations, with no end in sight.\n\nThat all changed the day the Traitor King Weyrin unleashed his Curse upon the world.\n\nIn a few short weeks, the kingdom of Galamonde fell, consumed entirely and reborn as a dark, barren wasteland. The remaining nations, seeing such swift and utter destruction far beyond any of their own means, put aside their differences and established a tenuous truce to stem the tide of the Curse. They were successful, but at a great cost that would continue in perpetuity. The Curse was contained in the Dead Kingdom Galamonde, a festering blight in the heart of the world, and from his dark throne within, the Traitor King forever strives to break his bonds and engulf the world in shadow.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, what was once open warfare has devolved into restrained hostility, as the powers that be struggle to hold themselves together under the constant threat of outbreak, uprising, and the inevitable resurgence of total war.\n\nIt's in this time, in which the frayed edges of the mortal realms are beginning to unravel completely, where Oathborn's story begins.", "summary": "Oathborn: The Chronicle of Ruin is a grand-scale SRPG that charges you with leading a band of soldiers through a dangerous, desperate world of shifting alliances and arcane oblivion. Inspired by classics like Ogre Battle, Suikoden II, and Final Fantasy Tactics, Oathborn is a game about strategic decision-making, compelling characters, and a story with no promises of happy ends or easy answers.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 29816, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oEcKUvB3MRE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEcKUvB3MRE", "title": "Oathborn: The Chronicle of Ruin - Trailer 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oEcKUvB3MRE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
