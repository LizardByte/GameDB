The player controls a mage who descends into the chambers of an old castle to defeat demons. On each level the mage must free all \"souls\" imprisoned throughout the map, then enter the gate. Demons of various kinds keep appearing, and most of them can be defeated with magic. The mage starts with a basic spell that shoots sparks, but it's possible to collect artifacts which temporarily allow using other spells, such as projectiles that freeze or slow down demons. The mage's health is depleted by demon attacks and the level must be restarted if the mage is killed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/demonlisher", "videos": [{"id": 89508, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "L6nojYS586s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6nojYS586s", "title": "Demonlisher - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L6nojYS586s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
