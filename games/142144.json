It is set after the events of the film: VR game developer Jimi Dini has wiped the source code of his latest game Nirvana, thus releasing its protagonist Solo from his virtual prison. However, portions of the game still survive in Jimi's archives, creating a potential risk of Nirvana being re-assembled. The player is called upon to investigate Jimi's house and archives in search for the lingering game code and destroy it. \n \nThe gameplay is a mixture of puzzle-solving and exploration viewed from the player's perspective. The location view can be freely rotated by moving the mouse and several objects are clickable, often giving access to secret rooms. The bottom bar icons offer several actions such as using scanners, connecting to the network and communicating with the artificial intelligence that powers Jimi's house. Many solutions to the puzzles are found by sifting through Jimi's archives, which contain audio, images and clips from the film, as well as program code and other digital objects", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nirvana-x-rom"}
