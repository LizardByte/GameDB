After the most powerful spacecraft in the known Universe, the Golden Warpship, is disassembled by a band of ruthless Space Pirates and scattered throughout the galaxy, Solar Jetman is tasked with rebuilding the ship to its former glory.

With survival running as thin as his fuel, Solar Jetman will need to ward off every potential invasion and escape with the Golden Warpship intact \u2013 only then can he face off against his largest interstellar foe yet!\n\nSolar Jetman was re-released as part of the Rare Replay Collection on Xbox One.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 4548, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "MaTJAw0QDH0"}]}
