Inspired by movies like The Road and I Am Legend, as well as the game Metro 2033, MISERY concept-wise, was meant to provide a highly challenging experience with a unique setting and atmosphere. Our goal is to throw the player into a miserable environment and give them only one objective: to survive. This survival-driven aspect is particularly explicit in MISERY: you only have limited resources at your disposal and have to deal with various threats when you\u2019re at your weakest and most vulnerable. The implication of this is clear: the player is forced to re-think their habits and get used to new and demanding conditions of the Zone as envisaged by MISERY developers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/s-dot-t-a-dot-l-k-dot-e-r-dot-misery", "videos": [{"id": 41456, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cA6VjqnJLGE"}]}
