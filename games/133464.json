Hyperspace opened the door to the stars, but habitable worlds are few and far in between, overpopulation is still rampant, and our civilization's appetite for resources has only increased. For over a hundred years, the incredibly rich Dust Zone sated this endless appetite, jointly controlled by the United Earth Nations and the Zone Mining Cooperative. But humanity\u2019s fighting chance only lasted for a short hundred years.\n\nNow, it has gone dark. Freighters stopped arriving with supply hauls and humanity is facing an unprecedented crisis. It's up to the commander of UEN's finest fleet, to deploy into the Dust Zone, investigate, and solve the supply chain crisis before it spirals out of control. It's time to demonstrate strategic aptitude in a turn-based management mode. Then, head to the front lines and channel your inner commander in intense, real-time space battles.", "summary": "A hybrid of 4x and real time strategy. Players are presented with a starmap and can complete story missions at certain locations to unlock more missions. Side missions are also available for extra rewards.\n\nThe player can upgrade their fleet with new ships, and can customise the weapons load out of each one. Ships can be built during the turn-based starmap phase, or in realtime during missions.\n\nThe game also features a full mission and campaign editor, and mod.io support so players can share and download new campaigns.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dust-fleet", "videos": [{"id": 49424, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "95STa9Dps1o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95STa9Dps1o", "title": "Dust Fleet 2020 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/95STa9Dps1o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 94771, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "I-hdpW2DsGc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-hdpW2DsGc", "title": "DUST FLEET - First Look & Gameplay (New 4X RTS Space Sim)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I-hdpW2DsGc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 96348, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AQHgAu7OVzo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQHgAu7OVzo", "title": "Dust Fleet - Official Trailer | Re-MIX Showcase July 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AQHgAu7OVzo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
