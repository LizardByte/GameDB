Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: One king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Pieces move in different assigned ways according to their type, and accordingly are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in \"check\") and there is no way to move or defend it."}
