By order of the King, Punk has been banished to the hot dungeons beneath the castle where Gapas lives.\n\nThe dungeons are guarded by Gachi, a terrible and horrible wizard. The poor guy, since he has to eat hamburgers all day and can't keep watch, sends some balls of ketchup and mustard. These balls drain Punkito's energy, and he finds himself overwhelmed in the dungeon's labyrinths.\n\nHe has one chance to escape. He must find the 18 auroras that make the thirteen elements that make up the hamburgers. Once he finds the auroras,\n\nPunkito will have the same strength and energy as Gachi. Once he has fought him, he can leave the dungeons and settle the score with King Gapas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/punk-star", "videos": [{"id": 139259, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iSxHey5FD7g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSxHey5FD7g", "title": "Punk Star (Iber Software/Genesis Soft) (1988) (Amstrad CPC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iSxHey5FD7g/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 139260, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "y1DCIoD9j_g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1DCIoD9j_g", "title": "Punkstar (Iber Software) (1988) (ZX Spectrum) (Full Walkthrough)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y1DCIoD9j_g/sddefault.jpg"}]}
