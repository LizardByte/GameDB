One or two players can compete in Match Play mode while up to four can compete for the best score in the 18-hole Stroke Player mode. The game also sports a Grand Opening Mode (compete with the world's best Japan Pro-Golfers,), a Career Mode, Qualifying Tournament (you create your own player and start with a handicap of 0) and Network Opening. The latter lets you connect to Randnet and compete in an All-Japan tournament.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/japan-pro-golf-tour-64", "videos": [{"id": 39452, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "GW6mN9BxspI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW6mN9BxspI", "title": "Japan Pro Golf Tour 64 - Intro & Demo (64DD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GW6mN9BxspI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39453, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "DcYjo_lDc3k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYjo_lDc3k", "title": "Nintendo 64DD Review - Japan Pro Golf Tour 64 - H4G", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DcYjo_lDc3k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
