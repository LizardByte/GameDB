All of Gensokyo\u2019s residents gather in the village to celebrate with games, snacks, and a spectacular fireworks display to rival even the most dense of spell cards!\n\nWhat they don\u2019t know is that Wriggle and her troupe of fireflies are an integral part of the celebration. Like a swarm of Danmaku, Wriggle leads her legion of lampyridae to give the festival their blessing and light up the night. This year, you have the honor of helping them out!\n\nUnfortunately, some of the villagers see the hard working insects as nothing more than a nuisance. Be careful out there!", "summary": "Help Wriggle save the Summer festival!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lampyridae-matsuri"}
