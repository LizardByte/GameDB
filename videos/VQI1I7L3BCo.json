I worked things out so that I could get everything without having to revisit any of the stages - in case you were wondering by I don't always take them in the order of the bosses' weaknesses.\n\nThis is a really odd feeling game. It has the Game Boy versions' initial four-boss only stage select in play, and the graphics feel scaled to proportions closer to the GB screen than the NES games - the sprites are huge! To give credit where credit is due, the sprites look great: the style is quite similar to that in Mega Man 8, and there is some really impressive use of color. But because they are so oversized, the stages feel wicked claustrophobic. And even though they all look great, the sprite animation feels a bit... lacking, for a better term. It feels too stiff in contrast to the level of detail. The SNES certainly could handle better than is on show here - maybe it was a consequence of the tiny 16mbit ROM it shipped on? \n\nI really did love the shoutouts to older games though - that robot museum area is really cool.\n\nThe controls are also a bit laggy at times, and in general, the whole thing just feels kinda meh... it's a complete rehash of other stuff with less spirit behind it. Granted, it was developed in just a few months by seven guys, but Mega Man's main series really deserved a bit more attention and time... the Mega Man line is a bit of a legacy, and while this game is quite good, it's definitely weak for a numbered Mega Man game. I'd put Mega Man 7 right about even with Mega Man 6 for relative awesomeness. It's much better than 5 was, but it's no 1-4.\n\nOh well. Mega Man 7 is ultimately a but pretty average game, and nowadays, buying a legitimate original copy will set you back an exorbitant sum. Unless you have cash to burn, there are several good games that you could buy for the cost of this one. Or, you know, just pick up one of the several collections that let you play it emulated. \n\nHope you enjoy the playthrough!\n\nOh, and what's up with that animation when you enter the shop? It looks so gross when you enter, like you've been inhaled by some sort of robotic prolapse. I've always thought of it as the Goatse Shop. Uck, I know. \n\n*This video is a brand new playthrough to replace my older, lower quality one in the SNES playlist. \n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VQI1I7L3BCo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VQI1I7L3BCo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VQI1I7L3BCo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VQI1I7L3BCo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Man 7 (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1995 Super Nintendo game, Mega Man 7. \n\nIn this video I collect all of the extra, optional stuff throughout.
