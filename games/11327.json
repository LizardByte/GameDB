Destroying the guardian would win the game for the team.\nPlayers controlled hero characters named Shapers. \nShapers could have their stats modified by players by choosing spells and items, and had the ability to access wards that could be placed to provide vision to areas of the map for their team.\n\nIt was to be Free to Play and supported by micro transaction, like its competitors.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 4626, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Et_AAdPSPzE"}]}
