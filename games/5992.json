Nick, however, is captured, but manages to free himself and continue his mission to stop The Movement, regaining his psychic abilities along the way. \n \nThe game mixes regular weapons with the weapons of the mind. You'll have access to a series of mind powers, such as Telekinesis (the ability to fling object and soldiers around), Pyrokineses (the ability to set things on fire), Mind Drain (for draining Psi power out of foes' minds) and Remote Viewing (leaving your body behind and exploring the level).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/psi-ops-the-mindgate-conspiracy"}
