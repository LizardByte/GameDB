You are an assassin who was hired to go to planet Pykron 9 to take out its boss, Dunmark Pykro.\n\nThe adventure part was extremely confusing for me, as the game won't accept basic commands like North, or Go North. After many tries, I finally found out that I needed to use Forward, Back, Left, and Right for navigation. Hope you enjoy the short walkthrough!\n\nThe long play is done by Smartadventurer, a program that I wrote to automate the playing for vintage Apple ][ games.
