{"id": "ECsC9wIuHcE", "snippet": {"title": "Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach | official Xbox Trailer", "description": "(Everything in this video is Owned By Steel Wool Studios, ScottGames, Xbox, And Microsoft.)\n\nTHE NEXT CHAPTER IN FEAR\n\nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games loved by millions of players from all over the globe. Play as Gregory, a young boy trapped overnight in Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex. With the help of Freddy Fazbear himself, Gregory must survive the near-unstoppable hunt of reimagined Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s characters - as well as new, horrific threats.\n\nTHE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED - Once nighttime protocols are initiated, the animatronics at Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex will relentlessly pursue all intruders. Glamrock Chica, Roxanne Wolf, Montgomery Gator, and the Pizzaplex\u2019s security guard, Vanessa, will turn over every Cotton Candy Pizza Stand if they have to - it\u2019s not wise to stay in one place for too long.\n\nADAPT TO SURVIVE - Access the building\u2019s security cameras to survey the environment and plan your route through danger. Distract enemies by knocking over paint cans and toys - just slip away before enemies are drawn to your location. Hop into hiding spots and allow danger to pass, or try to outrun your pursuers. Play your way, but be prepared to adapt.\n\nEXPLORE AND DISCOVER - Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex offers a variety of attractions for guests to enjoy - Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway, Bonnie Bowl, the sewers, and\u2026 Sewers? The Pizzaplex is vast and has no shortage of goodies to discover.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECsC9wIuHcE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECsC9wIuHcE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECsC9wIuHcE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECsC9wIuHcE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ECsC9wIuHcE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach | official Xbox Trailer", "description": "(Everything in this video is Owned By Steel Wool Studios, ScottGames, Xbox, And Microsoft.)\n\nTHE NEXT CHAPTER IN FEAR\n\nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games loved by millions of players from all over the globe.
