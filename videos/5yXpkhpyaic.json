Game developer Visual Concepts made NBA 2K and SEGA published it in 1999 under the label SEGA Sports. The NBA 2K series was then exclusive to Sega Dreamcast and continued on until NBA 2K2 (that was also released on GameCube, PS2 and Xbox).\nThe series is to this date very alive and kicking with the latest game being NBA 2K16 that was released for all major contemporary platforms (including mobile).\nAll of the games in the franchise have been developed by Visual Concepts. Its a primary competitor to NBA Live series from EA Sports.\n\nAs a basketball game it's pretty basic, but what else can you expect from the first game in the series. The available game modes are Exhibition, Seasons, Playoffs, Practice, and Customizations. In Customizations, the player can create a real NBA player and his player or team. They may also change their team's starting lineups. Also, players can move onto different rosters. You can also import created players and teams to another person's Dreamcast.\n\nThere is also a Code Menu where you can give your players big heads, big feet, make them 2D and so on. A couple of these codes is featured in this video.\n\nWhat can we say? It's a simple but fun basketball game. It doesn't stand a chance against the new versions regarding modes, features and content, but it's just pure and simple fun. We warmly recommend that you give this game a chance if you're a fan of basketball.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5yXpkhpyaic/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5yXpkhpyaic/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5yXpkhpyaic/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5yXpkhpyaic/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "NBA 2K (Dreamcast)", "description": "This is where it all started.
