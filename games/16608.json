It tells the story of a small creature surviving in a mysterious, hostile world. Once players escape the crude crate the strange, lumbering beasts used for a trap, players journey through sprawling forests, mountains, caves, and swamps, brought to life in a cinematic physical-effects style reminiscent of Jim Henson\u2019s The Dark Crystal, or Hedgehog in the Fog.\n\nThe dreamlike world of Feist is a striking and mesmerizing place, but dangerous AI-controlled enemies keep pushing the players toward their fate. Enemies and traps, without scripted sequences, interact and produce surprising emergent consequences, creating a physics-driven environment with its own rules. The gorgeous, lush backgrounds are brought to life by a haunting and restrained soundtrack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/feist", "videos": [{"id": 6784, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jOi2SNPoQHU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOi2SNPoQHU", "title": "Feist Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jOi2SNPoQHU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
