I just got done participating in the Unreal Engine 4 EpicMegaJam and this is an example of what playing my new game demo \"Down To Earth\" is like.. if you want to see it expanded and turned into a full game definitely leave a comment below! \nFind the game here:: https://luxireally.itch.io/down-to-earth\n\nThis was created for Windows 10, you might need to make sure DirectX is installed as well if a warning pops up. \n\nI made all the pixel art and models myself using Blender and Piskel, the soundtrack is also available on my bandcamp page here:: https://luximusic.bandcamp.com/album/down-to-earth-ep .. if you download the game the soundtrack that I also created within the game jam week using Ableton Live is included in a folder named \"MUSIC\" so definitely check that out.  \n\nThis was one of the most fun times I've had making a quick little jam game! Some of the textures are from the startup content that I modified and also a couple sound effects are from a royalty free website called soundbible. \n\nIf you want to see my other work check out http://www.luxireally.com or http://www.wickedalley.com\n\nThanks so much for playing / watching! xoxo", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S26M3hnDRn0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S26M3hnDRn0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S26M3hnDRn0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S26M3hnDRn0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S26M3hnDRn0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "// Down To Earth // UE4 EpicMegaJam Trailer", "description": "Hey Lovelies!
