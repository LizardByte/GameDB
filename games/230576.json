Taking place in a haunted mansion, players create rooms by laying out map pieces given to them by StreetPass-encountered players. Laying pieces of the same color together expands the room, sometimes revealing treasure chests that offer new weapons and items. The main task is to uncover the stairs to the next floor in order to progress. When entering a new room, the player may encounter an enemy, which they must face against using their equipped weapon, which uses rechargeable batteries to function. During battle, the player can either fire at the enemy, which uses one battery charge, or defend against the enemy's attack, which slowly drains the battery meter. Defeating enemies earns experience points which can power up the equipped weapon. There are various types of weapon, some of which are more effective against certain enemies. If the player runs out of health points, they will faint and their session will end.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-manor--1"}
