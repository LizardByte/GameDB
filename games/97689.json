It's the future and the world's so overpopulated that you have to live in the stacks, a big-ass pile of cars. Since there's nowhere for your generation to go, you all live in a virtual reality game called \"The Oasis\", where the limits of reality... Are the limits... Of your own imagination.\n\nIn the Oasis you will be able to see things from your wildest dreams. Characters from film and TV and video games crossing over in unexpected ways. Huge interstellar explosions. Massive-scale fights between Transformers and Godzilla... You name it. And maybe along the way... You will find romance."}
