Commonly ridiculed for its forward-swept wing design and jetsonian bubble cockpit, not one soul denies\nits pivotal role in the Battle of Yandori-11 that ultimately stopped the seemingly inevitable Interstellar Desegmentation. Fueled by dark matter amulite, the turbo encabulator propulsion and displacement system feeds surplus energy to the shield capacitor while still providing perfectly cromulent thrust. In a questionable choice of engineering, a valve between said capacitor and the quark cannon was installed. Opening of said valve results in unpredictable, rapid fire that quickly drains the shield system. Lack of operating shields results in absolute cabin depressurization and death. Also featured are a corduroy-lined dashboard and a cargo bay of extradimensional space accessible through a trunk sized hatch located on the underbelly. The intrepid Rudy has been rigorously tested, performing courier missions across the galaxy, surviving pirates, mercenaries, and ne\u2019er do wells throughout hostile space for the past 0.237 Terran life cycles.\n\nBy slim chance or providence, you found yourself emotionally entangled by egregious eyestalks.
