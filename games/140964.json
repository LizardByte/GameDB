A short lived drumming game series from Konami in their BEMANI franchise. The cabinet consists of 4 tom-tom drums in a row where one or two players play in time with falling objects in the screen.\n\nThe second game adds Drum rolls, a special Heat up combo mode (kinda like star power from the Guitar Hero franchise) and some special combination notes that needs to be hit simultaneously.\n\nThe game features a couples mode where notes are placed in such a way that you often end up hugging the other player (with one player playing the inner two drums while the other having the outer two drums), in this mode you are scored not only on how well you were doing, but your compatibility.\n\nThe game makes use of a kinect camera to show you drumming in the background of the game, as well as creating a collage of your performance that you can retrieve from the eAmuse app at the end of the game. The camera is also used for special gesture commands in some songs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mirai-dagakki-futuretomtom-ver-2"}
