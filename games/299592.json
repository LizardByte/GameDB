These creatures, each oddly shaped, jostle against each other to help solve puzzles together. When in trouble, shout \"HELP!\" and friends will surely come to your aid. With everyone's strength, turn friendships into friend-shapes!\n\nThe game's intuitive, straightforward controls mean that anyone can jump right in. You'll control creatures that are shaped differently as you progress through each level, to clear challenges. Although these creatures can move around freely, they cannot rotate, necessitating the need for teamwork to solve the puzzles. Join forces to overcome obstacles and reach your goals together!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/all-you-need-is-help", "videos": [{"id": 112478, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "5BAXsD-9Egk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BAXsD-9Egk", "title": "All You Need is Help Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BAXsD-9Egk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 127682, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6LBKxE6LkeQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LBKxE6LkeQ", "title": "All You Need Is Help - Trailer | TGS 2024", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6LBKxE6LkeQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
