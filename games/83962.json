As a storm approaches, Martha Madison: Waves challenges players to use the science of waves to rescue Martha\u2019s animal friends. Working as virtual scientists, players use a powerful machine to create transverse waves along ropes and longitudinal waves through water. They adjust the amplitude and manipulate the energy level to save Martha\u2019s friends. Martha Madison, meerkat scientist and student mentor, is on-hand to guide students as they embark on science-filled, problem-solving adventures that bring complex concepts to life."}
