Inspired by the hit TV show, it features the Hills and their neighbors in 20 different Fourth of July games and activities, such as Barbecue, which Hank Hill says is \"the only cooking that should be done by a man.\"", "summary": "Based on the FOX animation series of the same name, King of the Hill is about the Texan Hill family and their misadventures with their friends and neighbors. As a game, it's actually two unrelated games (install and run separately). One is a romp through the neighborhood with little \"parlor\" type games such as Tic-Tac-Toss, Scavenger Hunt, and more. The other is a cartoony imitation of Deer Hunter.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-of-the-hill"}
