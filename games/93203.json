Players navigate a simple grid, collecting dots while avoiding computer-controlled cars. The unique control scheme uses just two keys to shift lanes inward or outward, creating a challenging and fast-paced experience. With automatic movement and a focus on quick decision-making, Grid Run offers an addictive, high-score-chasing gameplay loop. Bonus cars are awarded every 10,000 points, adding to the game's replay value.\n\nPontoon offers a digital version of the popular card game, also known as Blackjack. Players aim to build a hand as close to 21 as possible without going over, competing against a computer dealer. The game features logical ace play by the computer and provides comprehensive on-screen result assessments, making it accessible for both newcomers and experienced players.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grid-run-and-pontoon"}
