Now you can challenge Facebook friends and opponents around the world to compete in in real-time matches! \n\n*HOW TO PLAY*\n\nGoal: Make the number 24 using all four numbers on the card! \n\nSolving: To solve cards simply tap on a number OR slide between two numbers and select the desired operation (+ \u2013 x \u00f7). You can add, subtract, multiply or divide. Each number can only be used once and yes, there is at least one solution to each card! Most cards have multiple solutions. \n\nDifficulties: There are three difficulty levels shown by dots in the corners of each card \u2014 1 Dot cards are easy, 2 Dot cards are medium and 3 Dot cards are tough! \n\nStrategies: Choose one number on the card and turn the other three into the numbers you need. For example: If you have a 4, try and make a 6, 20, 28 or 96.\nCommon Patterns that make 24: 6x4, 8x3, 12x2, 24x1. Don\u2019t just look at the numbers independently, but as two pairs. For example: On the card 8, 7, 5, 4. Add 7 + 5 to make 12 and 8 divided by 4 is 2, so 12 x 2 = 24. \n\n*FEATURES*\n\nMultiplayer: Compete against your Facebook friends or opponents around the world in head to head challenges! Solve the card faster to win that card and earn points. Whoever wins more points, wins that challenge! \n\nPoints: 1 dot cards are worth 1 point, 2 dot cards are 2 points, and 3 dots are 3 points.\n\nRewards: Climb the leaderboards, viewing your global rankings and how you match up with your friends!
