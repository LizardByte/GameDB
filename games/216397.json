Without hesitation, it took the first step in the human history and made the perilous jump.\n\nAfter the spacetime jump, SAT-V had a startling revelation: an unknown entity emerged from SAT-V\u2019s cerebral nexus and took the leading role of her virtual personalities. Providing little information about its origin, the entity gave SAT-V various tasks to reach the final destination, where humanity will be rewarded by supreme beings mentioned as Celestes.\n\nThus starts the Trail Of Celestes\u2026", "summary": "Timewell: Trail of Celestes is an old-school story-driven 3D space shooter RPG.
