One day, she received an urgent message from the Forest Fairy:\n\n\"Oh no! The annual Cherry Jubilee is tonight, but all the cherries have gone missing! Can you help?\"\n\nCherry Blossom gasped. The Cherry Jubilee was the most important celebration in Fruit Forest! Without cherries, there would be no cherry pies, cherry juice, or cherry decorations.\n\n\"Don't worry! I'll save the Jubilee!\" Cherry Blossom squeaked.\n\nShe dashed through the forest, her little pink paws pattering on the ground. She climbed trees, hopped over streams, and peeked under bushes. Everywhere she went, she found cherries and gently placed them in her basket.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Cherry Blossom raced back to the Fairy's clearing, her basket overflowing with juicy red cherries.\n\n\"You did it!\" cheered the Forest Fairy. \"The Cherry Jubilee is saved!\"\n\nThat night, Cherry Blossom danced under the stars, sipping cherry juice and feeling proud of her cherry-picking adventure.", "summary": "Cherry Jump is a 2D platformer where players race through levels, collecting cherries and aiming for the fastest completion time.
