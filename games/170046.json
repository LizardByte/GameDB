He is hoping to surprise her on their anniversary with a small present, but doesn\u2019t have anything to give to her yet. Help Kuma Bear find something nice to give to Cinnamon Bear, and a way to surprise her with it. Kuma Story was originally created as an anniversary gift from SpacePirateCaine to his girlfriend for their 3-year anniversary. She enjoyed it very much, and asked that it be continued, and shared with the rest of the world. Please note that what little text there is in the game is generally in Japanese. There is nothing specifically important written at any point as Kuma Story is intended to be a short, mostly textless adventure game, playable and accessible by anybody in any language.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}]}
