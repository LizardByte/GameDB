In this top down shooter the player is on an intense experimental form of LSD and as a result they must battle against hordes of nightmarish creatures in randomly generated roguelike adventures and arena style levels. Basically run around with an Uzi in each hand wildly spewing bullets in all directions. Fun for all the family! \n\nInfluenced by the colourful craziness of Hotline Miami, Overdosed takes those run and gun elements and ramps up the intensity as you scramble looking for cash piles, ammo and more drugs while defending yourself against many terrifying enemies.\nGamemodes\nADVENTURE \nThis is the main roguelike mode where the main goal is to progress through 5 randomly generated stages, each one with their own unique set of objectives to complete in order to progress. Every level will be different each time you play. Pickups like ammo/cash/drugs spawn at random locations which you must hunt for if you want to survive! \n\nOnce you die you go back to stage 1... however you can come back stronger! Adventure features a hub area where you can spend the cash you find on new weapons, permanent upgrades and ammo. So with each playthrough you will punch that little bit harder! \n\nAdventure also features bonus objectives which reward you for tasks like kicking enemies down a pit of death or defending a giant mound of coke. It\u2019s a risk/reward situation where you can make a quick buck or lose it all and perish under a horde of enemies. \n\nARENA \nAs you start with just Duel Uzi\u2019s and limited ammo, fight increasingly frantic waves of enemies and earn points to purchase additional weapons and gadgets within the level. There\u2019s no order of unlocks so you can play it your way and spend your points however you like. Each wave gets harder than the last with more enemy numbers and the introduction of new enemy types. \n\nFeatures Coming Soon:\n2 new adventures and arenas\nYeah, you read that right! We are planning on making this game 3 times bigger than it is now when we come out of early access. \n\nHAUNTED THEME: \nThis theme will resemble a haunted house where the furniture comes alive and attacks you. Imagine a bear skin rug suddenly leaping up and charging at you to rip your face off! Sounds delightful doesn\u2019t it? \n\nHOSPITAL THEME: \nJust a normal visit to the hospital really - fight through an eerie labyrinth of a hospital where the only occupants are hungry infected zombies. \n\nEach new theme will have their own set of enemy types with unique characteristics and abilities.\nBoss Battles\nThe conclusion to each adventure will feature a boss fight to test your skill to the metal!\nSteam Online Leaderboards\nA leaderboard system will be integrated for the arena stats so you can compare and compete with others around the globe to see who can reach the highest wave!\nFull controller support\nWhat\u2019s a twin stick shooter without the ability to use twin sticks!? An early access game that\u2019s what! We will be working on getting full controller support including the steam controller to work in gameplay and the menus.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p_h7XfIAN_8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p_h7XfIAN_8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p_h7XfIAN_8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p_h7XfIAN_8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p_h7XfIAN_8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Overdosed A Trip To Hell Gameplay PC HD [60FPS/1080p] [Early Access]", "description": "Overdosed A Trip To Hell Gameplay PC 1080p 60fps\nRoguelike, Shooter, Steam Early Access\nPlatform: PC Video Game\nDeveloper: Lazy Games Studio Ltd \nRelease Date: 2 Nov, 2015\nBuy on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/413830/\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/tr1ppa?sub_confirmation=1\n\nLet's Play Overdosed - A Trip To Hell\nOverdosed is a crazy fast paced, adrenaline fuelled trip to remember!
