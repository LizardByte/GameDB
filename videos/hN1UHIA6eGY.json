I had a previous video for this, but it lacked the case artwork.\n\nThese games differ slightly from other Game & Watch entries in that they don't have a Game A and Game B feature, but instead have just a single game mode.  This one I feel plays better than the Super Mario Bros. game, even if the platform structure of it makes it feel similar in design but with vertical movement.\n\nIt is believed that the Crystal Screen and New Wide Screen versions of these share the same MCU and ROM data, with only the case and screen being different.\n\nRecent work on Game & Watch emulation has come from Algestam, with earlier work being done by Sean Riddle and hap.
