Included in this pack are Rayman: Raving Rabbids, Raving Rabbids 2, and Raving Rabbids TV Party.\n\nAll three games in the collection have a simple plot line of Rayman either imprisoned or escaping the Rabbids, silly looking rabbit creatures. The first game starts off with Rayman being kidnapped while at a picnic and Rabbids have him endure many types of tests that the player must complete in order for him to be set free. The next game features Rayman entering a mall trying to attack the angry Rabbids that have captured him in the previous game. In TV Party, he is running away from the Rabbids and discovers that a bolt of lightning has transferred the Rabbids into a TV set, which is the premise for the mini games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/raving-rabbids-party-collection"}
