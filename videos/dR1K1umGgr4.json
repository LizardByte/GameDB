It is a Beta Disk version and SCL and TRD files can be downloaded here: https://vtrd.in/release.php?r=e8fc175b57074a267d6766c2eb433ee4\n\nThis game is a high score game that goes on and on forever without ending. The walkthrough ends after a successfull transfer and delivery of the cargo.\n\nTHE GAME:\nWhy and when are two unanswered questions but the story tells that an \u201cinsane alien power\u201d is attacking Earth and exhausting its most precious resources in the process. Earth's capacities to defend itself from the menacing force are becoming dangerously low.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, as soon as these malevolent entities became aware that there could be hope from the outside capable of restoring Earth's vital resources, they mounted a heavy blockade around the planet to impend anything from getting in or out.\n\nThat's when an heroic team of hardened space-traders mindful of the great danger their home planet was facing, decides against all odds, to run through the blockade to deliver the necessary supplies capable of driving off the invading aliens and sustain Earth's survival.\n\nMany dangers will lie ahead inside this heavily armoured blockade and this won't be an easy task. The game begins with the player commanding the space-traders blockade runners. The first obstacle he'll face during his blockade journey will be a meteor storm planted by the aliens.\n\nBlockade Runner's ZX Spectrum version is significantly different from the other ported versions, mainly because it will use a 2D environment instead of a 3D. It's a side-scrolling Sci-Fi shooting game with traditional arcade key elements with the ultimate goal to make contact with a Terran blockade runner and successfully transfer the cargo.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dR1K1umGgr4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dR1K1umGgr4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dR1K1umGgr4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dR1K1umGgr4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Blockade Runner (1983 / 128k AY Music Version) Walkthrough, ZX Spectrum", "description": "Huge playlist archive with AY / GFX improved games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxOanVBhqd3t74YnYAJA9p4vMQYZYCJWX\nUpdated 128k AY music version made by Lone Wolf.
