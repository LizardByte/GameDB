He is determined to escape, but not without Linda, a gang member with whom he has fallen in love during his abduction. Then he begins to search the hotel to find her, but something terrible is waiting for him in the shadows. His prison will soon become his nightmare.", "summary": "Canceled sequel to the 2012 Adventure-Horror game 'Anna.' White Heaven was to take place in an abandoned hotel nestled in the Italian Alps, eponymously titled White Heaven. Its narrative focuses on a kidnapped victim escaping his captivity after having fallen in love with one of his captors. The game was to follow three playable characters while continuing to explore the backstory of its predecessor rather than serving as a direct continuation. Early footage showcased chase sequences, which weren't attempted in the developer's previous work. The game was announced in 2013 and was being created in Unreal Engine 4 with an additional extension to aid with dynamic lighting. In 2020, its developers announced a cancelation of this iteration of the game, as they felt it to be \"too much, too soon\" in terms of the story they were attempting to tell.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/white-heaven", "videos": [{"id": 130071, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "isQOtSZfLkQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isQOtSZfLkQ", "title": "White Heaven - Canceled Game Trailer, Preserved (READ DESCRIPTION)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/isQOtSZfLkQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
