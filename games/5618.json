Wrath of the Dead Rabbit has several zones with different visual styles, including \"haunted caves, science labs, casinos and spaceships full of talking animals\". The player navigates these zones by traveling on a large buzz-saw-like circular blade that can cut through the environment, can fire a variety of projectile weapons, and is equipped with a jetpack. Ash is assisted in his quest by his butler, Nestor, a top hat-wearing Octopus.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hell-yeah-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit", "videos": [{"id": 32350, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p9hS3Ay-5Vk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9hS3Ay-5Vk", "title": "Hell Yeah!
