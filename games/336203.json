Eventually, the human race discovered these lands and began to settle down.\nFor a long time humans coexisted with the deities, some humans even learnt from them how to manipulate mana and the elements. This was how humans were initiated into magic.\n\nSeeking for more power, the greedy humanity tricked the deities and trapped them to take possession of their power. To prevent others from having access to the deities, temples and other constructions were built to conceal the sealed traps.\n\nBlinded by selfishness, the humans that learnt how to control mana and the elements did not pass on their knowledge to the next generations, leaving the once-shared wisdom confined to dusty tomes.\n\nAs more centuries elapsed, human civilization continued expanding across the lands of Lumeria, destroying nature and broadening their territories. During this period, deities remained calm, and patiently awaited the day that the sealed traps would be somehow broken.\n\nThe foolish humans, unaware of the sealed traps placed beneath the temples built by their ancestors, tore them down, unleashing the wrath of the deities that had been patiently waiting for this unavoidable event.", "summary": "Clash of Adventurers is an Open World MMORPG developed by Devsland Soft, a studio incorporated to bring this project alive.\n\nThe first Saga of Clash of Adventurers: 'Arrival of the Adventurers' is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 as Free To Play for PC Windows O.S.\n\nElemental forces attempt to take over the lands of Lumeria, you will take part as an Adventurer to restore the order and prevent the wild creatures from erasing the Human Race. As an adventurer you will be able to explore freely the lands of Lumeria and forge your own destiny, the only boundaries are your skills and abilities to survive in the wild. Collaboration and coordination are key values, playing the role of an Attacker, Defender or Support you will have to join other Adventurers to complete Quests, unlock Achievements, defeat the fantastic creatures unleashed in Lumeria, and perhaps engage in battle against other Adventurers, much just like yourself, are shaping their own fate.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clash-of-adventurers", "videos": [{"id": 144054, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "-b8jfxW_-xE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b8jfxW_-xE", "title": "Clash of Adventurers - First Look, Progress and Team Reveal", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-b8jfxW_-xE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
