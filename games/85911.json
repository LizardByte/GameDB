Most of the time the body easily repels these marauders, but just occasionally a stronger - mutant -\nstrain of virus appears putting the body's own defences under threat of being overwhelmed. When this happens we use artificial mechanisms to protect the body and Vaxine puts you in control of the newest devices.\n\nThe invading cells appear and gradually bond together until they are strong enough to attack certain key body cells. If the invaders are not eliminated before they latch onto these calls, they will not only destroy them but also use the constituent parts to make more of them-selves. If all of these key body cells were to be destroyed, life could no longer be supported, and - inevitably - the game would be over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vaxine"}
