Player and enemy sprites are also drawn in a noticeably more detailed way and have a higher resolution.\n\nHowever, the side-scrolling exploration environments retain the original look, with \"retro\" graphics reminiscent of the older original game.\n\nFor the most part, the location layout in this remake are the same as in the original version, and the gameplay remains largely unchanged as well.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/revival-xanadu", "collections": [{"id": 1463, "name": "Xanadu"}]}
