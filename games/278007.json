Its current history of human habitation stretches back 12,000 years. Its history begins with the first humans arriving there shortly after the collapse of the Earth System. It has no star and orbits a network of primordial black holes that are hidden behind Melas. Such exotic physics are a cause of strange phenomena seen around its collection of worlds.\n\nWhen humans arrived in the Genesis system there were 2000 years of darkness. Since the Fall of the Earth System there had been an absence of recorded history. Pre-dynastic records speak of legends about \u201cThe Watchers\u201d bringing humans lost in space to this system after earths demise. Melas has and always will be the pivotal point of control in the home system due to its use as a power source. Before the fall of Old Nautilus the home system was a type II civilization. Mitra and Gelida thrived as blue and green marbles in the times of Old Nautilus. Things would change with the Nautilid-Chaldenic Wars. When Nautilus collapsed the Genesis system was downgraded to a type I civilization. Many worlds suffered irreparable damage to their atmospheres and ecosystems.", "summary": "DEEPSPACE is an innovative Web3 strategy exploration MMO set in an expansive space environment.
