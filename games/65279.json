By overtaking other racers (which partially have a bit of an unconventional driving style, which does not make it easier) without causing a crash, points are added to your account (1000 points per 10 cars). If you reach more than 20.000 points before the time has run out, you receive further time units and you can go on driving. Next to the normal track you need to master driving on ice, in curves, at night and on motorways. If you crash you need to drive into the mobile garage (PIT), which is at the left roadside, which costs you valuable seconds. Additionally the number of cars overtaken until now is set to zero.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/le-mans--1", "videos": [{"id": 87585, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7at-bpfidhk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7at-bpfidhk", "title": "C64 Gamevideo 03 - LeMans", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7at-bpfidhk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
