For one week, August 1-7, referred to as \u201cdeath week,\u201d teenagers mysteriously disappear. City officials have long ago given up on the mystery and are simply closing missing persons cases, advising residents to stock up on essential supplies and not to leave their homes. But even such measures don't save the day, and more people go missing every year. Is a serial killer, who has passed his craft from generation to generation, to blame for these terrible disappearances, or ... or ... Is it a curse?\n\nThe protagonist is John, a diligent senior year student with a passion for video blogging. On August 1, 2017, exactly one month before his coming of age, a new \u201cweek of death\u201d arrives. The townspeople are busy going about their business and seem to have already forgotten about the curse, but John receives a tempting offer from his friend Will: to explore the long-abandoned house of a deceased old lady who once instilled terror in all the residents.", "summary": "In a remote provincial town, teenagers mysteriously disappear every 25 years.
