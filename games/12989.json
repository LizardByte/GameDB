Players control Dan as he boards the Anastasia ship, which is promptly attacked by the hostile Treen aliens. Armed with a laser, Dan must race against time to locate and disarm a planetary destruction device. The game involves exploring the ship, battling Treens, and strategically transporting five crucial components to the control room for diffusion. Dan can only carry one part at a time, adding to the challenge. If captured, he's imprisoned but can escape, though this disorients his progress. The game balances combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving as Dan fights to save Earth from the Treen threat, culminating in a final escape to the surface.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dan-dare-pilot-of-the-future", "collections": [{"id": 1711, "name": "Dan Dare"}]}
