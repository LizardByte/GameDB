Seriously! Unless you're really skilled with solving the Rubik's cube, expect a serious challenge.\n\nThe basic puzzle has over a million of different configurations and only one of them is the right one.\n\nA note for cubers:\n\nThe difficulty range is somewhere between the Pyraminx and the classic Rubik's cube for the basic puzzle, eclidus mini should be at the Pyraminx level and eclidus prime should be closer to the classic Rubik's cube but still a bit easier.\n\nWe hope you'll enjoy them!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eclidus", "videos": [{"id": 62990, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ngzO8qJEEAk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngzO8qJEEAk", "title": "Eclidus [Game Trailer]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngzO8qJEEAk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
