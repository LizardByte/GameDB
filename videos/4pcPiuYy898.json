And it was a bit rough for me personally. Whilst playing I ran into so many bugs that I was about to rage quit. But then i had that perfect run that helped me finish this boss.\n\nWhile fighting the bugs I ran into are:\n\n1) If you do too many parries or backstabs, you will run into a fatal error, and the game will crash.\n\n2) When the boss tries to do projectiles the fps drops hard,\n\n3) hitboxes are non-existent at times (You can see this in the end where the boss and I can't land hits.\n\n4) When you just and if you land on the boss, you will get launched several feet into the air\n\n5) Weird parries where the boss gets parried but instantly recovers and murders you.\n\n6) non-existent sound effects at times. The audio in the beta is frigging crazy at times.\n\nThere were a few more, but hey atleast it's over now.\n\nThe main thing the developers need to focus on is to polish the game. The game screams a lack of polish for the main gameplay elements. Other than that the scope is there and it can be fun when it works.\n\nHopefully things get fixed.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**Note - Thanks to Laureline of Redlock Studios for providing me the game.\n\n#Shattered #ShatteredBeta #Gameplay\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nContact Info:\n\nDiscord - The Hunter's Dream - https://discord.gg/AXyF5gV\nTwitch - rubhen925 - https://www.twitch.tv/rubhen925\nStreamlabs Donations - https://streamlabs.com/rmchiva925\nPaypal - rmchiva925@gmail.com\nPSN - rubhen925 - https://psnprofiles.com/rubhen925\nSteam - rubhen925\nTwitter - @raijumc - https://twitter.com/raijumc\nInstagram - rubhen925 - https://www.instagram.com/rubhen925/\nSnapchat - rubhen925\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nLike, Rate, Share, & Subscribe to stay tuned to more new game walkthroughs and game content :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4pcPiuYy898/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4pcPiuYy898/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4pcPiuYy898/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4pcPiuYy898/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4pcPiuYy898/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SHATTERED: TALE OF THE FORGOTTEN KING - The Stranger Boss Fight (Beta)", "description": "This is the first boss I ran into in the beta.
