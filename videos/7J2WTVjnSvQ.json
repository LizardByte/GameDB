In order to differentiate most refer to the original as King's Field Japan. \n\nThe game is essentially Ultima Underworld/Elder Scrolls, but specifically designed for consoles. As such, the UI is drastically simplified to focus mainly on the in-game action. This allows a sense of immersion that is different from the other titles, especially considering the limitations of the PlayStation that required short draw distances and the limited polygons provides an eerie, brooding tone. The music enhances this feeling, which is what I love about it.\n\nThis is a rip from my actual copy of the game, so the title is in Japanese. However, if you would like to play the game in English, there is a fan translation available. I would recommend checking it out if you're a fan of old-school RPGs.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7J2WTVjnSvQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7J2WTVjnSvQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7J2WTVjnSvQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "King's Field (1994/Japan) Gameplay - PlayStation", "description": "Ahh, King's Field.
