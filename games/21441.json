High-speed battles unfold as drivers enter all kinds of races, seeking to test themselves. Striving for the top, racers battle one another day after day.\n\nAt night, the dark side of the Circuit emerges: a private world known only to racers, where \"Survival of the Fittest\" is the only rule. Gossip leads to rumors, and rumors grow into the stiff of legend...\n\nOne such legendary racer once existed. He was called the Emotional King, a veritable god in the Kaido World. However, they say that he suddenly vanished after a race in Aso...\n\nWith the Emotional King gone from the Kaido night scene, two dominant figures emerged: Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit.\n\nThey came from Category Races and were already \"legitimate\" racers. These 2 are now rumored to be the best that Kaido has to offer.\n\nThen a legendary metropolitan team, The Thirteen Devils, apparently took it upon themselves to stem the flow of metropolitan racers crossing over into Kaido.\n\nCan anyone defeat the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit?\n\nWhat has become of the Emotional King?\n\nHas the Kaido Circuit really been overrun by the Thirteen Devils?\n\nAnd where is the next legendary racer?\n\nAs the battle begins, a team has been formed to fight against the 13 Devils: Kingdom Twelve, whom their leader's real identity is mysterious.\n\nIn the meantime, all Slashers (Stage 1 : MMC Ooaza and World Supremacy, Stage 2 : Haruna Guardian, Lonely Wanderer and Metal Wizard, Stage 3 : Final Leg, New Moon and Global Winner) and the double aces Yeti Fang and Murder Supremacy are preparing themselves as the 13 Devils may eventually challenge them.\n\nWhile everyone is ready, the player arrives and defeats every Slashers who ask if he/she would join them against the 13 Devils. Meanwhile, after Global Winner's defeat, Kyoichi Imaizumi (Yeti Fang) and Tastu Zoshigaya (Supremacy Murder), described as 2 witnesses of the last battle, discuss about that battle :\n\n\"What did you think of that battle?\"\n\n\"Hmm... He races rough, but still fast. He's obviously not from the racing circuit...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I agree. He came here on his own, and he's out to battle us now. We've got nowhere left to run. All we can do now is accept his challenge.\"\n\n\"Fine. I'll make it perfectly clear who the better racer is. My technique is tempered by experience, it's unbeatable. What I want to know is, where did he come from..?\"\n\nThen, both the Kingdom Twelve and the Thirteen Devils are being defeated one by one. Meanwhile, a person begins to doubt about the Kingdom's objective as it seems that the leaders are strangely friendly. Furthermore, after the player defeats Timber Slash, the identity of Kingdom Twelve's leader is revealed by her: Hamagaki, the former Emotional King, AKA Kaido President. Apparently, he lost against Kokami just before Zoshigaya beat him.\n\nAs both the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit were defeated, a new course has been opened : Hokkaido, where only the best drivers are there. By reading the messages, the player can see that the 13 Devils' leader is here : Motoya Iwasaki, AKA Speed King, and some legend drivers are here, such as God Shift Bunta, the High Empress (former Lovers' leader) and someone who drives a black and red Lancer Evolution III but no one can remember his identity.\n\nWhen the Empress is defeated, the real goal of the Kingdom Twelve is revealed by her as she was recruited by Hamagaki, but declined his offer : \"Kingdom Twelve's ostensible goal is to get all the Tokyo racers and all the highway racers under their thumb. Then, once they've conquered the highways, they'll transform into the ultimate rally team and make a new start\", meaning that Hamagaki wants to build his own \"racing utopia\".\n\nAs Kaido President and Speed King are defeated, the black and red Lancer Evolution III is revealed to be the long lost Emotional King : Taiju Kokami, who wanted to make a fresh start as Emotional King. After his defeat, a new team shows up after the great battle : Revival Of Sodom, lead by Zaiga Koshigaya, who appears to have known Kokami for a long time as he was his friend. Even though Zoshigaya is one of the best drivers, he lost to them, so everyone asked if the player can do something about them as the new legendary racer.", "summary": "The mountains of Japan are calling - and so are your racing rivals.
