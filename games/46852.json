The seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eighth rounds are also \"bonus rounds\", where you have to destroy all the bricks in the formation within a preset time limit (unless all your balls go out of play); the thirty-third and final round is also a \"boss round\", where you are up against \"Burida\" (who is protected by a metal wall with a vulnerable spot on its top side, but does not attack by spitting lethal mirrors like Doh did to both Vaus in Arkanoid and the human Bubblun & Bobblun in Rainbow Islands). Once you have hit that vulnerable spot on the top side of the wall five times, it will leave Burida vulnerable - and once you have hit him, you will receive 100000 points for every life you have left and the game will be over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quester"}
