(Lime - Aurora)", "description": "This video was actually finished a few days ago, but it has only gone out of drafts and it took so long because I have no idea what to write for the title! It's half of the number of keys from my last video, but the title of both songs are very similar LOL\n\nApparently, the difficulty of this chart is \u260612+(\u96e3), which is the second-highest one for 9k! The highest is \u260612+(\u8d85\u96e3). I'm not exactly sure yet why they decided to name the difficulty after \u260612 like this though! \u260612+(\u8d85\u96e3) I think is quite a step up in difficulty, but then again there are only 3 charts in this difficulty, 2 for 9B and 1 for 9A! Oh right, I should explain the difference between the two keymodes! \n\n9B is basically static 9 keys while 9A is kind of like the top rows of Danoni's 15k keymodes! The keybind for 9B on default is asdf space jkl; , which is what I am using in this video! I might make a video of 9Ak soon, so that is why I decided to include the keyboard overlay in this video even though it's static gameplay! I'm still not exactly sure if this is the best place to put the overlay though!\n\nOf course, this channel is still mainly for 10 or more keys rhythm gaming, because those are the ones that I love the most, but I'll make videos of lower ones occasionally! Actually, I might be streaming myself playing lower keymodes danoni in like two days from now! I have been neglecting them for a while now, and I am kind of curious as to what difficulty level I'm in for each keymode! I did try some of them and I kind of figured out where I stand on each keymode, but I might improve during streaming! My twitch account is here, but I might try to stream with youtube's streaming service as well, as in, I'm going to stream on both platforms! That's possible, right? Oh, there are already archives of past streams on the channel as well, so you can take a peek at how the stream will look like (yes it's ms paint layout)\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/deskurisu\n\nAnyways, please try out 10+ keymodes someday! Or else.\n\nShorts ver: https://youtube.com/shorts/IEpsTpm8Z1w\n\n#danoni\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nSong: Lime - Aurora\nSong Source: BMS\nMaker: \u3059\u305a\u3081\nChart Link: https://suzume.kirara.st/aurora/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6WAJQ9TvWg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6WAJQ9TvWg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6WAJQ9TvWg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6WAJQ9TvWg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "[9Bk Danoni] What's My Actual Skill In 9k?
