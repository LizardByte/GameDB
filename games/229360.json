These are not 'games' in the strict sense of the word, but digitally animated stories, rendered in real-time by the graphic engine, which can be influenced by the viewer at certain points in the story line.\n\nAfter the events in the previous episode, the alien ship has started moving slowly towards the surface, gradually destroying the Ganymede colony in the process. The team has no choice but to go into the alien vessel and find a way to stop this.\n\nTo add to the predicament, Green, the base sheriff, who is now alone but still at large, is moving to make sure that if he doesn't make it out alive no- one else will either.\n\nOur heroes split up into small teams to foil Green's sabotage plan and save the base. Many dangers await along the way and not everyone might live to see another day, but if they do, they'll make sure to get some... payback!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gravity-angels-part-3-payback"}
