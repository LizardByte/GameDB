Not long after, that revolution in technology gave birth to a brand new sport, Flying Circus, which used the shoes to make players compete in the open sky.\n\nMasaya Hinata, who was once considered a prodigy, turned his back on Flying Circus after suffering a crushing defeat, although there was also another reason...\n\nHowever, his former passion is reignited while teaching the new transfer student, Asuka Kurashina, how to fly.\n\nThis time, Masaya chooses to enter the world of Flying Circus not as a player, but a coach. Sometimes fighting, and at other times encouraging each other, he and his team decide to challenge the top student athletes in Japan.\n\nNow, with Asuka by his side, how high will he be able to fly?\n\nThis is a love story about those who met through the sky, as well as the friends who surround them.", "summary": "Aokana: Four Rhythm Across the Blue is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Masaya Hinata.

Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. The game follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aokana-four-rhythms-across-the-blue", "videos": [{"id": 34178, "name": "PS4 Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "Ee3DjoYJvQA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee3DjoYJvQA", "title": "Aokana - Four Rhythms Across the Blue - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ee3DjoYJvQA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 34393, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "c74D_ug--K4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c74D_ug--K4", "title": "Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm - Opening [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c74D_ug--K4/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6038, "name": "Aokana"}]}
