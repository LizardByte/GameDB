Yet, truthfully, it feels more like a lackluster Route 16 knock-off. \nThe primary issue lies in the unpredictably lethal passages\u2014no chance to know the safe path, leading to inevitable lives lost in trial and error. This disheartens, making you strive to at least conquer the initial loop to end the gameplay.\n\nIt's regrettable because I adore Route 16, and the prospect of essentially playing it with the addition of Doraemon was thrilling. However, the incessant loss of lives due to uncontrollable randomness breeds immense frustration. Sure, the take-copter aids in salvaging some lives and slightly improves looping chances, but that's the extent of it. It's not about competitive play; it's about sheer survival until it's no longer feasible.\n\nOn the surface, the game offers three difficulty levels. The hardest (this one) features four fast mice as adversaries, but again, not enough to pose a threat, at least not in the first loop. As mentioned, the core issue lies elsewhere.\n\n#retrogamingloft #doraemon #arcadia2001", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcq13xOsPiI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcq13xOsPiI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcq13xOsPiI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcq13xOsPiI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcq13xOsPiI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Doraemon Longplay (Emerson Arcadia 2001 Game) - Level: 3 (hardest) - Warning: Flashing Lights!", "description": "- Doraemon Longplay (Emerson Arcadia 2001 Game) - Level: 3 (hardest) -\n\nThe game prides itself on being the inaugural Doraemon title for a home system.
