You are trapped in Nightmare Park, and must find an escape before you can race the Ghost Rider. \n \nThe park is made up of four linked levels of road, which you can move up and down at by finding a ramp headed in that direction and moving the joystick in that direction. Standard direction changes on each piece of road must also be navigated. \n \nThere are many creatures to avoid or jump over - mutant kangaroos and hedgehogs for starters. Standard hazards such as ramps and school buses are dealt with by pulling a wheelie - in this case, jumping at the last possible moment while at top speed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wheelie"}
