It's a person who is daydreaming all day and thinks the dream is pretty good. \n \nFor me, the game is my second life.... \n \nI play all kinds of games, but I'm always annoyed by the wonderful stories of some works, and I get angry even when I'm unhappy,Then in order to vent their anger began to deliberately play games, while facing the NPC and cruel scourge while thinking about if the story is my own to do good..... \n \nOriginally, I have lived such a life without doubt for myself until..... \n \nOne day I had a dream. I had a very sad love story. It was only a dream, but I felt very sad. \n \nSo I remembered the dream and thought it was a love story of the world..... \n \nBut when I saw the story again, I found that it couldn't be any more common, and why was it that I was so unhappy and annoyed?! I don't understand... \n \nAfter that, it took root in my heart like a seed. The longer it grew, the more I grew unhappy...... \n \nThen I found that I regret only exist in my actor dream, when I woke up I'll no longer be a hero, so this love story will become intense darkness without light in my eyes. \n \nHaving understood all this, I began to hate myself for being so unhappy and hating myself as a keyboard player. \n \nFinally, I opened the software, made this little game to taunt myself, and wanted it to stay on the platform that the player knew all the time,That way I can think of all this humiliation and live a happier life.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/this-is-not-rpg"}
