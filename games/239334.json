To overcome various obstacles, players need to rotate the barrel and jump from side to side, which requires a lot of skill and experience because it can slip on the move.\n\nJump Barrel, an easy-to-learn control, is an accessible game, but it requires delicate skills to escape. I highly recommend it to challenging platform game fans.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jump-barrel"}
