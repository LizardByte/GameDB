His new project, code named \"Alpha-152\", is the result of the ultimate evolution of hyper-cloning technology, birthed from a DNA sample of Kasumi.\n\nThe main storyline continues with the war between the Doatec and the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan. After Ayane successfully defeats Doatec's last creation, Omega, Hayate returned to the Mugen Tenshin clan, taking over the leadership. Now leader, his heart burns with the desire of revenge as he goes on a quest to put an end to Doatec. During the fourth tournament, Hayate brought together the most powerful group of Ninjas known to man. He is accompanied by Ayane, Ryu Hayabusa, and other members of the Mugen Tenshin clan; Kasumi, though reluctant, is dragged into the events herself as she follows her brother.", "summary": "Dead or Alive 4 is a fighting game and the fourth major title in the Dead or Alive video game series, its plot following the events of the 2001 title Dead or Alive 3. Dead or Alive 4 features 22 playable characters and many multi-tiered and interactive fighting arenas. DOA4 has a number of updates in reference to previous titles. Characters' move lists have been vastly updated and four new characters have been added to the fighting roster, with returns from a couple of past characters as well. The counter system has been tightened, making the window for counters shorter and more difficult to execute, and the amount of damage that counters inflict has been changed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-or-alive-4", "videos": [{"id": 64302, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NzSgf28U56U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzSgf28U56U", "title": "Dead or Alive 4 Trailer [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NzSgf28U56U/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119107, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "scLGf2EMbFs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scLGf2EMbFs", "title": "Dead or Alive 4 E3 2005 Xbox 360 Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scLGf2EMbFs/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 295, "name": "Dead or Alive"}]}
