This is much easier than you may think as Selvaria has access to the games two most useful orders, Defense Boost and All Units Defend. These orders make it so even engineer Johann will be able to absorb interception fire and makes Selvaria strong enough to run headlong into walls of defending shocktroopers and heavy gatlings.\n\nCompleting all main missions with an A/S allows the player access to the 4th and final bonus mission, in which it is possible to play as Selvaria in her Valkyria form.", "summary": "Unveil an engaging new chapter in the critically acclaimed tactical RPG, Valkyria Chronicles, with an exciting expansion pack!
