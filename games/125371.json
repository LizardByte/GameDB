Using the precious few resources still available, you can build more advanced firepower into your mining craft to turn it into an awesome fighting machine. 5 detailed levels to explore with multiple enemies and terrain, many puzzles to solve and quests to conquer, modular and upgradeable ships.\"", "summary": "Dark Orbit  is an action/role-playing game where you pilot your mining ship through the wind-swept canyons of the tenth planet, Nibiru. An ancient alien species is awakening from deep inside the core, and their numbers are growing by the hour! Your primary goal is simple -- get off the planet alive.\n\nTo do this, you will need to use your brain as well as your brawn. There are wrecks out on the surface... hulks of technology that might help you in your grim journey. The planet is also littered with Malidium, a mysterious compound that can be formed into almost any molecular structure.\n\nBy collecting Malidium, and scanning in the patterns from salvaged ships, engines and weapons, you can build new items with the Matrix Formers back at your base. You will need every bit of help you can get to escape the Legion of Abaddon!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-orbit"}
