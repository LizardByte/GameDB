The great Dark Majesty is missing from their throne, and the feverish Conclave demands a replacement declared.\n\nAs a powerful fallen Archfiend, sinister overlord of the Infernal Kingdom of Hell, you are a contender during the Great Trial of the Throne. Command your dread legions, order your praetors, cast sinister rituals, and outplay your rivals to become Hell\u2019s new Dark Majesty.\n\nUNRELENTING STRATEGY \n\nIn your path to victory stands the hellish red tape of Pandaemonium, Hell\u2019s capital, strict codes and laws that govern and control the Fallen. This isn\u2019t your standard strategy game: in Hell, you also must wage war through bureaucracy. You\u2019ll need to navigate the Conclave\u2019s labyrinthine political systems, rife with betrayal, bluffing and deceit, in order to realise your plans.\n\nSolium Infernum is a simultaneous turn-based strategy game for up to six players that will test the limits of your strategy, cunning and political acumen.
