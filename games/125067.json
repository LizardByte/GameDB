You must quickly dodge Titan's frenetic attacks while firing accurate shots at his weak spots. \n \nThe primal gods were forgotten by humans. But now they have returned to collect thousands of sacrifices. In this post apocalyptic fantasy world, all the remaining humans are children or teenagers, as no one else lives for long.

And only courage can bring peace.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/giant-slayers"}
