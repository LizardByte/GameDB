The region in question was southwest North America, specifically the northwest quadrant of New Mexico.\n\nSatellite reconnaisance noticed objects spontaneously appearing on the desert sands in periodic intervals of 10.67 hours. The first object was a 1961 Buick Oldsmobile. It was hastily whisked away by Black Mesa technicians soon after its appearance. The vehicle was later followed by a striped basketball, a portable oven grill, and a small brown kitten (most likely a Calico).\n\nTrans-teleportation was a hot-button topic during World War II, culminating in the bittersweet Philadelphia/Norfolk incident and the lesser-known Wilmington/Atlantis dilemma. The research being conducted at Black Mesa was highly illegal and scientifically dubious. But, not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, a decision was made to preserve Black Mesa and extract prime scientists.\n\nThe call was made for base infiltration and the \u201cexfiltration\u201d of one key scientist named G. Freeman. A marine squadron stationed in Wisconsin answered the call.", "summary": "\u201cBootleg Squadrog, sir. It is not about individualism. It is not about cowboy heroism.
