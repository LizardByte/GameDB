It was more of an RPG than a Strategy game. Players chose one of six heroes at the beginning, and there was a cost to change the hero. Players also equipped a main and reserve army; if a troop died the troop in the reserve would take over. Players clicked to walk, which depleted energy, and all events on their way were mandatory, except for vs PvP. During the battles players had no control, instead all troops including the hero attacked automatically until all troops on one side died, or the battle timed out (which the timer was not displayed).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/epic-war-legends", "videos": [{"id": 83187, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "G_qLdkepmUg"}]}
