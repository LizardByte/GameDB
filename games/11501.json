The main protagonist of Mugen Souls, Chou-Chou, plans to conquer the universe by subjugating the seven worlds it comprises, as she thinks the planets look pretty. Gameplay revolves around exploration and turn-based, open-field combat, and the game also includes mini games and customization. Due to the questionable nature of the game's portrayal of child protagonists, certain aspects of the western release have been edited and some mini-games have been disabled.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mugen-souls"}
