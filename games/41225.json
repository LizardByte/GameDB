The player controls the 12 checkers at the bottom of the screen and attempts to remove the 12 checkers at the top of the screen, controlled by the computer. A player can only move his checkers diagonally toward his opponent's side of the board. A checker can be jumped when two opposing checkers are adjacent to each other and there is an empty space directly across the checker being jumped. If there's a checker in the board that a player can jump, he is forced to do so. If a checker reaches the other side of the board, that checker is kinged and is allowed to move and jump both back and forth in diagonal movements. The game is won by the player who removes all of his opponent's checkers from the board.", "videos": [{"id": 16087, "name": "VR", "video_id": "yyKvn8U4kp4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyKvn8U4kp4", "title": "The Channel F Files VideoCart 19 Checkers Gameplay!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yyKvn8U4kp4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
