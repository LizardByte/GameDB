Scared to death while sleeping this year, too! Some meteor-thingy crashed into a mine nearby, and two Toads want me to check it out for 'em. I bring the meteor home, hoping I can get a bunch of hamburgers for it. But without me knowing it, it absorbs my DNA! And in the night, it creates a shadow clone of me! Luckily, the two stupid Toads are out for a walk when they see this shadow-me. They overhear his plans, and finds out he calls himself for Wirio (how original), and that he is going to return to his own world and prepare to lay our world in shadows. Oh, and that he has 5 shadow-generators or something that will protect him. And after hearing this the next morning, the Toads want me to go into Wirio's world and stop him, blablabla. The only reason I go, is because of treasure...and to stop that thief who stole my good looking face!\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-wario-and-the-world-of-wirio", "videos": [{"id": 94632, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "aWph-oOG1yM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWph-oOG1yM", "title": "Super Wario & The World Of Wirio | NEW WARIO ADVENTURE!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aWph-oOG1yM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
