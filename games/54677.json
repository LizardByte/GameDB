Her only escape is her sketchbook and paintings in which she draws and paints to deal with life challenges. She is struggling to find inner peace with what has happened through her life. Her paintings of life changing incidents are both drawn from logical perspective of Mr. Ruppel or the chaotic view of Ms. Schmidt and you have to help her find the balance between these ever-conflicting feelings. Each scene and level tells a part of Lona's life story and the way she tries to deal with real life difficulties. You have to solve puzzles and use items important to her to try and bring her peace of mind.\n\nLona's story will be narrated in a non linear fashion with no dialogues and conventional narration methods.
