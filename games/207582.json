Every critter has their own story and predicament. Can you find a creature who might have a use for your twig? If so, they might be willing to trade with you for something better.\n\nBy making the right series of trades, you can help many of the woods' creatures, and find the key to getting Georgia back in the process.", "summary": "Your dog has been kidnapped by a lonely ghost!
