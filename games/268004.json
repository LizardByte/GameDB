However, the player soon hears news over the radio of 'strange atmospheric phenomena', and his car crashes into a lake after being hit by a lightning bolt. He escapes the lake and arrives at a mortuary chapel from a maze of catacombs. Here, he discovers the zombies attacking the town. He moves on, passing through a swamp and a volcanic rift called Devil's Rift, gaining weapons and encountering zombified policemen that are still smart enough to handle firearms. He gets to the town by commandeering a train. At the town, he manages to reach the radio station seen in the intro and call the state police for help. The state police tell him to wait for them at the police station. There, it turns out to be a trap, and he is captured by the undead sheriff Chester Rockwood, who puts him in a prison cell. Trapped, the episode ends with a zombie approaching his cell door to eat him.", "summary": "The first part of a horror oriented total conversion mod for Half-Life made as a promotional game for PC Gamer.\nAfter a nasty car crash, you search for help only to find that monsters have taken over the area. you have to run and fight through graveyards, sewers, a swamp and even a volcano all in an effort to make it to the radio station in order to call for help.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/they-hunger-episode-1"}
