Your girlfriend has been kidnapped by the moon men, and the only way to get her back is to eat all the fruit out of 45 crazy jar-worlds!\n\nThe game has simple controls. Tip your iPhone to move Hoggy left or right, and touch the screen to reverse his gravity.\n\nUse your reflexes to grab all the fruit in each level, and use your mind to force your enemies to grab the fruit you can't reach!\n\nIt's a great retro-arcade experience! If you love side scrollers and arcade action, you'll love Hoggy!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hoggy"}
