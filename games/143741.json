The protagonist discovers that he has lost his memory, and after recuperating, he revisits the cliff and meets a young girl named Ayumi Tachibana. He learns from Ayumi that he is an assistant detective investigating the death of Kiku Ayashiro, and heads over to the nearby Ayashiro estate located in Myoujin village. The Ayashiro family owns a huge plot of land passed down from generation to generation, but there is a strange saying in the village that the dead will return to life to kill anyone who attempts to steal the treasure of the Ayashiro family. As the protagonist investigates the mysterious death of Kiku Ayashiro, he discovers the terrifying connection between this saying and the serial killings which take place.\n\nThe Girl Who Stands Behind\nThe second game is a prequel, and opens three years before the events of The Missing Heir. The prologue scene depicts an autumn night as a 15-year-old boy (the protagonist of the game) is on the run from two police officers. A man, respected by the police, decides to care of the situation by himself. The man takes the boy to a coffeehouse, where the boy explains that he ran away from his orphanage to find his parents' whereabouts. The man introduces himself as a private detective named Shunsuke Utsugi, and convinces the boy to become his assistant.\n\nA few months later, Utsugi and the protagonist receive a phone call to check over a crime scene. The murder victim is a freshman schoolgirl named Yoko Kojima. The protagonist begins gathering information from Ushimitsu High School to solve the Yoko case and connect it with the Genjiro Kaneda case along with the help of Yoko's two high school friends; a girl named Ayumi Tachibana and a boy named Hitomi Kawaii. It soon emerges that Yoko was deep into an investigation of \"The Tale of the Girl Who Stands Behind,\" a rumor involving a ghost of a blood-soaked girl that stands behind a student, and the trio set out to discover the truth behind this rumor.", "summary": "A bundle of two Famicom Detective Club remakes released on Nintendo Switch.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 45867, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "0Qw_6v9xN7s"}]}
