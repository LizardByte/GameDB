Why, yes.\nThis time, we're looking at a SNES Bootleg by the name of Bananas de Pijamas, which apparently is a kids television show about twin bananas... In pajamas.\n\nThis game is a ROM hack of \"Chester Cheetah - Too Cool to Fool\". From what I can tell, it's the same exact game, just with different graphics for the main collectables, character, HUD and it starts on a different stage, but I may be wrong.\n\nIf you want to play this game, you can play it here: http://www.vizzed.com/playonlinegames/game.php?id=64029&ref=282619", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JIj_re5ldoU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JIj_re5ldoU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JIj_re5ldoU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Bananas de Pijamas (SNES Bootleg)", "description": "Another bootleg game?
