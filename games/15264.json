The field is always shown from the top and scrolled softly into all directions.\n\nDifferent game modes make for diversity. Up to 15 players can enter their names and then compete with each other in a league. One can also take part in a World Cup, whereby the venue corresponds to the one of a real World Cup. The computer takes over the controls of as many teams as needed. A two-player friendly can be played head to head.\n\nThe game offers features as \"banana kick\", \"action replay\" and weather.\n\nThe original was developed by Sensible Software for the C64, Electronic Pencil Company were responsible for the Amiga and Atari ST versions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/keith-van-erons-pro-soccer", "videos": [{"id": 53829, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "63AaLlIbQz4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63AaLlIbQz4", "title": "MicroProse\u2122 Soccer Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/63AaLlIbQz4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
