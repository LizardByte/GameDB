The dungeon must have a self-sustaining ecosystem, so players must strategically dig and create a dungeon with a balanced food chain. Periodically, human heroes will invade the dungeon, in order to bring peace and harmony to the world. But, they are your enemies. You must destroy the heroes before they capture the Overlord and take him back to the surface in this, hilarious real-time strategy/god game!"}
