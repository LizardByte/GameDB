However, brute force isn't the only path to victory - you can also support your Creatures with powerful spells such as Siren's Song, which entrances your opponents' units, or artifacts like Narrow Bridge, preventing your opponent from swarming you with many creatures at once. Every decision is crucial on your journey to victory. You will have to forgo some cards in order to gather the resources necessary to play your more powerful cards. Will you choose to overwhelm your opponents with raw strength, or outmaneuver them with clever use of spells and artifacts? The choice is yours in Conclave.\nAre you ready to test your strategic prowess? Play now to find out!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/conclave-dissension"}
