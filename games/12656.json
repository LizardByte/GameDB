Bright primary colours and smiling characters are used to tell the tale of Kid's journey to rescue his girlfriend.\n\nThe levels feature an assortment of enemies to kill, including snakes, elves and crocodiles, as well as flames and spinning wheels. Many of these appear during the level, forcing you to plan for them. You have 10 lives, but the loss of one resets the level to its original state. The initial coin-throwing is pretty weedy, but better weapons (as well as extra lives and smart bombs) can be bought in the shop, which appears every 5 screens.\n\nThe levels are flick-screen, and can usually be finished in different ways, which results in different starting positions on the next screen, and you can travel back and forth through them, for example to pick up bonuses which are visible but not accessible as the level starts.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kid-gloves", "videos": [{"id": 137680, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "L2TkcGPANeA"}], "collections": [{"id": 1671, "name": "Kid Gloves"}]}
