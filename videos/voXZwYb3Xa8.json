{"id": "voXZwYb3Xa8", "snippet": {"title": "Legend of Mana Official Trailer (1999, Squaresoft)", "description": "Legend of Mana, originally released in Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana (\u8056\u5263\u4f1d\u8aac LEGEND OF MANA, lit. \"Legend of the Sacred Sword: Legend of Mana\"), is a 1999 action role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the PlayStation. It is the fourth game in the Mana series, following 1995's Seiken Densetsu 3. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows an unnamed hero as they restore the land of Fa'Diel by creating the world around them and completing a large number of interrelated and independent quests.\n\nWhile incorporating action role-playing elements from the prior games in the series, such as real-time battles, Legend of Mana has its own distinct style of gameplay. Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the world's structure through a Land Make system, generating regions and quests in a non-linear gameplay system rather than a strong main plotline. Legend of Mana was directed by series creator Koichi Ishii, designed by Akihiko Matsui, and produced by veteran Square director and producer Akitoshi Kawazu.\n\nThe game had high sales, selling 400,000 copies in its first week of release and 700,000 by the end of 1999. Reviews were less positive than for prior games in the series. Critics gave considerable acclaim to its vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics and soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, but were critical of the lack of a clear main storyline, stating that it left the game feeling disjointed. The game was re-released as a part of both the PlayStation's and Square Enix's best-sellers lines, and re-released on the PlayStation 3 PlayStation Network store as part of the PSone Classics series in 2011.\n\n\nLegend of Mana is set in the fictional world of Fa'Diel. The Mana Tree, the giver of mana and life for the world, burned down almost entirely nine centuries prior to the events of the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the burnt Mana Tree slept as it regrew and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, controlled by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and its mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa'Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa'Diel is also the home of a host of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other Mana titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins. The player controls the protagonist of the game, who is either a male or female silent protagonist. The character is unnamed and no information is given about their past; their history and personality is meant to be determined by the player.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/voXZwYb3Xa8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/voXZwYb3Xa8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/voXZwYb3Xa8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Legend of Mana Official Trailer (1999, Squaresoft)", "description": "Legend of Mana, originally released in Japan as Seiken Densetsu: Legend of Mana (\u8056\u5263\u4f1d\u8aac LEGEND OF MANA, lit. \"Legend of the Sacred Sword: Legend of Mana\"), is a 1999 action role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the PlayStation.
