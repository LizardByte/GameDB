But my X-Tension 1.4 Version had a few flaws and bugs that made the game awkward. Until the X-Tension 2.1 version came, I wasn't able to buy the 125MW Shield and TL ship. And the profit for using the Crystals was screwed up. \n\nSecret tips:-\nFirst of that the main important tips of this game is gaining revenue and avoiding destorying friendly target or making \nthe Pirate Base and friendly stations RED raging angry. But personally, having a startup with a Argon Buster M4 Interceptor isn't enough as it takes a LOT of time to regain reputation and profit. If you are new to X-Series games from Egosoft, the you best of starting with X Beyond The Frontier to get to grips with the basics in the X-Universe. However the only thing that X-BTF game has that the newer X-Games doesn't have is the SETA Boost Extension, and the Extra Turbo Boost by pressing the TAB key, but DON'T use the boost if you have NO Shields. The only downside is X-BTF is no starmaps or addional important information. But in this game this maybe the game for you to build your empire. \n\nSo here is a few secrets: first is the money cheat is the only best cheat you should use if you are totally impatient - \nwhich is reasonable and X3 series as more complex and advanced features which are hard-to-learn at that stage. What you need to do is use a HEX Editor tool in one of the .sav files (best make multiple saves when playing X-Tension!) and locating the HEX code to alter the money. To do this use your Windows Calculator by typing the exact credits you got in your save files and converting the number value into a HEX value. Then you need to open your .sav using the HEX editor to find the exact match, but I cannot guarantee it will work as it is likely you may find the wrong HEX value among other values. But there are other ways you can money cheat at the start of the game by selling your Buster and buying 3 Discoverers which will contain a glitch in Argon Prime Shipyard shop menu. \n\nHowever, just to be wise I won't reveal or indulge anymore tips that may spoil your game but try using your Search Engine on X-Tension Money Cheat for more help. I've also copied this X-Tension Top Secret Guide link below. Now this info that I made isn't really typed by myself as the person from ozemail.com.au deserves the credit, but I don't know if that site he originally typed up will remain forever so I copied it into my site in case that guide vanishes permenently. \n\nAnd one final thing there is a secret Options menu, simply press [Shift + O] ingame and look at the options. Now you can increase the SETA power to 10x if you like but when you are travelling in a TL or M5 ship it is likely you will crash and ruin your reputation and Police License. Remember save your game mainly everytime when you are not on a mission when docking and try to make multiples saves as you progress. DON'T dock at a station when you are STRAFING or you will get that momentium bug when you exit the dock and crash into the tunnel exit. \n\nIf you DON'T want to know the Money Cheat and for the Top Secret missions, DON'T click on it unless you are tempted or a inpatient short tempered person. \n\nIf you want to know more hidden tips and secrets, go to my link below.\n\n2000 (c) Egosoft\n\nhttp://apg-clan.org/showthread.php/8464-X-Tension-Guide\n\nMade in Germany.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u9VeU14iIyk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u9VeU14iIyk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u9VeU14iIyk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u9VeU14iIyk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "X-Tension - Egosoft", "description": "I've mastered this game many years ago, long before X2: The Threat was built.
