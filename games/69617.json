The disc is divided into four quarters, each a different colour, identifying with balls of four various colours zooming around the playfield and four differently-coloured wall-mounted hands grasping out, waiting for the player to deliver a ball of the appropriate colour. In order to ensnare a ball (as though they were complementary sides of a velcro connection), the player must rotate the disc using the mouse buttons to ensure that the side facing the ball is of the same colour as the ball itself when they connect. Colour-mismatched connections result in taking a hit; after twelve such failures, the game is over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/velcro-mind"}
