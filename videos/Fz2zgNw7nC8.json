Yukari has a powerful homing shot and Yuyuko has a good spread shot. \nStage 3 Medicine and stage 5 Sanae seem to have different spellcards depending on which team you are. \n\nCertain enemies during stages drop pink orbs. These pink orbs add to the meter on the left of the screen. The meter will be full with 9 orbs. \nThis meter has several properties.\n- The fuller the meter, the lower the POC.\n- If you have 5 orbs you can use an autobomb, in exchange of consuming those 5 orbs.\n- You can use a special attack that consumes one orb. This gives you some brief i-frames and also cancels bullets in a small radius around you into point items. \n- If the meter is full enough at the end of a boss, you'll trigger a bonus Last Spell like in Touhou 8. Even if you get hit you won't lose a life.  \n\nThe game is good fun. The stages are not terribly exciting, but the bosses are good. \n\nThe game is not terribly difficult to just clear. On top of a ton of resources you also get the special attack that cancels bullets and the occasional autobomb.\nIn terms of like LNNN I don't think it would be -that- bad either. I feel like it would mostly come down to a couple of patterns.\n\nThe stage 6 song is quite a banger.\n\nBuy the game on Steam here:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/915130/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fz2zgNw7nC8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fz2zgNw7nC8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fz2zgNw7nC8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fz2zgNw7nC8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fz2zgNw7nC8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou \u6771\u65b9\u9f8d\u96b1\u8ac7 ~ Chaos of Black Loong - Lunatic 1cc (No-Miss)", "description": "Chaos of Black Loong (sometimes known as Chaos of Black Dragon), is a new Chinese Touhou fangame made by the same people that made Touhou Phantasm Dream.\nJust like the previous game, it has super high production values and features full voice acting.\n\nThe game has four teams and you can freely switch between the partners during gameplay. \nYukari and Yuyuko team is easily the best in the game.
