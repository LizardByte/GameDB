The game, released in May 2005, was developed by Haemimont.\nThe game contains various civilizations to choose from, among them are: Rome (Imperial and Republican), Egypt, Germania, Brittania, Iberia, Gaul and Carthage. It has a more elaborate hero system over its predecessor.\nThe game focuses on tactics, troop mobility and terrain topography rather than sheer strength of numbers for winning battles. Though resources are important there is less relevance in gathering them than in other real-time battle games. Instead of sending an army of servants to mine, lumber, collect food or gather any other kind of resources these are generated at a constant rate directly proportional to the inhabitants of a population center.\n\nThere are 3 player modes to choose from:\n\nConquest: The battles involved on this game are focused on raising an empire by conquering all the known ancient world, the user can choose any of the available civilizations (see below) to do so.\n\nRome's Greatest Battles: A good amount of effort has been dedicated to historical accuracy; not only on the graphics but on the story line of this pre-built scenarios on which the player can live Rome's defining moments, from The Battle of Zama which marked the final and decisive end of the Second Punic War to the rebellion of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra.\n\nCustom Game: These feature is always present in modern day real time tactic and strategy games, it can be used to practice against computer opponents on custom made scenarios or to go on-line and battle against other human players", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/imperivm-iii-great-battles-of-rome", "videos": [{"id": 351, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ryoJoghn2S8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryoJoghn2S8", "title": "IMPERIVM ONLINE FX - Trailer italiano", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ryoJoghn2S8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7845, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "iT66IU-MA0I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT66IU-MA0I", "title": "Imperium III GBR Multiplayer battle 1vs1 Egypt", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iT66IU-MA0I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
