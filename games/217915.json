Well we have, but we actually have no idea and we can't actually offer you a real cat.\n\nWhat is on offer is an ultra realistic unrealistic representation of what it is like to have a cat, aka nothing like the real thing.\n\nYou can however stroke it and make it purr, then you have the opportunity to do it again, and again and then stroke it as many times as you want before you are completely relaxed... or annoyed... or bored... then you can leave."}
