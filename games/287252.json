Its official name is the metropolis of Imnus.\nThis country is divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower, and the status of the people is largely determined by the level they live in.\nHowever, there is hardly any land outside the country where people can live, and it is a world of darkness where only demons are stirring.\n\nPeople live in such an unreasonable world.\nEveryone has his or her own life, aesthetics, and will, and shows his or her own way of being.\nThis is a story of people living in such a world, their way of life.", "summary": "This is an event-based RPG.\nIt is a dark fantasy RPG with the content of an ensemble drama through conversation.\nIn short, it is an orthodox RPG in which everyone defeats the enemies that stand in their way while advancing through the events.\nThis is the first full-length RPG with an emphasis on scenarios in our game.\n\nThe difficulty level is high, and it is an unreasonable game in its own way.\nWe do not expect everyone to clear the game at all.\nHowever, if you can complete a typical RPG just to reach one ending, I think you can go for it.\n\nThere are many long events, so it is not for those who want to operate quickly.\nIt is for those who want to proceed slowly and steadily. It is also for those who are not satisfied with a half-lengthy story.\nHowever, I think it is not suitable for perfectionists.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nonstories-eien-no-hakoniwa"}
