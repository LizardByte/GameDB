You, the white teletubby have been trying to figure out what happened.  After 5 years of research on the teletubby custards you collect from teletubby land, you believe that the custards are genetically modified.  You travel to teletubby land once again (which is now destroyed and swamp-like) to collect more custards for your research, only this time you find a secret entrance inside the teletubby house which leads to an unknown passage.  You travel further into this passage and find some sort of secret layer full of unknown technology.  More custards are inside this layer, you believe they are fresh and hold the truth and try to collect them for research.  As you are doing so, you find hints that this layer genetically creates teletubbies and controls teletubby land.  This explains the unknown speakers that instruct the old teletubby family what to do during the day.  You begin to believe that tinkywinky took a bad dose of the genetic teletubby custard.  You fear that teletubbies are not born, they are made... and only to be hampsters in a cage.  There is only one way to know for sure however, you must collect all the custards and find out the truth.\n\nFeatures:\n    Singleplayer\n    Multiplayer\n    10 Different Maps\n    Bug fixes\n    New NPC\n    Co-op Mode\n    Versus Mode\n    Oculus Rift Support\n    3D Anaglyph Support\n    Lobby For Multiplayer\n    Text Chat\n    You Can Choose The Amount Of Custards Per Game\n    Multiplayer does not require port forwarding or hamachi\n\nControls:\nMovement - WSAD / Arrow Keys\nRun - Shift\nJump - Space\nToggle Light - Left Mouse Button\nLook Through Camera - Right Mouse Button\nZoom in - E\nZoom Out - Q\nChat - T\nShow/Hide Cursor - H\nCustards Remaining - C", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FB9ucEHcJhg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FB9ucEHcJhg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FB9ucEHcJhg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Slendytubbies II Official Trailer", "description": "Download Link:\nhttp://zeoworks.com/misc.php?page=slendytubbiesii\n\nDescription:\nSlendytubbies II continues the story after the first 'Slendytubbies' game.  5 long years has past since the events of teletubby land.
