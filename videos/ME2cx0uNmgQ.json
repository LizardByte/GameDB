I'm thinking this was probably a good idea, since there's no way the Master System could've ever handled half of what the Genesis threw around on screen at once - and it's extremely well made. It's not a piece of garbage with Sonic tacked on that was just shoveled for a quick buck - the pace and speed is really scaled back, but there's a whole host of original levels here that look good and play better to the Master System's strengths. The Game Gear version of it was quite good too, though the smaller screen and lower resolution makes the game much harder because you can't see as much of the level around you on-screen at once. \n\nThe music, at least by the awful SMS/GG PSG chip standards, is pretty good. And check out the Bridge Zone music - sound familiar to anyone? Yeah, Janet Jackson ripped that tune off for her 90s pop single Together Again. Could you ask for a better endorsement for its composition than that? And does anyone else remember hearing that song on TRL?\n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ME2cx0uNmgQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ME2cx0uNmgQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ME2cx0uNmgQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic the Hedgehog (Master System) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 1991 platformer for the Sega Master System, Sonic the Hedgehog. \n\nCollected all of the chaos emeralds for the best ending. \n\nThe Master System/Game Gear version of Sonic isn't a port of the Genesis title, but rather an entirely new game designed specifically for the 8-bit Sega platforms.
