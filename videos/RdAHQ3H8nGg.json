Only one man has the ability to stop their advance: Captain William Blade. Take command of Blade and his ragtag crew of chopper pilots as they fly one of four choppers Huey, Chinook, Super Stallion, or Apache through 16 missions of plastic carnage. Help them maneuver through perilous settings like the \"Backyard\" and the \"Picnic.\" When you get tired of seeing your buddies melted on the barbecue, call a friend to help you in the Cooperative Play mode. If sharing is not your thing, knock your friend's chopper out of the sky in a head-to-head match up. Either way, with Army Men: Air Attack, it is real combat with plastic men.\n\nWe do not own the rights to this material.
