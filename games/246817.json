He is also scolded by his teachers every day....... It was as if the world was pushing Ollie into a corner.\n\nOne day Olly is threatened by Bobby and his friends and together they sneak into a spooky mansion. They steal \"parts\" of a certain work and escape, only to be caught by the owner of the house - an old man named Joseph. Joseph, who claims to be a watchmaker, asks Olly what happened to him and says he won't do anything bad to Olly if he gets the \"parts\" back from Bobby and his friends.", "summary": "This is a 2D adventure game of puzzle solving.
