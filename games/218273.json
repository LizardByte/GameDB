Running on Unreal Engine 3, this game truly stands out with its stunningly beautiful sceneries, fluid-feeling movement, impressive special effects, and dynamic shadows.\n\nGods and demons have fought for power over this world for many millennia, but neither side could prevail. It was decided to place the fate of the world in the hands of mortals by sending the Weapons of the Gods down to earth. These weapons are so peculiar, so powerful, so fascinating, that no human can ever resist the appeal. Sooner or later, either the gods will prevail and the earth shall bend before their will, or the demons will win and plunge the entire world into chaos and madness.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/weapons-of-the-gods"}
