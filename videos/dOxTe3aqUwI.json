Here is a rough overview of how it works if you are interested:\n\nI first spawn rooms with random position and random size on a fixed-size 2D grid of cells. A room is only placed if it doesn't overlap with any other room. Each room also has a margin which can be adjusted to create longer/shorter corridors.\n\nThe rooms are connected by sorting them based on their position on the X-axis and then connecting each adjacent room in that sorted order. When two rooms are connected, an L-shape line is created between the room centers. It is randomly chosen if the corridor moves horizontally or vertically first.\n\nWhen the rooms and corridors are finished, tiles (e.g., floors, walls, and ceilings) are instantiated for each cell based on the cell's neighbors.\n\nThe props can be placed in two different ways. They can either be set to stick to the wall or be placed out somewhere in the center of the room.\n\nDecals such as blood splats are projected on the floor to add some more details.\n\nThis approach was based on https://rogueliketutorials.com/ and this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlLIOgWYVpI&t=298s, (awesome resources if you want to generate dungeons).\n\nThere are still tons of features I would like to add to this, e.g., add more props and room variety as well as some verticality to the dungeons. Right now, it's all on the same level, which can be a bit boring, to be honest.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or feedback. I'm happy to go into more details if you are interested.\n\n#indiegame #survivalhorror #horrorgame\n\nResources:\nhttps://rogueliketutorials.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlLIOgWYVpI&t=298s", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOxTe3aqUwI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOxTe3aqUwI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOxTe3aqUwI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOxTe3aqUwI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOxTe3aqUwI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nekyia | Procedurally Generated Dungeons | Devlog #1", "description": "Steam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2676030/Nekyia/\n\nThe approach I went for is relatively simple, but I'm pretty happy with the result so far.
