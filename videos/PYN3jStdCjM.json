I just want Yuuto Ichika to kiss me under the mistletoe. Whenever Yuuto does her spells, her eyes glisten at me through the screen of my rig! I know what she wants.

With people disliking her because her passion was too strong for them to keep up with, Yuuto develops a bitter stance towards those who don't put any effort. She's forced to chase her dream alone. Yuuto doesn't have a natural born \"cute personality\", a necessary talent for anime games so she makes up for it with effort. It's similar to a musician who needs to put in more hours of practice to reach a similar height of proficiency than someone with greater natural talent. Passion over talent is what her character is about. Yuuto molds herself to pursue what she loves despite her faults. This kind of imperfect appeal is hard to put a dot on or even realize, but it's the main reason I will keep making games about her.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYN3jStdCjM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYN3jStdCjM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYN3jStdCjM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYN3jStdCjM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYN3jStdCjM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Yuuto Ichika Makes Friends Trailer - Game Boy Homebrew (Free Download)", "description": "The bootleg 2hu Yuuto Ichika is back to make some new friends!
