I actually managed to play the first one through without any cheats, but was almost out of ammo at that point. So even if it was possible to complete the game without unlimited health (what I seriously doubt) it would be impossible to complete the next section, because of running out of things to shoot with. I used a trainer to play this through.\n\nThere are total of 20 cops (lives) in three squads and 5 in reserve. Only one squad can be used to play the game. Otherwise each squad has to make their own way through the first section. Reserves can be teleported to any squad carrying a teleport device. Each squad carries a set of preselected weapons. The whole squad runs out of ammo when the pointman does and they can barely carry their own weight.\n\nHaving said that I think it's a potential shooter ruined by bad design. It's one of those games I loaded few times back in the days and never played again. Playstyle is far from cautious, I could get hit less by advancing carefully. The cops actually die from few hits even with kevlar vests and explosives kills instantly. Didn't record this video to show off my gaming skills, which are actually awesome.\n\nThis game was slow on A500 so I used a default A1200 config in WinUAE to speed it up. \n\nPublisher: Dinamic Software (1991)\n\nhttp://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=772", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZzDQb8mBpI4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZzDQb8mBpI4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZzDQb8mBpI4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZzDQb8mBpI4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZzDQb8mBpI4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Narco Police (amiga) cheated walkthrough", "description": "There are two sections to complete.
