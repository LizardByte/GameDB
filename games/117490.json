There are no additional in-game purchases: once it's yours, you can begin tackling it until you reach the end. Maybe it\u2019s time to take a break from playing games for other people.\n\nKey features of ALPHA\n- A single-player action shooting game. Quite a challenging one, in fact.\n- Average play time of 2 hours (or, if you like to spend more time, as long as you want)\n- Knock off enemy bullets with your sword to shoot and slash your way through stages.\n- No save points during stages. Enemies are tough, and so are the bosses. Study their moves and work around them.\n- When it\u2019s game over, you start over from the beginning of the stage. You won\u2019t be getting it easy!\n- Some health items, shields, bombs, etc. are just a few useful items.\n- All this for a small price.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alpha", "videos": [{"id": 26574, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HV9XNgges_o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV9XNgges_o", "title": "Nintendo Switch\u300eALPHA\u300fOfficial Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HV9XNgges_o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
