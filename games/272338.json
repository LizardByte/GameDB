You're joined by STEVE, the lab's AI assistant, who shows you the different effects of biology, physics, and chemistry in each realm. Together you'll scan objects, find hidden ducks, and observe science in action. You will complete four missions around giant ants, a tardigrade, a protist, and giant fungi that have accidentally been scaled up by using scientific concepts and scaling objects up and down yourself.\n\nIn addition to the base game, there is a Multiplayer Theater where players can invite their friends and watch Kurzgesagt videos together in VR. There's also a Mixed Reality Sandbox where players can bring objects and creatures they've unlocked in the game into their home.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/out-of-scale-a-kurzgesagt-adventure", "videos": [{"id": 100415, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nxXVQYW2qTU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXVQYW2qTU", "title": "Out of Scale - a Kurzgesagt Adventure | Coming Soon | Meta Quest 3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nxXVQYW2qTU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
