Also unlike most hacks, in this one you are only allowed to save stars via the \"cap\" switches in the overworld until you get at least 40 stars, from then you can save when you want, just to add a lil live management... you get 25 lifes, don't worry.\n\nDownload v1.2: https://romhacking.com/hack/star-revenge-55-destroyed-memories\n\nMusic: Play a Mini-Game (Deluxe mix) - by SM64Pie", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HJv-1B6plJc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HJv-1B6plJc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HJv-1B6plJc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HJv-1B6plJc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "[Download v1.2] Star Revenge 5.5 - Destroyed Memories - Release", "description": "If you thought to yourself that SR5 was too easy, well now you got this.
