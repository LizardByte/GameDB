The area is soon to be a dam site and the two sisters reminisce about the times they spent there. While remembering an accident in the forest that left Mayu's leg weak, Mio notices that her sister has disappeared. She sees Mayu chasing a crimson butterfly and, after following her, the two are spirited away into All God's Village (a.k.a. \"The Lost Village\" and \"Minakami Village\".)\n\nUnknown to the twins, the village is the site of a mysterious ritual that failed, causing the village to be trapped in continuous night and to disappear from the region, destined to relive the events of the ritual's failure forever. The two sisters discover a newspaper clipping and photo of a couple on the outskirts of the village and decide to investigate before leaving by entering one of the nearby family houses after seeing a female ghost entering it. Inside they find the abandoned Camera Obscura, as well as the diaries of a woman who came to the village in search of her missing boyfriend, which the twins assume to be the ghost they viewed previously. Upon finding her final diary, the woman's ghost attacks the sisters in anger, forcing Mio to use the camera to exorcise her.\n\nAlthough the plot of the game remained the same, a new ending called the \"Promise Ending\" was available as a conclusion to the story. The ending can be achieved by playing and completing the game on \"Nightmare\" difficulty with any rank.", "summary": "Crimson Butterfly is the second installment in the Fatal Frame series, although not a direct sequel to the first title, Fatal Frame.
