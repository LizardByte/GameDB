Moving the joystick controls his \"wisp\", a magical boomerang-like device. Pressing the fire button plants a seed that will slowly grow into a tree in several stages to adulthood. Ogres appear from both sides of the screen, walking across it horizontally. If they walk over an immature tree, the tree shrinks back one stage of growth, eventually disappearing. Spiders periodically appear and move randomly about the screen. If they move over a fully grown tree it becomes poisoned, and will eventually die. Both enemies can be vanquished by touching them with the wisp, which will also cure poisoned trees. Eye-Pods containing additional seeds periodically appear and can be picked up with the wisp. The speed of the action increases continually through the level until it becomes quite hectic at the end.\n\nEvery tree that survives the first level becomes Illuminar's ally in the second. Here the player enters a five-level side-view map of a crypt filled with spider eggs. Using the wisp, the player selects trees and moves them over the coffins where their roots grow into the roof of the coffins and eventually break through to crush the eggs lying below. If they take too long, the spider will hatch and attack the trees until the wisp kills them. Periodically the Hands of Fate descend from the roof, picking up anything below them and sometimes dropping prizes. The player must move through the crypt while all of this takes place, capturing question-mark prizes in order to extend ladders needed to reach lower levels. On this level, moving the joystick normally moves Illuminar, but holding down the fire button freezes him in place and moves the wisp instead.\n\nThe final confrontation between Illuminar and Tetragorn takes place in a graveyard. Gravestones appear that must be destroyed by walking over them in order to prevent Tetragorn from appearing. When he does - and there are always enough gravestones to ensure this - he shoots off trails of fire that injure Illuminar as he moves about. Any spider eggs that were not destroyed in the crypt also turn into spiders that attack Illuminar. The wisp can be used to banish either enemy, although while it is in use, Illuminar remains fixed in place.\n\nEach hit by any enemy on Illuminar reduces his power and eventually kills him, although the periodic appearance of small rings of power will improve his life power again.", "summary": "The player controls the wizard Illuminar who attempts to grow an army of trees to attack Tetragorn the Necromancer and his evil minions who are attempting to take over a graveyard. The game is an arcade action title, but is unusual in that there are three distinct segments of gameplay, each of which affects the one following it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/necromancer", "videos": [{"id": 108985, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Lnc3vI0fgJA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnc3vI0fgJA", "title": "Atari 800 - Necromancer gameplay Bill Williams 8-bit games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lnc3vI0fgJA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
