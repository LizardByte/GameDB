It is not a sequel to any previously released title, despite its name.\n\nAir Raid 3 lets players become a jet fighter pilot with numerous missions all over the world. The gameplay is similar to the Ace Combat games as it is primarily focused around dogfighting versus a range of other aircraft in the sky and achieving mission based objectives such as blowing up a certain building of defeating a number of enemy aircraft.\n\n15 levels of continous changing of the opposition's strategy, weapons and appearance, ensure many hours of action packed fun.
