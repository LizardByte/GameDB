Instead of displaying objects on a table in front of you, it creates a virtual environment around your physical space that has you walking around your room discovering parts that were never there before. Through the power of AR, players can immerse themselves in 50 different levels of mystery anywhere using a mobile phone or tablet as they uncover the story behind ARia\u2019s sudden disappearance and discover her legacy.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arias-legacy"}
