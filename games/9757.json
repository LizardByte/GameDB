You must help the Yars avenge the destroyed colony and defeat the Qotile.\n\nYou fly a Yar scout over the shielded base of the Qotile, which you must chip away at by either firing energy blasts or by simply eating away at the shield. Once you have cleared an open path, activate the Zorlon Cannon and use it to blast the Qotile base to oblivion. But watch out for its destroyer missiles, which seek after your Yar scout in order to destroy him. You can hide out in the rainbow-colored Neutral Zone to be safe from the missiles. However, it cannot protect you from the occasional Swirls that the Qotile base launches at you, so dodge them quickly.", "summary": "Yars' Revenge is a video game released for the Atari 2600 in 1982.
