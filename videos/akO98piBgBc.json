This video is 4 hours long... wth is wrong with me. I hope you do enjoy it. \n\nFive Nights At Sonic's 1's Power has most likely been buffed. It goes down WAY faster... or it might be a bug.. idk, that game is very old. I also timed when tails would attack on Night 4. (Also has a bag of chips in hand while do this). \n\nFive Nights at Sonic's 2 is one of my most favorites in the series. Also... 17 Golden Sonic totally kills my strat. Gotta try a different strat. Also I nearly fell out of my chair when Toy Yoshi Jumpscared me. Remember, the withered characters were Clones not animatronics.\n\nFive Nights at Sonic's 3 is my MOST favorite game in the entire series. Phantom Tails always scared the heck out of me. Also Toy Yoshi is annoying as heck in this game. She can use the vent in cam 3 to get to me. Imagine how many times she could do that in just 1 minute. Also on Night 6 or Custom Night, if Toy Yoshi is in your office and you're looking at your panel, Golden Sonic is always behind it as soon as you pull it down then... and that's most likely a bug... cause it happens EVERY, SINGLE, TIME... 27 Golden sonic can also kill you on the cams.\n\nFive Nights at Sonic's 4 is my least favorite in the series. Basically it was a bit rushed... and a little underdeveloped, it was being made while FNAS 3 was being made. However, this game has scared the heck out of me in the past, and I'm shocked that it still does to this very day. The whole listening thing pretty much made it more scarier. Also Sam was hella scary with that phone call. Props to him. \n\nFive Nights At Sonic's 5 is the start of it all. That's why it's called the First Chapter. Origin Golden Sonic was the First Clone, and he had some Cloning errors tho... (The reason he is Golden in the first place). Which explains why the heck the Golden Sonics from the other games slowly decayed until Shadow Sonic. This is my 2nd Favorite game in the series. \n\nThanks for reading to the end....\n...\n...\n.. uhh...
