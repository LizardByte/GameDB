Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.\n\nThe game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ghosts-n-goblins--1", "videos": [{"id": 66473, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "P7CdqiHHPpQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7CdqiHHPpQ", "title": "Ghosts 'n Goblins (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P7CdqiHHPpQ/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2265, "name": "Ghosts 'n Goblins"}]}
