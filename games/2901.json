It was later published in North America by Data East, without the movie license. The Japanese version was based on the Jackie Chan movie Wheels on Meals, known as Spartan X in Japan, and credited \"Paragon Films Ltd., Towa Promotion\", who produced the film upon which it was based. The game is considered by many to be the first beat 'em up video game, and contains elements of Bruce Lee's Game of Death.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spartan-x--1", "videos": [{"id": 1456, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "x3JldVnuWV0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3JldVnuWV0", "title": "Kung Fu (Nintendo, 1985) - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x3JldVnuWV0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 2453, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "FkmyqdJ0jd0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkmyqdJ0jd0", "title": "Kung Fu Master gameplay HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkmyqdJ0jd0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2529, "name": "Spartan X"}]}
