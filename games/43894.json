On the asteroid there are no walls or jails. Unchained Prisoners have been left alone to follow their own destiny. Survival is the only universal law. Life on \"THE HELL\" spawns a violent sport without any rules called \"RAGEBALL\" and played on hostile fields with an iron skull for a ball.\n\nAnyone on IS-326 is eligible to play Rageball. The only aim is to put food in your belly and clothes on your back, and if you are lucky, to struggle towards a better life. In time, the World TV Networks decided to follow this strange new sport, pulling in massive audiences for each match. The media frenzy kick-starts a network of illegal betting and rigged matches.\n\nHowever, in a world without rules, what can truly be called legal? Everyone has a price... as the manager of your own RAGEBALL team, how much are YOU worth?", "summary": "The futuristic sport of Rageball, inspired by Speedball 2, is fast, violent and deadly, and played by teams of exiled convicts who have nothing to lose. The year is 2612 and sports hit an all-time low. Therefore, prisoners are sent to the planet IS-326, nicknamed \"The Hell\", where they are forced to compete in a violent sport with no rules.\n\nIn the single player mode, you take on the role of the manager of an up-and-coming Rageball squad, as you coach the players to victory, with strategical decisions and tactics. Up to four competitors can battle against each other through multitap.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rageball", "videos": [{"id": 112103, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "MViQxfWuk7Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MViQxfWuk7Y", "title": "Rageball - Intro for the Playstation 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MViQxfWuk7Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 112104, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GzYbpi6Q4Hc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzYbpi6Q4Hc", "title": "[PSX/PS1] Rageball - Single Match", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzYbpi6Q4Hc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 112105, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FzxwY3yxqtQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzxwY3yxqtQ", "title": "Rageball ...
