The 'space gold' is flown to their crew on Earth and used to fund a rebellion against the Earth's wealthiest 1%. The pirates have become a nuisance to the people in power, by regularly hacking their communications satellites, demanding ransoms and encouraging the 99% to rise up and overthrow the ultra-rich. These efforts soon, however, come at a cost...\n\nAs there is no jurisdiction and law that governs space, the 1% band together to fund a space fleet, who's only motive is to destroy the Cosmic Butterfly and all of it's crew. Filled with pride, the pirates have no intentions to flee from conflict and so attempt to take on the Earth fleet. But to no avail, the Butterfly is shot into critical condition and their only means of escape is to hurtle towards an unknown planet for an emergency crash-landing. Panic-stricken, the crew climb into separate escape pods and are ejected from the ship, leaving them scattered around the planet.\n\nAfter a hard landing, a lone pirate regains consciousness and scans the surroundings using the pod's radar and to their surprise, this planet has breathable air, and even harbors life! It seems as though this place has been kept a secret from history... But why?\n\nAfter fashioning a sword from the escape pod's parts, the pirate sets foot outside to look for the missing crew...\n\n- Website -\nhttps://tidal-rave.com\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Streaming\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2Tsr1xU\nApple Music: https://apple.co/2woAGNV\nYoutube Music: http://bit.ly/2ToCezu\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Social\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tidalraveband\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tidalraveband/\nhttps://twitter.com/tidalraveband\nhttps://tidalrave.bandcamp.com/music\n\n\u00a9 2023 Tidal Rave.
