Your mission is to infiltrate a top secret fortress. You must capture enemy documents and get out alive. Your challenge: the diabolical maze of corridors and elevators designed to confuse you and keep you from the documents. Your danger: enemy assassins programmed to shoot on sight. Your weapon: a high-power laser gun as powerful as that of the enemy. Your advantage: you're sharp enough to duck when they shoot. It's a hectic chase. Hop an elevator. Survive enemy fire. Fire back. Duck.
