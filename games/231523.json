The only difference in that mechanic is that the game would use two paddles, each controlled by the two D-pads on the controller. Each stage had enemies that you could hit with the ball. There would also have been boss stages, one featuring a giant tree stump enemy that would throw rocks.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/virtual-block"}
