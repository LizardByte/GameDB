The mod is finished and released on GameJolt, so I'm happy to announce the link has been added here for convenience!\nhttps://gamejolt.com/games/supercatwars/627452\n\nFor those who are looking forward to my Super Mario War mod, \"Super Cat Wars\", please check out this video!\n\nDISCLAIMER: THIS VIDEO IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE MOD. Some assets are not replaced yet, such as the Koopa Troopa shells! The final version of the mod will have all the base assets completely remade!\n\nSuper Cat Wars is a Super Mario War 1.8 mod that themes the entire game into the world of \"SUPER CAT TALES\" by developer Gionathan Pesaresi (NEUTRONIZED). This mod was developed and finished on March 29, 2022 by EleCyon/Astrakitu, CindyChan/CindySparks, and a couple of friends from Team SCW!\n\nSTORY:\nInitially, you might find that Super Cat Wars has no story - essentially most (if not all) your favorite Super Cat Tales characters and more duke it out in a four-player battle royale across Neko Land. But the mod features a World Mode world map called \"Story Mode\" which gives the mod an actual story.\n\nIn Story Mode, the Golden Paw Trophy has been stolen by Dark Kallio (a corrupted form of Captain Kallio which manifested after Drop Wizard Tower's events), after he intercepts into the finals of the battle royale tournament in Hikari City Arena. It's up to you and your friends (can be any of the characters you chose) to chase and stop Dark Kallio and the Kardion League from taking over Neko Land while fighting back for the Golden Paw Trophy!\n\nFEATURES:\nNOTICE: This description is from 2020, so most of these are outdated.\n- It's a complete mod! What do you expect?\n- One of my ambitious side-projects besides my usual Just Shapes and Beats fanstories.\n- VARIOUS extended tilesets and decorations based on the Super Cat Tales and Neutronized Universe Games (Drop Wizard Tower, Slime Pizza, etc.)\n- Old and new backgrounds, featuring afternoon/night variants for almost each background\n- Featuring 10+ playable cats and more! (Alex, Brutus, Shinji, Kuro, Amy, Olli, Sergeant McMeow, Luna, Pascal, Rigs, and more to come!)\n- And Neutronized crossovers! (Teo from Drop Wizard, Slime from Slime Laboratory/Slime Pizza, etc.)\n- 100 playable maps... I guess? I mean, you can make more with the level editor.\n- 3 worlds will be bundled with the game! There's already a built-in world editor for creating more worlds!\n- Take bells to kittens!\n- Made with love and care!\n- Dedicated to Florian Hufsky and Gionathan Pesaresi.\n\nRELEASE DATE: March 29, 2022 (Finished)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uk5PjuUQYyw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uk5PjuUQYyw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uk5PjuUQYyw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uk5PjuUQYyw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Old Preview Video (2020) | Super Cat Wars - Super Cat Tales-themed Super Mario War Mod!", "description": "UPDATE 01-10-2023: A lot of people are coming here asking if the mod is out or if there's a download out there.
