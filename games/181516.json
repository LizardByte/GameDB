One day during summer vacation, she is suddenly transported back in time to the Heian era. She ends up in the capital city \u2013 a place where the elegant world connects to the land of death. While wondering aimlessly around she encounters a man called Abe Seimei, an exorcist working for the emperor, who tells her that she will return to her world at the next full moon. Kaguya replies that would be fine in a sullen tone, as she doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s speaking the truth and is dubious that anyone would believe that she\u2019s actually from another time. The boy, who likes to meddle in other people\u2019s affairs, raises an eyebrow at her nihilistic nature and orders that she must change from being a \u201cliving corpse\u201d to a \u201cliving person\u201d before he sends her back . However, with this change came the start of her sorrows\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
