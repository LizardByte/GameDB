Gameplay is apparently unchanged, you control a vehicle called Whummel into a 9x9 grid maze, chasing down, and being chased by, the alien invaders. Targs have evolved into the more dangerous Rammers, and Spectars appears more often, shooting at player's ship.\n\nYou use a 4 way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at enemies. Up to two players can alternate in gameplay.\n\nThe most noticeable difference from his predecessor is that to complete a level you must now collect all the gems in the maze, in a Pacman-like game. Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.\n\nGraphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor: the maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environement settings, changing from the \"square-block town\" of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spectar", "videos": [{"id": 103737, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wBnOhrTmu6k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBnOhrTmu6k", "title": "Arcade Game: Spectar (1980 Exidy)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wBnOhrTmu6k/sddefault.jpg"}]}
