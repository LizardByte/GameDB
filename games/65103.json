Instead of kicking the ball, you shoot it with a special gun. The arenas are the size of a soccer field but for now played indoors. The game was designed for LAN parties but can be played over the internet as well. Up to 4 players per team are allowed and the host has many options that can be selected for gameplay. Players can get damaged from the projectiles and if you disable another player you spend time in the penalty box. The ball is 10 feet in diameter and is a bit squishy. You shoot it like you would a pool ball. The game comes with 5 single player \"Trials\" you run for time and score. The Trials help you control the ball so you will do better in tournaments.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hyperxball"}
