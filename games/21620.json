To do this you need units and to get units you need resources. To gain these valuable resources you need to capture and hold so called resourcepoints that are located throughout the battlefield. To capture a resourcepoint simply walk your units into it, eradicate all traces of the enemy and then it's yours. Usually there will be three to five resourcepoints on a map. When you have captured a resourcepoint it will start to produce resources for you. These resources are then spent on making more troops so that you can capture more resourcepoints or harder contest those you allready got. When you feel you have a sufficient army you march for the enemys base and win the game.", "summary": "Tablemen is a VR RTS game, set in a steampunk setting.
