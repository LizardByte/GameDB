Learning requires repetition, which is often boring. So here the repetition is embedded within the grinding tasks of a role-playing game, and the development is heavily focused on gameplay.\n\nIn LoL you explore a procedurally generated world inhabited by different beings, which you can capture and train in battles. These battles are the core gameplay, and your battle success depends on solving translation challenges. As your beings level up, you gradually encounter harder challenges and can explore new areas of the world.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lands-of-languages", "videos": [{"id": 112133, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "XdbvoeY4gKA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdbvoeY4gKA", "title": "Lands of Languages Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XdbvoeY4gKA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
