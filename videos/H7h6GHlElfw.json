He's brought his trademark style to this newest story, that of a down-on-his-luck mangaka who begins investigating urban legends in the hopes of finding material for his next work. That investigation leads him to discover that one particular urban legend is all too real; that of Kurokami-sama. She's a trapped yokai who normally kills humans, but spares our protagonist on one condition: he must hunt and kill other yokai hiding within society, and prepare them as meals for the starved Kurokami-sama. Faced with the threat of death should he make even the slightest of mistakes, the journey to sate the hunger of a deadly yokai begins.\n\nFollow JAST USA for more information:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jastusa\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/rMGjzQE \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jastusa", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H7h6GHlElfw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H7h6GHlElfw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H7h6GHlElfw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H7h6GHlElfw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H7h6GHlElfw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Kurokami-sama's Feast - English Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Published by JAST USA\nDeveloped by Minato Carnival World\nRelease Date: January 21, 2022\nPlatforms: JAST Online Store, Steam, Nintendo Switch\n\nKurokami-sama's feast is the latest creation of legendary author Takahiro, who is known for works such as Akame ga Kill, Majikoi, and Release the Spyce.
