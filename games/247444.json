If you get it right, the mystery is solved. If you get it wrong, everyone could be in danger. So, tread carefully.\n\nIn the game, you play as Charles, a scholar on a mission sent by His Majesty (the lion king Lav) to help the critters of The Burrows where the outbreak is on the rise. Is it dangerous, or just a mere nuisance? It is up to Charles to find out what is going on.\n\nBut there would be problems on his path, both scientific and social.\n\nThe Burrows is a mining town, and miners are on a strike\nThere is no cure for the outbreak, and productivity is suffering. The miners won't tolerate the current scenario and are on strike. The problem? The foreman of The Burrows isn't having any of it and wants to shut down the strike. Unless Charles finds a creative solution.\n\nPaws of Coal is a short, stand-alone game set in the larger Trip the Ark Fantastic universe that is currently in development in Gamechuck. Paws of Coal offers around 3 to 4 hours of gameplay (depending on your play style), and even multiple endings.\n\nThe investigation is solved by talking to each resident of The Burrows, finding the clues in the environment, making a lot of notes, and connecting the dots (literally) using the interface in Charles' journal.\n\nWhen you're sure you got it right - submit the report, and... hope for the best.
