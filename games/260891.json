The project is inspired by Arsinikk and NinjaDelphox's 100 Line Massacre.\n\nAs the 100 in the title suggests, each map was limited to 100 lines at most. Mappers were only given one week to make maps for the project.\n\nThe megawad comes with 30 maps (28 normal + 2 secret) from the Doomworld Community! All maps were designed with pistol start in mind, though continuous play is perfectly fine. Each\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf map should take around 2-5 minutes to finish.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/100-line-christmas"}
