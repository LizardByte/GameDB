Each route is broken up into several zones, which are controlled by the rival teams.\n\nRival teams in Street Supremacy include Rolling Guy, Fine Drive, Galaxy Racers, The Road of Justice, Departures, No Loser, Highway Outlaw, Free Way, Another Star, Unlimited, Neo Limited, Speed Masters R, and Wanderers (much like other Shutokou Battle titles, Wanderers have certain requirements that need to be met before challenging the player). Some bosses from the other titles appear in Street Supremacy as Wanderers by default. Street Supremacy is the only Shutokou Battle series title where rivals can change teams during the game and teams can disband during the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/street-supremacy", "videos": [{"id": 74451, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6h46h9kZzuE"}, {"id": 74452, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "1TAeQCcM2zk"}, {"id": 74453, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "idSAz0Mwmqk"}]}
