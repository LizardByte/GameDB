In single player mode, you play as the Confederacy, while the computer controls the Union. Each turn you have to decide how to allocate your funds on food, ammunition and salaries and choose one out of eight strategies to use in battle (four offensive, four defensive). The sides with fewer casualties wins the battle, and whoever wins eight or more battles wins the war.\n\nThe game was developed at Lexington High School by students L. Cram, L. Goodie, and D. Hibbard. In 1973, it was compiled and published on \"101 BASIC Computer Games\" by David H. Ahl, who credited G. Paul and R. Hess of \"TIES\" for adding a two-player mode", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/civil-war"}
