You can view it here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJPMHYyP1AE\n\nDawn of the the Tiberium Age is a mod (a Total Conversion) for Tiberian Sun which converts it into Tiberian Dawn (C&C95). This mod looks and plays nearly like Tiberian Dawn, but since you have all benefits of the Tiberian Sun engine (like being able to move while firing, drag-scroll, high resolutions, online play and skirmish) the gaming experience is (in my opinion) better.\nAside from this there's also an extra game mode called survivor, in which you have to collect crates to get units and upgrades. Possibly some other kind extra stuff will be added in the future.\n\nVisit DTA's website at https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-dawn-of-the-tiberium-age", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jnrkO_41jdc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jnrkO_41jdc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jnrkO_41jdc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Dawn of the Tiberium Age v1.8.0 (AKA build 1.08) trailer", "description": "I made a new trailer showing off a later version (1.10) of DTA (and I actually also put a lot more work in that trailer).
