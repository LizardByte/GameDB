As commander Reimu or Suika the players can select three kinds of units: Walking (very basic but flexible, they move in any direction), Barrage (they attack from distance) and Flying (fast, life bar and damage are various). Each unit is disposable and players can increase their deck level by synthesizing existing cards or collecting new ones each time they win a mission. Touhou Hyakki Kassen is the 10th official game from Strawberry Bose.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-hyakki-kasen"}
