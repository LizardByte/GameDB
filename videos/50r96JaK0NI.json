This is the second Shaman King game developed for the Game Boy Advance in North America and the sequel to the game Shaman King: Master of Spirits that had been released in 2002. This second version was released in 2005 in North America and Europe!\n\nThe second version of this story revolves around another antagonist, named Zeke (Hao Asakura) that fight against our hero Yoh Asakura in search of the title of Shaman King. And Yoh counts with the help of your friends, your spirit Amidamaru, other spirits (like Corey, Chloe, Tokageroh, Lee Pai Long, Grand Tao Dragon and more) and also Magister (villain in the first game, here ally). The game follows the same style metroidvania of his predecessor!\n\nIs a good game, but rather evolved from its first version, the only notable development was the soundtrack (forest and lava stages are my favorites musics of the game), but it just... who want know the anime is only for GBA games will still need more things to be learn more about the story of Yoh Asakura, who still was not complete in this series.
