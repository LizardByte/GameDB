Peace has returned to Scott and Rebecca's home planet.\nJust as spring has started to bloom there, both of them awake from their hibernation slumber and start doing what they do after every winter - running happily to the nearby woods, enjoying the beautiful nature and joining some sick moshpits at their favorite metal festival after that.\n\nBut this time, their routine gets interrupted by Scott... who mysteriously disappears on their way to the woods.\nRebecca immediately starts looking for him, and not much later she comes across the reasons of his disappearance... and some familiar faces too.\n\nBut those kind of faces she never hoped to see again. Furry, green eyed faces with stubby noses. With mouths emitting a stench of canned tuna. Eew.\n\nTheir stench is not the worst thing about them, though. It's much more their deeply sinister intentions, which are far worse than last time...", "summary": "Rise of the Wool Ball is a 2017 total conversion for the ZDoom engine. It was made by MSPaintR0cks and is the sequel to Shadow of the Wool Ball. The game is spread across three episodes, each having five levels with a secret level. Like its predecessor, Rise of the Wool Ball uses a cartoon art style, and it was named a runner-up at the Cacowards that year.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-the-wool-ball", "videos": [{"id": 80499, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "LWvsgzMmuHM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWvsgzMmuHM", "title": "Let\u2019s Play Rise of the Wool Ball #01: Introduction", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LWvsgzMmuHM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
