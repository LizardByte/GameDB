In this game you have to canoe up the Amazon River. Before starting, it is obligatory to choose yourself a guide - each of the four available candidates has a special skill that may help you on your journey. In the course of the game, you need to manage the supplies; meet, talk, and trade with different people presented by live actors in FMV; read maps; and decide how much to eat, when to rest, and how fast to paddle.\n\nThe game also contains a huge amount of information about the science and history of the Amazon rainforest. It is possible to explore the rainforest along the route spotting one of 100 different species and taking pictures or picking up fruits for the supply. There is a fishing mini-game as well, and six more learning games where kids learn the origins of commodities like coffee, rice, and chocolate, locate the major rivers of the world etc.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/amazon-trail-ii", "collections": [{"id": 11190, "name": "The Amazon Trail"}]}
