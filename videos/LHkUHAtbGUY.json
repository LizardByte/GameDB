{"id": "LHkUHAtbGUY", "snippet": {"title": "Game Boy Color Longplay [123] Worms Armageddon", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nWorms Armageddon is a 1999 artillery strategy game developed by Team17 and ported to Game Boy Color by Infogrames. The player uses a team of Worms against another team of Worms, which controlled by a computer or human opponent. The goal is to kill the Worms on the other team using various weapons and be the last surviving Worm(s).\n\nGameplay is turn-based, with each team moving in sequence across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move one of its Worms. Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) teleport and fly with a jetpack. Each worm begins the round with a specific amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options. When hit with a weapon, the Worm will lose health depending on the power of the weapon and the directness of the hit. A Worm can be killed either by having its health reduced to zero or being knocked into the water around and below the level.\n\nThe Game Boy Color port has different physics compared to the original. It lacks many weapons and tools as well as a random level generator. It does have plenty of pre-designed levels, but most of them are hidden. Almost no weapons are available in standard mode, while the Deathmatch mode has more weapons but fewer levels. The first turn is not given randomly here, so player 1 always goes first. Only two teams can compete at a time, which is the worst part of the game in my opinion. Worm names are not displayed, however, teams of Worms themselves are different color, which is nice. Damage calculation is weird, especially for Bazooka, as direct hits do less damage than attacks into terrain near a targeted Worm.\n\nI show all levels, all modes and all weapons. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHkUHAtbGUY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHkUHAtbGUY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHkUHAtbGUY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Color Longplay [123] Worms Armageddon", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nWorms Armageddon is a 1999 artillery strategy game developed by Team17 and ported to Game Boy Color by Infogrames.
