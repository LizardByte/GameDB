On their path they will meet J\u00f6vla, a mysterious wanderer skilled with daggers, Laric, an apprentice alchemist with a lot of potential but very little self-esteem and Qibayn, an artist in constant search of inspiration.\n\nFollow the path of a legendary hero to shape your own story.", "summary": "Evering is an adventure RPG with a turn-based combat system and pixel art style that tells an epic story through witty and funny dialogues with charismatic characters in a completely unique and very detailed world where time loops around in circles.\n\nThis is an era of peace and the world faces no danger but if this legend turns out to be true... our days could be numbered.\n\nEvering is a love letter to nostalgia, a tribute to the games we grew up with, with a renewed look and feel, with no random encounters and accessibility options. You don\u2019t want to fight? That\u2019s okay, you can escape every combat with no punishment so you can follow the story at your pace.\n\nThe world of Evering is full of treasures, maestros and crystals to learn new skills and alchemy ingredients. There are secrets hidden in the last place you would imagine.
