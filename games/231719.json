Toad, Donkey Kong Jr., and Mario are the pedestrians in this version, walking at different speeds, while Yoshi is the character the player controls. In this version, four manhole covers can stay up at once, unlike in the original. The manhole covers can drop from characters stepping on them, causing the next pedestrian to fall if Yoshi does not act quickly. Yoshi can also hold a manhole cover in place to keep it from falling. He holds up the upper manhole covers with his head and the lower ones with his tongue. At 200, 500, and 700 points, a Chubby comes out of the ground and throws a heart for Yoshi to catch to remove a miss. This version also features music, with the tempo changing depending on the speed of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/manhole--2", "collections": [{"id": 242, "name": "Donkey Kong"}, {"id": 240, "name": "Super Mario"}, {"id": 5205, "name": "Game & Watch"}]}
