In it was a pair of magatama, one red and one white. The magatama is actually the sacred treasure of the Furude Shrine. With its magical powers, the holder of the red magatama would unconditionally fall in love with the holder of the white one. Upon testing its effects on the school faculty, the club members of a Hinamizawa school decided that they should duel each other to see which pair gets to keep the magatama. In the beginning it was only an afterschool club activity, but their game eventually engulfed all of Hinamizawa.", "summary": "Higurashi Daybreak is a doujin game developed and distributed by Twilight Frontier with the cooperation of 07th Expansion. Unlike the original sound novels, the game is a two-on-two versus third-person shooter based on the system of the Mobile Suit Gundam VS Series.\n\nCharacters from \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" utilize weapons such as bats and hatchets in battles set in Hinamizawa. The scenario is an original work by Ryukishi07 and does not feature the horror elements present in the source material. Despite being a doujin game, it employs the same voice actors as the original drama CDs and anime adaptation, which is unusual for fan-made games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/higurashi-daybreak", "collections": [{"id": 1298, "name": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"}, {"id": 8985, "name": "Higurashi Daybreak"}]}
