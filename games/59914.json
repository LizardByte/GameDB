As he wakes up, Katsu finds out that he missed the flight and Don and the others have already left for Hawaii without him.\n\nHe thinks forward about what can he do while no one is at home as he feels lonely before he settled on something: to become the top popularity star of the (singular) street.\n\nHow will Katsu do to accomplish this? By befriends the animals around the street!", "summary": "Atsumete\u2605Tomodachi Daisakusen! (lit. Gather Buddy Attack!) is the third Taiko videogame for the Wii U home console, and the second console game to be released in occasion of the 15th Anniversary of the Taiko no Tatsujin franchise; as such, the Game + Tatacon bundle of this title also includes a set of promotional goods related to the anniversary celebrations.\n\nThis installment inherits the signature multiplayer modes from the previous Wii U games (Baton Pass from Wii U Version and Intro Don! from Tokumori), with the addition of the new 'Buddy Attack' single-player mode, in which Taiko sibling Kat-Chan tries to become a popular star by befriending wild animals from the streets with music. Content unlocking through the Mekadon Gacha and DLC supports make their return, as well as the coming of Nintendo-exclusive features to the game like Miiverse support and, for the first time ever, compatibility with Nintendo's Amiibo figurines.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 35899, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "A38d59BijB4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A38d59BijB4", "title": "Wii U \u300c\u592a\u9f13\u306e\u9054\u4eba\u3000\u3042\u3064\u3081\u3066\u2605\u3068\u3082\u3060\u3061\u5927\u4f5c\u6226\u300dPV\u300011/26\u767a\u58f2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A38d59BijB4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
