The last sound you hear before the world becomes silent and motionless. Wind no longer blows, rain no longer falls. The world has become free of humans, animals and everything else that attests to the flow of time. Without a material body you traverse trough this new realm frozen in time. Days, weeks or perhaps even years go by as you lose yourself on this new adventure before even a moment in you old world passes.\n\nWelcome to World in a Moment, a photo collage exploration game."}
