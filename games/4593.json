Grabbing a crystal ball causes the player character's Kage's clothes to change to the next level in colour and thereby attain certain powers (bigger shuriken and/or faster speed); if Kage is hit while in green or orange clothes, he does not die but revert to his normal red clothes. Grabbing a scroll causes Kage to stand still and meditate for several seconds while approaching enemies drop to the ground dead (although the scrolls appear in the arcade version, the crystal balls do not).\n\nThis MSX version was brought without a license to the SG-1000 in Taiwan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-kage", "videos": [{"id": 120604, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "n6c_AX5kAfY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6c_AX5kAfY", "title": "Legend of Kage, The Complete Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n6c_AX5kAfY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
