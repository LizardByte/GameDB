{"id": "kwyjUwZ5mP8", "snippet": {"title": "Playmobil - Laura's Happy Adventures (English UK) (1998)", "description": "A long time ago, fairies lived freely in the deepest forests and the highest mountains.  One day, a fairy called Lumina flew over one of these mountains.  On the steepest slope she discovered the entrance to a little cave.  Lumina flew in to rest for a moment.  But a storm broke out the moment she was inside the cave, so she decided to stay until the storm was over.  Exhausted by her long journey and mesmerised by the beauty of the scenery, Lumina fell asleep.\n\nThe night was cool, so as she slept, Lumina covered herself with her wings.  However, as she did so she dropped her beautiful red, shining diamond  out of her bag.  This diamond was the fairies' lucky diamond.  When she awoke, the weather was glorious.  The sun was flooding into the cave and the sounds of nature filled her ears like a sweet melody.  Fully refreshed, Lumina set off on her journey again.  Unfortunately she had unknowingly left the cave without the diamond.  It was not until later that she realised her mistake.\nLumina, the little fairy had not realised that the mountain was actually a volcano.  The day after her visit to the cave, the volcano erupted.  Lava came pouring out of the mountain and spilled down its sides.  A river of lava ran into the cave and the diamond was washed away.  Then, as the years passed, the lava became hard so that the fairies' lucky diamond was imprisoned in the newly formed walls of the cave.  No one was able to find it again, not even any of the fairies.\n\nSeveral years later, an athletic nature-lover climbed the volcano.  His name was Henry.  He had a wonderful collection of stones and he wanted to add a piece of volcanic rock to it.  He climbed up to the cave and went in.  He looked around the inside of the cave in wonder.  The walls were covered with a solid lava;  Henry had found the ideal cave to find his piece of volcanic rock.  He took hold of his ice pick and scraped at one of the walls until a piece came away.  It was just the right size for the little boxes which held his collection.  Henry placed the stone carefully into his pocket and happily went home.\n\nThe moment he entered his house, Henry ran up to the attic.  He opened his little chest and placed the volcanic rock inside.  He took a good look at his collection and knew immediately that the rock fitted perfectly. Very pleased with himself, Henry came down from the attic and stretched out in the comfortable armchair in his little sitting room.  What he didn't know was that the fairies' lucky charm was still imprisoned in the volcanic rock.  And it would stay there until it was to be discovered many years later.\n\nCredits:\nSound and music:\nProduction director: Didier Lord\nAssistant artistic director:  Martin Klein\nProduction executive:  Chadi Lebbos\nSound design: Simon Ashby\nDesign of sound environment:  Josu\u00e9 Beaucage\nSound effects: \nDesign of sound effects: Jo Caron\nSound effects engineer: Tchae Measroch\nSound engineer: Daniel Bisson, Studios Modulations\nSound integration: Michel Marsan & Olivier Lambert  \nSound engineer - voices: Isabelle Cliche\nProduction coordinator: Carole Tr\u00e9panier\n\nMusic:\nComposer : Daniel Scott\nSound and mixing engineer (music) : Mario Brillon\nRecorded at Marko Studios, Montreal \n\nEnglish voices:\nCasting director: Emmanuelle Cosso\nLaura: Hester Wilcox\nCarmen-the greengrocer: Hester Wilcox\nViolet the florist: Lisa Jacobs\nRosie the Maid: Kim Broderick\nLumina: Sandy Bernard\nMother: Vivienne Vermes\nEliade: Vivienne Vermes\nFather: Peter Hudson\nMr Morris the Milkman: Peter Hudson\nCurly Coo the Acrobat: Peter Hudson\nPico the Parrot: Peter Hudson\nTheo the Tramp: Les Clack\nTommy: Patricia Kessler\nMiss Clara: Patricia Kessler\nAmelia: Particia Kessler\nGrandfather: Nicholas Hawtrey\nThe Diamond: Christopher Pearson\n\nInstallation Guide: On Windows 8, 8.1, or 10, you can open the ISO file with Windows Explorer (right-click open with).\n\nYou will now need to install nGlide for the game to work on newer systems: http://www.zeus-software.com/downloads/nglide Click on \"download\" and then \"open\" inside your browser.
