In the Orb Chamber after killing Alexander, right as he and his dreams vanish in a bluish mist. At this point, the shadow nor any of the servants are present in the Brennenburg castle. It's empty. Almost. Feeling of guilt is what Daniel goes through as he remembers leaving Agrippa alone, trapped in his human vessel, before he starts his journey out of the castle. Being in the lowest depths of the castle, Daniel has to go and follow his own footprints back. He was confident in his ability of ascending out of the darkness after he successfully descended into it. But something was off. He knew the feeling very well, the feeling of something lurking in the shadows. Going through The Chancel, Cistern Entrance, The Cistern, Prison North at a steady pace, with no signs of slowing down.. Daniel had frozen in fear. A lifeless body, nowhere to be found. Making him wonder whether the hellfire to wash away his sins was yet to be put out.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/amnesia-fleeing-brennenburg"}
