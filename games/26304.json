In one sense it\u2019s much better \u2014 the flat plain is well landscaped and teeming with buildings, radar towers and telegraph poles. The missiles, once fired, seemed to travel at a realistic speed. In another sense it\u2019s not so good \u2014 the enemy tanks don\u2019t appear as frequently and there aren\u2019t any flying saucers to contend with. On the other hand the enemy tanks aren\u2019t so over-intelligent at avoiding your fire, so you get a better sense of achievement! Rather poor sound and the hollow 3D graphics are colourless, but it\u2019s fun just wandering round looking at the buildings. Watch out for the special loader routine which makes it look as though the program isn\u2019t loading properly.\"[2]", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rommels-revenge"}
