{"id": "x3_wPx5PV0M", "snippet": {"title": "BoaBite 3D for PC", "description": "Came also out for:\n\n---\n\n\nGame description:\n\nBoaBite 3D is a variant of Snake, turning the concept into a 3D game and played from a first-person perspective. The player controls a Boa constrictor who wants to eat fruit. The game is played in a closed environment and the snake can be moved in any direction. Four movement keys are used to control the snake and this can be done in the normal control mode (left and right makes the snake turn) or in the elite control mode (named after the spaceship control in the C64 game Elite) where those keys make the snake roll left or right instead of just turning.\n\nSimilar to the original Snake, with each piece of fruit the Boa grows in length and it cannot touch any part of its own tail or the environment walls, or the game is over. The goal is to survive as long as possible while increasing the length, maneuvering in 3D space. The game perspective is not entirely first-person as a part of the head and the tongue is still visible, rather it resembles as if the camera is mounted on its head. There are different viewpoints available. Fruit spawns gradually and there are three types to collect. An apple adds four points to the length, a chili pepper adds six and speeds up movement until a next piece of fruit is picked up, and a mushroom adds eight and makes the speed change constantly until the next fruit, creating a wobbly effect.\n\nNext to single-player with different levels that progress when a certain length has been achieved, the game can be played in a vertically divided split-screen with two players on a single PC. In addition to the regular conditions the Boa cannot collide with the other player's tail whose snakes moves in the same environment and chases after the same pieces of fruit. When both snakes survive, the one with the most points wins when time runs out. Highscores are saved in a table.
