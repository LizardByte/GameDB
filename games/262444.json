The battle graphics have been improved, along with a cleaner layout, and several bugs have been fixed from previous versions. This is still novelty software, though, and probably could not be used to create a commercial game. This should be used as a practice tool for those starting off in game programming.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rpg-workshop-max-2"}
