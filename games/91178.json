To solve the patience, create descending \u201cruns\u201d of cards. The order goes from King to Ace, and has to be of the same suit to be discarded. On the tableau, single cards can be moved between the columns regardless of their suit or color, but only same-suit cards are allowed to be moved as a group. If no moves are available, you may deal another row of cards, as long as there are no empty cells on the table. Your final score for a game of patience depends on the number of moves, session time and the difficulty mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spider-solitaire--2", "videos": [{"id": 87717, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8kTbwCT1Jlk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kTbwCT1Jlk", "title": "Spider Solitaire", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8kTbwCT1Jlk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
