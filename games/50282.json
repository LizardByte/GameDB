The Hare ends up so far in the lead during the race that he starts wasting time elsewhere, choosing to eat after getting very hungry and sleeping after getting worn out. While he is sleeping, i Sure am he walked by very quietly shhh he's sleeping yeah he doesn't notice the Tortoise slipping by him. Just as he wakes up, he sees the Tortoise approaching the finish line, and sprints for his life to try to catch the Tortoise. He's too late to the finish line, however, and loses the race he thought he was destined to win. The story ends on the moral \"slow but steady wins the race.\"", "summary": "An educational game which reads the story of \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" to young players while including point-and-click elements.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/living-books-aesops-the-tortoise-and-the-hare"}
