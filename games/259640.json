He hears a cry for help and meets a little elf who is asking for his help. The elf wants Elliot to save the elf world from a wizard's spell. To do this, the elf gives Elliot a great power: he can become the animal he touches. But there's a catch - the power will fade at dawn, so Elliot must hurry up!\n\nAs Elliot crosses through the hole in the centennial broccoli tree, he enters the elves world. But nothing is as it seems in this fantasy world, and everything gets more complicated with every step. Elliot must use his shapeshifting power to overcome obstacles and challenges in five chapters full of humour and mystery. Each chapter presents a different environment - land, sea, air, and even under the ice. Choose the animal that best suits each of the environments and help the elf save their world.", "summary": "Are you ready for an unforgettable adventure?
