The objective is to collect all keys on each screen and then heading to the safe, all the while avoiding some of the strangest enemies to appear in a computer game. This is a game where timing and forward planning are of the essence and it will take many, many attempts before you master each of the levels.\n\nBefore tackling each level, it's well worth spending a few seconds analysing positions of keys and plotting the best route to the safe. Many of the platforms disintegrate when touched, meaning that once you've crossed them there is no going back. Finding yourself in a position where you have, quite literally burnt your bridges, is an all-too-common occurrence leaving the level in a state where it cannot be completed.\n\nBlagger is very much a game of it's time and is likely to be divisive amongst gamers, with some enjoying the challenge whilst others are likely to give up in frustration after the first few screens. All games in the genre are invariably hard as nails, but Blagger is easier than similar titles, such as China Miner.\n\nThe simplistic graphics and sound meant that there was more memory available for content and, with thirty levels in total, Blagger represents pretty good value for money (providing you like this sort of game).\n\nFor fans of the genre Blagger is a solid entry and if you want a solid challenge then this game delivers.\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXejMDqxxyg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXejMDqxxyg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXejMDqxxyg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXejMDqxxyg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXejMDqxxyg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Blagger Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Antony Crowther and published by Alligata Software in 1983.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nSo today I decided to go back in time to one of the earlier releases in the C64's extensive library, one which happens to be one of the first games made commercially available by a certain Mr. Antony \"Tony\" Crowther.\n\nBlagger is flick-screen collect 'em up cut very much from the same cloth as Manic Miner, also released that same year.
