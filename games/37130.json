It continues the story and offers four more isometric levels of fiendish puzzles.\n\nAfter defeating Dianos, Karadoc returns to the inn only to find his employers gone, and every living person within the city either dead or transformed into a monster. Seeking the cause behind this, the dwarf fights his way to the local temple, and finds the answers - and his money - deep down in the crypts.\n\nGameplay is similar. Cadaver: The Payoff has only four levels, but they are significantly larger than those of the first game, and the second level has a large number of monsters and scant possibilities to heal.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cadaver-the-payoff"}
