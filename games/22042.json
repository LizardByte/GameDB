Unlike their fathers, Trex and Sam are not very successful on the ring and don't have many fans.\n\nTrex is an egocentric maniac that tries desperately to achieve success, but is actually an insecure nerd on the inside. He's Muscle Sam childhood friend and he's one of the few people that can understand what he says.\n\nMuscle Sam most distinctive tract is that he's an anthropomorphic cat, but it's not a weird occurrence in a world where everyone impersonates their gimmick. He's not a very talkative guy, mostly because very few people can understand what he says. What Sam thinks is a mystery: sometimes he acts like a very brilliant person, sometimes like an instinctive animal.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trex-and-muscle-sam-a-new-kickstart"}
