{"id": "OjkHN4XuQR0", "snippet": {"title": "Stellaris: Federations - Expansion Announcement Teaser", "description": "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. With the Stellaris: Federations expansion, players can extend their diplomatic dominion over the galaxy like never before. Use every trick in the book to gain an edge on friend and foe alike, with a host of new options to influence, manipulate, and dominate without firing a shot.\n\nFeatures include:\nExpanded Federations: With expanded diplomacy capabilities, players can build up the internal cohesion of their Federations and unlock powerful rewards for all members. Whether you join a Trade League, Martial Alliance, or Hegemony, membership can be extremely advantageous. \nGalactic Community: Unite the space empires with a galactic senate that can vote on a wide range of resolutions to drive legislative agendas. For example, players can pass a resolution to increase commitments to collective defense or funnel profit towards wealthy elites. Members can also sanction those who defy the community, and enact a single galactic focus. Sway the senate to position yourself as a leader, trading favors and maneuvering, doing whatever it takes to gain influence among schemers.\nOrigins: Each empire has a story that shapes its path. Give your civilization deeper roots with the new system of Origins. By choosing an Origin, players can flesh out their empire\u2019s background and alter its starting conditions. Whether it\u2019s Void Dwellers who have abandoned their homeworld to live in perpetual orbit, or a society that worships and protects a powerful Tree of Life, you can lay the groundwork wisely for the seeds of your empire.\nNew constructions: Construct glorious new projects for your empire like the Juggernaut, a massive mobile starbase that provides a moveable repair base even in enemy territory, or the Mega Shipyard, a new megastructure that can churn out fleets with incredible speed. Offering both tactical advantages and a good dose of shock and/or awe, these are sure to be an asset to any space empire.\n\nParadox on YouTube:\n---------------------------------\nParadoxInteractive - http://youtube.com/ParadoxInteractive\nTrailers, Feature Breakdowns, Dev Diaries, and more.\n\nParadoxExtra - http://youtube.com/ParadoxExtra\nGameplay of our video games, convention coverage, and other fun things from Paradox!\n\nParadox Grand Strategy - http://youtube.com/ParadoxGrandStrategy\nGameplay of our Grand Strategy Games.
