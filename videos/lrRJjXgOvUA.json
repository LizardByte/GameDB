This game is a shoot'n up, where the player commands a helicopter and needs to rescue refenses and take them back to the base located at the beginning of each stage.\n\nWith the helicopter we can move to the left and right, but we can also rise in the air, which will be essential to avoid some shots of the enemies. Our helicopter can shoot in various ways, depending on the position you are in. We can place the nose looking left or right, and the vehicle will then shoot that direction, but we can also put it looking forward, in which case it will shoot down. To rescue the hostages we just have to land, trying not to get off too quickly or the helicopter will suffer damage, and they will take charge. At each level we have to rescue a certain number of them, but we only have the capacity to transport 10 per time, so when we fill the quota we have to return to the base so that they go down and go to the building and return to the others.\n\nThe helicopter also has several types of missiles and bombs, as well as items like the CF (which for those who do not know, serves to deflect enemy guided missiles to prevent them from hitting you, although this item could have been more optimized) and the white ball (which guarantees invincibility for a few seconds)\n\nIt's a good game, at the time we rent video game cartridges I used to play this game because it came in multi-game cartridges. All the hostages were rescued at all stages! I hope you enjoy the video.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lrRJjXgOvUA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lrRJjXgOvUA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lrRJjXgOvUA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lrRJjXgOvUA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lrRJjXgOvUA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Longplay] SNES - Choplifter III - Rescue Survive (4K, 60FPS)", "description": "Played by xRavenXP (me)\n\nThis is the longplay of the game Choplifter III - Rescue Survive, for the Super Nintendo!
