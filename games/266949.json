This sounds easy, right? Wrong! Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs. In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the \"power ball\" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the \"E\" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear. The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bomb-jack--10"}
