In Can Androids Survive, you are a battlefield courier, sent to an active warzone on the Moon to deliver supplies to Starbound Alliance bases--even if it costs your life in the process. Battle a draining fuel gauge, hordes of mechanized hazards, and a treacherous lunar surface to unravel the nature of your existence. Jettison fuel through your exhaust ports to escape stellar float mines and launch your chassis across craters. End the war itself--by destroying the field.\n\nIn 2143, a rogue AI commandeers the defense satellites surrounding a dead Earth, and blows up the Moon.\n\nThis is how you do it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 54458, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "vP8e70Tresg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP8e70Tresg", "title": "Can Androids Survive - LAUNCH TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vP8e70Tresg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
