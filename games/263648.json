It is a utopian apocalypse fantasy, a forever-camping world narrowed to linear miles of RVs parked under a mountain, the people who live in them, and the systems that interconnect them, both social and material.\n\nThe game was commissioned for Solar Protocol, a network of solar powered servers that connects from whatever server is in the most sunshine. It is programmed for the browser, with low-energy use and computational power front of mind. The entire story is told via spatialized text - no images, no libraries, just divs and textboxes and basic javascript.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/drift-mine-satellite"}
