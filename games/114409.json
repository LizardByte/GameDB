This AI\u2019s quest for preservation sets players out into the stars to pilot space cruisers and engage in furious combat that allows them to destroy their enemies using advanced technologies, fortify their ships from damage, and board enemy ships. Once the boarding party lands on the enemy ship, players will enter a first-person perspective as they infiltrate and eradicate enemy forces from the inside out. Destroying control points and clearing the ship gives one control over their enemy\u2019s ship. Capturing ships and completing missions generate payouts to the victor, which take the form of XP, weapons, ammo, and in-game credits.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 24358, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0RjVNC2lVlY"}]}
