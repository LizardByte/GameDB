I use filters, high resolutions and hacking skills to bring you these videos. If you want a perfectly smooth 60fps experience,  use Firefox as your browser. Chrome, Vivaldi and other browsers drop a lot of frames. The best looking quality is only in 1440p (mostly for 3d games), others are significantly worse.
