Also features some modified progs, like rotation, breaking walls, and cutscenes.\n\nMade by mexx (Marcus Dromowicz), the earliest \"big name\" in the Quake modding scene back in 1996 (not even one year past its release). Penumbra of Domination is considered by many to be mexx's finest work and is one of the few early Quake maps which stood the test of time, using limited tools.\n\nMap packs were rare back then, and having more than two maps was considered out-of-the-ordinary.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quake-penumbra-of-domination", "videos": [{"id": 66357, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7D1BhWi8JCg"}]}
