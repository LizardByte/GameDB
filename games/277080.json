There\u2019s no shame in using them!\nI\u2019ll also have a full developer commentary on my Youtube channel of course, so if you need help figuring out how to beat a certain level, or if you just want to sit back and see the whole game, that option is available as well.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/takua-64", "videos": [{"id": 101834, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VvJWO8d8GTE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvJWO8d8GTE", "title": "Takua 64 Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvJWO8d8GTE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
