As of recording and uploading this, the game was released two days ago. It is a remake/revision of the original Shadowgate, a point and click adventure game originally released on a variety of computers in the 1980's, as well as later the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy Color. This remake was a Kickstarter-backed game, which is how I received my copy of the game. For those interested in checking it out, you can get it on Steam, or DRM free through other places like the Humble Store.
