Fallout: London stands apart from its contemporaries and offers an entirely new experience: setting a Fallout game outside of the United States. True to its moniker, Fallout: London takes place IN London. From stuffy parliamentary aristocrats to a resurrection of the Knights of the Round Table to an uncompromising cult of revolutionaries (and more!), Fallout: London embodies the history and aesthetics of London and puts an unmistakably nuclear spin on the beloved city.\n\nFallout: London\u2019s development is labor-intensive and involves a plethora of eclectic cross-discipline individuals, both at amateur and industry level. The team maintains a strong sense of professionalism and devotion to the craft. Everyone on the Fallout: London team shares a deep love of videogames, and most importantly, Fallout itself. Each member of the Fallout: London team is individually recruited for their contributions and talent in the realms of game design and modding.", "videos": [{"id": 72892, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zzGG-eImQ_Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzGG-eImQ_Q", "title": "Fallout London - Official Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zzGG-eImQ_Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
