After having supplied you with supplies on the island of Cuba and heading towards the Yticat\u00e1n region to unravel its innumerable mysteries, our man has been shipwrecked in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. Totally helpless, without friends, without weapons and without money, he manages to arrive, by a pure miracle, on the island of Cozumel, where he finds traditions, rites and the spiritual world that he gradually understands and respects until he masters his environment. \n \nBut, as the wise man said, history repeats itself, and while it is true that you have managed to get out of Cozumel alive, you find yourself again in unknown waters and in front of strange lands. \nHaving used all your earnings to buy the boat, you do not have a dog (as it is becoming usual for you) and you have to face new mysteries in two of the oldest temples in northern Yucatan. What happens and the final result ONLY YOU ARE NOW THE RESPONSIBLE.", "summary": "\"Los Templos Sagrados\" is the second part of the adventure tritogy \"LEGENDS OF CI-U-THAN\" that covers a period and a fairly extensive area of \u200b\u200bthe geohistory of Yucat\u00e1n. \nThe CI-U-THAN epic consists of three totally independent books and, therefore, such an extensive project has had to be developed in three complete games of several parts each. \nThe first book, divided into two parts, narrated your adventures from the arrival on the island of Cozumel as a poor and helpless castaway, until your triumphant departure from it. \n \nIn this second book, \"LOS TEMPLOS SAGRADOS\", you will have to find Chich\u00e9n ltz\u00e1 through the ruins of Cob\u00e1 and Tulum. \nThe third book, \"THE MYSTERY OF CHICHEN ITZA\", will tell us about the fabulous final outcome in the most famous Mayan temple: Chich\u00e9n ltz\u00e1. \nSo, now you have the opportunity to continue with the story of the famous adventurer and archaeologist Doc Monro in the lands of the archaic Mayan culture.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/los-templos-sagrados", "videos": [{"id": 43858, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "oVst8R4p4vw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVst8R4p4vw", "title": "Los Templos Sagrados (Atari ST) - parte 1 - castellano", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVst8R4p4vw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
