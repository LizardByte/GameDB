And thanks to our special guests, we have our first licensed song by none other than DRAGONFORCE! They have kindly provided us with our first licensed song, TROOPERS OF THE STARS off their new album EXTREME POWER METAL (available now, so go grab/listen to it!).\n\nDownload Clone Hero v.23 here!: https://clonehero.net/releases/v0.23.1/\nClone Hero Discord server: https://discordapp.com/Hsn4Cgu\n\nA new UI overhaul, online multiplayer, A LICENSED SONG, and a whole bunch of other fixes and QOL improvements await you. What are you waiting for? DragonForce themselves to download the game for you?\n\nWith v.23, we are really close to the end of our journey with Clone Hero and will soon be switching over to StrikeLine. That's not to say that Clone Hero won't receive any more updates, as we'll likely fix any major bugs and introduce Drums towards the end of the year. Thanks for being here with us, we've got lots more coming in the future!\n\nPlease do be aware of a few things though in v.23:\nBecause of changes to both the song cache format and player profiles, both will need to be recreated when you first launch v.23. So if your profiles are gone and you're waiting impatiently for the scanning to be done, don't panic (and please don't bug the Discord staff about it) because this is intended. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it happens.\nOnline multiplayer will require sharing your IP address with others (if you are hosting), so be careful and only give your IP out to people you trust and DO NOT show it on stream or in videos. You can use tunneling services like Hamachi or VPN's, but be aware you still need to be smart about who you play with.\nAnd rest be assured, your scores are waiting for you in v.23.\n\nGo show these guys how great the community can be!\nhttps://dragonforce.com/shows/\nhttps://dragonforce.com/release/extreme-power-metal/\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/hermanli/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OCsLYR2GIDU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OCsLYR2GIDU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OCsLYR2GIDU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OCsLYR2GIDU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Clone Hero v.23 Release : DragonForce - Troopers of the Stars", "description": "V.23 is here!
