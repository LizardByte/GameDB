It is based on the adventures of Hercules who the player controls as he travels the Greek countryside (as well as some other locations in the Mediterranean) in his quest to defeat the gorgon Medusa. To do so five magical items have to be collected which is done by completing tasks for Hermes and Athena. At the same time Hercules has to be aware of the wrath of Hera, who will try to stop him. Time is limited as the player only has seventeen days of in-game time to complete the quest.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ancient-glory"}
