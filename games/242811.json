You play as a psychically-attuned stranger to town who has a feeling that there's more to some of these people than meets the eye. Lucky for you, you're charming enough that people trust you with a whole host of secrets.\n\nVisit various different locations around Greenvale and talk to the cast. Collect illustrated trading cards after getting to know people through dialogue options. View a range of familiarly odd items with new descriptions. Even flirt with the people you've made friends with, if you're so inclined.\n\nFriendly Premonition is a talking sim where you can meet every character from the original game and listen to them talk your ear off about a range of interests. Once they've run out of specific topics, they'll eagerly share whatever thought enters their head. A select number of characters even have special mechanics for you after you've talked to them enough, so make sure you check back.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/friendly-premonition"}
