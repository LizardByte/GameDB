So many great games from Ocean released around the same time and this was quite the let down. Its really short and you play the beat em up section 3 times. The puzzle parts are probably the only good bits of the game even if I did mess them up. The game does have alot of good colour use though which looked good in the magazines so didn't look a bad game at that point. reviews of 70% or more though just shows how much they over hyped games to help get em sold and for the writers to get the free games ;)\n\nThe bike riding bit was annoying and always took a few goes to get right. Helicopter chase was easy and the beat em up bits can go either way depending on how fast the T1000 abuses the same move all the time. The music, what there is of it is abit naff too. Also what happened to the scrolling terminator intro that graced other versions! -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4_T5C5jnvI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4_T5C5jnvI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4_T5C5jnvI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "ZX Spectrum Longplay [058] Terminator 2", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nTerminator 2 for the Spectrum 128k\n\nWhat a letdown this was.
