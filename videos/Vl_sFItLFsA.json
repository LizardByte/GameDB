You will have to bring your logistics game to a whole new level with these prisons, as you need to use a variety of new tools to make sure they run as intended. From ferries to helicopters, you will be able to deliver supplies directly to docking areas, and to maximize efficiency by linking them to specific deliveries \u2013 but be careful, as this also means more access points to sneak in contraband into your prison!\n\nLuckily, you will also have new security objects that will allow you to inspect deliveries and prisoners as they enter the prison, or at key security checkpoints. You will also have access to additional emergency services when things get out of hand. Air Firefighters, Elite Ops Teams, Air Paramedic \u2013 we made sure you have all the support you need when things take an unexpected turn.\n\nIf you want to find out more about the expansion over the next few weeks, remember to follow us on social media and check our weekly streams on Tuesday at 15:00 CEST (6:00AM PDT) \u2013 we may show the new content over the next few weeks!\n\nPrison architect on Twitter: https://twitter.com/PrisonArchitect\nPrison architect on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PlayPrisonArchitect\nParadox Interactive on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/paradoxinteractive\n\nParadox on YouTube:\r\n---------------------------------\r\nParadoxInteractive - http://youtube.com/ParadoxInteractive\r\nTrailers, Feature Breakdowns, Dev Diaries, and more.\r\n\r\nParadoxExtra - http://youtube.com/ParadoxExtra\r\nGameplay of our video games, convention coverage, and other fun things from Paradox!\r\n\r\nParadox Grand Strategy - http://youtube.com/ParadoxGrandStrategy\r\nGameplay of our Grand Strategy Games.
