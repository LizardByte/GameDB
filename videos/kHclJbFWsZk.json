Come with us back to the Middle Ages where WOOD is the cutting edge, leading energy source!\n\nWhy? Because there\u2019s MACHINEGUNS THAT SHOOT BOMBS. That\u2019s why.\n\nWOODPUNK brings you back to the Middle Ages, but with a catch: You are an expert inventor who (stupidly) chose a science career in an era dominated by art majors. Using wood and other scrap material, you\u2019ve made yourself the ultimate tool: A robot that can create weapons.\nThis grotesque and brut- \u2026 uh - This \u201cclassy interactive experience\u201d features:\n\nExhilarating pixel shooter action with virtually endless variations of level designs allowing for new challenges every time you play\nA wide arsenal of procedurally generated weapons, both melee and ranged, with over 1400 possible creations \nBattle over a hundred enemies on screen at a time, each with different strategies and fighting styles, along with massive bosses!\nBeauty from destruction: Everything inside the map is destroyable. Trees crumble, boxes explode into the air and entire 2-story buildings collapse. Corpses, pieces of furniture and rubble are all left behind, and can have special gameplay effects later on!\nPlay with a friend! Asymmetrical local multiplayer: One player plays the inventor, the other plays the robot, each with their own complementary skills. \nResearch new weapon parts to build your custom weapons. Develop and unlock new modules to expand your robot\u2019s combat capabilities or enhance your own.\nFast-paced, action-packed gameplay with slick and responsive controls in 60 FPS. Prepare to sweat! \nOh, and it\u2019s gamepad compatible, of course!\n\n\u2026 and all the yadda-yadda that every other rogue-like has: Random levels, random pickups, all that random generation stuff that you love.
