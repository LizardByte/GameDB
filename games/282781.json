Given the fact that the Supercharger allowed for more memory and larger games, Sweat! probably would have been an amazing game had it been completed. Of course this never happened as the video game market was crumbling rapidly and people weren't spending money on regular video games, much less games that required special hardware. It was around this time that the financially troubled Starpath merged with Epyx. Most of Starpath's programmers transferred over to Epyx and used Sweat!'s game concept to create Summer Games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sweat-the-decathlon-game"}
