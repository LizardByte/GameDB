In addition to the standard Mahjong mode, there is a tournament mode with a slight RPG aspect to it, in that the player can enhance certain stats after winning games in order to increase their odds in future rounds of the tournament.\n\nThe game is a one-on-one version of the game, less common in real-life Mahjong games but the standard for computer adaptations due to the reduced complexity of having only a single AI opponent. Nihon Bussan was responsible for Family Mahjong II's development and was at the time fairly well known for their Mahjong Arcade games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/family-mahjong-ii-shanghai-he-no-michi"}
