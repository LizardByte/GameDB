It also features a new unique boss that replaces the conventional D'Sparil fight from Episode 3.\n\nChronologically it takes place between ArgonianLord's first release, Tower of Chaos and its sequel, A New World. But you need not have played ToC to enjoy Sitnalta, as it doesn't feature story and dialogue as much as those two.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sitnalta"}
