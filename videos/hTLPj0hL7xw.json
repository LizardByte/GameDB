See how many characters you can see from classic games from the 80's and 90's. From Monkey Island to Earth Worm Jim to Space Invaders.\n\nG'day! My name's Paypercutts and welcome to my dev log channel for my game Swooping Justice.\nI'd like to show you the very early stages and concepts of my game that I've been working on over the last 9 ish months. A game where you play as an Australian Magpie, who's job it is to go out on missions, swooping and pooping on suss so and so's, and people who deserve to be swooped and pooped on.\n\nThe main idea of this dev log series is to show people what skills a new game developer must learn and what tasks to accomplish as they progress through their project.\n\nI'm less than a year into game dev, at the time of this recording, so you can see episode by episode, how I grow as I learn and how the game comes together as I build it.\nI'm a solo developer with a long history in PC gaming. I'm still obsessed with the nostalgia of all the games I grew up playing, from the 80's and 90's, from the NES to DOS games, through to various Xbox consoles.\n\nI use Aseprite for the pixel art and animations and I use GameMaker Studio 2 as my preferred game engine.\nI've also played around alot with Unity, Construct 3, GDevelop and Godot\n\n\nWishlist Swooping Justice on steam now!
