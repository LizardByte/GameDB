It uses the \"true space physics\", seen in games such as Elite and I-War, which means the ship will continue moving in one direction until the engines are fired in another direction (unlike games such as Wing Commander where the ship handles like an airplane). The storyline in the default campaign (more are downloadable from their official web site) is centered around the Shadow War.\n\nDanger and Opportunity is a prequel campaign to the game with 3 training missions and 5 full missions based on a stand-alone prologue storyline\n\nThe game's title comes from the last issue of DC\u2019s Babylon 5 comic In Valen\u2019s Name (written by J. Michael Straczynski and Peter David). According to the comic, these were Valen\u2019s final words recorded by Babylon 4 station. The story of the game is set around this phrase.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/babylon-5-ive-found-her-danger-and-opportunity", "videos": [{"id": 128298, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "v3zUFLQ0X-4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3zUFLQ0X-4", "title": "Babylon 5: I've Found Her", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v3zUFLQ0X-4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 128299, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "5O-0tWz8jkk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O-0tWz8jkk", "title": "Babylon 5: I've Found Her \"Danger And Opportunity\" Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5O-0tWz8jkk/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 128300, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VQkEYZpzlv4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQkEYZpzlv4", "title": "Babylon 5 I've Found Her Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VQkEYZpzlv4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
