Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It\u2019s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She\u2019s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren\u2019t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.\n\nJust like the first game, This Is the Police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. It won\u2019t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. Every challenge requires the player\u2019s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. Now your subordinates aren\u2019t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.", "summary": "Interpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff's department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate. Make tough decisions - and try to keep out of prison yourself \u2013 in this story-driven mixture of adventure, strategy, and turn-based tactical combat.\nIs it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle?
