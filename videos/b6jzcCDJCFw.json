Got a yearning for learning? Or just keen to build an educational masterpiece? Two Point Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. For the first time, build on the outside as you develop a blank canvas of greenery into your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. Place benches and tennis courts. Build a Cheeseball arena, complete with stands. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance).\n\nNot the usual fare\n\nBut, of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Two Point game without a twist. Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies.\n\nThe academic year\u2026 is here!\n\nTake advantage of the opportunity to spend way more time with the little people in your university. The academic year begins with a summer break, giving you enough time to get everything looking great before your students move in. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked!\n\nShaping the students of the future\n\nBut it\u2019s not just work hard. Oh, no. It\u2019s play hard, too. For your university students aren\u2019t all bookish 24/7. You\u2019ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they\u2019re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud.
