The empire kept their religion as their base form for governing and declared all their laws to be divine. After years of the rest of the world resenting the empire for its prosperity, more armies from the north joined forces to bring the empire into their clutches. A coordinated attack on the Egyptian empire was in full force and for the first time, the empire of Egypt could not defend itself from the onslaught. The Egyptian empire managed to use their superior technology, with the Nile as their power source, to create powerful automatons to defend their empire from the invaders. After the great war, the empire decided to use these terrifying automatons as part of their police force, further oppressing the people. Many were slaughtered from the war, and many more from their own government.\n\nYou play as a slave to the Egyptian empire that was born of sacred lineage, blessed by a religious leader that wishes to stop the oppressive nature of the empire. Your sacred lineage grants you awesome powers you can use to end the empire\u2019s oppression once and for all or become a brand new tyrant the likes of which the world has never seen.", "summary": "Honored is a stealth, action-adventure game where the player uses various gadgets and powers to knock out or kill enemies in order to escape and take down the Egyptian empire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/honored"}
