A simple feud with the Mac Daddy of Planet Earth descends into wild cosmic conspiracy, as Frebb disrupts and uncovers the true purpose of a year-long party and its connections with a mysterious alien super-fuel!", "summary": "If you ever wondered how a Kirby inspired action-platformer would play if you ditched the copy gimmicks and smashed the speedometer, Frebbventure is the game for you! With four playable characters, you've got plenty of movesets to master, and a variety of special bonus medals will reward you for learning the levels, too. Collect them all to unlock bonus stages, and peel back the layers of a shocking secret.\n\nBeware on your quest, as Ulcethot has many friends in high places. A colorful rogue's gallery of boss characters and monsters are waiting around every corner to thwart Frebb's efforts, so never let your guard down and always be prepared for the worst!\n\nThe tricky platforming and countless hectic boss fights might get a bit overwhelming at times, but fear not, because an imaginative and humorous plot (that's still not afraid to raise the stakes!) is there to accompany you through. Frebbventure explores and lampoons the absurdity of culturally-approved rebellion and mass-market edginess through a manipulatively hip villain, a mercilessly unindulgent hero, and a comically mismatched supporting cast.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frebbventure", "videos": [{"id": 74232, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lJpsHYpv9Zo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJpsHYpv9Zo", "title": "Frebbventure - SAGE '22 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lJpsHYpv9Zo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
