It turns out that it was invented by Gray's grandfather, to give his grandson a message from the past. The fact is that the inventor was in love with the mysterious Mona Lisa, which he asks his grandson and his friends to find. But not everything is as easy as it might seem at first glance.\n\nBefore you go in search of the Mona Lisa, you have to find the very grandfather of Gray, and for this - to find and unravel clues scattered throughout the different eras. The most important thing - to look carefully around and collect everything you can find. These items will be very useful to time travelers.\n\nThe road ahead is long, but when it happily ends, you can relax and dance to your heart's content!", "summary": "A Ukrainian point & click adventure game.
