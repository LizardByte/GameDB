These Great Gates remained closed and stood tall above the various landscapes. The life forms that lived across the solar system created settlements near and around these colossal monuments. They lived in packs and developed civilizations, some advanced, some primitive, and some in-between. This time was known as the \"Pre-curser Era\", and similar to the species that currently inhabit Earth today, they all sought to survive and were heavily driven by the same pursuit of expansion.\nOn earth, all continents were physically connected as one, on Mars skies were blue and oceans filled to the brim with water, Mercury although hot, remained host to creatures and species that adapted to its conditions. Jupiter's moons were bountiful with lifeforms of all shapes and sizes roaming about. Their worlds were reminiscent of that of our current, being culturally diverse with a thirst for knowledge and power.\nThe population of each civilization was a mere fraction of our current day figures which allowed their worlds filled with natural resources and possibilities to go untouched for long periods of time. The Pre-curser era was a peaceful time, and with no conflict, the lifeforms grew restless and ready for conflict.\nThe peaceful times would be short-lived for there was a galactic phenomenon that occurred every 100 years called the \"Cosmic Eclipse\". Similar to a Solar eclipse as we know it today, it blanketed all the planets in total darkness for a short while. However, unlike our solar eclipse today, the darkness caused all Enders Gates across the universe to activate simultaneously.\nDuring the Cosmic Eclipse, all habitable plants would face a fierce storm causing lightning to cross the skies, oceans to rise from the seas, earthquakes splitting the earth, and finally, like clockwork, war horns blowing from the Gates themselves creating an ominous unforgettable rallying call bringing an end to all the chaotic storm that ravaged the land.\nAs each gate opened, it revealed a new world, however, through the dust settling were figures, often unrecognizable to the opposing faction.\n\nAmong the chaos, one thing was always certain, War.", "summary": "Enders Gate is a new digital Trading Card Game with over 300 collectible digital trading cards featuring stunning hand-drawn art from artists around the world, the possibilities are endless.
