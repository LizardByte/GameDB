The team needs to neutralize threads and can choose between six different agencies, such as GSG-9, NOCS, Team Alfa and the SAS. The player can only control one team member at a time, but issue general commands to the other two members such as \"follow\" or \"hold\". At any time, it is possible to directly take control of any of the other team members. This is useful as every agent has access to different weaponry, but the game also encourages the player to place agents in tactical positions to provide cover fire when entering new areas.\n\nMissions consist of securing objectives and taking out the opposition. Weapons, ammo or health do not need to be collected. Each agent has a number of different weapons and can switch between them. These include handguns, shotguns, machine guns and sniper rifles. There is a zoom option, a melee attack and the agents can duck or prone when the situation requires it. A mini-map in the top right corner keeps track of enemy opposition and the location of objectives. Next to the singleplayer campaign mode, each unlocked mission becomes available in a cooperative multiplayer mode where each agent can be controlled by a different player.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eurocops"}
