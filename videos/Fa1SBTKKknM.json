Unfortunately, when the game was over, it went unnoticed, largely because it didn\u2019t have an appropriate distribution. Luckily it has been rescued, adapted to work correctly in current operating systems and some small bugs have been corrected.\n\nWe really hope you have a good time playing it and remember the old days! And if you can do it in company\u2026 Better than better! Of course, you will have to do it locally, with the same computer and seeing them faces.
