Duke's problem lies on the fact that communications are being interrupted by the leaking of said mineral from a capsule that was accidentally destroyed, and the matter, when being vaporized, it generated this huge storm that puts the entire zone in jeopardy by the mere fact that the dam where the company used to substract it's energy, is being collapsed and about to crumble, with the fore coming catastrophe, Duke must enter the mine to find the mineral core and destroy it to prevent the invasion of the aliens.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rush-back"}
