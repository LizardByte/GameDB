Using the stylus as a universal crafting tool, crafters will sew, mold, glue, cut and paint under Mama's masterful direction. Best of all, players can use each of their creations within the game itself: dress Mama up in a new apron you've sewn or even fly a freshly folded paper airplane. In addition, new materials, colors and patterns are available to customize each project, and multiplayer support lets players create with a friend. Crafting Mama is guaranteed to turn Mama fans into crafty creators in no time!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crafting-mama"}
