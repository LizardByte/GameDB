The fun never stops as you grow grass, feed chickens, collect eggs and take your produce to market. From there, you'll spend the money you earn on additional buildings that produce exciting new products, including delicious steaks, tasty cakes and quaint down-home apparel.\n\nYou've got to stay on your sun-kissed toes, though, to keep the bears from tearing up your farm. Thankfully, dogs are on hand to help drive them away! With tons of levels to complete, plenty of hidden gags to find, and an empty shelf begging to be filled with trophies for outstanding achievements, Farm Frenzy 2 will keep you busy throughout the dog days of summer and long after the harvest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farm-frenzy-2", "videos": [{"id": 116883, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "la8VEvz48JU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la8VEvz48JU", "title": "Farm Frenzy 2 | Gameplay Part 1 (Level 1 to 8)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/la8VEvz48JU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
