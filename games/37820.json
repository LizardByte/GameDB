Interaction with non-player characters is possible while at the shopping district. Players can also gamble by placing wagers on other bicycle racing events,[5] buying parimutuel tickets with the chance of winning a respectable sum. Acquiring a newspaper to pick up results from other races can be done within the downtown portion of the game.\n\nThere are nine competitors and five laps in a typical race. Every track that can be raced on using a bicycle is an velodrome with four superelevated turns that are typical in most velodromes. Riders are not always traveling at full speed or at a specific radius; making a balance between aggressive riding and passive riding a must. All information for particular races are viewable on an information bank that is included with the racing action. Players must choose between story and party modes that provide a different perspective of the bicycle racing lifestyle.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-keirin"}
