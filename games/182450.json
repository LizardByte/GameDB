Later, this dark essence awoke 3 Gods, Melora, Moradin and later Faron.\n\nThe Gods arose from this emptiness, it is not known for sure where they came from or if they always existed and they simply awoke at some point from their deep sleep.\n\nMelora, Goddess of nature, of serene personality, kind, just and of great power, Moradin, God of civilization and invention, strong and impartial personality and lastly Faron, God of the underworld, of the kingdom of the dead, Owner of a ruthless personality , it was disgusting, insensitive, monstrous and few had the courage to pronounce his name.\n\nAt a certain moment, Melora with her great power felt the need to start the creation of the world and for that to decide to call Moradin and Faron, who at that moment had not yet revealed his chaotic personality.\n\nMoradin immediately accepted the idea and joined efforts while Faron rejected it, but he remained at a distance following all the work of Melora and Moradin.\n\nWhen Melora and Moradin's work started to take shape, it aroused in Faron one of his darkest feelings, envy, and at that moment Faron kept thinking about a way to transform that perfect creation into something different, that is, the more the creation of the world became a success the more his envy grew and for him the only way to alleviate that feeling was to boycott the creation process.\n\nFaron initiated the creation of a spell to try to curse Moradin and thus change the course of creation, however every time Faron tried to use the spell, Melora with his keen sense of magic, warned that something was happening and Faron's plan failed. Faron completely overcome by his anger and envy, on a dark night he managed to approach Moradin and stabbed him in the back, and little by little Moradin fell into a deep sleep, Melora tried to prevent but failed, Faron, aware of the great power of melora, he fled once and for all into the darkness of the underworld and grew his kingdom there.\n\nMany say that the continent of Absolus was part of this creation and even today it receives adventurers from different parts, through the portal of the souls of Ebrin.\n\nSays the legend that Melora created this portal to attract adventurers from other dimensions after Moradin fell asleep, and with the coming of these heroes they could fight the forces of evil.", "summary": "The Magic Land is a massive online role-playing game where people live in a magical world of adventures, In an MMORPG people from all over the world meet on a virtual playground to explore areas, solve tricky riddles and undertake heroic exploits.
