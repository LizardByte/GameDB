Theme: Non-fiction horror. It is inspired by a real life crime that happened in Brazil.\n\nOn October 31st 2002, a couple was found dead in their bed. What first appeared to be a burglary followed by murder left too many unusual traces, and the police soon figured that whoever did it was probably someone familiar with that house. Less than a week of investigation revealed that the murder was planned by the couple\u2019s own daughter, with the help of her boyfriend and his brother.\n\nThe game tries to reenact this story from the perspective of various characters involved. Each scene is focused on a different character, and uses a different style of gameplay to represent his motivations and goals.\n\nSuzy and freedom is NOT, however, an attempt to recreate the original story in a completely faithful and exact fashion.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/suzy-and-freedom"}
