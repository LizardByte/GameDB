{"id": "NBDgD8iNS4w", "snippet": {"title": "NIRAVASI - Launch Trailer", "description": "Follow the game here:\nhttps://niravasithegame.co.uk/\n\nNIRAVASI is a Dark Adventure game built with the RPG Maker MV engine (and the MV3D plugin), set within the ruins of an ancient human city. You play as Mura, a feline archaeologist that finds himself trapped within the titular lost city of ruin after being split off from the rest of his team. Armed with only a flashlight, and a mysterious ally guiding him through the city with his handheld radio, Mura must now navigate the dark streets of Niravasi to find his missing team and make his way out of derelict cityscape.\n\nBut Mura is not the only one living within Niravasi. Guarding it is the Artificial Ecological Overseer Network (A.E.O.N), an artificial intelligence built to protect and perfect humanity. Together with its robotic proxies, A.E.O.N will do everything in its power to remove anyone who arrives in the city uninvited. Among these machines is a particularly devastating one known only as The Harvester, which will continually track and hunt Mura down until either the latter escapes or is killed. In order survive, you\u2019ll need both your skills and wits to help keep Mura alive long enough to find a way to escape Niravasi. After all, there is always protection in perfection.\n\nCheck the game out on Steam, GameJolt, itch.io and RPGMaker.net:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2022680/NIRAVASI/\nhttps://gamejolt.com/games/Niravasi/5...\nhttps://king-sangos.itch.io/niravasi\u200b\nhttps://rpgmaker.net/games/11776/\u200b", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBDgD8iNS4w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBDgD8iNS4w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBDgD8iNS4w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBDgD8iNS4w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NBDgD8iNS4w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "NIRAVASI - Launch Trailer", "description": "Follow the game here:\nhttps://niravasithegame.co.uk/\n\nNIRAVASI is a Dark Adventure game built with the RPG Maker MV engine (and the MV3D plugin), set within the ruins of an ancient human city.
