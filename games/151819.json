As they settle down for the night, they stumble across a young woman bound in to a tree. While they express concern at first, the situation quickly turns dark when one of the members encourages the others to take advantage of the situation and toy with her as they please. All but one are on board with the idea and the more he stands by and watches, the more he realizes what kind of darkness lies in the hearts of people who are given power. He slowly begins to reconsider who his allies and enemies really are, confronting his urge to turn against his friends for the sake of a complete stranger.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}]}
