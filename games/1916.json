Lost Planet 3 reveals new truths about the foreboding planet and the colonial history of E.D.N. III.\n\nLost Planet 3 introduces Jim Peyton, a rig pilot who leaves Earth to take on a hazardous but lucrative contract on E.D.N. III. Working for Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) who are preparing the planet for colonization, Jim joins his fellow pioneers at the Coronis base and begins surveying the uncharted terrain and obtaining samples of the planet\u2019s energy supply \u2013 Thermal Energy.\n\nWith NEVEC\u2019s existing Thermal Energy reserve running low the fate of the Coronis mission depends on the natural source of the energy supply being located. Realizing that this is a great opportunity for a huge pay-off and early ticket home to his family, Jim braves the risk of the treacherous environment and threat of the indigenous Akrid.\n\nActing as a home away from home and boasting an array of tools that can assist Jim on the field, the utility rig provides Jim\u2019s safety and is essential not only for his contract work but also his protection against the ever-changing climate.\n\nLost Planet 3 will deliver a diverse range of gameplay including on-foot battles and intense first person action.
