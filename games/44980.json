But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense.\n\nHarry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old Dad.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pitfall-3d-beyond-the-jungle"}
