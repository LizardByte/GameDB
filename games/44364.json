Along the way there are monsters to shoot and items to collect. Shoot too much at once and your laser will overheat. You can also run out of coolant if you don't collect water along the way. \n \nWhat I found neat was that you have to get out of your ship and walk around to collect items. Reminds me of Blaster Master."}
