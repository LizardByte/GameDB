When you first arrive on the planet, you\u2019ll find yourself amid murky waters, oil spills, and scattered junk. Within the polluted environments, you\u2019ll find remnants of GUPPI\u2019s buildings, ships, and machinery all sunken to the ocean floor. As you clean up their mess, explore these areas to discover clues about the company\u2019s questionable past.", "summary": "Play as an interstellar custodian sent to clean up a polluted ocean planet.
