A unique addition to Karous, is that you don't collect weapons by power-ups, but instead upgrade each of your basic weapons (gun, sword and shield) depending on their use thanks to a basic experience module, with increased power and features at later levels (multiple shots, bullet reflection, etc.)\n\nThe game uses cel-shaded polygonal graphics with a distinct black and white look.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/karous"}
