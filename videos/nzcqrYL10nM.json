{"id": "nzcqrYL10nM", "snippet": {"title": "Queen Busters Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Original Air Date: September 17th, 2009\n\nQueen Busters is a Doujin Smash Bros. imitation that has several versions featuring different characters from Kanon and Ragnarok Online. It's not that good, but there is a decent roster of characters. You start with a few, but you unlock more as you beat the game a few times. The most devious characters are the maids and the final boss. This is a relatively short video where I beat up the CPU and wait around to demonstrate a few of the items in the game. This isn't the only Smash Bros. style doujin game out there. Up to four can play. Enjoy.\n\nOh, and ignore the Fraps counter that pops up very quickly; For some reason, this game catches it between load screens. Some other PC games also can't completely get rid of the Fraps display, like desParaiso. All it'll tell you is that the game was recorded at 60FPS.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nVisit GS At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzcqrYL10nM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzcqrYL10nM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzcqrYL10nM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzcqrYL10nM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzcqrYL10nM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Queen Busters Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Original Air Date: September 17th, 2009\n\nQueen Busters is a Doujin Smash Bros. imitation that has several versions featuring different characters from Kanon and Ragnarok Online.
