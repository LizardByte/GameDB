During her shifts, she finds that the once charming robots on-stage aren't her friends when the lights go out. With only a battery-powered flashlight to light up the dark corridors of the building, a Sonic mask to disguise herself, and guidance from a familiar employee of the SHPP establishment that isn't too reassuring, Amy must face the horrors that stalk the halls at night.", "summary": "Welcome to the new and improved Sonic's Hero Pizza Palace! Here you will find 4 of the most recognizable heroes of the 1990's except that they are animatronics. The clones were a little spoiled, so we left it. Do not worry. Even if you work at night, nothing should go wrong.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-at-sonics-2"}
