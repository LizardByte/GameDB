Beneath it, the village, bathed in darkness save for the faint glow of the flickering torches as they struggle to stay alight. In its deep shadows creeps evil in all its forms. Whilst overlooking it looms the castle. It's towers seem to reach up, struggling to escape the darkness that is all around.\n\nAmongst them screams the wind, lashing its way from spire to spire, seemingly trying to draw the castles very walls crashing down. In a tower which the wind seems even more intent on destroying, a window is illuminated by a strange light. Within its walls he sits, alone, dying. His hand rests on a glowing orb, its eerie light throws his drawn features into high relief. His eyes focus and the interminable blackness as his mind escapes to happier times.", "summary": "Darkmere: The Nightmare's Begun is an action-adventure game developed by Zero Hour Software and published by Core Design in 1994.\n\nViewed isometrically, Darkmere sets you as Ebryn, the son of the former King of Darkmere, a barren cursed land, with the aim of discovering what happened. The area is besieged by problems, including orcs running riot, and racial tension between different species.\n\nIt is Zero Hour's only title to date. Core Design went on to publish a less-well received pseudo-sequel to Darkmere in 1994 called Dragonstone, on Amiga and Amiga CD32.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/darkmere-the-nightmares-begun", "videos": [{"id": 114183, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ztLKChowUXI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztLKChowUXI", "title": "Amiga Longplay Darkmere: The Nightmare's Begun", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztLKChowUXI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
