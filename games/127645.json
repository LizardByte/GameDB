Onua (the Toa of earth), is the first to awaken, followed by Gali (the Toa of water), Pohatu (the Toa of stone), Kopaka (the Toa of ice), Lewa (the Toa of air), and Tahu (the Toa of fire). The Toa search for Kanohi, powerful masks that grant them new abilities, while aiding the island's villages and defeating Makuta's six elemental monsters.\n\nThe Toa briefly converse with each other during the quest, also sharing their collected Kanohi with each other. After gathering all of the Kanohi and defeating all six elemental monsters, the Toa team up and enter Makuta's lair, hidden underneath an ancient temple. Inside, two groups of three Toa each combine into the two Toa Kaita and defeat the Manas, powerful minions of Makuta. The Toa Kaita dissolve back into their original forms and conquer six different areas of Makuta's lair before facing and defeating Makuta,[b] releasing a light from the temple visible across the entire island. As the villages celebrate Makuta's demise, a creature awakens underneath the island.", "summary": "Lego Bionicle: The Legend of Mata Nui is a canceled action-adventure video game developed by Saffire Corporation.\n\nThe Legend of Mata Nui has a three-dimensional, third-person perspective and a similar gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda games Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, with the player collecting items that enable them to progress further in the game's open environments.
