Rather than feature a side-scrolling perspective as in previous handheld efforts, Tomb Raider maintains the console and computer's third-person perspective from behind globetrotting archaeologist Lara Croft. While navigating the 3D worlds in an attempt to recover a relic known as the Scion, players can run, jump, climb, shimmy across ledges, and perform various other acrobatic maneuvers. Along the way the intrepid explorer must defend herself from hungry wolves and rival treasure hunters using her trademark dual pistols or an assortment of other weapons found during her journey.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider--5", "videos": [{"id": 88476, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wmlkCdpl1rs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmlkCdpl1rs", "title": "Tomb Raider (2003) - Nokia N-Gage Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wmlkCdpl1rs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88477, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "M7Xk9R-guwI"}]}
