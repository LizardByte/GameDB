The game is a port of a 2002 PC game made in Korea by KidnKid.com and published by Mindscape. The company went defunct in 2007 so Mindscape ported the game themselves, and Rex was going to be released on September 14th, 2009 alongside the launch of the Bandai CD. However, Mindscape games were not selling well, so Mindscape sold the rights of Rex to Atari. Atari finally published the game on November 9th, 2010. The game is a platforming game based off a Korean animated series called \"White Heart Baekgu\", which aired from October 6th, 2000 to January 12th, 2001.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rex--4", "videos": [{"id": 98180, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jknW3Un0MM4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jknW3Un0MM4", "title": "\ud558\uc580\ub9c8\uc74c\ubc31\uad6c \uac8c\uc784 \uc624\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub110 \ubc84\uc804 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ub05d\uae4c\uc9c0", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jknW3Un0MM4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
