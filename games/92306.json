The player's first task is to place the egg into a basket and stroke it until it hatches.\n\nThe player interacts with the Pok\u00e9mon using the D-pad to move a cursor around the interface. The player can pet, play with, and drag their Pok\u00e9mon with this cursor. They can also interact with background objects such as a light switch and a drawer.\n\nUnlike standard virtual pet video games, the player's goal in Pok\u00e9mon Breeder mini is not to keep the Pok\u00e9mon alive but rather to train it in three out of four different skill categories. The game allows the player to train their Pok\u00e9mon by playing with it using various toys, feeding it Pok\u00e9blocks, and playing with it outside in various challenges.", "summary": "Pokemon Sodateyasan Mini\u200b (also known as Pok\u00e9mon Breeder Mini) is a Tamagotchi-like life simulation, in which the player cares for a young Pok\u00e9mon : Torchic, Treecko, or Mudkip.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-sodateyasan-mini", "videos": [{"id": 30768, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "gQ4uilyS5JA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ4uilyS5JA", "title": "Pokemon Breeder Mini Japan Translated En NINTENDO POKEMON MINI HYPERSPIN NOT MINE VIDEOS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQ4uilyS5JA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
