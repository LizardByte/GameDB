The game allowed moderate free-roaming of the environment, which was revolutionary for the time, and contained several semi-hidden shortcuts that could be used to reduce lap times. A handbrake is provided which the player is encouraged to use to perform handbrake turns round sharp corners.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gti-club-rally-cote-dazur"}
