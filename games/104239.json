While things seem difficult at first, Flode's earnest attitude soon wins over the hearts of the local populace, and she even manages to befriend a monster woman!\n\nHowever, things take a dark turn when her new friend is captured, and to free her, she must find the legendary treasures spread across the island. Things seem hopeless, but it just so happens that the shrine Flode is living in was built on holy ground belonging to the old god of the island, Noir, who's willing to lend her a hand. Will Flode succeed in her quest and stay true to her faith, or will she become a follower of Noir?", "summary": "Take control of Flode as she journeys across the island of Cerbes and attempts to unearth the ancient relics hidden there!
