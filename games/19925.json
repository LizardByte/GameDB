Pushmo World finds players pushing, pulling and climbing blocks to solve a collection of more than 250 new puzzles. What separates Pushmo World from the other games in the series, besides the crisp and colorful HD graphics and original puzzles, is the addition of World Pushmo Fair, an in-game hub that gives players an easy way to share and download new puzzles.\n\nIn Pushmo World, players are tasked with solving three-dimensional block-based puzzles by moving blocks to climb to the top of structures. As the game progresses, the puzzles get larger and more complex, with some massive, screen-filling creations resembling familiar objects, animals and even classic Nintendo characters. Pushmo World introduces a collection of training levels that players can use to hone their puzzle-climbing skills. The game also features a time-rewind option that lets players undo mistakes. This forgiving feature rewards players for being smart thinkers, rather than forcing them to restart a complex puzzle for making a hasty move. Being stumped won\u2019t stop the fun: If players are stuck on a particularly tough puzzle, they can skip ahead to the next one. In addition to the numerous puzzles included in the game, Pushmo World lets players create their own puzzles using a selection of tools in Pushmo Studio and share them with friends and others around the world.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pushmo-world", "videos": [{"id": 11733, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Vm7qYpklhNg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm7qYpklhNg", "title": "Pullblox World - Launch Trailer (Wii U)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vm7qYpklhNg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11732, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0noVqmZKYAY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0noVqmZKYAY", "title": "Nintendo eShop - Pushmo World for Wii U", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0noVqmZKYAY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
