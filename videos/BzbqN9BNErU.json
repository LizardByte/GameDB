Brutal Strife is a mod similar to Brutal Doom, all of the enemy deaths are brutalized, with several effects to the weapons. In the game, our protagonist is a hero suddenly attacked at the beginning of the game by the Order's Acolytes. The plot is quite simple, long ago the meteor striked Earth, unleashing Virus that slowly kills population of planet. With that virus, there is another threat... the Order becomes mindlessly fanatic, with goal to turn males into souless cyborgs. Their methods of new order are more and more brutal, with enslaving and killing entire populations. Your goal is to destroy the Order, and find the cure to virus. And don't trust anyone in your way.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BzbqN9BNErU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BzbqN9BNErU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BzbqN9BNErU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BzbqN9BNErU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BzbqN9BNErU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Brutal Strife from Doomguy5th #1", "description": "Strife is a game released back in 1996 from the Velocity with cooperation of Rogue Entertainment.
