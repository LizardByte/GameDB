One day, while playing alone in his bedroom, he was rudely interrupted by a family of dirty rats. Chasing them out of his room, the little boy suddenly found himself lost in a vast, mysterious forest, where he happened upon a magical crown that imbued him with the power to command. The little boy -- with his newfound companions Liam, Verde, and Howser the Bull Knight at his side -- has (rather surprisingly) become the leader of the small, down-on-its-luck kingdom of Alpoko.\n\nWith his newfound powers of persuasion, the little boy began working to raise Alpoko from the depths of obscurity and poverty into the dizzying heights of absolute power and prosperity. With Howser offering effective advice and unrestrained ambition, and the citizens of Alpoko sharing his grandiose plans (whether they want to or not), the little boy marches ever onward to his ultimate goal of World Domination!\"", "summary": "\"Initially released for Wii to rave reviews, this cult classic real-time strategy game juxtaposes cutesy fairytale visuals with some decidedly adult cynicism for a zany, irreverent adventure to build, enhance, and maintain a mystical, magical kingdom. Making its way to PC for the first time, this edition of the game remains faithful to the Wii original, but brings all its charming, sassy fun to a new audience. Can you keep Alpoko safe from the Onii and help our little hero become king of the whole world?\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/little-king-s-story", "videos": [{"id": 9178, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cBffUzqE6Hw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBffUzqE6Hw", "title": "Little King's Story - PC Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cBffUzqE6Hw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
