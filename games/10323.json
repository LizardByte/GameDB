While exploring a new planetoid, Flix takes an unfortunate nosedive into a chasm. It's your mission to guide Flix up and out of monster infested caves in the hopes of getting him back to his rocket-ship and the sanctuary of his cozy doggie home.\n\nHighly inspired by the wonderful 8-bit classic \"La Pulga\" (AKA: Bugaboo), Flix The Flea returns to an almost forgotten sub-genre of cutesome flea-based platform games, with a host of fresh environments and features, creating just the right balance of fun and frustration for a very entertaining & addictive gaming experience!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
