Help the people with simple pigeon activities... like delivering messages, helping out with a thing or two and of course... pooping on people and cars! Also, be aware of dangers like cars and the cat that is always patrolling the city. As they can give you some serious hits! But you got this, fly and poop little pigeon!"}
