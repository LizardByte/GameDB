These horrific experiments haven\u2019t advanced human health at all, of course\u2014they\u2019ve only tormented and killed animals and wasted precious medical resources.\n\nThis cruelty is why 16-year-old Archit Kumar of Dublin, California, is on a mission to end speciesism, and he\u2019s developed a video game called Monkey Fright to help accomplish that. The game brings awareness to the constant suffering and deprivation that these monkeys experience inside small, barren cages in windowless laboratories\u2014day in and day out\u2014where they\u2019re denied companionship, sunshine, fresh air, exercise, and everything else they care about.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monkey-fright"}
