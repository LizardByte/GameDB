The game is played from a top down perspective and uses a mix of stylus and button controls. Tapping and holding down the stylus moves a player around while lifting the stylus and then tapping again leads to a pass being made. Shooting is done by pressing a button, and holding it down gives extra height, but it is also possible to use the stylus to add aftertouch and curve the ball's movement.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fifa-soccer-2002"}
