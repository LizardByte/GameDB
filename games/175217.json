Roll the poker dice and build the hand that gets you what you want. Rob the bank, mine for gold, or settle the land, but be smart, because only the best rolls can win, and there's always someone willing to steal your hard-won rewards right out from under you. If your hand isn't what you hoped it would be, you can always pay to try again - as long as you can afford it, that is.\nDice Town Mobile is a solo game that will entertain you against one to 4 AI players and wrap up in less than an hour. Spend your money to make the best hand you can, because in this town, luck may decide the winner, but the best players make their own luck.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dice-town-mobile"}
