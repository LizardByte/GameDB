While there is NSFW content, it is used to enhance the story and the character interactions and to openly deal with issues related to sexuality without censorship.\n\nThis story has everything. It\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster with flawed and relatable characters full of sarcasm and wit that will ask very hard questions of the characters and the readers alike.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}]}
