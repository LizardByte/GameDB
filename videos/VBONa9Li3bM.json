It's a fun old-school repetitive action game where your mission is to save the fairies from a tower in which they are trapped, which takes place from the perspective of two different characters, Nora and Ziam (with a third unlockable character, Teenya). There are over fifty stages, a dart throwing mini-game, various secrets, and many enemies and different obstacles as you climb the tower. The game's case mimics that of a Dreamcast game (known as Steamcast) and is SSIG-0007 (likely the product code).\r\n\r\nThe goal of the game is simple: just grab all the fairies and take them to the exit panel. The order doesn't matter (though you get more points if you grab them in the proper order), but it becomes trickier to get them as you advance as enemies spawn faster and some fairies have to be collected strategically as you only get one shot and different characters have different traits for adjustable difficulty. For example, Nora's regular attack is not strong enough to defeat enemies (just stuns them) while her charge shot can destroy enemies and walls, but scares fairies away from her to their original positions (so on levels where you can only get a fairy one way, you have to consider if all pathes and such have been cleared beforehand). The game features a Challenge Mode which has a few different levels as well.\r\n\r\nThe game features nice and colorful graphics at a low resolution (320x240 with a Chime logo of 640x480) and a good soundtrack. This is one of about two dozen doujin games I've purchased recently. Ordinarily, I'd distribute it as the developers don't make money for it anymore and it's about ten years old, but you can't get music for the game without the CD as the audio files are hidden on the CD and in CD-DA format (you need the CD in the drive to get music too). There's a possibility it could work as an ISO, but I don't exactly feel like figuring that out at the moment.
