There's probably some I might have missed, since sadly due to the abrupt end of this project, I wasn't able to get a proper list of everyone who's contributed to this hack, and thus I can only list the following people:\n\nOriginal Chris, for testing on hardware, doing art, music & giving feedback.\nSpeems for testing, music & feedback.\nMCTravisYT for testing on hardware, art & giving feedback.\nInferno for coding help & testing.\nRivet for coding help & testing.\nBladeOfChaos for testing & feedback.\nManiacShard for testing & feedback.\nand somario360 for always somehow finding bugs every time which is incredible\n\nI want to thank all of them for helping me in this project. Our efforts will not be going to waste, as assets, music and more have been reused for other projects of ours.\nThis project has taught me to take it easy, simple, and go slow. Think more about what you're gonna do first. Plan out things as much as you can if you don't know what you want to do before doing it.\n\nWith that being said, I want to leave with a fair warning.
