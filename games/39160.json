After centuries of harmony, Middle Earth has hit problems due to a cataclysmic sequence of events - a crop failure leading to animals turning violent, and then an attack from a mysterious enemy to the north. The evil Demon Lord Alagiarept is discovered to be responsible, and as such the Wizards are given a week to beat him, before Middle Earth must surrender.\n\nYou play a rookie magician with Meditation, Mysticism and Moneymaking skills. While the main war goes on, you attempt a much bolder mission - locate the four Stones-of-the-Elements and the Medallion of Life to enter Alagiarept's Dark Tower and kill him.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jewels-of-darkness-adventure-quest", "collections": [{"id": 2718, "name": "Jewels of Darkness"}]}
