The rules here are: only 3 continues, the\ndifficulty goes up after every level, and you pick the first 3 from the full\nset of 12. However, as for the final (4th) stage, you can only pick from the\nthree you have beaten earlier (1st to 3rd stages) so pick the ones that you\nexcel at. The final stage can only be one of those three you picked in the earlier stages.\n\nThe games are: \n\nShoot Out (Basketball).\n\nThe Slugger (Baseball).\n\nTouchdown Derby (American Football).\n\nLong Shoot (Soccer/International Football).\n\nComputer Recive (Tennis).\n\nHole In One (Golf).\n\nPuck Rally (Hockey).\n\nDirect Ace (Different Soccer/International Soccer Mini-Game). \n\nFastest Sprinter (Cycling).\n\nPutting Match (different Golf Mini-Game).\n\nThe Kicker (Different American Football Mini-Game).\n\nHardest Save (Different Hockey Mini-Game).\n\nLet's talk about the mini-games i played in order, stating with Shoot Out:\n\nJoystick Aim cursor\nA Button --- Shoot\n\nEasy to learn hard to master.\nYou have to sink as many balls as you can in 60 ticks with 15 balls. Shooting the ball is something you haven't seen before. If you have played games like the NBA2K series, you would know that the shooting depends on your timing. Well, not this time. \nYou have to move the cursor to the '+' which is the target. When the + turns red, shoot! If you just wait for the cursor to move over the + by itself, you're going to run out of time. \nSo, use your joystick to move to the + faster, saving your time. If you want a S Rank, just make the first 12 throws and you're bound to get it. \nAs the stage goes up, the requirement of number of the balls made goes up and the cursor will move around a bit more.\nThere's only 60 seconds so make haste,with a Regular Shot you get - 300 points,colored Shot you get - 600 points,all 3 Shots from one side you get - 500 points.\n\nTouchdown Derby: \n\nA Button --- Increase your Tackle Power and Speed.\n\nJust tap A as fast you can to break down the tackle bag and dash to the finish line before the opponent does. The winner will catchthe ball automatically and run for the touchdown. \nThe Harder you hit the tackle bag, the more points you get.\nThe faster you get to the end zone (if won), you get more points. Usually 1000 or 1500 points.\n\nPuck Rally :\n\nJoystick to Move Hockey Player/Select direction of shot.\nA Button --- Shoot. \n\nJust use A to shoot back and forth. Try to fool your opponent and hit one of the panels. The number on it is how many hits you have to hit it before it can be broken. \nThen insert the puck through the gap to win. \nYou can hold down A to make your shot faster bu it's risky. Just don't let a puck go past you and you should be fine.\nThe LV. 4 stage for this game is insanely difficult. Just alternate between both sides and hope that the computer chokes.\n Getting an S requires you to finish it SUPER FAST.The opponent is FAR, FAR smarter on LV. 4 than LV 1. Because of that, the wall guard is only at 1 hit on LV 4 while it's 3 on LV 1. \nSixty seconds is the limit. Even if you don't give up a goal, you lose if you can't score.\n\nHitting a panel gives you 300 points.\nBreaking a panel gives you 300 points.\nScore! gives you 3000 points.\n\nAt end of all of the 4 sports trials the score gets merged and you get a trophy based on how you performed.\n\n\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\r\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InsertCoinArcad", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kou2HpYG2vQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kou2HpYG2vQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kou2HpYG2vQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kou2HpYG2vQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kou2HpYG2vQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sports Jam Arcade", "description": "1 or 2 players can play this one.
