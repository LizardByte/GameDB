The game eludes to other EDF forces, but they are never seen.\n\nYou choose two weapons for each mission from dozens of various missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers and more unique weapons, some, faster, more powerful or better suited to the mission at hand than others, are given infinite ammo (though the weapons must still be reloaded after each clip is used up) and are set loose in one of several (usually city-based) fully destructible environments. Players can also mount a vehicles such as an air bike, a tank and a helicopter.\n\nThe player recovers and increases his maximum health and armour, and unlocks new weapons by picking up power-ups from defeated enemies that spawn in and come at the player by the dozen. The game also features 2-player split-screen cooperative multiplayer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
