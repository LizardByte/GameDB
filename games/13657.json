The player takes on the role of an adventurer who is tasked with forming a party, navigating through dungeons, gathering treasure, and engaging in combat against monsters. Characters can be improved through learning skills and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based, and dungeon navigation takes place from a first-person perspective on a grid map. Party members can belong to five main classes (namely fighters, magic users, scouts, maids and spielers) which branch into over 30 different subclasses with unique skill sets and outfits as characters progress in specialization. For instance, a fighter can develop into a paladin and a valkyrie, while magic users can transition into enchantresses and witches.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-travelers-2-the-royal-library-and-the-monster-seal", "videos": [{"id": 5928, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bAywufNUtZM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAywufNUtZM", "title": "Dungeon Travelers 2: Now Available!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAywufNUtZM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
