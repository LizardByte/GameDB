Play at your own risk.\n\nThe Voidness is a SCI-FI psychological survival horror game where it takes place inside the void where it's filled with just gloom - the only way to see is by scanning the environment with your range finder device, however you are not alone. Don't breath as they are listening.. and watching. You take the role of a space specialist named Francesca Lee, sent to study the mysterious void on a newly founded planet filled with just gloom and darkness.\n\nThings however, are not what they seem to be. Navigate your way by scanning the simulation environment equipped with your range scanning device, upgrade, scan and mind your footsteps as every step you take can be deadly inside the void. Use scanning turrets to guide you in the environments, find upgrades, mark landmarks and more. Trend carefully as stepping on debris will make them hear you, same as if you are within their line of sight or if you make any noise. Something is lurking in The Voidness alongside you .. and the only way to see it, is by scanning.\n\nThe enemies can also hear when you are in hiding spots, from your microphone.
