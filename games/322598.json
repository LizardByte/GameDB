If you catch one and let it express itself, it can grow into a beautiful plant - some into extremely rare plants! Care for your plants with fun interactions like watering, catching pests and so much more - you can even sing for your plant. Relax with minigames like catching bubbles in your bubble tea. As your room becomes your safe space, you might encounter your inner child in the room's hidden depths.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dustbunny-emotions-to-plants", "videos": [{"id": 133367, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RRFGDBe2oMY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRFGDBe2oMY", "title": "Preview Dustbunny, the coziest plant game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRFGDBe2oMY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
