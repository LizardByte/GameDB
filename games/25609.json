You can also play with a keyboard, but it's a lot more fun with a controller you can hit really hard.\n\nHit the drums to destroy the comets and dodge lasers. Get hit three times or fall off of your platform, and the universe will end. No pressure.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beat-nebula"}
