Space Cavern is a fun arcade style classic retro old school video game that combines elements of Space Invaders with Moon Parol and comes out as a winning cartridge for Atari collectors. If you like shmup video games, shooters or any kind of games that involve space travel, aliens, guns, bad guys and monsters you'll dig it. This game is from 1982 by Apollo for the Atari 2600 video game system. What we need to see is Space Cavern remade for the PS3 Playstation 3 for the Sony Network, or for Xbox Live Arcade on the 360 for download XBLA.  Space Cavern is a solid game and a must have for collectors.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, PS2, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360.
