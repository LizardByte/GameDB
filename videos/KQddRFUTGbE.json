When a magical power source dries up after the king\u2019s passing, princess Tamaki performs a ritual to summon saviors in times of dire need, but her power spirals out of control and scatters them across the domain. As the legend foretells that the land\u2019s liberator will be crowned its new ruler, Tamaki sets out at once to seek the new arrivals and restore peace to the kingdom. However, so do her rivals Setsuna and Shiki \u2013 descendants of the royal family who also vie for the throne. Uncertain of their fate, the champions are split into three separate groups with no choice but to duke it out for dominance.\n\nWithin this volatile setting, the player must choose their allies carefully. By engaging in Key Battles and taking on Free Scenarios, players will gain access to their faction\u2019s roster of warriors and craft a dream team. Character choices will affect the course and conclusion of the game, as their friendships are key to how the game\u2019s story unfolds, which is further enhanced with the addition of the all-new Bond system. Relationships between characters can improve by fighting alongside one another and spending time together in the Barracks. The closer the Bond, the stronger the abilities unlocked to gain an upper hand on the battlefield.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQddRFUTGbE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQddRFUTGbE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQddRFUTGbE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQddRFUTGbE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KQddRFUTGbE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Warriors All-Stars: Tamaki Clan Trailer", "description": "An action-packed new trailer for the Tamaki Clan features Zhao Yun, Lu Bu, Wang Yuanji and Zhou Cang from DYNASTY WARRIORS, Oka, Tokitsugu and Horo from Toukiden, Sophie and Plachta from Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Book, Opoona from Opoona, and princess Tamaki. \n\nSummoned from a diverse range of worlds and time periods to save a mysterious land at the brink of destruction, the champions of Warriors All-Stars find themselves in the middle of a clash for control.
