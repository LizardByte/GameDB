Using the Aspen engine, the game opens up the hunting simulation into wide maps with plenty of vegetation, but without the framerate hits. Players can customize a hunter and the weapons used to. As the player progresses through the game, skill points are awarded and the character grows to be a more efficient hunter. Multiplayer is included so that players can challenge each other in online hunts and compete for the monster prizes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trophy-hunter-2003"}
