Help Randolph to find him by mastering 45 levels.\n\nEach level has sinkable platforms, which will sink when Randolph moves over it. Once that happens, you never can use this platform again. Your job is now to sink all platforms in the level. If one or more platforms remain and you can't reach them, you have lost the level. But you can try the level so often as you want.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-misadventures-of-sir-randolph-doogleberry-british-explorer"}
