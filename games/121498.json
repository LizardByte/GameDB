The mega-corporations use mass consumerism to keep the core systems population in check, which requires a continuous flow of resources from the frontier, which in turn creates a conflict between the corporations and colonies over the resources on the colony's planet.\n\nAmidst the chaos on the frontier, pirate factions have arisen around organized crime, black markets, and raiding resources.", "summary": "Mech Merc Company is a 90's style singleplayer first-person mech combat simulator with business management elements.\nTake command of your own mercenary company and pilot massive combat mechs on battlefields of the future.
