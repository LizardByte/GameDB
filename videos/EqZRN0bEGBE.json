It then rewards the 5-to-9-year-old-child with passes to go on field trips or to play games on in the play park out behind the schoolhouse. Apparently the Sonic graphics were all taken from the unreleased Sonic X-treme game that was being developed for the Saturn and PC at the time. They certainly look like the prerendered models shown around the time of X-treme's development builds.\n\nIf it has any claim to fame (not just notoriety), Sonic's Schoolhouse is the first fully 3D Sonic game to appear on the market. Many sites credit Sonic the Hedgehog into Dreams (included in Christmas NiGHTS on the Saturn) as being the first, but Schoolhouse predates it by a few months.\n\nIt's really not terribly exciting unless you have to have a Sonic game that looks like Doom/Wolfenstein 3D, or if your life isn't complete without watching videos of animals with stupid voiceovers of which, somehow none of the animals from the Sonic series appear. Really?\n\nA couple of particular bits did make me laugh though: the ring collecting game starts with the game saying we're going on a Sonic Adventure, and it puts you in a grassy 3D area - sounds promising, right? Well, not after you finish it in less than thirty seconds. \n\nThe other lol-worthy bit is the music playing in the background of the matching mini game. Anyone else recognize it? It's a demo song from the old original Sound Blaster 16 installation floppies. Seriously - the same exact song. Way to set that bar high, Sega.\n\n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EqZRN0bEGBE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EqZRN0bEGBE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EqZRN0bEGBE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EqZRN0bEGBE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic's Schoolhouse (PC) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 1996 edutainment CD-ROM title for PCs running Windows 3.1/95, Sonic's Schoolhouse.\n\nI had this disc sitting around, and after going to the effort of playing so many of the lesser known Mario educational titles, it didn't seem fair to leave the Sonic attempt out. \n\nThe game features FPS-style areas where you are tasked with finding answers to questions in maths and English.
