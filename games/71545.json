This was the first golf game to operate in true 3D. This means that the player's stance and swing technique can be adjusted, and have a significant effect on the shot outcome. Although the manual's tutorial helps, it's harder to master than rivals such as PGA Tour Golf. There are six courses, an unprecedented number for a computer simulation, and tonnes of playing modes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/david-leadbetters-greens"}
