Developed in partnership with the Alaska Native community, Foxtales reminds us that some challenges are best faced together and that even the smallest among us deserve respect.\n\nFeatures\n-Take to the seas -- Climb aboard your umiaq (a sealskin canoe) and take to the waters of the coasts, rivers and lakes of Northwest Alaska. Paddle through waves, ice floes and rapids or dive underwater and journey across the sea floor, inside mysterious caverns and through a sunken village.\n\n-Seek the help of the spirits and your companion -- Discover spirit helpers who can change the course of currents at your command. Switch between Nuna and Fox in single player mode or play with a friend in local co-op mode.\n\n-Explore Alaska Native culture -- Foxtales includes five new unlockable Cultural Insight videos featuring members of the Alaska Native community including the family of Willie Panik Goodwin, Sr., the storyteller whose tale of \u201cThe Two Coastal Brothers\u201d inspired the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/never-alone-foxtales", "videos": [{"id": 22624, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pzO1f4cK-Fk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzO1f4cK-Fk", "title": "Never Alone: Foxtales Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pzO1f4cK-Fk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
