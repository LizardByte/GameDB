Born and raised in the hill country of Backwater, USA, you're quite deft with the shotgun, and afraid of nothing. Then again, you haven't been in the haunted mansion up on the hill. As you hunt for your lost little brother, Delbert, you must enter a house full of zombies, spooks, and bad guys and turn them into hamburger meat, before they make a meal out of you in Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion! \n \nDangerous Dave\u2019s Risky Rescue \nUnfortunately for our hero, his little brother is afflicted with \u201calways getting kidnapped\u201d syndrome. Dangerous Dave must battle wolves, mummies, ghosts, and other ghastly apparitions on his way to save Delbert from the clutches of the evil Dr. Nemesis. With 11 levels of spine-tingling platforming action, you\u2019ll be shooting up a storm in Dangerous Dave\u2019s Risky Rescue! \n \nDave Goez Nutz! \nLife is difficult enough without having Dr. Nemesis as your arch-villain. Why does he have to pick on Dave\u2019s little brother, Delbert, so much? Not only does he snatch the already kidnapping-prone Delbert, but he hides him away deep in the bowel of an insane asylum! Crazy nurses wearing purple of all colors wander the halls, cleaver wielding orderlies, and jolts of electricity all stand in Dangerous Dave\u2019s way in Dave Goez Nutz! \nThe Dangerous Dave Pack includes Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion, Dangerous Dave\u2019s Risky Rescue, Dave Goez Nutz! and The Deserted Pirate's Hangout! \nA wide variety of locations ranging from a haunted house to the insanity of a mental hospital! \nOver 30 levels combined of side-scrolling, platforming-and-gunning action!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
