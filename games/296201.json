In an instant she finds herself whisked away to a familiar yet strangely different world! Hoping to get some answers from a strangely dressed Marisa, it quickly becomes apparent that this is not the Marisa she once knew.", "summary": "\"Odyssey of the Anachronistic Tome\" features Patchouli Knowledge who was pulled into a strange, forgotten Gensokyo from a long abandoned canon with the gameplay inspired by the very first Touhou! This is our little alpha build for the Touhou Game Jam 13 with the theme \"Retroactive, Retrospective, downright... Retro\". Thank you for checking out our game! This is not only the first thing we've ever worked on as a group, but the first game any of us have ever worked on as individuals and with only a 72 hour time budget... sorry if the game explodes lol.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/odyssey-of-the-anachronistic-tome"}
