An unknown object hit the Ulteye Star, causing it to flood the world with the liquid known as Star Tear, which is about the same as ocean water but much more saltier and with a hint of melon. To prevent further damage, pipes were built everywhere to keep the liquids away. This event ultimately lead to a shortage of crops, including tomatoes which are one of the most important ingredients for making a Francesinha, Pantufa's favourite dish.\n\nIt is the red cat's task to stop the Star from crying and to prevent it from happening again to ensure Francesinhas are possible in the future.\n\nThere are rumours about this ancient artefact known as the Plot Bullshit Bell that is known to prevent anything from crying with its chime, perhaps this item will aid the red cat on its journey.", "summary": "Pantufa the Cat: Extended Edition (Pantufa the Cat 2 in Europe) is a modification of Sonic the Hedgehog for the SEGA Genesis / SEGA Mega Drive derived from a similar project from late 2011, Pantufa the Cat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pantufa-the-cat-extended-edition"}
