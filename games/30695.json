This turret can fire or swing your Starblade in any direction.  The Starblade can be used to cut down most enemy projectiles. Switch between guns and blades to combat your enemies, but you can\u2019t activate both at once.  Use your weapons wisely because if you let too many enemies slip past then you lose the mission.  Choose your ship.  Choose your weapons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
