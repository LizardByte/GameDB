As time progresses Alice loses touch with reality. She is institutionalized in Rutledge Asylum, where she is observed and treated by Dr. Heironymous Wilson. Alice's only possession in Rutledge is a stuffed rabbit. Ten years after Alice was committed to Rutledge, she finds herself sucked back into a Wonderland that has been twisted by her own broken mind. The White Rabbit summons Alice to aid a radically altered Wonderland, which became a twisted version of itself as it came under the horrible rule of the Queen of Hearts. The Cheshire Cat serves as Alice's companion throughout the game, frequently appearing to guide her with cryptic comments.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/american-mcgee-s-alice", "videos": [{"id": 37449, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Fg4FG0kCMBU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg4FG0kCMBU", "title": "American McGee's Alice - Trailer [HQ]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fg4FG0kCMBU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
