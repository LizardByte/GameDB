It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the Icewind Dale series, as well as other licensed D&D campaign worlds such as Planescape: Torment. The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life.\n\nLet's Play Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgOcy5VFQ-WXR69mAp6jcnL79ZYMJNivf\n\nMore Yahweasel: http://www.youtube.com/c/Yahweasel\n\nSubscribe: https://goo.gl/Kf9nFf\n\nFollow Yahweasel:\nWebsite: http://www.yahweasel.com/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/yahweasel\nDiscord: http://www.yahweasel.com/discord\nTwitch: http://twitch.tv/yahweasel\n\nMore videos:\n\neheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh~ \u2014 Yahweasel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9CbxxrMB0s\n\nDonnie VR \u2014 LCD games in VIVID 3D! \u2014 Yahweasel's Scratch an Itch(.io)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc6PRx52YZ0\n\nThe Forsaken Tower \u2014 Why hath it forsaken me? \u2014 Yahweasel's Scratch an Itch(.io)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNli13DOM7s\n\nLet's Play b00tl3g kr3w \u2014 Pirates need games! \u2014 Yahweasel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFhv_tqb-Ac", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ydV3s5jMIHg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ydV3s5jMIHg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ydV3s5jMIHg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ydV3s5jMIHg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ydV3s5jMIHg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Longplay Baldur's Gate for Mobile Phones", "description": "What do you play when all you have is a feature phone?
