The statement said the problems date back to several months ago, when a storm destroyed the steam autoclave sterilization plant that processed the waste. There was no biological threat to public health, it was unlikely to spread widely.\n\nBut that was not true. The threat spread across the country. Disease and mutation spread among the population. Most channels carried the government's announcement but started studio debates, videos and live broadcasts from the country.\n\nYou will play as Peter, who embarks on a journey to prove that the disease and mutations that spread among the population, were not an accident as the news suggested. Peter made his research and though he might know where the government's labs and bases that made the virus were. While traveling on his journey, Peter gets into an accident and has to search in the woods for help, but there was something unexpected waiting to be discovered. In a world where weapons are nonexistent, survive the harsh environment using your observational skill, intelligence, and patience. Will it be enough? That's up to you.", "summary": "Outlive is a first-person survival horror game, set in a post-apocalyptic world after a virus infected most of the population.

The only chance of survival is to use your speed and agility to outsmart your enemies, solve puzzles and make your way to safety after collecting all the evidence.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/outlive--1", "videos": [{"id": 95338, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YeKnByyrW2U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeKnByyrW2U", "title": "Outlive - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YeKnByyrW2U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
