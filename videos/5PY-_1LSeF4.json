The locations change, the missions change, the characters change, the bosses change, and most of all, the story changes. Characters who you trusted before, may turn against you. Enemies who tried to kill you, may end up helping you. Simple missions can turn into deadly traps. No two campaigns are the same.\n\n...\nKiller Bean Forever:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyYHWkVWQ4o\nMusic by Jeff Lew:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5usEA18fKSY", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5PY-_1LSeF4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5PY-_1LSeF4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5PY-_1LSeF4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5PY-_1LSeF4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5PY-_1LSeF4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Killer Bean - 2024 - Official Trailer", "description": "Coming 2024 - Wishlist on Steam!  https://store.steampowered.com/app/1597080/Killer_Bean/\n\nFrom the same creator as Killer Bean Forever, this is a first person/third person, open-world, roguelike shooter. \n\nEvery time you start a new single player campaign, everything changes.
