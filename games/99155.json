The game follows on the heels of Cross Gate, another MMORPG released by Enix this summer. Depth Fantasia will continue Cross Gate's excellent standards, and will help to further open the online RPG market in Asia.\n\nDepth Fantasia allows up to four players to join a party. The party will travel to Ritos Island where they will slay demons, collect Life Gems, and restore order to the cursed land. Players will build their characters based on a class system. As with any other class system, characters learn abilities and then pass them on to more advanced classes. To gain levels, one will need to find Life Gems, or fight another player in a duel.\n\nPlayers will interact with a number of NPCs. These characters all have a unique niche in the world; some examples of these roles include fearsome warriors, mystic sorceresses, and holy clergymen. Each NPC will give the player advice and assistance in completing their quest.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/depth-fantasia", "videos": [{"id": 24568, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0Ex6Aw8kVYs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ex6Aw8kVYs", "title": "Depth Fantasia \u6df1\u9042\u5e7b\u60f3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Ex6Aw8kVYs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
