It allows for truly organic town layouts without the grid and angle restrictions on a three-dimensional landscape. The goal is to make player's creations to become alive and believable communities where real-life problems would arise, thus making the late game a new challenge rather than a repetitive chore.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ostriv"}
