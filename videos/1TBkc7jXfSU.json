Game index for this part 1 (part 2 is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht6RSxfikE0 ):\n\n0:00 - start\n3:52 - Space Invaders Color, 1978\n7:27 - Lunar Rescue, 1980\n11:02 - Alpine Ski, 1982\n14:33 - The Fairyland Story, 1985\n21:05 - Rastan Saga, 1987\n26:19 - Kuri Kinton, 1988\n30:27 - Jigoku Meguri, 1988 (aka \"Bonze Adventure)\n38:07 - Don Doko Don, 1989\n45:50 - Flipull, 1989\n51:13 - Aa Eikou No Koshien, 1990\n1:00:47 - Majestic Twelve - The Space Invaders Part IV, 1990\n1:06:42 - Runark, 1990\n\nEach game features configurable operator options, button remapping, game instructions, and a transcribed game flier--all in Japanese: rewind slightly before the time-stamps above to see them for each game. I can mumble my way through enough katakana to decipher some of the button commands, but that's about it. ; D I got the game titles from a listing on import site NCS (ncsx.com) back in the day.\n\nFive or so of the games--the ones listed in blue in the game list menu--are locked at the start; some unlock just through cumulative play-time of all games, while others only unlock through cumulative play-time of *specific* games, which is kind of a pain; GameFAQs has details on that, but they also list a button sequence that unlocks all of them immediately, so in part 2 I just end up using that. : D So anyway my play-through here isn't entirely in list order, because I have to go back to four of the locked games later, after they become available.\n\nYou can turn on auto-save to save high-scores (for games that have them), but there is no save-state support like more recent retro game ports tend to have. And all the games run with a more or less thick blurring filter over them. ; P Still, there are some mighty interesting games in here, and even some I actually like: in Joukan, I plan to come back to Don Doko Don, The Fairyland Story, and Runark (not a perfect game by any means, but just ridiculously over the top in its beat-em-up action : o).
