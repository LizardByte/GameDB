Exploring the ship he finds it's a medical frigate run by the Cayne Corporation for illegal research on unwilling victims. His primary companion is Te'ha. From a variety of PDAs he learns that Dr Malak created project SEED, designed to create super soldiers by reactivating dormant human genes, through torturous experimentation and forced impregnations, resulting in the creation of animalistic and vicious hybrids. Several of these hybrids escaped and butchered the crew, skinning them for their subdermal tags to allow them to roam the ship freely. Concurrently, a ravenous fungus and insect infestation crippled numerous systems. John is eventually captured by Malak, who kills his daughter for sabotaging the ship's oxygen gardens.\n\nReaching the escape deck, John shatters a portal and vents Dr. Malak into space, before falling and breaking his leg. Reluctantly, Te'ah acknowledges she engineered the hybrids escape and destruction of the Groomlake, in order to find Ellen, Johns wife, who has material in her bone marrow containing all of Malaks research, which she plans to sell in vengeance against Cayne Corporation for the murder of her husband. John tricks the ship security systems into killing Te'ah, ruining the last stasis pod in the process. John allows the escape shuttle to leave with his wife. In an epilogue, it appears Ellen has either died in the stasis pod, or turned into a hybrid.\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "summary": "The Deluxe Edition of Stasis includes the game plus the following items:\n- A beautiful digital art book with concepts, character art and behind the scenes development images\n- The STASIS soundtrack in mp3 and flac format\n- Four exclusive 4k wallpapers plus four additional bonus wallpapers\n- Game screenplay\n- Document of all written in-game text", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stasis-deluxe-edition", "videos": [{"id": 85961, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "C37wapIp99w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C37wapIp99w", "title": "STASIS Available Now Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C37wapIp99w/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 85962, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EyE40XPAeEA"}, {"id": 85963, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LgLf8AqxNnY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgLf8AqxNnY", "title": "STASIS - Accolades Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgLf8AqxNnY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
