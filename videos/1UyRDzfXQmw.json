The game is split into parts and part 1 will be free. This is used to determine if you like the game before you buy the other parts.\n\nWhen is it coming out?\nThe game is set to release WEDNESDAY, June 20th 2018.\n\nDoes it work on a Mac?\nI am intending that the game will. The game is made using the Unity Engine so I should be able to get it on macs.\n\nHardware?\nFrom the current beta tests, if the game is run on a device that isn't very powerful, it tends to lag. I will try my hardest to get the game working on all computers.\n\n\n\n\nProduction Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound: http://www.epidemicsound.com\nRoyalty Free Music by http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music (for videos that make use of music tracks)\nSound Effects by http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects (for videos that make use of sound effects)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1UyRDzfXQmw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1UyRDzfXQmw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1UyRDzfXQmw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1UyRDzfXQmw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1UyRDzfXQmw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "archieve: GLITCH | AN ORIGINAL INDIE GAME", "description": "HOPE YOU ENJOYED! :D\n\nQUESTIONS / ANSWERS\n\nWhat will it be on?\nThe game will be released on STEAM.\n\nWill it be free?\nPart 1 will yes.
