TABI Ex Boyfriend Mod + Cutscenes [HARD]", "description": "NOTE: The engine in this mod is very buggy, which causes it to drop combos and make notes disappear, but rest assured I hit every note I could, as seen by the miss counter which is always at 0! Also, the miss sprites always appear when you hit nothing, but you don't actually take any penalty for it.\n\nWhat an absolutely INCREDIBLE mod! I'm pretty sure this is the first mod with voice acting as well and I hope it won't be the last, because it was amazing! I love this character so much, especially his russian accent and I'd love to see more of him in the future. His story seems really interesting! The cool visual effects it adds were so good as well, I love how this mod looks so much, really surprised me by the level of polish it has! The music  was incredible as well, the last one was super intense, loved it all around!

In the descriptions I give my in-depth opinion on the video game as well as timestamps for each part of the video.
