This sequel retained the core pit-fighting and arena combat mechanics of its predecessor but introduced 3D graphics and a more immersive environment. VQ2 was designed to push the boundaries of web-based gaming at the time, featuring a blend of PvP combat and RPG elements in a fully 3D isometric world. Despite its innovative approach, the project faced numerous challenges, and the development was eventually abandoned.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vagabonds-quest-2"}
