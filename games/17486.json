Many games have tried to replicate the depth and complexity of this global conflict and only a few have managed to give an all around experience to players. \n \nThis is a game that truly replicates all these aspects. The developers of the highly successful Time of Wrath are back to the European theater of war with an ambitious project that allows players to truly experience what it was to be a decision maker of the period. \n \nTime of Fury spans the whole war in Europe and gives players the opportunity to control all types of units, ground, air and naval. Player is able to pick a single country or any selection of countries and fight his way against enemy at the country-customized difficulty levels.Important notice \nTime of Fury features unique gameplay options. Each country in the game is represented with dedicated attributes. Every country has got it's pros and cons. This makes the game extremely replayable and provides hundreds of hours of play.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/time-of-fury"}
