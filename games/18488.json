Similarly as in Berzerk you walk thorugh several screens shooting enemies. But contrary to Berzerk where you could see every enemy right from entering the screen; in Marauder the enemies only appear on the screen when they are in your line of sight. Therefore the player can be surprised by enemies much more easier. The ultimate goal of Marauder is to destroy the power center which has to be found by the player before the timer at the bottom of the screen runs out. After having destroyed the power center, the game starts anew on a harder difficulty level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
