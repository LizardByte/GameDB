In the maze, monsters are born from rock-like eggs (which can be rolled with a punch). The monster does not accept mini punches from other than the front, faints with the mini punch from the front, and can be defeated with another blow. Some eggs do not hatch, and monsters and punch boys often roll eggs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/punch-boy"}
