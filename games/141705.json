The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole.[4] A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active.[2] Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.", "summary": "Arcade exploration game released on the Amstrad CPC computer family.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 43723, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NjzMu8BHgFc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjzMu8BHgFc", "title": "Obsidian Review for the Amstrad CPC by John Gage", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NjzMu8BHgFc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
