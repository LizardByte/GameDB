The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!", "summary": "Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game and the first installment of the series developed by Scott Cawthon. You take the role as a security guard and the goal is to survive five full nights at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza while avoid getting caught and killed by the animatronics (Freddy and team). Check their movements using the security cameras and use the power carefully to survive each night.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys", "videos": [{"id": 51604, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RP4UTOek0-Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4UTOek0-Y", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RP4UTOek0-Y/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 51605, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GS-VcKmK7Gc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS-VcKmK7Gc", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GS-VcKmK7Gc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70750, "name": "Clickteam PS4 Trailer", "video_id": "yjTIz5nE-Y0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjTIz5nE-Y0", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's - PS4 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yjTIz5nE-Y0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70751, "name": "Clickteam Xbox Trailer", "video_id": "cIt8h49oFII", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIt8h49oFII", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's 1 - Xbox One Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cIt8h49oFII/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70752, "name": "Clickteam Switch Trailer", "video_id": "1tAUiP3MX_Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tAUiP3MX_Y", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's - Nintendo Switch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1tAUiP3MX_Y/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70753, "name": "Clickteam iOS Remastered Version Trailer", "video_id": "KMdmrwxaGAc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMdmrwxaGAc", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's Remaster - iOS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMdmrwxaGAc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70754, "name": "Clickteam Android Remastered Version Trailer", "video_id": "u8H0pazYY5I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H0pazYY5I", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's Remaster - Android", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u8H0pazYY5I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
