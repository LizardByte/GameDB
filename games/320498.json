Entire families are dying, businesses are running out of employees, stores have low demand, streets are empty, and the economy has been affected ever since. A government-funded organization, named \"Hope in the Empty\" (HITE), seeks to make life on Earth better, because living on this planet with all the destruction caused is not the same anymore.\n\nSo, countries had to give in and invest in something to end all types of pollution, making it a crime now. Any individual caught littering, destroying nature, or emitting toxic gases, like greenhouse gases for example, will be arrested and sentenced. Their sentence is a terrifying death in the \"Endless Empty.\"\n\nHowever, those who think this place only serves to make polluting humans disappear are mistaken. HITE created it with the intention of sending all the existing garbage on the planet there, thus getting rid of the \"Filthy Pandemic.\" If the garbage disappears, the danger ceases to exist, right?", "summary": "Sci-fi horror about a controversial company that removes the world's trash.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/endless-empty"}
