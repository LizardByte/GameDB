The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It does not matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in as it does not have word recognition, so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/singstar-fussballhits"}
