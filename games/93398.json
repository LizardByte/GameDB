By infesting the Intergalactic Zoo with creatures called Qwirks, the Warlords hoped to destroy the Alliance's scientific showpiece.\n\nAt first, the plan worked well. The Qwirks began multiplying quickly, threatening to overrun the entire facility. Furthermore, their telepathic powers overwhelmed the minds of several Zoo creatures, turning them into evil monsters.\n\nBut the Alliance scientists fought back. They captured and domesticated two Qwirks, whom they named Cosmo and Bigelow, to help in their lab experiments. They discovered that Qwirks of the same color have a special telepathic affinity and link up when they're next to one another. When four or more Qwirks are linked this way, they transmigrate into the eighth dimention. By herding the Qwirks into the proper groups, the scientists have learned to make enough Qwirks transmigrate so that there is now some hope of defeating the evil Warlords' plans...", "summary": "Qwirks is an English adaptation of Puyo Puyo (1992) for home computers licensed from Compile. Unlike Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Kirby's Avalanche it does not involve the use of a particular license, instead featuring entirely original characters. The game was introduced by Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/qwirks", "videos": [{"id": 89893, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "J8CM4Nsb1IA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8CM4Nsb1IA", "title": "Qwirks - Challenges (1995) [WINDOWS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8CM4Nsb1IA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
