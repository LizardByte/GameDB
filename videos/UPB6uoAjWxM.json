{"id": "UPB6uoAjWxM", "snippet": {"title": "SNES Longplay [359] Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story (Fan Translation)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nLongplay of Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon - Another Story (fan translation name of game Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story), a RPG game based in the pretty anime Sailor Moon (one my favorite animes, with good plot and beauty girls) released in 1995 for Super Famicon only in Japan.\n\nIn the game, a sorceress named Apsu arrives from the 30th century. She has gathered a group of girls from Crystal Tokyo and ordered them to affect the past in order to change the future to her liking, with the ultimate goal of attaining the Mystical Silver Crystal. Her followers are called the &quot;Oppositio Senshi,&quot; (Kishar, Sin, Nabu, Ishtar, Marduk, Nergal and Anshar; a great friend of Chibi-Moon) and succeed in changing the fates of the defeated villains from the first three story arcs, bringing deceased villains back to life and turning reformed and healed individuals back to the darkness.\n\nThe storyline of the RPG is fairly linear. All ten members of the Sailor Team (Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Pluto, Venus and Chibi-Moon) are playable, each character have your individual habilities and some girls have one short individual story around the world before we can see our heroines together in a mission against Apsu. Only five members of the Team can be in the player&#39;s party at one time. The game includes some locations like the anime, per example Mugen Academy, Usagi&#39;s School, Osa-P, the Hiwaka Shrine, the Usagi, and Mamouru&#39;s Houses and more. Is a good game, with fun and dramatic moments based on a great anime/mang\u00e1. Instead of MP, our heroines uses a EP (in a form of crystals, that regenerate after each battle) and your magical attacks (single and multi-techs) and this attribute have a fixed number of 12.\nDone with the best ending (win last battle with Sailor Moon team). With love for all great Sailor Moon fans (i&#39;m are a fan too). English translation by Bishoujo Senshi Translations and FuSoYa.
