The thing is, I'm not a native English speaker, and I have the tendency to reduce my ascent and to make sure I sound as natural as possible. In fact, my whole game development career is built on the sole purpose of learning English. I've learned Unity in English, coding in English(obviously), and writing game stories in English. So making sure that I sound as natural as possible is also one of the core goals of the whole thing.\n\nThere for, I recorded the same lines over and over again, and when I still was not satisfied with the result, I took a lot the time editing the audio, making sure I cut out every single part that I did like.....(maybe I didn't, there are just way too many pronunciation mistakes there...) Plus I only had so little time to work on this, like a couple of hours a week.\n\nI think this is a good place to admit, the real reason behind all of these excuses is procrastination.\n\nBefore I knew it, it's been 18 months...\nBut, better late than never, isn't it?\n\nI know this is just a basic, simple tutorial, and it's nowhere nice perfect. but it means a lot to me, it's the first time I speak a new language to do something I like ( I make a game demo called \"Soul Delivery\" before, but I didn't use my voice in the process)\n\nSo, I hope you would like to join me on the journey.\n\nEnjoy, and please let me know if you run into any problems in the tutorials, I'd like to help.\n\nRyan\n\n\nYou can get the tutorial in the link below\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/project-little-adventurer-learn-to-create-a-3d-action-game", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1lqxiS4XlE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1lqxiS4XlE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1lqxiS4XlE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1lqxiS4XlE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1lqxiS4XlE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Soul Delivery Demo releases trailer 02", "description": "My Unity course with coupon code applied:\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/project-little-adventurer-learn-to-create-a-3d-action-game/?couponCode=C7C752A911A50C9B5368\n\nYou can try the free demo here:\nhttps://singlemindedryan.itch.io/projectlittleadventurerandie\n\nThis is a tutorial that took me 16 months to make\n\n18 months ago, I came up with the idea of making a unity tutorial to support my game development career, because I thought naively that I could make a tutorial in a shorter time than a video game.\n\nTurns out, I spent 2 months learning and creating all the art assets for it (characters, animations, environment, etc..), and what happen next, which was the recording and video editing became a total nightmare.\n\nOK, we see YouTubers updating videos daily, so what could be the problem for me?
