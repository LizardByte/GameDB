Climb ladders, jump over traps and hop across platforms to grab every food item in sight: get them all, and the next level will present an entirely new type of delicacy to quell your appetite. Beware the scorpions, and watch out for mystery jars - most of them will get you a score bonus, but some may contain a snake.", "videos": [{"id": 22984, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "OAzhfe4VBBc"}]}
