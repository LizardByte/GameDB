Said overhauls include a new cyberware system, which correlates V\u2019s armor stats to your equipped cyberware rather than your clothing. This offers a greater degree of expression alongside stat-based boosts and debuffs depending on your layout; a new perks system that introduces the ability to deflect bullets, dash in mid-air, and a variety of finishing moves; and an all-new skill tree associated with the Relic chip embedded in V\u2019s body, which only further supercharges your various abilities.\n\nUpdate 2.0 also brings an introduction of a brand-new vehicular combat system, allowing V to ride shotgun and hack nearby vehicles while in-transit to inflict carnage on any would-be assailants. The introduction of vehicular combat comes with an overhaul to the game\u2019s \u201cwanted\u201d system, allowing various tiers of the NCPD to give chase until they finally throw the big guns at you: The heavily-armored and highly lethal MaxTac Psycho Squad.\n\nCyberpunk 2077's 2.0 Update also comes with over 100 new items, ranging from new weapons, to new pieces of clothing, to new Cyberware, to new vehicles.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-2-dot-0-update", "videos": [{"id": 96591, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zBrkG3aeWCc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBrkG3aeWCc", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty \u2014 New Ways to Play", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zBrkG3aeWCc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97870, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "odf7Q8Plcvw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odf7Q8Plcvw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 \u2014 Update 2.0 Date Reveal", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/odf7Q8Plcvw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
