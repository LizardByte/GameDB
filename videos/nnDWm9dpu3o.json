Explore an infinite number of ever-changing new lands, expand your settlements from sprawling villages to vast cities and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about buying ISLANDERS please keep in mind that we are a very passionate but small team of three. This is not a blockbuster experience with hours and hours of content. What we\u2019d like to offer you is a simple game that lets anybody create and explore their own little worlds, while providing enough depth for players who want to challenge themselves. And you can get it at the price of a medium sized pumpkin spice matcha caramel latte.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact us if you have feedback, questions, or problems with the game. We\u2019ll do our best to get back to you as quickly as possible and provide support if needed. Also let us know if you enjoyed the game, because that makes our day!\n\n#indiegames #strategygames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnDWm9dpu3o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnDWm9dpu3o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnDWm9dpu3o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnDWm9dpu3o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnDWm9dpu3o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ISLANDERS Launch Trailer - Minimalist City Builder", "description": "ISLANDERS on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/\n\nISLANDERS is a minimalist strategy game about building cities on colorful islands.
