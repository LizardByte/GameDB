The doctor turned on the power and the miniaturization process began.\n\nAfter a few moments of blinding white light, Bob Jones was reduced to the size of a few microns.\n\nThe experiment seemed to be a success but the Molecular Miniaturizer suddenly started smoking and a few seconds later, exploded, killing all those in the lab, including Dr. Schnapps.\n\nBob Jones, now known as MicroMan, was never found after the explosion.\n\nHowever, since the Molecular Miniaturizer and its creator had both been destroyed, it didn't really matter \u2013 there was no hope to return MicroMan (formerly Bob Jones) to his original size.\n\nMicroMan now finds himself in a strange and hostile world where he is one of the smallest inhabitants. Now, his mission is personal: to explore and stay alive.", "summary": "A platformer developed for Windows 3.1.\n\nThe game is broken into two episodes: Adventure 1: Crazy Computers and Adventure 2: Savage Stones.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 49564, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "a3u6odKo2Vo"}]}
