Stuck in a chicken cage, getting launched by a conveyor belt, it's a sad sad world. \nIn the game 80 players are stuck on top of a disk above a gruesome grinder. The disk is unbalanced and if someone falls off the disk they die and turn into a chicken nugget. \nThe player has a few moves, walking, sprinting, jumping and dashing which can be used to survive the race. The final player on the disk wins the game and gets the highest score bonus. The number one player on the leaderboard gets to wear the crown, this makes him/her the ultimate nugget master, king of the chickens. \nScore in the form of nuggets to unlock new hats, like a visor cap, ketchup cap, deep fry basket and a drinking lid. Collect all the hats!\nPlayers who eat the most corn grow the biggest and have an easier time pushing other chickens of the disk. When starting the game you are at the smallest size but you do have some jumping advantages. \nEat corn, dash other players, stay on the highest point of the disk and have fun. Come play NuggetRoyale.io, it's free.\n\nThe game is online multiplayer but can also be played locally with up to 4 players on one computer.  \n\nFollow Pelican Party Studios on social media!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pelican_party\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PelicanParty/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/PelicanPart...\n\nNugget Royale links:\nhttps://nuggetroyale.io/\nhttps://nuggetroyale.com/\n\nA game by:\nPelicanparty.co", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JLWfJ7jexBE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JLWfJ7jexBE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JLWfJ7jexBE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JLWfJ7jexBE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JLWfJ7jexBE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\ud83d\udd2a BUTCHER UPDATE  - NUGGET ROYALE UPDATE \ud83d\udd2a", "description": "You are on the cutting board about to be chopped up by the butcher, dodge all the knives or be cut into pieces. \ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udd2a\nNew stages, hats and much more! \n\ud83d\udc13  Play Nugget Royale here: https://nuggetroyale.io/  \ud83d\udc13 \n\n\nJoin the Nugget Army on social media!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NuggetRoyale\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NuggetRoyale...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nuggetroyale/\n\nNugget Royale is a game where you play as a little chicken that fights for its poor life in a factory farm.
