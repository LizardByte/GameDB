With his powerful evil power, the legacy of Count Dracula has been dreaded by the people. However, no matter how many times Dracula comes back, he never manages to fully change the world into darkness as he is always put away by Simon, a descendant of the Belmont clan.\nHowever, the devil Dracula has existed long before his first confrontation. Not as the devil Dracula, but as an evil sorcerer. Count Dracula was a fanatical demon worshiper, who built a dark castle at the outskirts of Transylvania and conducted evil rituals every night. He has summoned several demons from the other world to serve him and he himself has been trying to get eternal life by becoming a demon king possessing evil powers.\nWith each day, Count Dracula's evil powers became more frightening, as he spread fear and terror to the people of the village. Until one day, a man stood up. It was Christopher, an ancestor of the Belmont family. Christopher rushed to the dark castle. Many demons and traps laid out are waiting for him at the castle. Will he be able to defeat the transformed devil, Count Dracula, as expected?", "summary": "Battle against Dracula's forces once more as Christopher Belmont in Castlevania The Adventure - Masque of Retribution!\nEnhanced Visuals, smoother controls and gameplay, remixed and remastered OST, a completely overhauled set of bosses; Castlevania The Adventure - Masque of Retribution is the definitive way to play this reimagined classic by Konami!\nAs with the previous WarMachine Studios releases, this is a NON-PROFIT FAN REMAKE. No monies were exchanged in any way for the creation of this game.
