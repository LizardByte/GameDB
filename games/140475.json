It features ray-traced graphics with many options to customize the game and has a worldwide high score competition. \n \nThe play field is covered with colored tiles. When tiles of the same color are touching, they are grouped and can be eliminated from the field by clicking them. The other pieces on the screen fall into the holes left by the removed pieces which changes the layout of the play field. That is where the strategy comes in. The player has to consider the current move and it's ramification. You can even achieve an \"ultra-high scoring combo\" if you move the pieces in a clever way.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flux--1", "videos": [{"id": 42218, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "uCDroHotVlk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCDroHotVlk", "title": "Flux", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uCDroHotVlk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
