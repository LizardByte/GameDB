As a player, you direct the servants and heroes to remove obstacles, build structures and collect resources in order to fulfil the goal of each level and move on to the next level. The game has two modes: timed and relaxed. In timed mode, your goal is to beat the best time, which is a pretty hardcore experience. In relaxed mode, time is of no significance, and you just need to complete levels.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 31297, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rpaSxx7SCw0"}, {"id": 31298, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cEA6ssJ3bpY"}]}
