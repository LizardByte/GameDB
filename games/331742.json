We have to venture into space and mine as much ore as we can for the home planet. Can you survive the harsh environment of an asteroid field? Use probes to discover the sector. Pilot mining ships or direct mining drones to mine ore from asteroids that fly by. Protect Outpost Sigma from collisions using shields. Buy from trading ships. Transports will come to take the much needed ore back to Sigma Prime. If the situation goes bad, you must escape! Good Luck. This is a single-player 2D top-down pixel game with space physics. Random generation makes every run unique. If you ever want to just mine some asteroids while trying to survive the harshness of space, this is the game for you.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-outpost-sigma"}
