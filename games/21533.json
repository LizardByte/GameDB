Now an agent for a special security agency, Leon is sent to Spain on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult organization.", "summary": "Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition features the bonus content from the PS2 version and has many alterations compared to previous ports, taking Wiimote aiming into account. The shooting mechanism uses a much larger reticule that turns from green to red when an enemy is targeted as opposed to a very narrow laser sight, a \"quick knife\" command is added that auto-targets the nearest enemy or object, and motion sensitive quick time event prompts are included as well as button presses.\n\nVisually the game is on par with the original GameCube version as opposed to the somewhat inferior graphics of the PlayStation 2 version, although in very few instances the inferior PS2 graphics are mistakenly retained such as herbs having lower detail models in some places. The Wii version also supports the Wii's Classic Controller, which reverts aiming and the laser sight back to the original format. The only other noticeable differences are that the game seems significantly easier, and that all of Leon's actions appear to move slightly faster.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-4-wii-edition"}
