As a hot air balloon operator you'll be left mostly to the mercy of the winds having no control over your balloons movements on the X or Y axis.

The wind changes at different altitudes, you'll be aware of the way it's blowing at every height thanks to a wind compass on the right side of the screen, so you'll have to make shrewd use of it to get where you're going.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 38739, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yQN3ZgW8hLg"}]}
