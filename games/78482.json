The version by Asobo Studio is, like other versions, a 3D platform game, but has its own design, levels and missions.\n\nThe game follows the plot of the film only loosely, but has the main voice cast from the movie reprising their roles. The player controls Remy, a rat with a refined sense of taste. When Remy finds himself in Paris near the restaurant of the famous deceased chef Gusteau, he works on making his dream of becoming a chef himself come true, while helping out his fellow rats to procure food.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ratatouille--1"}
