You shoot enemies (obviously), but there's a twist!\n\nThe mouse is used to aim your crosshair, and enemies launch attacks that are one of two colors. Shoot their blue attacks before they hit the screen's edge, while dodging their red attacks before they hit your crosshair. The game strikes a beautiful dynamic of shooting blue while dodging red, leading to a fresh, frantic, and fast-paced action game unlike any other. Even if you have never played another light-gun game, Oblivion Eagle is perfect for anyone to pick up and play. A color-blind mode is available, too!\n\nWEBSITE: https://www.nickdonnoligames.com/games-oblivion-eagle\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtXkDzzbz_26gbzmuRVLOiw\n\nThanks to ThatGuyWhoGames for text effects: https://youtube.com/c/ThatGuyWhoGames\n\n#gaming #pcgaming #arcade", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4L8ZEuwbcZY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4L8ZEuwbcZY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4L8ZEuwbcZY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4L8ZEuwbcZY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4L8ZEuwbcZY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Oblivion Eagle - Reveal Trailer", "description": "Play Oblivion Eagle on STEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2256950/Oblivion_Eagle/\nPlay Oblivion Eagle on ITCH.IO: https://nickdonnoligames.itch.io/oblivion-eagle\n\nJoin the DISCORD server and keep up with game development: https://discord.com/invite/hmfdXs6hQK\n\nOblivion Eagle is a light-gun game reminiscent of classics like House of the Dead and Time Crisis, while also having elements that appeal to fans of Osu!, Undertale, and Touhou.
