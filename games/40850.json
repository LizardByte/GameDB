Both feature authentic table layouts, targets, and bonuses; the conversion of Elvira and the Party Monsters also features digitized sound effects, including the voice of Cassandra Peterson (Elvira). \n \nEach table scrolls up and down during gameplay (as opposed to just \"snapping\" to a new area as the ball reaches it).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-jam"}
