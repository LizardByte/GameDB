With that said, its no surprise that Midway brings NHL Hitz 20-03 to GameCube, with Hitz' trademark 'On-Fire Mode', over-the-top animations, and fully 3D crowds. Like all NHL Hitz games, NHL Hitz 20-03 features gameplay modes for up to 6 players, in-game fights and hidden teams, players and stadiums. The game will also feature Create-A-Player modes and mini-games."}
