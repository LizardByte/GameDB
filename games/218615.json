This particular version differs significantly from its computer and console counterparts. It adopts a top-down action game format featuring 3D characters across forty levels. During gameplay, the player can seamlessly switch between Wolverine, Iceman, and Magneto in certain levels, while others focus on controlling Nightcrawler exclusively. Character movement is facilitated through the Control Pad, while all other character actions are executed via the touch screen. The lower screen serves as the gameplay area, displaying the characters, while the upper screen provides information on their status.\n\nNightcrawler possesses teleportation abilities, Wolverine excels in ground-based attacks, Iceman specializes in shooting ice attacks, and Magneto can manipulate metallic objects, including picking them up and throwing them. Magneto is also capable of breaking metal doors. Each character's attacks have varying effectiveness against enemies, making it essential for the player to switch between characters to defeat them frequently. In addition to the standard enemies, many levels also feature formidable boss characters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-the-official-game--2"}
