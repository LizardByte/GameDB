The Space Marines fleet will be available on June 21, and will be playable in the multiplayer modes of Battlefleet Gothic. \n\nAs advertised for several months, the Space Marines faction - as well as the Tau faction currently under development - is free to all Early Adopters of the game. The Early Adopter offer applies to all pre-purchase owners and people who buy the game during the first two months of the game\u2019s release \u2013 until June 21. Players now only have few days left to purchase their Early Adopters Edition of the game and receive for free the Space Marines and the Tau factions. Players who will purchase Battlefleet Gothic: Armada after June 21 will be able to purchase the Space Marines and The Tau as DLCs. \n\nThe Space Marines are the greatest of humanity\u2019s warriors, fierce soldiers that have been subjected to intense training, genetic modification, and psycho-conditioning. Their fleets are experts at close-ranged battles, sporting well-armoured ships and specialize in aggressive boarding techniques. In addition, they have access to two unique faction traits which makes them immune to insubordination mechanics and gives them the ability to prioritize their attacks on different subsystems when boarding. \nThe Space Marines DLC includes 5 different Space Marine chapters. The past week, we introduced you the Dark Angels and the Space Wolves. This week, we\u2019re unveiling more about the Ultramarines, the Imperial Fists and the Blood Angels.\nThe Ultramarines pride themselves on their strict adherence to the Codex Astartes, and view themselves as an example for all Space Marines Chapters. To the Ultramarines, the Codex is more than a set of rules, it represents discipline and respect for order. They are among the best warriors of the Imperium.\n\nThe Imperial Fists are recognized to be among the most loyal Chapters to the Emperor and have been instrumental in holding the Imperium together during the bleakest of times, with renowned stubborn resilience. They are Siege Warfare specialists, a title exemplified with their role in leading the defence of Earth, which gave them the title of \"Defenders of Terra\".\n\nThe Blood Angels are a Chapter known for their impressive bloodlust, and an occasionnal deadly rage, but also for their keen aesthetic skills and their exceptionnal longevity, even for Space Marines. Their Chapter Master, Dante, is more than a millennia-old, and leads his Chapter wisely and with exceptional efficiency.\n\nBattlefleet Gothic Armada\u2019s Space Marines DLC will be available from June 21 at the price of \u20ac6,99, and free for all Early Adopters.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pxdtigmeDY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pxdtigmeDY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pxdtigmeDY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pxdtigmeDY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pxdtigmeDY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Battlefleet Gothic: Armada - Space Marines Trailer", "description": "Get it now on STEAM: http://store.steampowered.com/app/363680\nWebsite: http://www.battlefleetgothic-armada.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BattlefleetGothicGame\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bfg_armada\n\nBattlefleet Gothic: Armada unveils its Space Marines trailer\nThe Space Marines DLC will release on June 21\n\nBattlefleet Gothic: Armada, the RTS videogame adaptation of Games Workshop\u2019s classic tabletop game by Tindalos Interactive today unveils a new video trailer presenting the Space Marines - its upcoming faction.
