The game thats crossed between a shoot em up, and a platformer. You play as noah, running through each stage shooting an array of different animals and creatures, while the sea rises up in order to drown you. After each mission theres a boss, and once you defeat him you get the chance to grab hold of some fruit, which seems to be noahs favorite food. \nThe game itself was a bit cheesey, but wasnt oo bad. It made me feel like i had to finish each round in order to not feel defeated. Id actually like to do a full playthrough of this one at some point. \nIts not the most common game to get hold of, but if you do see a copy, its worth picking up for its novelty value.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWTp9GcHHbs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWTp9GcHHbs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWTp9GcHHbs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWTp9GcHHbs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Noahs Ark Nintendo N.E.S.
