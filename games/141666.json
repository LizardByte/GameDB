However, with the development of the submarine, that strength also exposed a vulnerability. Britain was absolutely dependent on its maritime lifeline, a lifeline the Germans had nearly severed in the Great War, and one they would attack with even more fury in the Second World War. \n \nWolfpack covers the battles over that lifeline, not only from the perspective of the U-Boats, but also that of the escort commanders on their cold and lonely vigils in the North Atlantic. \n \nCan you bring down the transports that carried the very life blood of Britain? Can you keep the hunters of the sea away, and keep your charges safe?", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/naval-campaigns-wolfpack", "collections": [{"id": 5959, "name": "Naval Campaigns"}]}
