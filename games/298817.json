Only available for the NEC PC-9801 computer, this was the most ambitious game the industry had ever conceived. Unfortunately, it was a sales failure and was lost in the abyss of time.\n\nMore than 30 years later, One More Encounter (a.k.a OME) has been partially revived. One More Encounter was a dungeon crawler where the important thing was not the motif, but the journey itself and the characters we encountered along the way. Unfortunately, only 0.35% of the total game could be saved. That is, of the more than two thousand possible encounters in the game, this version only contains seven.\n\nBe that as it may, this is a look at a world that could have been, an industry that never really took hold, and a type of videogame that, so many years later, we are still struggling to make.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-more-encounter"}
