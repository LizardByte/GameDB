The summer breeze sweeps in from the sea, soothing man and beast; hard working farmers, lazy dogs, sneaky cats, and horses. School's out and the seemingly endless summer vacation has just begun. There is no more homework, no more dusty history classes with Mrs. Corkwood, or mind-numbing science experiments with Mr. Flagstaff.\n\nJust day after day of working for Herman who runs Jorvik Stables, riding and caring for the\n\nhorses. Life simply couldn't be better.\n\nThen Coyote arrives.\n\nHe is Herman's brother, and he's decided to come home after two decades out West, where he has been a professional rodeo performer. Now he plans to build a Western-style riding park in Jorvik.\n\nAnd he wants your help!\n\nSoon there is fierce activity on Jorvik's northwestern peninsula, where farmland and swampland are rapidly being converted into paddocks and trails, and where you and the rest of the crew have a very limited time to learn barrel racing, pole bending, trail riding and show jumping. It is hard work and you have never had more fun in your life. But something is lurking beneath the surface. Strange rumors and intriguing gossip are spreading among the people on the farms and at Jorvik Ranch.\n\nIs there more to Coyote's return than just homesickness?\n\nAnd will you be able to uncover his secret?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-stable-the-summer-rider", "videos": [{"id": 105600, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "maLzDdWSxjc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maLzDdWSxjc", "title": "Star Stable SUMMER RIDERS | Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/maLzDdWSxjc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
