Battle tanks, planes and artillery units against the CPU, against a friend or online over Game Center against your friends.\n\nOnline play with Game Center can be done turn-based (asynchronously) or in real-time live (as shown in vid where the opponent sees what you see, even with iPhone vs iPad!).\n\nThe game also has a huge mission campaign allowing you to rise up through the army ranks in single player, where you can show off your superior rank to your online foes! See the App Store description for more details.\n\nNote: This game version in the vid is quite old - it has since had a few tweaks like nicer (non-system!) popup message boxes and a pencil shadow, amongst other improvements.\n\nMusic (used in-game): 'No Honour No Glory' by Chris Haigh.\n\nAvailable now on the App Store!\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/app/lead-wars/id393340337?mt=8\n\nhttp://www.demonstudios.com\nhttp://facebook.com/DemonStudios\nhttp://twitter.com/DemonStudios", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLT1AzzAhLE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLT1AzzAhLE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLT1AzzAhLE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLT1AzzAhLE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLT1AzzAhLE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lead Wars - Pencil & Paper War Simulation for iOS", "description": "Lead Wars is a simulation of a real-life old-skool turn-based pencil & paper wargame, the likes of which were popular back in the 70s and 80s long before there were portable gaming devices!\n\nIt's a Universal app so works full-screen on iPad and iPhone / iPod touch.\n\nLead Wars requires skill as well as strategy.
