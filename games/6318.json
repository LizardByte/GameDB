While her real body would still be stuck underground, she could now initiate a scheme of revenge against Banjo and Kazooie at will. Kidnapping Kazooie, she goes back in time (supposedly 20 years, although the actual amount of time is unknown) with the plan to prevent the bear and bird duo from ever meeting in order to erase her prior defeat from history and restoring her to her previous self.", "summary": "Gruntilda is back, and it's up to Banjo and Kazooie to stop her master plan. In Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, you'll play as Banjo and follow him through six worlds rife with trials and contests. Some of the challenges you must overcome include solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles, and battling different enemies. Defeat your foes by using Banjo's array of combat moves. You can also seek help from witch doctors, who can transform Banjo into a mouse, a tank, and other creatures.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/banjo-kazooie-grunty-s-revenge", "videos": [{"id": 39904, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qZOBhJu2mss", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZOBhJu2mss", "title": "Banjo Kazooie Grunty's Revenge (GBA) Longplay [175]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZOBhJu2mss/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 440, "name": "Banjo-Kazooie"}]}
