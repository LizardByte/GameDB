Vagn, a dark-skinned Viking, is our guide in this expansion. We chose one of the six rivers on the map to navigate and we went on the attack! The new maps are all based on river systems, which consist of a meandering main course with islands and interconnecting side channels. Scattered along the banks of the river are civilian settlements, military compounds, monasteries and druid camps. Each of these location types offers different challenges and rewards. The maps are: River Exe, River Severn, River Dee, River Erriff, River Berbha and my favorite: the River Rhine (it's in France and it has a very big city, I was impressed!).", "summary": "River Raids is a free update for Assassin's Creed: Valhalla. Released as part of Title Update 1.1.2, the update adds the replayable river raiding mode based on the existing raiding feature in the base game and introduces three distinct maps of rivers for players to explore; namely the River Exe, the River Severn and the River Dee. The update also added new quests and a set of armor and weapon to obtain through the new map.\n\nAn additional update in conjunction with the Ostara Season content added a second armor set to be obtained.\n\nA third update introducing the River Erriff, the River Berbha and the River Rhine was released on 7 September 2021, featuring new questlines to obtain Lugh's Spear and the Ulfberht Sword.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla-river-raids", "collections": [{"id": 18, "name": "Assassin's Creed"}]}
