Once the crystal has been destroyed the volcano in which Durgan is located will start to erupt making it imperative that you reach the surface again before it blows.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barbarian--1", "videos": [{"id": 120316, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "M54hoUUqpe8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M54hoUUqpe8", "title": "1GO Short Play - Barbarian (Psygnosis) (Amiga)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M54hoUUqpe8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
