Play as a lonely timid frog, determined to make his mark on a mapset that's ever so crumbling around him. Make your way through exhilarated, magnificent and enchanting landscapes. Move with frog, live with frog, breathe with frog. Be. Frog.\n\nExamine the memes through the eyes of your frog, and allow the sun rays to reflect through the intricate pixels of the fireblu walls. Ever wondered what it would be like to platform in the doom engine? Controls reversed? Solve puzzles? Or how about owning your own revenant rocket with a personality more ecstatic and enchantingly realistic than any class clown or surf shop employee? It can all be done with Poogers."}
