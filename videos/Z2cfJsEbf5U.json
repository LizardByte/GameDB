This collection contains seven JP games, five of which were originally developed and released by Ocean Software.

Since the Carbon Engine doesn't support those yet, their ommissions can be easily forgiven.\n\nThere aren't that many critic reviews of the collection, but PS5 and Switch versions have a total MetaCritic score of 55 and 50 respectively. Both versions only have one negative review each, while the rest of the reviews were mixed. COGconnected rated the PS5 version a 45/100, where he praises the music player and rewind features, as well as the Game Boy titles being pretty fun, but doesn't exactly recommend the collection unless you happen to be a diehard fan of the franchise. The only negative review of the Switch version came from The Jimquisition, who was a lot more harsh, giving it a score of 2/10. They even went as far as to say that they'd \"have taken Jurassic Park: Trespasser over anything within this compilation\", stating that at least Trespasser was \"intriguing\" in its awfulness.\n\nThe highest score on the Switch version is from Gaming Age, who gave it a 7/10, while the highest for the PS5 version is from God is a Geek, who gave it 6.5/10. The latter criticised the collection for very little additional content, control mapping on the analog sticks, most of the games' age and too many of said games being similar to each other, it was praised for the in-game maps and the rewind functions, as well as the SNES game being still enjoyable to play after all those years.\n\nThe only Xbox Series X|S reviews of this game are from Gamereactor Finland, Eurogamer Germany and Xbox Achievements, all of them being mixed reviews. The highest is from Gamereactor Finland, who gave it an 8 (70 on MetaCritic), while the lowest was from Xbox Achievements, who gave it a 50%.\n\nThat leaves the PC version (which you are seeing in the video), as the only critic review was from The Guardian, who gave it 3/5 stars. Keith Stuart, who wrote the review, does make an interesting conclusion regarding retro game compilations, stating that \"the same old arguments apply to this release as to all retro compilations: you can find these games online then run them on an open source emulator for free, though you won\u2019t get the modern save features. You could buy an original console and a copy of the games on eBay, but then that will work out much more expensive and unreliable.\" Strangely, I actually agree with him on that.\n\nAs far as user reviews go, MetaCritic user ratings total to an 8.2 on Switch, with the only written user review being on the PS4 version. RemyLebeauX, who wrote the PS4 version's review, states that while the omission of the Mega CD and the rail shooter arcade game is a missed oppoturnity and the collection could have been better, he would still recommend it to both Retro Gaming fans & fans of Jurassic Park, even praising the fact that the Platinum trophy simply requires you to beat each game.\n\nFinally, the Steam version got 63 reviews (46 in English) and the overall reception is considered to be \"Mostly Positive\". Most users were happy those games were even ported to begin with, though some are disappointed the Master System and Game Gear titles were missing. The quality of the original games varied, obviously, but the negative reviews' common issues were the price (which is around 30$), lack of the DOS version, as well as the fact that the collection felt barebones, especially when compared to Digital Eclipse's efforts like Atari 50 or TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z2cfJsEbf5U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z2cfJsEbf5U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z2cfJsEbf5U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z2cfJsEbf5U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z2cfJsEbf5U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Jurassic Park, Limited Run Games and Universal worked together to bring a collection of games based on the very first film, thus giving them an official re-release for modern platforms, all while using the Carbon Engine.
