The story envisions a fictional world dreamed by Chopin during his last hours that is influenced by Chopin's life and music, and in which he himself is a playable character, among others. The game's battle system centers on musical elements and character-unique special attacks. Light and darkness play a part in the appearance and abilities of enemies on the battlefield, as well as the types of magic that can be cast.\n\nThe game features a selection of Chopin's compositions played by pianist Stanislav Bunin, though the original compositions were composed and arranged by Motoi Sakuraba. It is notable for its use of classical piano pieces, educational cutscenes featuring real paintings and photographs (in contrast to the cel-shading graphics of the game) and lush landscape design.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eternal-sonata", "videos": [{"id": 10048, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EPIthYJXZxI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPIthYJXZxI", "title": "Eternal Sonata trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EPIthYJXZxI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
