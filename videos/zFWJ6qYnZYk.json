In Explosive Candy World, you\u2019ll have to destroy obstacles, blow yourself over pitfalls and ricochet off walls in order to reach the goal! It\u2019s physics-based mayhem with a precision platforming twist. Presented in cute and colorful pixel art and set to an original retro soundtrack, Explosive Candy World mixes classic style with modernized mechanics for a unique and unconventional platforming experience.\n\nAdjust the strength and direction of your detonations, then release to toss a mighty explosive candy. Propel yourself through the air, flip switches, break barriers, activate buttons and obliterate platforms right from under your feet! Levels are all short and sweet, and even when they prove to be a little tricky, quick respawns and infinite retries keep the experience fun and accessible.\n\n\u00a9 Eastasiasoft Limited, Marcos Game Dev, Ratalaika Games S.L.
