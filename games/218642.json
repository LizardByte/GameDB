An indeterminable amount of time passes after the first game and a new phenomenon is bearing down on the residents of the Country of Hearts. The Crazy Storm will change something about each and every one of the residents, including the people whom Alice loves.\n\nEven before the storm arrives, Alice finds that she has no memory of two of the residents of the Hatter Mansion, Humpty and Dumpty.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice dreams about two mysterious eggs who urge Alice to become their king and hatch them.", "summary": "Wonderful Twin World is a continuation of \"Heart no Kuni no Alice\", and its fandisc.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}]}
