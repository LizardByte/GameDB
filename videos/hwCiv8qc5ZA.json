The scene then switches to a map of a portion of Elwood City, showing the eight people's locations and the Ice Cream Shop. We must choose 6 steps (or fewer) for George to take to deliver ice cream to that person. Each step, George goes in a straight line in the direction chosen to a person's house. George can only stop to change direction at people's houses but does not have to if the person was not chosen. The goal is to get George to the selected person in as few steps as possible.\n\nSubscribe to my channel!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hwCiv8qc5ZA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hwCiv8qc5ZA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hwCiv8qc5ZA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hwCiv8qc5ZA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Arthur: Go!
