Featuring realistic tuning and modification of your mud-spattered vehicle, it's not just your rallying career youll build up as you race - every part of the car that can be tweaked in reality can be honed in Euro Rally Champion for a fully-customisable rally experience. But even if you don't know your \"rear differential\" from your \"toe-in\" you won't be left choking on the starting grid as Euro Rally Champion gives drivers all of the adrenaline and emotion of an arcade racer as well as the precision and realism of a true simulation. In addition to the single player Time Trial and Championship modes, you can go head-to-head in \"foot to the floor\" multiplayer sessions. Budding stunt drivers and those who simply fancy flipping their car without the risk of fractured limbs and bruised pride can even burn rubber on one of the special Extreme Exhibition stages. These are filled with mad jumps, perilous slopes and the chance to barrel roll your way around adrenaline-inducing arenas of motoring insanity.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/euro-rally-champion"}
