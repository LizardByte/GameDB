Battle mode (the standard Bomberman game), is joined by tennis, golf and baseball games. At the center of all this is the Living mode, a character building feature in which the player can design a Bomberman for use in any of the battle modes.\n\nBattle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other Bomberman games. This mode is essentially the standard Bomberman formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode, although they all center around the standard Bomberman gameplay.\n\nClassic Battle: A standard deathmatch-type game.\nStar Battle: Collect the most stars.\nCrown Battle: Find the crown in the level to win the game.\nPoint Battle: Earn the most points by killing opponents\nReplay: Watched game sessions saved to memory card.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 71536, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8X_QmrEXQoU"}]}
