Run the sheriff\u2019s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate.

A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It\u2019s all of these, and more!\n\nDive into a one-of-a-kind -story-driven experience.\nWelcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn\u2019t spiral out of control.\n\nTake charge of the Sheriff\u2019s department.\nYour subordinates aren\u2019t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears, and prejudices \u2013 and you'll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You\u2019ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department.\n\nEngage in tactical combat.\nDuring your most dangerous operations, the game will switch to turn-based combat. Gather a team of your finest cops. Carefully study the terrain, adapt your plans, stealthily approach your suspects, and use non-lethal weapons and equipment \u2013 if the situation allows. True, sometimes gunfights are almost impossible to avoid, but be careful: This Is the Police 2 doesn\u2019t have hit points. A single bullet can cost a cop their life.\n\nBecome a true detective.\nCollect evidence, study case materials, interrogate suspects, and send the criminals to court. And if the suspect was innocent? Perhaps it's time to find out if any Sharpwood judges can be bought.\n\n#ThisIsThePolice #WeappyStudio #HandyGames\n\nby http://www.handy-games.com. \u25b6\n\nJoin us on Facebook: http://www.fb.com/handygames\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/handygames\nCheck news on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/handy_games\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: http://goo.gl/2Kq6yY", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GU5P35qbOMk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GU5P35qbOMk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GU5P35qbOMk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GU5P35qbOMk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GU5P35qbOMk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "This Is the Police 2 - Mobile // Official Trailer", "description": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/this-is-the-police-2/id1453820315\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.titp2\n\n\n\n#ThisIsThePolice2 #TITP2 #NoirDrama #Strategy\n\nInterpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police!
