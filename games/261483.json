This is a one-man megawad and all maps were made by me. I would categorize the maps as slaughter-lite, meaning it is not full-on slaughter but you might face a horde or two, especially the farther into the wad you go. The WAD is broken down into six 5-map episodes. There are 4 new monster types and 2 bosses added.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/azazels-second-descent"}
