The diabolical Dr. Robotnik has created a robot factory and it's up to Sonic to stop the metal mutants. Sonic works his way through maze-like rooms in an attempt to remove the Chaos Emeralds, the factory's only power source. Team up with Sonic through 12 levels of fast and furious action as he tries to put Dr. Robotnik out of business for good!", "summary": "Amazing Sonic is a 1994 LCD game distributed by Tomy, and part of the Pocket Arcade series. A pop-up lid must be lifted to play the game. The LCD is not backlit, and is hard to see without proper light. It is slightly hard to control since the directional pad is separated into two different sections, making the game hard to figure out without instructions. Sonic must navigate through 12 maze-like levels."}
