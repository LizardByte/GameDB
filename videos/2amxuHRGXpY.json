The game was a launch title for the system in North America and Europe.\n\nEvergrace features two main characters, Darius the swordsman and Sharline the homemaker, with two distinctly different storylines and different battle techniques. The game allows players to switch between characters at any save point, and uses an experience system dependent on items and equipment rather than statistical upgrades. Another feature is the Palmira Action System which allows players to improve the physical abilities of their characters by combining specialized crystals with their armaments.\n\nEvergrace also features a bonus dungeon that is named after Shadow Tower, another game by From Software, a company is often known for including past game references in their games. The Moonlight Sword, for example, a weapon that originated in their flagship series, King's Field, also appears in Evergrace as well as its follow-up Forever Kingdom.\n\n\nThe continent of Edinbury once held the largest and most powerful empire of all time: the Rieubane Empire. This empire was primarily ruled by Morpheus, a powerful magician, and his servants and clients. Morphius became devoted to studying the Crest, a series of markings on one's hand, and are considered cursed due to the misfortunes that happen to the Crestbearers. Morpheus was fascinated with the Crest and performed several experiments, thus creating the powerful Palmira Armaments and the man-made AI Crest. After capturing a renegade soldier who had the Crest, Morpheus ordered the Empire to invade Toledo, a nearby independent village in the Billiana forest, because they worshiped the Crest and were supposedly a threat to the balance of Rieubane. The Empire would never have agreed with Morpheus if they knew his real reason for invading the Toledans: simply to acquire more test subjects. In the end, the Empire effortlessly crushed Toledo, but as the flames grew higher, the Rieubane Empire, Toledo and the Human Research Lab suddenly and completely disappeared. People came to call Rieubane \"the Lost Kingdom\", and the land became overgrown with Billiana Trees. Hundreds of years later, four villages once part of the empire banded together to establish the empire of Fontraile, but this was not to last...\n\n\nThe musical score for Evergrace was composed by Kota Hoshino. He stated in an interview that voices are used as the primary \"instrument\" in the game's soundtrack. Hoshino recorded samples of his own voice and edited them with Soundforge, then recorded more voice samples to create what he considers to be an ethnic sound. Japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi and the shamisen were also added. All the score's percussion was synthesized.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2amxuHRGXpY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2amxuHRGXpY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2amxuHRGXpY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2amxuHRGXpY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Evergrace Official Trailer (2000, Agetech/From Software/Ubisoft)", "description": "Evergrace (\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\u30b9 Ev\u0101gureisu) is a 2000 action role-playing game developed by From Software for the PlayStation 2 and published by Agetec in North America and Ubisoft and Crave Entertainment in PAL territories.
