Once upon a time there was a blob ecosystem on your screen. Blobs have to eat other blobs to create more blobs. If the time is right blobs of the same color can breed. Each time a blob is created you get a point. If a color disappeared from the ecosystem the game is over. If a blob colony grows too large, it may catch a disease, and the population will collapse. Use the tools to help control the blobs ( if you can). You start off with just your finger, and then you\u2019ll get some basic geometric shapes. As the game progresses you\u2019ll get more tools. Bio weapons to spread disease. Nuclear bombs. Radiation that will mutate blob behavior, for better or worse, and your blobs will did off fast. Get wind to blow the blobs. Gravity and antigravity to push the blobs, black holes to suck the blobs away. The most powerful tool of all is love. Good luck.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
