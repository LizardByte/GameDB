Take Lillian into a large host of unique levels, with an assortment of power-ups, and enjoy a fun game every one can pick up relatively easily (or can challenge you when you go the extra mile, you know, if you're into that sort of thing). You can become empathetic and take yourself on a wild ride with the story, or you can DOOM marine it and just play the darn thing without needing any plot!\n\nThe game has reached mid-point development at the release of this trailer, and Luke (the developer) has been working super hard at this! It's been a long while working on this, but this will show that this game is aimed to come out in a matter of time (and also something for him to look at and say \"oh, man, this is actually happening\").\n\nTo support Luke and keep up to date, you can check our Twitter page (which I, the musician and social media guru, keep on tabs and update for him)!\n\n-| TWITTER |-\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Psycutlery\n\n\n-| OUR HUMBLE WEBSITE |-\nhttp://www.eyesineverything.com/main/\n\n-| FACEBOOK |-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EyesEverything/\n\n-| INSTAGRAM |-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/Psycutlery/\n\nThanks again, you guys, for the support!
