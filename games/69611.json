You play a bomb-squad cop in pursuit of crazed bomber Jimmy Scaggs, you follow the storyline through videos and then get to navigate through virtual rooms filled with hot spots. Clicking on them then leads you to logic-puzzle sequences where your objective is to disarm bombs through said puzzles, usually against a timer. You get logic, number, word and maze puzzles.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blown-away"}
