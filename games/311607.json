Flap the Parrot only has two controls: a right flap, to flap to the right, and a left flap, to flap to the left. As you get higher up the island, you'll encounter new regions with new gimmicks and traps to be wary of. Avoid getting sent back to the ocean down below, and find the treasure at the peak!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-pair-of-feathers-squawk-together"}
