Markus remembered reading an article in his local newspaper about a man being haunted in his own apartment. They portrayed it as a fake because obviously ghosts and paranormal activities don\u00b4t exist, right? Maybe Markus wasn\u00b4t the only one wondering about what could possibly happen next. He told himself he had no reason for believing these fairy tales until he got overwhelmed by his concerns. The last thing Markus remembers is waking up in his bathroom with a serious hangover. It also seems like there are some odd noises outside the door but he could not remember giving his neighbours a key to his apartment. He felt nervousness rising up in him. He needed to contact the guy he read about in the newspaper as soon as possible but... all of Markus\u00b4belongings are outside the bathroom.", "summary": "An indie horror game with an emphasis on sounds and jumpscares, Previous Tenant is not for the faint of heart.\nWho can solve the puzzles and explore the stories surrounding the mysterious Previous Tenant?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/previous-tenant"}
