Arion Dorleac defeated the Succubus in combat, preventing the return of the dark lord Rhogul to this world. But peace has not settled in.

However, that task is complicated, for he will succumb to his curse on the next full moon, ten nights out! Arion must travel the lands, fight those that bind Rhogul's spirit to this world, kill them and take their flames. Only then can he enter Citadale castle one last time and put an end to his curse. But Arion is weak and time is running out. The final adventure has begun...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe third and final installment in the Arion Dorleac Trilogy - and it is bigger and better than ever before! Explore the lands surrounding Citadale island; beautiful forests, dark caverns and bustling towns await. Seek help from the people of the lands, upgrading your character through optional quests.
