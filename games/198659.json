It was released in 1982, and is based on the arcade game, Zaxxon.\n\nThis system uses a \"double panel\" LCD screen, one to simulate the first section of the game (set in space) and another for one of the space stations. Aside from a similar perspective, handheld Zaxxon is very little like the arcade game - the player cannot move upwards or downwards, and many of the memorable scenery in the game (such as the brick walls and turrets) were omitted due to hardware restraints. In essance this turns Zaxxon into a fairly standard LCD shoot-'em-up game, where players move left and right shooting foes before being hit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zaxxon--1"}
