Your only offense is a solid defense! Equip yourself with a variety of stat upgrades, familiars, and abilities to keep enemies at bay. Dodge your way through dozens of randomly selected room layouts, survive until time runs out in each room to advance through a story mode where you'll (reluctantly) meet some odd and interesting characters. If you're in the mood for a real challenge, test your skills in arcade mode! Clear as many rooms as you can and go for a high score.\n\nPersonal space will be available some time this year. Please wish list it on steam if you're interested! The game is completely FREE.\n\nSteam page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1973450/Personal_Space/?beta=0\n\nAlso, follow the lead developer on twitter for updates: \nhttps://twitter.com/DrawmiRami\n\nTrailer created by Diane Sparks:\nhttps://twitter.com/fractaldiane", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_oIsmdKoWM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_oIsmdKoWM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_oIsmdKoWM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Personal Space - Official Trailer", "description": "Personal Space is the only roguelike action RPG all about avoiding others.
