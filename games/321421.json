As she laments her fate and thinks about the bright side of dying at work (enjoy the stigma of working an employee to death, company!), her only regret is that she couldn't read her favourite character's ending in an otome game she loved one last time. But after her vision fades to black, she comes to... right in front of said favourite character in the flesh?! It turns out she was reincarnated as the villainess her bias, Albert, is in love with, just as he's confining her to his manor in his obsession ending!\n\nBut unfortunately, despite the miraculous circumstances, things aren't all roses for our heroine. Just as she's about to jump headfirst into a lovey-dovey life with her best boy, the villainess Meirina's original personality yanks control of the body away from her to express her disgust, just as she did in the original ending. It turns out that the original Meirina's mind takes priority when it comes to dealing with Albert. But a strange sound as the villainess's heart flutters opens up a method to get our heroine's desired ending: raise Meirina's affection levels for Albert until she accepts his mad love, so that they can fall into the darkness together!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yandere-tensei-i-cant-beat-the-programming"}
