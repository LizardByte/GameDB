However, when she starts high school, things remain the same until one day when she accidentally crashes into a person, a girl named Delena. Over four months of talking to Delena, everything changes for Kurai Hana as she begins to realize she\u2019s no longer a ghost.\n\nOne day, while walking through the school corridors, Kurai Hana witnesses people bullying Delena. Now, her objective is to get rid of these horrible individuals each week until she can confess her love to Delena without any distractions between them.", "summary": "True Love For Her (TLFH) is a Yandere game inspired by Yandere Simulator and Life Is Strange that doesn\u2019t compete with the original games.
