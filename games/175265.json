But hey, that'll at least guarantee you an evening of fun on the couch kicking some aliens in the behind while wondering whether it was really necessary to blend a casual strategy game with a fricking dating sim. It's just that one level tho, promised. Well, anyways...\nAt its very core End Matter is an arena-like strategy game set in space: short and action-packed (puke) rounds of conquering new planets, defending them from enemy players, outgrowing their fleets and showing them who's intergalactic boss. On top of its core game play loop the game experiments with some unique game modes and dabbles into a bunch of weird genre blends. Ever wondered what 4 in a row with planets, space ships and black hole guns looks like? You'll find out right after flirting with the thicc planet next door that has a secret love affair with an AI named Steve.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/end-matter"}
