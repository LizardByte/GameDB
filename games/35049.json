Challenge other players in a deathmatch, team deathmatch or even capture the flag. The game is a cyberpunk themed first person shooter, it uses smooth and easy to grasp parkour to enable players to flank other players and much more. While playing, it's probable that time will change which effects every single aspect of the game. The game has three time periods: 1940s, 2015 and 2070. This forces players to adapt to new weapons and change tactics; the time periods each have different mechanics and layouts. Protocol brings together modern and WW2 shooters to create a fulfilling experience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/protocol"}
