What are the sensations? But especially, is there a way to wake up from this sleep? Yes, there is, finally.\n\nIt seems that the coma traps us in a sort of parallel world; no one knows exactly how this is done because it turns out to be different for each person, shaped by the memories and emotions of oneself. What is certain, it's that we now know how to wake up from it: it will be necessary to find a series of significant memories, moments so impressed in the character's mind that they are also present in the parallel world that dominates his deep sleep. Memories are often represented in the form of objects.\n\nIn this near future, the inspectors have the delicate task of investigating the human mind in search of those elements that will bring our loved ones back to life.", "summary": "The Inspector is a short-form first-person adventure about exploring the human mind.
