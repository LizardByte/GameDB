Living there are Mamiya Marie, an alluring older woman, Maria, her gorgeous daughter, and Aira, the estate's maid and caretaker.\n\nTakamiya has been entrusted with tutoring Maria, a girl as undisciplined as she is beautiful, but soon he finds himself seduced by the lewd advances of the three sex-starved women. As their new plaything, he spends his days in abject debauchery as the gears of fate turn increasingly askew...\n\nWill it be a rosy future that awaits him in the end? Or a nightmarish reality...?\n\nThe doors of Black Rose Manor are now open...", "summary": "This new tale from the delightfully twisted mind of Sei Shojo, the creator of Bible Black, is set in the Black Rose Manor, where Mamiya Marie, the CEO of a powerful conglomerate, lives with her youngest daughter, Maria, and a stoic maid, Aira. When Takamiya Ryohei arrives to be Maria's new tutor, he has no idea what kind of tantalizing web he's just fallen into. As the women lure him into debauchery, all his lesson plans soon come unraveled.\n\nYet all is not as it seems in the manor. Surely there must be some reason other than her daughter that keeps such a powerful and important CEO here within its halls. There's also the mystery of why the room next door is strictly forbidden.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sleepless-a-midsummer-nights-dream"}
