{"id": 45367, "genres": [{"id": 31, "name": "Adventure"}], "name": "Mad Martha", "slug": "mad-martha", "summary": "This (mostly) text adventure game places you in the role of hen-pecked hero, Henry Littlefellow. Seeking entertainment once in his life, your goal is to steal back your wages from your wife's purse and head off to the bright lights of the nearby casino (and other establishments) for a night of fun. Unfortunately, your axe-wielding maniac wife won't let things be that simple, and even escaping the house will be tricky without stumbling in the dark or waking the baby and alerting her to your sneaky plan. \n \nMad Martha is primarily a standard text adventure game, however the user is also presented with the odd arcade section (such as collecting \u00a3's of money whilst avoiding the family cat, or dodging frogger-style across a road to go back home and collect the car keys), to break up the game flow. Getting into the casino leads you to the final challenge.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mad-martha"}
