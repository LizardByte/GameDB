With his iron fisted rule, both humans and Reploids alike are now under oppression.\n\nThe game begins with a human Caravan escaping from what was once their home, being chased by a new type of enemy soldiers, the Variant. Zero and the Resistance join the chase, fighting off the Variants and saving the humans. Ciel and Zero meet the leader of the Caravan, Neige, who tells them about the current situation in Neo Arcadia, and that she is now leading her group to Area Zero, where a human settlement was established.\n\nThe Resistance convoy follows the Caravan into Area Zero. Exploring the habitat, Zero soon encounters the Einherjar Eight Warriors and their leader, Craft. Through them, Zero learns of Operation Ragnarok, a military operation where Weil plans to obliterate all inhabitable places like Area Zero so that humans would stop running away from Neo Arcadia. The Einherjar and Craft are the ones who will execute this plan, thinking the humans are foolish to even think of running away from Weil's rule.", "summary": "The Zero Knuckle... the baddest new tool in Zero's arsenal lets you steal enemies' weapons and use them in battle. Employ this along with countless other cool moves to fight the Neo Arcadian army, defeat the evil Dr. Weil and help the caravan of humans reach the peace and security of Area Zero.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 39508, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cGjp7zdlkUc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGjp7zdlkUc", "title": "Mega Man Zero 4 Game Boy Trailer - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cGjp7zdlkUc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39509, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "AisbZKrnNcI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AisbZKrnNcI", "title": "Megaman Zero 4 - Trailer E3 2005 - GBA", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AisbZKrnNcI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
