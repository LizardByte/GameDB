Seven very different factions vie for control over the cataclysmic aftermath left behind by Andor Drakon\u2019s defeat.

Choose your allegiance carefully, for you are nothing more than an expendable asset to the masters you choose.\n\nFight for a mercenary's glory and purse, for the justice of a folk in decline, for the light of purity or even for ChAoS itself. Every choice you make will determine how you approach the ever-changing Caverns of Chaos before you.", "summary": "Create your own character or journey into the ever changing depths of the Caverns of Chaos as a legendary hero.
