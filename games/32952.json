Your crew has discovered a dead body, your brand new ship's been impounded by the cops, and most people you run into seem very unhappy with you... probably something to do with that missing cargo of gold bars.\n\nSo... will you take on a couple shady delivery jobs in order to afford a better ship, or will you downsize to a cheap jetsuit and go shooting space-junk for quick money? Will you perhaps decide to focus on finding that missing gold shipment before the local gangs and salvage teams get there first?\n\nMeanwhile, there's that damn mechanic who sold you a stolen ship, and a mysterious 'Taoist' group everyone keeps talking about. Oh, yes, you have most definitely found yourself inextricably caught up in a plot of intergalactic intrigue...", "summary": "Blast off and explore this unique and exciting Space Adventure!\nOpen World Space exploration, boarding stations and derelicts, talking to people and trading on stations, tons of missions and an exciting plot are what await you in this genre-twisting Experience!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3030-deathwar-redux", "videos": [{"id": 18783, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BYJVZgdwZ4A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYJVZgdwZ4A", "title": "3030 Deathwar Redux - 1.0 Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BYJVZgdwZ4A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 85867, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "c3DQZhWSeRU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3DQZhWSeRU", "title": "3030 Deathwar Redux - A Space Odyssey - New Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c3DQZhWSeRU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
