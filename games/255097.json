Throughout the story, players witness the string of events that finds Jack adopting Carol and how they grow into a family unit before the collapse of civilized society. Influenced by Stephen King\u2019s The Stand and numerous zombie movies and books, Now & Then is a tale of survivors learning to cope with life as it comes to them.\n\nWhile the present is filled with tense moments as the Brooks family struggles with the challenges of the new normal, memories of the past provide a slice-of-life window as Jack tries to learn how to be a new father to a teenage girl.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/now-and-then-a-tale-of-the-end--1"}
