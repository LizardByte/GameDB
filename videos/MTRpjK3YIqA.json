A cross between Second Life, Minecraft, World of Warcraft and Decentraland would probably be how I'd describe this game and world within.\n\nWith a heavy emphasis on owning land and building, creating etc, each plot of land (10,000 in all) is a unique NFT (non-fungible token) that can be bought and sold. The world will start as a blank canvas - except for pre-existing landmarks.Landowners will be given a set of levelled tools and assets to allow them to design and build on their plot. Each player gets an avatar with a fully editable look and avatars will be able to chat via text and audio chat in world. The game will be playable by people without land too - though of course having your own owned land is preferable.\n\nVulcanites are mythical beasts - also NFTs, that can be obtained to use in VulcanVerse. They have their own stats and are levelled in the same way that your plot is levelled. Upgrade your plot level and if you have higher level Vulcanites, they can come into play. Vulcanites can battle, forage (finding all sorts of useful items), spy (obtaining unique items such as building blueprints) and defend your plot - for example stopping other Vulcanites from spying. Importantly, like land, once a person has the Vulcanite NFT, it is theirs for life or as long as they want to keep it. \n\nVulcanVerse is split into four quadrants - each unique. The Mountains of Boreas is frozen tundra with alpine like assets to match. The Gardens of Arcadia is grassland and forest, again with assets to match. The Desert of Notus is all sand, sandstone and dunes and finally, the Underworld of Hades is blood rain, dead trees, swamps and mausoleums. In the middle, anchoring all quadrants, is Vulcan City. This could be classed as the administrative centre of the VulcanVerse. Each quadrant is represented within Vulcan City.\n\nAt present, the game is in its early alpha testing stage - where bugs and glitches can be found and removed. Even so, it looks very promising and, as part of the VulcanForged ecosystem of games and dApps, is going to be very popular in future.\n\nThe game is based on the VeChain blockchain - follow @VulcanVerse on Twitter all the latest news and information.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTRpjK3YIqA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTRpjK3YIqA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTRpjK3YIqA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTRpjK3YIqA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTRpjK3YIqA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "VulcanVerse - a first look at the alpha test of the blockchain game", "description": "I've been lucky enough to have early access to VulcanForged's VulcanVerse, a new blockchain based game.
