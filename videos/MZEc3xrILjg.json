{"id": "MZEc3xrILjg", "snippet": {"title": "Sega Golden Gun Arcade", "description": "Like the House of the Dead games, Sega Golden Gun is a rail shooter in which players blast enemies while the camera travels a predefined path. Pistols are the primary weapons; they hold 12 bullets, and pointing the gun outside the screen will reload them. However, if the player continues shooting with no bullets remaining, the gun will automatically reload. Consequently, this reloading takes longer. Blue and red reticles appear wherever players 1 and 2 aim, respectively. Most levels end with a boss fight.\n\nIn each stage, an item merchant will appear twice in the background; shooting him activates the Item Shop. Here, players can spent the points they've accumulated on special items, including different weapons, enemy weakeners, and bonus lives. Item prices increase during multiplayer and for each stage the player advances. If the player runs out of lives and continues, they will get items as a bonus.\n\nSimilar to House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn, the game is comprised of a prologue chapter, three middle chapters -- BaiJiaFang (\u767e\u5bb6\u574a), JiuQuYuan (\u4e5d\u66f2\u56ed), and ShiLiTan (\u5341\u91cc\u6ee9) -- that can be selected in any order, and a final chapter once all have been completed. Unlike Scarlet Dawn, the route is set once players decide on the second chapter, and there are no branching paths.\n\n\nTwo unnamed college students are touring China for a trip. While inside a museum, the two are suddenly attacked by mythical creatures and zombies. However, a security guard from the museum gives the two Golden Guns and explains how to use them. With the guns in hand, the two students use them to fight back against the monsters as well as trying to figure out the source of where they're coming from.\n\nThroughout the game, the students travel to different parts of China each overrun with creatures and a boss at each end. Each boss is a reincarnated form of a mythical figure from Chinese history. They fight Zhang Jiao, a sorcerer from the Han Dynasty who takes on the form of a giant turtle in the town of BaiJaiFang, Gao Qiu, an advisor from the Qin Dynasty who battles with a dragon in the JiuQuYuan palace, and Da Ji, a concubine from the Shang Dynasty in possession of a tiger spirit in the ShiLiTan city. Occasionally, the students battle a hooded figure who requests to test their strength in every location; he is later revealed to be the Monkey King who wants to see if the students can defeat the final boss, who returned to life once again after being possessed by a phoenix.\n\nOnce the final boss has been defeated, the Monkey King begins the task of repairing the city while the students decide to go to the arcade and play House of the Dead.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\r\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InsertCoinArcad", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZEc3xrILjg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZEc3xrILjg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZEc3xrILjg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZEc3xrILjg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZEc3xrILjg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sega Golden Gun Arcade", "description": "Like the House of the Dead games, Sega Golden Gun is a rail shooter in which players blast enemies while the camera travels a predefined path.
