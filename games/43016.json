Gone are the limits of power restrictions, limited classes, and qualifying rounds. Players simply choose their vehicle from a massive range \u2013 including dirt bikes, ATVs, sand rails, rally cars, monster trucks, and everything in between \u2013 then hit the track in a no-holds-barred sprint to the finish line. Carving a swathe of destruction through the ever-changing wilderness, players must compete in a gasoline-fuelled, horsepower spectacle where the only rule is to try and stay alive.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/motorstorm-complete"}
