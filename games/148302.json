It's time to look for something to eat and that's when the bear sees the bees pass by with the recently harvested sweet nectar. The bear follows the bees by instinct into the forest because it knows that there will be more honey stored somewhere. They go deeper and deeper until the bees stop at a giant tree upon which the nest is built. The bear shows itself and immediately strikes the trees to make the nest falls but the bees won't let that happens and swarm out to defend their nest. Could the bear win this fight and claim its prize or it would lose to the force of bees?", "summary": "Webcam motion control, action-packed and fighting game. Take on the challenge and fight against the bees to finally get your hands on the delicious honey hidden away in the forest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chubby-bear-smash"}
