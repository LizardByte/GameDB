{"id": "jZA5oe3wtpw", "snippet": {"title": "DeMagnete VR: Teaser Trailer", "description": "DeMagnete VR is a puzzle adventure inspired by magnetism, built from the ground up for virtual reality. Use your magnetic-powered gloves to solve puzzles and make your way to the top of a mysterious underground cavern. DeMagnete VR presents a variety of original magnetism mechanics that evolve with every chamber, as you find out more about what's happening around you.\n\nIn DeMagnete, each hand controls one magnetic pole, Positive and Negative. You use your hands to interact with objects in the environment, following basic rules of physics and magnetism: opposites attract, but likes repel. There are a variety of magnetic objects, like boxes, barriers, propulsors, etc. Each puzzle is built combining these objects and real physics rules to create new mechanics.\n\nOur goal with DeMagnete is to create an experience that not only immerses the player and makes use of the best that motion controls in VR have to offer, but also gives the player the sense of mechanical progression that gamers expect. DeMagnete VR is experimentation of magnetism and physics-based mechanics that evolve and deepen over 40+ puzzles.\n\nThe story of DeMagnete unfolds as you interact with the environment and your companion, Q. Voiced by the award-winning actress Ashly Burch, Q is the mysterious keymaster which controls the whole place and guides you through its chambers. Uncover the secrets hidden in the rock walls while Q leads you deep into the cavern.\n\nDeMagnete will come out for major VR platforms later in 2019! \n\nSteam page - https://store.steampowered.com/app/995270/DeMagnete_VR/\n\nFollow BitCake!\nhttps://Twitter.com/BitCakeStudio\nhttps://Discord.gg/BitCake\nhttps://Facebook.com/bitcakestudio", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jZA5oe3wtpw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jZA5oe3wtpw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jZA5oe3wtpw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jZA5oe3wtpw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jZA5oe3wtpw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DeMagnete VR: Teaser Trailer", "description": "DeMagnete VR is a puzzle adventure inspired by magnetism, built from the ground up for virtual reality.
