Spartan X, Challenger, Urban Champion, Astro Boy, and Dragon Buster are just a few references in the game. I'm not sure how I acquired this game because the developer apparently doesn't want anyone to have it or distribute it right now as it is currently being \"re-published\" with new characters and a new interface. My build is of an older version of the game that is no longer available (not that I know of anyway). The game was updated very recently though (in this month) so it may be close to being redistributed.\r\n\r\nThe game is made in Fighter Maker 95 and to be honest, it's funny but not really that good right now because it's very unbalanced. Each character has a somewhat unusual moveset that is partially based on their game of origin. For example, one of the boss characters (an eggplant from Ice Climber) has a ladder that it can climb and it also serves as an obstacle. When it is defeated once, it revives with another full life bar and fights while being carried by that bird that sits at the top of those Ice Climber stages and is hard to hit for most characters. He has a spring for characters that are not good aerial fighters, but it's extremely difficult to fight the boss with it. One interesting thing is certain death animations that characters have. For instance, if you defeat the Urban Champion, he falls in a hole like he did in UC. If you defeat the spelunker, it plays his death ditty instead of the regular victory music. \r\n\r\nGiven the circumstances, I can't provide the game for download, but the developer's webpage (for this game) is at:\r\n\r\nhttp://umigami.sakura.ne.jp/fc_hinshi/hinshi.html\r\n\r\nTheir main page is at:\r\n\r\nhttp://umigami.sakura.ne.jp/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7msFkuO0d0o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7msFkuO0d0o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7msFkuO0d0o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7msFkuO0d0o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7msFkuO0d0o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Famicom Hinshi Tai [\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u7015\u6b7b\u968a] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "This is a very strange game that stars characters from various NES (or Famicom) games.
