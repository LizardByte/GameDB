COULD exist.\nNow, with 500+ horsepower supercars and realistic physics, you can tackle those tracks that only exist in our imagination, but COULD be built in reality if we ever dared...\nAnd, with in iPhone 6+ and a cheap Google Cardboard headset, you can do the whole thing in 3-D VR... which is really quite amazing. The world looks HUGE in there!"}
