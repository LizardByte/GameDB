Players control Sir Graham, a knight of Daventry, who is tasked by King Edward to find three lost treasures to save the kingdom. The game takes place in a fairy tale-inspired world where Graham must explore, solve puzzles, and interact with various characters and creatures. Players navigate Graham through different locations, collecting items and using them to overcome obstacles. The game pioneered the graphic adventure genre, combining text commands with visual elements. As the inaugural title in the series, Quest for the Crown established many of the themes and gameplay elements that would become hallmarks of the King's Quest franchise, including its fantasy setting, puzzle-solving mechanics, and the character of Graham who would become a central figure in the series' lore.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-s-quest-quest-for-the-crown", "videos": [{"id": 118676, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gu9plquyhiQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu9plquyhiQ", "title": "Amiga 500 Longplay [020] King's Quest: Quest For The Crown", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gu9plquyhiQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
