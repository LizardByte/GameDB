A month passes without word from the King, so Zelda sends Link to find him. Unfortunately, he too goes missing, so Zelda ventures off to Gamelon to find both Link and the King, accompanied by her elderly nursemaid Impa.\n\nDuring Zelda's time in Gamelon, Impa discovers that King Harkinian has been captured, and that Link has engaged in a battle, the outcome of which is unclear. As she adventures across the island, Zelda defeats many of Ganon's minions and frees a woman named Lady Alma, who gives Zelda a canteen that she claims Link gave her in exchange for a kiss. On reaching Duke Onkled's palace, it is revealed that the Duke has betrayed the King and is working for Ganon. Zelda storms the palace, kills Ganon's henchmen, and saves a prisoner named Lord Kiro (sometimes known as Fari) who used to work for King Harkinian. Kiro reveals the secret entrance to Onkled's chamber, and when they confront him he reveals the entrance to Reesong Palace, where Ganon has taken residence.\n\nZelda travels to the Shrine of Gamelon to obtain the Wand needed to defeat Ganon, then makes her way to Reesong Palace where she fights him. After incapacitating Ganon with the Wand, she rescues her father. Back at Hyrule Castle, Duke Onkled is turned over to the king, begging for mercy. He is arrested and the King orders him to scrub all the floors in Hyrule as punishment. Although Link's whereabouts are still unknown, a comment by Lady Alma prompts Zelda to throw her mirror against the wall, and as it smashes, Link magically materializes, seemingly having been trapped in the mirror. They begin laughing, as all is well once again.", "summary": "When King Harkinian vanishes on a mission to save Gamelon, Link takes off to rescue him.
