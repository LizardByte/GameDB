The Kranks make it clear that they have no intention to spare anyone in their plan of world domination \u2013 especially not you!\n\nEarth\u2019s last hope is the Kore suit, invented by the ingenious (if slightly demented) scientist Dr. Samuelsen. Unfortunately, Samuelson has been lured into the ship and captured by the evil Kranks. Not to unfortunately, the Kranks are as stupid as they are ugly, and have forgotten to install the doomsday device in their ship when they took off to conquer the surface. This buys our heroes Pixie, Madboy and Rex some time to enter the Krank Tank, get hold of the Kore Suit and try to stop the devious Kranks. But time is ticking down, and many dangers lurk inside the ship.", "summary": "The Kore Gang is an action-adventure game where you take control of three different characters stuck inside robotic suits that amplify their individual abilities. The game-play is centered on the player's ability to switch between the three characters at any time and thus utilize and combine their abilities to solve puzzles.
