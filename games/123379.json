We know we do, but for the majority of animal lovers, a pet is the closest we can get. Some of us are not even that fortunate. That's where games such as My Pet Hotel come in: a variety of virtual pets at your mercy for as long as your DS can stand! You can look after dogs, cats, ponies, horses, rabbits, turtles and budgerigars. Feed them, clean their pens, play with them, teach them some tricks, ride out on horseback through the countryside and so much more. At the end of the game, you could be voted the best Pet Hotel in the world, if you find you can rise to the challenge.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pawly-pets-my-pet-hotel", "videos": [{"id": 145208, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "hwZJP3PPUbg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZJP3PPUbg", "title": "Pawly Pets : My Pet Hotel", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hwZJP3PPUbg/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4210, "name": "Pawly Pets"}]}
