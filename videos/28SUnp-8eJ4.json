Really tough start for UV-Speed; at first I tried to just run past the monsters and to get a shotgun from one of the sergeants, but that's really difficult, although this way it's not much easier. Really easy to die in the beginning since it's really hard to run past all the monsters with as much health as I do in this demo. First exit, and I hadn't any demo close to this one (in fact, when I got to the exit room and saw a cacodemon in it, it was a complete surprise to me, since I had never gotten to the exit on this map with monsters).\n\nCaptured using GL-Boom 2.5.1.4", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28SUnp-8eJ4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28SUnp-8eJ4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28SUnp-8eJ4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28SUnp-8eJ4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28SUnp-8eJ4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Doom 2 - 3 Heures d'agonie Map 01 UV-Speed in 0:50", "description": "Original text file below\n\n         3 Heures d'agonie\n       Map 01: Upsilon-Synth\n----------------------------------\n          3h01-050\n\nUV-Speed in 0:50.\n\nRecorded with: GLBoom-plus 2.5.1.4\n-complevel 2\n\n\nSkill level: Ultraviolence\nAuthor: 4shockblast\n\nComments: Demo came by a complete surprise.
