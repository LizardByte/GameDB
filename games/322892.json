I had surgery with a general anaesthetic for the first time in my life just before Christmas. This game is my response.\n\nI tried to follow the rules for a flatgame as closely as possible \u2013 to make me work differently. The most striking thing for me is how directly personal it turned out. I had a vague idea of what the game might be about. The graphics were abstract scribbles done in half an hour. The game was put together in about three hours. I'm aware I haven't done anything interesting with space in the game but the focus was very much on the story.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/procedure"}
