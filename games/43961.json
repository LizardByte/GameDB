After passing the exam and obtaining a license, players can accept various tasks which will reward them with money and Worker points.\n\nThe worker points serve both as the game's reputation system and are an integral part of the game's license system. They determine who would accept to be a part of the player's party, as well as allow players to get new licenses, which works in a similar way to Final Fantasy's job system. Equipping different licenses will unlock different spells for players to use in battle. The more worker points players get, the more likely it is that additional characters can be hired.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nige-ron-pa"}
