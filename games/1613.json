To accomplish this task, Shunjinko traverses all the realms, from his native Earth Realm to the hellish Netherealm, while tutored by the grand masters of Mortal Kombat. However, once Shujinko accomplishes his task, he discovers that he has been a pawn in a plot to restore the evil Dragon King, Onaga, from the dead. With Onaga restored to full strength, the champions of Mortal Kombat must stop him from altering the very fabric of existence.", "summary": "Mortal Kombat: Deception is the sixth installment in the Mortal Kombat franchise.
