The enemy placement is also different in both versions and weapons such as knives and incendiary bombs do less damage in Return of Double Dragon. Enemies can duck end combo blows, thus preventing the player from finishing their combos. The final Mission also features two additional levels before the final battle. An Option Mode is included in Return of Double Dragon as well, allowing players to adjust the game's difficulty level, as well as listen to the game's music and sound effects.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/return-of-double-dragon"}
