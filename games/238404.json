Now with new and improved controls! Cosmic Pool is 3D space pool with a twist: it takes place in zero gravity inside of a force-field bounded geometry. Games can be played inside of a cube, a pyramid or a sphere, each shape having its own unique characteristics. The rules of Cosmic Pool are similar to 8 ball pool: all of the balls of one type (striped or solid) are \u201cpocketed\u201d by knocking them through goals on the sides and/or corners of the geometry. Then the player must pocket the 8 ball to win the game. The controls allow you to take single, bank or combination shots and you can play against a computer or a human opponent.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cosmic-pool"}
