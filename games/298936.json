Learn to fly various drones risk-free!\nWe are continuously working to bring you the most realistic experience in both physics and visuals. Next to using the most advanced game development techniques, we are also developing custom tools to provide the most unique and original experiences.\n\nThe simulator is based on existing drones and parts, including their measured parameters with the support of the manufacturers. We intend to grow by continuously adding more models. The Physics engine of RDS is based on real-life physics formulas, and the software includes a flight behavior pre-calculator simulation system to determine the flight characteristics of even custom-built drones.\n\nThe available game modes are the Free Flight, Time Trial, Racing at the moment, and soon other modes will be added like Cinematography, Aerial Filming, Freestyle, Arcade, Strategical Missions, and more. There is a built-in Custom Map Editor as well, and the created maps can be hosted in multiplayer events.", "summary": "RDS is a realistic drone simulator which is focusing on FPV drones at the moment including freestyle and racing.
