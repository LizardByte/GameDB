The rolling demos that would normally play if the game was left inactive while in the title screen have been removed and the Unfortunate Mishaps video is also missing. The many filters used for explosions and motion blur are also gone, rendering the game with sharper textures, but less remarkable explosions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-legend--5"}
