Or fulfill your dream of being the most popular person in your high school with a date book filled up for the next five years.\n\nIn Alter Ego, you create the character you want to be--your \"alter ego\"--and then live out your alter ego's life from birth through old age. So be a kid again, get back at those snobs from high school, do all those things Mom and Dad wouldn't let you do or go back and marry that long-lost love you let get away.\nWith Alter Ego, you play the game of life.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alter-ego"}
