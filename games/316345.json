It plans on combining light influence from RPGs with and Platformer inspiration, making it a larger scale game. It has cutscenes that tell of a narrative with a science fiction flavor, that I wrote. It also has two different styles of platforming, one with more emphasis on physics and momentum, the other on combat. If it is completed, it is likely to have five different zones, all with five levels in each of them, with most of them being platformer styled levels. It is meant to feature hub worlds with top down gameplay, NPCs you can talk to, and saving.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-freedom-frontiers"}
