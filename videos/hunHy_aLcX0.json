In this update, we have focused on making this piece of history both playable and enjoyable by old and new LISA fans alike! Among other things, bugs have been fixed and combat has been rebalanced. In addition, you can start right before the Arkantos mod begins so you can hop right into action!\n\nIn addition, Pain Mode contains important changes to the story as well as character development as a reward for choosing a more hardcore experience.\n\nAnyways, we hope you enjoy this mod!
