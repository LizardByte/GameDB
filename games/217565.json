Copy enemies\u2019 abilities and use their power to attack with a sword, wield a whip, and float with a parasol. You can also laser blast with the new Mecha Copy Ability that makes a series debut! The extra muscle will be handy in finding missing pieces for Magolor\u2019s ship, which crash landed on Planet Popstar. Float and fight along with friends on the same system, where each player can control another Kirby or one of Kirby\u2019s iconic friends like King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Waddle Dee.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 74622, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "zAQZY2UVcoQ"}]}
