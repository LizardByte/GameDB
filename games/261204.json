Some historians date Mah Jongg back to the time of Confucius -- over 25 centuries ago!\n\nIt's believed that sailors and fishermen played Mah Jongg as a diversion from the monotony of their long voyages. The game was originally played with cards, but eventually bone and bamboo tiles were substituted since these were less likely to be blown off the deck.\n\nMah Jongg -V-G-A- recreates the beauty and addictive pleasure of Mah Jongg, but uses modern data processing techniques and high-resolution graphics instead of bamboo tiles.\n\nIn an attempt to make this game as elegant and as enjoyable as possible, the author has used some of the most advanced features of today's state-of-the-art MS-DOS computers. Not all PC computers are able to run Mah Jongg -V-G-A-. But if yours can, prepare yourself for the meeting of the past and future!!!\"", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mah-jongg-v-g-a", "videos": [{"id": 95628, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iYAo2A8pkZ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAo2A8pkZ0", "title": "Mah Jongg VGA (Ron Balewski) (MS-DOS) [1991] [PC Longplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iYAo2A8pkZ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
