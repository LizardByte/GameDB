You've just been made Keeper of the Spirits. Your job: save souls and protect the innocent. Along the way, you will have to contend with currents of energy, seas of lava, and an endless stream of evil adversaries, as well as throbbing background music that may remind you of your rapidly beating heart. But the worst thing you'll have to deal with (or the best, depending on your state of dementia) is the tormented spirit of Pumpkinhead. He's very, VERY ugly, terrible, nasty \u2014 and did we mention ugly. And he is very willing to share his torment with you. To save the innocent people of Ferren Woods, you've got to deal with him.\n\nSo, dive in, grab your controls and sink into the Netherworld, a demon land filled with \u2014 SURPRISE \u2014 demons. Everyone and everything here is out to get you. Here, the true source of power resides in the beautiful blue Tantanik Crystals. You can harness their power with the proper tools, but they can also destroy you.\n\nNOW LISTEN UP. These next few clues could save your wretched life. First, know that there are Portals throughout the Netherworld. These Portals allow you to step momentarily into the World of the Living. Actually, you're stepping into the movie that this game is based on. It's a horror flick, so expect to be horrified. But don\u2019t freeze up. Pick things up, and check out the characters you'll see. Many objects from the World of the Living can be brought back through the Portals to be used in the Netherworld. But beware, some of those objects would be better left alone. They could get you in trouble. Big trouble. (Did we mention the very unfriendly Pumpkinhead fellow?)\n\nYou will be constantly under attack, which makes lifeforce and firepower drain through you like a sieve. You had better find the secret sources for recharging them. Fast. Also, your quest doesn't just involve one world of trouble. There are THREE worlds of trouble: The Periphery, Purgatory, and Pumpkinhead\u2019s Lair. All very different, all full of very bad things. You have to get through the first two before you meet Pumpkinhead. At which time you will probably die in seconds anyway. But maybe you're up to the challenge. Maybe.\n\nDon't forget, you are the one bright spot of hope for this decrepit place, you re the one defender of good in the Netherworld. Many innocent souls will be lost and doomed unless you rescue and protect them. You might even discover that nasty Mr. Pumpkinhead isn't totally nasty. To succeed, you'll need to understand the reasons for his rage, as well as figuring out what\u2019s wrong with everybody else. In short, figure out everything, save everyone and try to not get killed too quickly.", "summary": "The tormented spirit of Pumpkinhead has been let loose to seek vengeance among the living.
