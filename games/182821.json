Known as the grandfather of modern first-person shooters and groundbreaking in it's design, Wolfenstein 3D set a new, higher standard for action games.\n\nIn 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology, Inc. (AWT) first attempted to bring Wolfenstein to virtual reality. With the use of Polhemus tracker technology, they created an arcade-style head-mounted display version of Wolf3D aptly named \"Wolfenstein VR.\"\n\nNow, modern virtual reality tech allows us to step inside the castle once again in this tribute to one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nPresented here is the \"shareware release\" of Wolfenstein 3D as you've never experienced it before. Brave ten levels of labyrinth-like halls, killer dogs, secret passages, and an army of Nazi forces as you try to make your daring escape in Wolfenstein 3D VR!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wolfenstein-3d-vr"}
