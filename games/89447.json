Is yours the first of its kind in this world, or one of many? No man knows, but what all men know is that their Empire must not only survive, but flourish! The world is full of terrible horrors, however, and they will wear away at your Empire from all sides. Natural resources have become more scarce. And perhaps worst of all, your powerful Empire has grown heavy and full of internal strife with its age. How long can you stand the pressures of survival before your Empire finally comes crumbling back down into the desolated earth from which it grew? Empire: The Deck Building Strategy Game introduces the world's first \"Deck-Building 4X Strategy Game\". Empire is a quick, easy-to-learn yet difficult to master strategy/tactics game."}
