When she regained her consciousness, she didn't remember anything at all. Hiro and Chiria's life now begins...", "summary": "This raising simulation follows Xero, a great hero of Lairland, and the mysterious holy woman Chilia. Over four in-game years together, Xero helps Chilia to blossom into her own person while also recovering her lost memories. Like in Princess Maker, the player's job is to set out her schedule with tasks like studying to improve her statistics, working to earn money, or more. Players can also head into town to befriend other NPCs or buy items, and their schedule is broken up periodically by special events or other long-term goals.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lair-land-story"}
