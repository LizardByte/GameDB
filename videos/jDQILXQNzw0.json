Read more below.\n\nEven if you weren't a small child in the UK in the mid-1980s, you've been here before. Just you and your friendly toys. But this new friend... this is something you are not yet able to understand.\n\nBonbon is a first-person domestic horror narrative, made in Unreal Engine 4, in which you navigate childhood events beyond your capacity to understand, and without parental context.\n\nPlay time is around 20 to 40 minutes, depending on your play-style. Progression requires the completion of some simple tasks, but it is mostly about exploring the objects and events around you. Play with mouse and keyboard, or a 360-style gamepad.\n\nIf you would like a download key for reviewing, recording or streaming, get in touch @AethericGames.\n\nThe music in the Bonbon trailer above is Space Chase by Romariogrande\u200b, CC-0 licence.\n\nThe Steam version of Bonbon is published by Pixeljam games.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDQILXQNzw0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDQILXQNzw0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDQILXQNzw0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDQILXQNzw0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDQILXQNzw0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bonbon Trailer", "description": "Bonbon is a short horror story, about your childhood.\nAvailable on itcho.io and coming to Steam October 2017!
