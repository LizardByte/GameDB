You've got simple, responsive (and remappable!) inputs, fluid and versatile movement options and extremely fast combat to allow you to jump around and beat down however the heck you want.\n\nIt takes a ton of inspirations from all the games and characters I enjoyed growing up, so you might notice some of that here!\n\nThe goal is for the game itself to be so fun that you'd be willing to open it up just to screw around in the hub world.\n\nYou're put into the shoes of Neon, a special android with access to Resonance: an ability to rapidly scale in power.

Neon is incredibly fast and powerful, but can only maintain that extreme potential when they're avoiding damage and continuously dishing it out.\n\nLike Celeste? You can use its dash twice! Go nuts. Avoid everything. Counterattack through your enemies. Heck, wavedash jump cancel\u2122 if you want.\n\nLike Smash Bros? Well we've got platform-fighter style combat here, so knock your foes around and KO them with that satisfying offscreen explosion!\n\nCombat lets you cancel virtually everything into everything else! Make your own combos! Hit, stun and run! Start up that combo with a dash! Unleash a barrage of punches like it's an anime reference! Teleport* behind the enemy and end them with a break attack!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 53680, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pD9hZ5Ev3t0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD9hZ5Ev3t0", "title": "Advent NEON  - Kickstarter Announcement Trailer (& New Demo!)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pD9hZ5Ev3t0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
