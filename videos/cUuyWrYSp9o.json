Billed as a \"rescue game,\" the title takes place in a Shanghai that's been overrun with demons called Kyonshis. You play as a demon-fighting special forces team member who must protect people from Kyonshi attack as you attempt to evacuate a building. Use swords, guns, and even barriers made of rice (no kidding!) to weaken the Kyonshis, then stab them with your lucky charm. The people you're trying to protect all have unique traits, some were slow, others being weak, and you'll have to study their data in order to properly guide them to safety. You can send commands to the people you're guiding, telling them when to stop and when to play dead (this latter act makes the Kyonshis stop their attack).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUuyWrYSp9o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUuyWrYSp9o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cUuyWrYSp9o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Simple 2000 Series Vol. 65: The Kyonshi Panic (PS2 Gameplay)", "description": "The Kyonshi Panic is a sci-fi action game set in the year 2050.
