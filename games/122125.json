In the game, you play as Kubi, who's friend were taken back in time by a evil 4-bit monster. It is your goal to save all of Kubi's friends. It is played from a top-down viewpoint. The interesting thing about Bit Boy!! is the ability to play in different generations (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, etc.) As you progress through the generations, more additions will be added to the gameplay, such as the ability to attack and jump. There are four game modes, \"Classic\", \"Warp\", \"Turbo Classic\", and \"Turbo Warp\". Classic is the standard game mode. Saving all of your friends and wiping out all the monsters is the main goal of this mode. The goal of Warp Mode is to collect as many Time Diamonds as possible, however, if you get hit by a enemy, you will be warped to the next level. Turbo Classic is the same as Classic mode, with the addition of super speed, huge amount of attacks, and unlimited lives. Turbo Warp is the same Warp, with the addition of super speed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bit-boy--1"}
