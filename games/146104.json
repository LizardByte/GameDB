The show's next season was held back to properly strategize the direction to take. TMNT 2003 had ultimately suffered from weak writing, making use of very involved plots but not comfortably telling the stories needed to be told, and as such the audience left. The decision was made to entirely skip the next season in favor of airing the semi-reboot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward, sending the brothers into the future and equiping themselves in cybernetic armor. Fast Forward had a distinctly different art style and the tone was much more lighthearted than before, though it failed to make any great impact on either ratings or merchandise due to the paper-thin premise. Only one game was produced to tie in with Fast Forward, Ninja Training NYC.\n\nNinja Training NYC is very much a standard action title for mobile phones, dumbing the concept down to make it suitable for a numberpad controller wihout any complicated controls. In this game, the TMNT must train in two specific categories, Combat and Agility.\n\nIn Combat, the turtle is situated center screen and must take out holographic men in suits wearing towels on their heads by pressing 4 or 6 repeatedly, or 2 in order to jump and attack. Certain enemies will drop special items which can be used to refill energy, and there is also a special meter that fills up; when full, it can be used to launch a shellshocker attack using the 5 key.\n\nIn Agility, the turtle of choice must run left or right to find the correct car which will fall down or find a hole to avoid getting killed off by the downward scrolling screen. The speed of the scrolling increases over time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-fast-forward-ninja-training-nyc", "videos": [{"id": 48312, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "l-u7GJJiv-8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-u7GJJiv-8", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Fast Forward  - Overloaded", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l-u7GJJiv-8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
