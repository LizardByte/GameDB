Within it he's found some of the most delicious little glowing alien bugs that he has ever tasted. Help Bob eat his fill of these \"out of this world\" treats. But take care to avoid the sweeping teleport beams and be careful not to let those bugs stay red for too long......\n\nBob and the alien fire flies is my very first game ever, for any platform anywhere. The inspiration for the game's main character came from a pancake I made once (it really did look like a hedgehog with tentacles). The game written entirely in bAtari BASIC features 3 different game over animations and two hedgehogs. Yes, that's right, you can play alone as Bob or play in two player mode with a friend and control both Bob and Hog as they battle to be the first to eat 20 fire flies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bob-and-the-alien-fire-flies", "videos": [{"id": 115006, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PsqSZoFsCxs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsqSZoFsCxs", "title": "Bob and the Alien Fire Flies", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PsqSZoFsCxs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 115007, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eekQ4ip6HjQ"}]}
