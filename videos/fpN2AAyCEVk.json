{"id": "fpN2AAyCEVk", "snippet": {"title": "Es Trial Beta Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "A game that was being made by 9thNight (Arthearts), the folks who brought you Nekonabe and Blood-Over, Es had the potential to be better than either of those games in my book...not that the aforementioned games are bad doujin games or anything. It was being worked on for quite some time (this beta is dated for 2007). The only thing I can think of is that it might have been too ambitious for the doujin circle at the time.\n\nThis video is quite good for my fifth attempt of the first stage and my fourth attempt at the second, though I'm not quite sure how the ranking or scoring system works. I recorded this video at 60FPS, but there was an odd playback issue that happened when I killed the first stage boss...and ONLY when I killed it...so it was a very specific and weird problem that I couldn't edit out. As a result, I had to stick with a 30FPS recording. As you can see, I didn't get hit AT all on the first stage and chained throughout the entire level and I got an A rank, so I'm assuming that you get a better rank for melee-ing enemies (which I did to the boss on stage two at the expense of some life) and it's easier to get S on Hard difficulty (more chaining potential).\n\nYou can buy stuff like a double jump and homing missiles and you can hit enemies in the air to juggle them. You start with a dash, air dash, proton bomb, shotgun (for rapid fire), lock-on lasers, and an \"Energy Shower\", which rains powerful lasers on everything in sight.  I chose to be pretty careful in this video, though I could've S ranked the first level if I just hit the boss with some melee attacks to finish it off. The game has lots of action and it seems like a hybrid of GunValkyrie, Panzer Dragoon (with the whole \"berzerk mode\" laser shower), and other fine action games. I just hope that videos like this and others will convince 9thNight to finish this game (if they aren't working on it).
