Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level.\n\nThe mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/roc-n-rope", "videos": [{"id": 109385, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mWyVRPchwrk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWyVRPchwrk", "title": "Arcade Longplay [779] Roc' N Rope", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mWyVRPchwrk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
