Each has three \"major gods\" to choose from before each game \u2013 Zeus, Hades and Poseidon for the Greeks; Ra, Isis and Set for the Egyptians, and Odin, Thor and Loki for the Norse. Additionally, each has \"minor gods\" to select from every time the player advances an age, with all deities granting the player unique technologies, perks, myth units and God powers that are used to damage or benefit players. There are three types of base unit \u2013 humans, heroes and myth units, the latter two being mythical figures or creatures from the historical civilization's mythology and legends. A rock-paper-scissors model governs which units are best suited against others; for example, humans are good against heroes but weak against myth units. Every unit also has a sub-category such as heavy infantry or archers, again with each being better suited against certain others. Human units include hoplites or chariot archers, heroes include Odysseus and Ramesses, and myth units include Cyclopes and giants.\n\nThe Campaign is divided into 8 scenarios for all three civilizations, set into separate campaigns, the first one, the Egyptian one focuses of Hatshepsut and her father Thutmose defeating Set's son Setekh, after investigating bandit raids near Memphis.", "summary": "Inspired by the hit PC title and built on the game engine behind the critically acclaimed Age of Empires: Age of Kings, Age of Empires: Mythologies will be the ultimate portable tactical strategy game with its refined gameplay, inspired design, fantastic multiplayer, and extensive replay value.\n\nAge of Empires: Mythologies for the Nintendo DS is a compelling new turn-based strategy game that challenges players to shape the destiny of three unique cultures in a fantasy world filled with mighty heroes, legendary monsters, and powerful gods. Players will lead their Egyptian, Greek, and Norse heroes to victory by raising massive armies, waging war, exploring new frontiers, and advancing through three distinct ages that offer fantastic new units, abilities, and god powers like lighting storms, earthquakes, and devastating plagues that players can call on to smite their enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/age-of-empires-mythologies", "videos": [{"id": 13137, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "RXSKFy3d2OQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXSKFy3d2OQ", "title": "Age of Empires: Mythologies Nintendo DS Gameplay - Hot", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RXSKFy3d2OQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
