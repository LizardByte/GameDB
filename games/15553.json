Additionally, she realizes that some of her research files have been stolen and needs to destroy the rest of them before anyone else can get to them. Once arriving at a section of the medical facility, she discovers that it has been destroyed and vandalized with graffiti. Whilst being hunted by the Xenomorph, Lingard sees Ransome in an upper section of the medical facility where all her research was kept. Lingard initiates an emergency hazard cleanse in the sector, with the area exploding and Ransome fleeing the scene. Lingard also collects some remaining medical supplies and later leaves. \n \nLingard, in hopes of avoiding any conflict with the Xenomorph or any other threat on the station, attempts to take a different route within a ventilation shaft. Unfortunately, the shaft is invested with Facehuggers and Lingard uses a newfound flamethrower to combat them. When taking a different course, Lingard stumbles across a small hive which she quickly leaves after picking up an engineer's report. Once leaving the vent, she sees that her exit is covered in noxious gas, with two Working Joes wandering the area as well. After grabbing a gas mask off of a corpse, Lingard manages to vent out the gas and take her leave in an elevator, returning her to the camp. \n \nOnce arriving at the camp, it is revealed that a horde of androids have infiltrated the camp and slaughtered its inhabitants, making Lingard the sole survivor. After a series of grave encounters, Lingard manages to access the emergency lockdown and flee in an elevator. \n \nHer fate afterwards is unknown.", "summary": "Welcome to Trauma, the second add-on content pack for Alien: Isolation.
