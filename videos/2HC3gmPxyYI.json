PS2 gameplay ( Phoenix Games ) 720p (Single Race)", "description": "Here is a single race video showing the first course in Offroad Extreme on the Sony Playstation 2. If your familiar with the company Phoenix Games then you wont be suprised to find out this game uses the same engine as most of there other racing sims. This, however seems to be more playable than the likes of Monster Trux Extreme or Moto X Maniac. If you check out my other videos youl see a full Bronze cup play through, which i actually enjoyed playing. This is one ill definately be looking forward to completing. Dont get me wrong, its by no means up there with games like colin mcrae, or need for speed, but this definately has some playability to it, and i think it will keep me entertained for a short while! \nPlease subscribe and leave a comment :) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\n\nRecorded by SHLIMPOLE\noff-road extreme PS2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2HC3gmPxyYI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2HC3gmPxyYI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2HC3gmPxyYI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2HC3gmPxyYI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Offroad Extreme!
