Use your wits and acquire magical abilities to regain your home!\n\nTravel from world to world to discover ancient magicks sealed within runes: harnessing runic magic grants Ashyr various abilities, from seeing the memories of the past unfold before his very eyes, to moving objects without even touching them. Ashyr wields no weapons or armour, but overcomes obstacles with his magic flute. His adventure sees Ashyr sail the endless seas, discover the secrets of a shattered world, delve in the misty realm of the dead, and seek out the gods themselves.\n\nDiscover secrets, collect lore scrolls and arcane remnants, and solve varied, unique puzzles in the divine realms of Heim!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heim", "videos": [{"id": 34699, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jcq4mSqcuNI"}]}
