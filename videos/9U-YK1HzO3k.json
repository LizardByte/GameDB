I was gutted because I thought I just wasted 4 hours but after a lot of messing I realised I could get the game going again if I held the ALT key. So I put the keyboard on the floor and held it down with my big toe. Unfortunately I couldn't fix the awful sound bug which loops the last few sound effects very loudly.\n\nPlayed on PC\nFirst playthrough\nNo Cheats", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9U-YK1HzO3k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9U-YK1HzO3k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9U-YK1HzO3k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9U-YK1HzO3k/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9U-YK1HzO3k/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Haunted Castle 2 - Castlevania PC playthrough.
