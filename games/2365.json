In later games, recall your toughest warriors and form a deadly host whom none can stand against! Choose units from a large pool of specialists, and hand-pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on different terrains against all manner of opposition.\nWesnoth has many different sagas waiting to be played. Fight to regain the throne of Wesnoth, of which you are the legitimate heir... step into the boots of a young officer sent to guard a not-so-sleepy frontier outpost... lead a brutal quest to unite the orcish tribes... vanquish a horde of undead warriors unleashed by a foul necromancer, who also happens to have taken your brother hostage... guide a band of elvish survivors in an epic quest to find a new home... get revenge on the orcs by using the foul art of necromancy...\nThere are at least two hundred unit types, sixteen races, six major factions, and hundreds of years of history. The world of Wesnoth is absolutely huge and only limited by your creativity \u2014 make your own custom units, create your own maps, and write your own scenarios or even full-blown campaigns. You can also challenge up to eight friends\u2014or strangers\u2014and fight in epic multiplayer fantasy battles.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-for-wesnoth", "videos": [{"id": 1374, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "w3P39lppcH4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3P39lppcH4", "title": "The Battle for Wesnoth - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w3P39lppcH4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
