{"id": "F6lSCQLgWqM", "snippet": {"title": "Fade to Black (PC DOS)", "description": "Sequel to Flashback. Played using supported 640x400 resolution and GUS for audio. This video shows about 1/3 of the game. I did this recording over a year ago, but didn't bother to upload to YT before. It's very unlikely I'll continue this so decided to upload it now.\n\nEngine is badly outdated. Conrad gets stuck easily to corners and maneuvering overall is difficult. It takes some time for the character to stop when running, reminiscent of original Flashback mechanics that suck heavily in a 3D environment. Often this results in running into instant death or screwing up a puzzle. Automatic camera angle switching / zooming can become a pain at times. Waiting times in some areas are also something to be pissed about. Most annoying puzzles appear later and are not included in this video, that's where I finally lost motivation to continue further. Just not that fun to play, especially when compared to Flashback.\n\nDeveloper: Delphine Software International\nPublisher: Electronic Arts, Inc.
