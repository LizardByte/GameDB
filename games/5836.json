Get equipment and trainers for your fighter to enhance his look and performance.\n\nThen take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.\n\nFight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for senseless button mashing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fight-night-round-3", "videos": [{"id": 119123, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "0YdW6iNv7QM"}], "collections": [{"id": 645, "name": "Fight Night"}]}
