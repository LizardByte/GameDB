In this day and age, the majority of the infrastructure essential to humanity's daily living has been optimized with AI. Kaito, who now had the power to do anything, issued his command:\n\n\u201cI want to meet a girl who loves me, Shimae Kaito! She has to have large, cute eyes, be kind, and will spoil me, oh, and have big boobs!\u201d\n\nHowever, the reply came back, \"No qualified persons found. Displaying results: 0 out of 0.\"\n\nKaito was dejected when his search got no hits, but the AI activated a late-night robot factory and built a robot according to his specifications.\n\nSome days later, a girl who looked exactly as he described showed up at his door - Tsukuyomi. She had superhuman physical abilities and loved Kaito immensely. However, being an AI, she lacked all common sense. Having determined that she still fell short of being his ideal, she decided that she had to express her \"love\" for him in the most perfect way possible.\n\n-You, who are like a God-\n\nWhat future waits for Kaito and his ideal (albeit robot) girl?", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
