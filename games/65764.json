Unlike the modern visual novel format of the original game, this retro game perfectly mimics the style of graphical text adventure games from the 8-bit PC era (e.g. PC-88), with the player typing short commands to interact with and explore the game world. It features all backgrounds and characters drawn in a low-color pixelated style with emulated scanlines, chiptune music played through an emulated FM chip, and no voice acting. Although non-canon, the game contains many easter eggs and references that connect Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate together.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/steins-gate-8-bit"}
