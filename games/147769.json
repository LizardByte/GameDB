This is the question that runs on our hero Walter\u2019s mind who is a jobless ex-veteran and suffers from PTSD. On the top all, Cthulhu is rising again from his eternal sleep from the deepest shadows of Earth to bring the apocalypse. With Cthulu\u2019s effect, his unstable conditions created a delusional world. Nothing will be the same anymore, especially from Walter\u2019s eyes. Everyone became monsters born from a mind inspired from HP Lovecraft\u2019s books. And Cthulhu calls you! Cthulhu wants you! Go through him! To answer the call of Cthulhu, walk on streets of the city and defend yourself against monsters which await hunting you down. How can a man keep his sanity straight in this delusional world? Let\u2019s take the ticket of an adventure full of madness and discover the delusional world of Walter born from Cthulhu\u2019s awakening. And think that those monsters are real or a mad man attacking people on the streets while living in his delusional hollow.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/awakening-of-cthulhu"}
