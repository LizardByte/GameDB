The player manages the hero's daily schedule, divided into two segments: school and home. Activities include studying, having conversations with students or teachers, taking part-time jobs, resting, talking on the phone, shopping, buying presents, etc. Each activity increases or decreases some of the hero's parameters. The overall level can be evaluated on a special screen, and the goal is to raise it by balancing the stats with various activities.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hatsukoi-monogatari", "videos": [{"id": 139432, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BBTHiipHGRM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBTHiipHGRM", "title": "[965]\u3000PC98\u7248\u300e\u521d\u604b\u7269\u8a9e\uff08Hatsukoi Monogatari\uff09\u300fOP\uff5eMOVIE", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BBTHiipHGRM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
