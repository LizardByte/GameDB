In this dream, he finds himself in a dark forest shrouded in impenetrable fog. He remembers being lost in this forest as a child and coming across a small town dominated by a mysterious little church.\n\nThe nightmare, however, becomes more and more sinister. Strange things happen as Michael tries to escape the forest and reach the church. Distorted figures lurk among the trees, eerie sounds echo through the darkness, and the line between reality and nightmare begins to blur.\n\nAs the game progresses, the player learns that the small town and church are haunted by a dark force associated with Halloween. The lines between the dream world and reality continue to blur, and Michael must face his deepest fears to uncover the secrets of Halloween night and free himself from the horrors that haunt him.", "summary": "Project Michael: The Halloween Nightmare is a Horror Adventure game which invites the players into an atmospheric adventure nightmare.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-michael-the-halloween-nightmare", "videos": [{"id": 100051, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HpBerZnWnlU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpBerZnWnlU", "title": "Project Michael: The Halloween Nightmare - Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HpBerZnWnlU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
