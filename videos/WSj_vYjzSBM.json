Spikey's chums have been locked up in the local castle's dungeon and it's up to Spikey to get them out.\n\nSimply wander around, pick up items and learn how to use them and solve the puzzles. Although you have limited inventory space, it's possible to leave items on the ground until you need them. Avoid the rats, bats and ghosts and pick up the steaming chickens to replenish your health.\n\nIt's interesting to note that you don't have to solve all the puzzles to win as there seems to be one more key/prisoner to rescue than is needed. In my video, I finish the game still holding the bottle of ale taken from the tavern, which can be used to get rid of one of the dungeon guards. I clearly remember when I played this on my real C64 that I solved the ale puzzle but didn't use the cannon ball on the cannon and still won; an oversight perhaps, or just the developers giving you choice?\n\nThis wasn't a particularly challenging game but it's nicely presented and has a decent tune playing throughout. It must be said that it looks like Spike has been mainlining some pretty hardcore substances judging by his eyes!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WSj_vYjzSBM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WSj_vYjzSBM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WSj_vYjzSBM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WSj_vYjzSBM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WSj_vYjzSBM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Spikey in Transylvania Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Genesis Developments and published by Codemasters in 1991.\n\nA strange but cool little arcade adventure game that looks like it was intended to be based on Haggar the Horrible.
