Drive faster than your competition, haul your cargo across the entire United States and feel the wind in your face as you control your own destiny. Blast the horn and build a career in the fast-paced world of trucking.\n\nKeep in mind that there's more to being a successful businessman than just driving fast. You've got to manage your money, keep your rig running smooth and watch out for speed traps that might trip you up. Bad weather? Fuel troubles? Tricky loading docks that require pinpoint precision? It's all part of life in the cab of a 18-wheeler. If you've got the guts, jump in a truck and head out for the highway.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/18-wheels-of-steel-across-america", "videos": [{"id": 11709, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "gTDRte5XDBw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTDRte5XDBw", "title": "18 Wheels of Steel - Across America Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gTDRte5XDBw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
