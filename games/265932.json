Across those thousands of years, he and his army have consistently attempted invasion but have failed due to the incredible diligence, bravery and courage of the Veredilian Resistance, lead by the almighty Caribou King, and thanks to a sacred artefact which keeps the Forest together and protected from the forces of evil. Many generations and thousands of years later into the present day, the dark overlord and his forces have this time located the sacred artefact and once again attempt invasion and fought to the death with the current Caribou King. As a failsafe to make sure this would never happen, he had shattered the artefact into multiple pieces, sacrificing his own life in the process. Now it's up to his two sons, Rein and Toronto the Caribou, as well as a young female Kitsune named Vancouver, to find the artefacts, defeat the dark overlord and his henchmen, and save Veredilia, the Sacred Forest, from eternal domination.", "summary": "Veredilia: The Sacred Forest is a 2D platforming game that takes inspiration from classic platformers such as Sonic, and fighting games like Mortal Kombat. The game aims to be a combination of classic 2D platforming with 1v1 fighting whilst also exploring the large forest of Veredilia across various locales with a wide range of characters, technical movesets, and flashy combos. You can take control of one of 3 characters, each with their own special moves, combos, and super moves. Solve puzzles, uncover secrets, and kick, punch, and slash your way to victory, before it's too late.
