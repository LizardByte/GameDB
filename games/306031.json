Each space contains a word, and a word appears in the middle of the screen. If the player has a rhyme to the displayed word, they need to type in the correct rhyme from their board, and that space is taken. If there is no rhyming match, the word should be passed on to their opponent for a chance to score. The first player to fill their board wins. The game allows for single-player versus computer or two-player games with three separate levels of difficulty.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moon-bingo"}
