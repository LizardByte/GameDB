Different doors are blocking the way, that need to be unlocked to proceed as fast as possible. Each door will give a different benefit, and a combination of them is the key to succeed .. or fail. \n \nTo open a door, a puzzle is presented, where pieces of a key have to be rotated and merged together to open the door. The further you run, the more difficult the key puzzles become. \n \nThere are three different modes: \n \n* Normal Mode: Score is increasing the more you survive. It decreases the more you stay idle in a room without picking a door. There's a set amount of rooms to complete before reaching the end. \n* Endless Mode: Score increases with each room that is completed. There is no end to the amount of rooms presented. \n* Random Mode: Each door has a specific score as a reward when opened. Rooms and their rewards spawn at random. \n \nThe available benefits from the doors are: \n \n* Green doors: Increase running speed. \n* Purple doors: Increase lock-picking skills, which makes opening new doors easier. \n* Blue doors: Gives extra chances before losing. \n* Brown doors provide no direct benefit, apart from helping complete more rooms.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-king-is-gone", "videos": [{"id": 43734, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-bB74ncv4kc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bB74ncv4kc", "title": "The king is gone - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-bB74ncv4kc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
