Gothic is the fourth game in the Elminage series. It is set in a world where Great gods clash with Dark gods for power through the faith of humans. You form a party of up to six characters, with sixteen classes available such as Hunter, Thief, Summoner and Valkyrie, and take them out into dungeons to fight monsters and gather loot. Most dungeons will have some quests you can do inside them. There are 400 types monsters to fight and lots of skills/spells to learn. Over 600 different types of items can be found. The game has a punishing difficulty. In some cases enemies can kill a character in one hit without being able to fight back. As such a grind-heavy approach is encouraged.\n\nThe PC conversion is identical to the original game, but has higher resolution art and an improved user interface. The original PSP game was also only available in Japanese.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elminage-gothic-ulm-zakir-to-yami-no-gishiki", "videos": [{"id": 24871, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wW1jzCJi4gs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW1jzCJi4gs", "title": "\u30a8\u30eb\u30df\u30ca\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5 \u30b4\u30b7\u30c3\u30af \uff5e\u30a6\u30eb\u30e0\u30b6\u30ad\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u95c7\u306e\u5100\u5f0f\uff5e", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wW1jzCJi4gs/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 24872, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "HDYiN6kTNOA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDYiN6kTNOA", "title": "\u30a8\u30eb\u30df\u30ca\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5 \u30b4\u30b7\u30c3\u30af \uff5e\u30a6\u30eb\u30e0\u30b6\u30ad\u30fc\u30eb\u3068\u95c7\u306e\u5100\u5f0f\uff5e \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HDYiN6kTNOA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
