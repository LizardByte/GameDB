Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called \"The Triangle\" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain \"Blackbeard\", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-command--1", "videos": [{"id": 139557, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JUNI-xfvsVU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUNI-xfvsVU", "title": "Star Command | Trailer [GOG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JUNI-xfvsVU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
