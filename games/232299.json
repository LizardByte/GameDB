The classic time killer and number match game with simple rules, enriched with many new features.\nMany of you know this Number Match logic riddle from school or university when you have played it with paper and pen. Now \"Number Match Game Numberama 2\" is also available for your smartphone. Matching brain games & logic puzzles for everyone.\n\nIn this numbers game you have to match and cross out numbers or digits on the playing field. Two numbers can be merged, if the numbers are the same, or add up to ten. For example you can combine numbers like 7 and 3, 9 and 1, or 6 and 6.\nThe two digits have to be side by side or on top of each other. The right side of the number board wraps around to the left side, so numbers on the right side are next to the numbers on the left, but one row down. The two numbers can have crossed-out number blocks between them.\nIf you cannot or do not want to merge numbers, and you do not want to use Boosts, you then press \"Check\". All the numbers remaining on the board are then copied after the existing numbers and the numbers game continues.\nNumber Match Game Numberama 2", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/numbers-game-2-number-match"}
