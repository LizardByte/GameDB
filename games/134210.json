The 6 x 6 playing field is divided into different regions and your task is to draw a path that covers only one square of each. Later levels introduce regions that have different mechanics to keep things interesting across 160 levels. Regions also features a dynamic soundtrack that responds to how you play. \n \nAlso included is a level editor that unlocks after the entirety of the game is completed (or when a secret code is entered). It isn't a fully polished product, but it's in the game for those who want to mess around with the same tools that were used to make the game. \n \nA color blind option is also available. \n \nUpdate: As of March 17th, 2020, this game is now free.", "videos": [{"id": 36444, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "C8KklLbxCv4"}]}
