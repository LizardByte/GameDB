Slydris 2's design brings more strategy and variety, and better balance to the Slydris formula.\nThe relentlessly addictive gameplay is enhanced further with fantastic visual effects and earth-shaking sounds. Slydris 2 also features 5 beautiful color schemes to unlock, and 5 mesmerizing music tracks that synchronize with the play field visuals.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slydris-2"}
