Condorra is foreign to Ryiu, and he has no recollection of the events that transpired.\n\nLuckily, there are allies to be found, allies that might have answers for about what happened. But some people stop at nothing to keep the truth hidden. What will it take for Ryiu to make his way back home?", "summary": "Frameland is a retro inspired RPG brought into the modern age.
