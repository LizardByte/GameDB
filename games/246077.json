Plenty of quality of life features will make sure you spend your time on the fun side of it instead of worrying about gruesome, tedious tasks.\nThe game features almost 500 battles, and all of them were designed with custom movesets and synergistic parties, making each trainer feel unique in it's own way within the world. You will not be stomping your way through battles here, you will simply be another trainer in the world, making your journey feel like an actual journey and not a slog.\nGym Leaders and Teams Aqua and Magma have been given extra attention and boss fights were added to complement the game.
