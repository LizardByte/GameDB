The C64 version is a little easier than the Apple II version. Unlike the Apple II version, RUN (push space key) has no merit because the turn is not quick.\n\nThe goal of the game is to explore a very complex and vast world in search of five gemstones, and then return to the entrance. After getting the 5th Gemstone, demons spawn and the game becomes harder. Return trip was very hard.\n\nIt's an extinct kind of game where you explore the world while drawing its map on graph paper. It was popular in North America. In Japan, the Gemstone Warrior was compared to Hydlide and Dragon Slayer, which are action role playing games. But, Gemstone Warrior doesn't level up with experience points, so for me Gauntlet, Aztec, and Doom are closer.\n\nThank you very much for Mr. ASchultz!\nThanks to his Guide and Walkthrough,  I could complete this game.\nhttps://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/appleii/566643-gemstone-warrior/faqs\n\nCorrespondence with ASchultz's map:\n9:50 Room 19.\n10:02 Room 21.\n----- I got lost even though I had the map ------\n13:56 Room 21.\n29:47 Room 37.\n32:14 and 46:22 Room 69.\n1:29:53 Room 50.\n\nGemstone Warrior, Strategic Simulations, Commodore 64, 1985.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2K-h0pzBI8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2K-h0pzBI8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2K-h0pzBI8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2K-h0pzBI8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2K-h0pzBI8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[C64] Gemstone Warrior \u30b8\u30a7\u30e0\u30b9\u30c8\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2 - Walkthrough Commodore 64", "description": "00:00 Opening.\n00:41 Outward.\n32:14 Start 1st search (result: no Gemstone).\n46:22 Start 2nd search. \n50:39 Get 1st Gemstone.\n54:50 Get 2nd Gemstone.\n1:03:10 Get 3rd Gemstone.\n1:10:09 Get 4th Gemstone.\n1:17:47 Get 5th Gemstone.\n1:19:30 Start return trip (demons spawn).\n1:33:33 Ending.\n\nGood music!
