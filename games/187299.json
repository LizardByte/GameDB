Your task is to bring the lander from the orbit down to the surface of each of 27 different exoplanets. In order to achieve high score award you need to hover close to alien artifacts scattered on the planets before landing precisely in designated zone. By controlling the thrust of two rocket engines you need to adjust your velocity in order to descend from the orbit and land softly on the landing pad. Watch your fuel, altitude and attitude to land like a pro!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
