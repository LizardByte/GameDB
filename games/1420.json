Randomly, the player will have access to the Imperial Tournament, which is the final goal of the game. The tournament is fought with steel swords and start each match with full health. The player can still challenge other schools and victory earns their school's sword. Equipping different swords gives you a unique \"special move\". At this point in the game, the player will be randomly challenged by either the master or unique student of other schools and cannot decline. Losing such random encounters strips the character of that school's sword. Both the life and Ki bars can be hidden from battle, and the status of a wounded character is displayed during battle.", "summary": "The mind is a powerful weapon. So is the sword.
