Hey, how many times have I told you not to come in as you please? Also, give me back my spare key already...\"\n\nRevolving around the AIKAGI, this is how the love story between our amiable but easy-to-tease protagonist, and his mischievous junior begins.", "summary": "Aikagi 3 is a console port for the Nintendo Switch.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aikagi-3--1"}
