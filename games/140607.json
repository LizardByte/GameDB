It is set up as a simple maze with hedges as walls. The only problem: it has angry cows in it. They also do not take kindly to people in their field and so will attack you whenever possible. Players can use their Xbox 360 Avatar as their character within the game. There is also support for up to four players in competitive gameplay, in which they compete to see who can get the most milk. Co-op can be played on either a single 360 console, or over Xbox Live.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/angry-brainless-bovines"}
