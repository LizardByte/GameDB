Here's how to rank yourself:\n\n\u2606 1 Hit - Even a blind monkey can do this\n\u2606 2 to 5 Hits - You should not be using a bow\n\u2606 6 to 10 Hits - You are a typical shooter\n\u2606 11 to 15 Hits - You are a fantastic archer\n\u2606 16 to 20 Hits - You are a Master at archery\n\u2606 21+ Hits - Few in the world can compete with you\n\nThis game is a parody of Psy and his amazing Gangnam Style.
