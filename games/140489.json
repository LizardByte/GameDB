Pressing the 'kick' key down will increase the power of the kick. The number of players on the field is unusual and consists of 7 players for each team including the goalkeeper.\n\nThe game is available for 1-8 players, and it has a slightly different range of computer AI levels, game speeds, match durations, and countries in Amiga/C64 versions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
