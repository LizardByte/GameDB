Space Station, a group of H.D.E. Defenders get sent out to stop them. However, the defenders end up getting thrown into a mission where they have to stop a plan called Codename: STEP.\n\nWith a 7-stage Story Mode, and a new Extra Mode (both playable in singleplayer and multiplayer), you can expect the game to be much bigger than the previous games. In addition, there's a singleplayer Classic Mode and multiplayer Battle Mode.\n\nItch.io Page: https://rgamesofficial.itch.io/galacticblasters4\nSFGHQ Link: https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/galactic-blasters-d-future-darkness-sage-22-version.1396/\n\nRGames Discord Server: https://discord.gg/JVhfDGM6gC", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztZTLVB1ss4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztZTLVB1ss4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztZTLVB1ss4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztZTLVB1ss4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztZTLVB1ss4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Galactic Blasters D - Future Darkness ~ Trailer", "description": "This is a trailer for the fourth Galactic Blasters game, Galactic Blasters D - Future Darkness, which finally reveals the release date for the game.\n\nGalactic Blasters D is a full-on horizontally scrolling space shmup where after enemy fleets start attacking the L.I.S.P.
