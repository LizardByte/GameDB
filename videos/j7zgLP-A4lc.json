This game was actually made for the Sears Tele-Games line of video games sold at department stores and through catalogs.  Memory Match is the identical game as A Game of Concentration for the Atari 2600 (by Atari).  This is a super old school retro video game from the late 70's that uses the Atari Keyboard Controller (previously reviewed).  It's basically the video game version of Memory, and also the Atari version of Matchmaker for the Magnavox Odyssey 2.  If you like strategy and brain games then this one may be for you.... but probably not.  Matchmaker! is ten times better.  Classic Game Room is the ultimate Atari 2600 reviewer should by a reviewer who loves all things Atari and appreciates retro video games.  8 Sears Telegames in total in this game cartridge.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j7zgLP-A4lc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j7zgLP-A4lc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j7zgLP-A4lc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Classic Game Room HD - MEMORY MATCH for Atari 2600 review", "description": "Classic Game Room HD reviews MEMORY MATCH for the Atari 2600 VCS video computer system.
