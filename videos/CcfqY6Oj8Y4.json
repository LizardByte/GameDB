I know I do -- they have a rather interesting and storied history between their various licensing deals and sub-contractors. Jaleco is a prolific corporate game studio and service provider that was founded in the 70s and operated during the early 80s and is perhaps best known for \"City Connection\", \"Bases Loaded\", \"Ninja JaJaMaru-kun\", \"Rushing Beat\", \"Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai\" and much more. They experienced a variety of financial struggles ever since the late 90s and have faced bankruptcy and acquisition numerous times. They generally ceased functioning as we know it by 2012 (after their \"Game Yarou\" mobile endeavor failed) and were later acquired by a group known as \"Clarice Disk\" who changed their name to \"City Connection\" and they currently hold the rights to Jaleco's many IPs. However, they released one final game of their own volition before declaring bankruptcy-- a little title by the name of \"Maji de Daiya Runba!\" \n\nAs a figurative Doujin gem, MdDR is a significant \"Power-Up Version\" (or expansion) to the free Doujin game, \"Chokotto Daiya Runba!\" released three years prior back in 2009. The game combines fun Arcade-style action with arcane secrets, several modes and unlockable options, and several guest characters from Jaleco's mobile works and Japanese PSP /Vita works, such as remakes of \"Momoko 120%\" (Momoko 1200%), independent mobile games such as \"Maou ga Ochiru Hi\", \"Takadaka no Wasuremono\" and \"Jinrui wa Ippon no Tou ni Omoi wo Kometa...\". The goal of the game is to guide the titular heroine, Runba, to riches by grabbing all the diamonds you can while avoiding enemies and obstacles on semi-random stage layouts. Collecting diamonds consecutively will increase your chain and points max out at 10,000 each (the video says 30,000, but this was fixed in a subsequent patch), but missing a diamond or having it destroyed by an enemy or other means will reset it as well as your \"Dia Power\". The player does not have control of Runba directly and she is always moving to the right, but they can indirectly influence her actions by sliding walls up or down as well as accelerating the movement of the screen (which will also increase Runba's speed).\n\nWhile the original was an endless score attack game, this version includes a wealth of additions including seven new main stages (that each introduce a different hazard) as well as \"Dia Powers\", various secret items needed to unlock bonus stages, new routes which will lead to the game's true ending(s), unlockable features such as a music and CG room, and more. Levels have various items that will power-up your character and give you new abilities, most of which you need to backtrack to previous levels to get upgrades to open new routes. If you don't go through stages in the proper order, you will keep looping back to previous levels, so unless you want to really build up your score, you should look for the hidden items on the stages. In the beginning, you only have a single \"Dia Power\", the power of clairvoyance (as long as it is maxed out, you can see many hidden objects denoted by flashing blocks), but you will also gain the ability to summon a helper who destroys a certain amount of enemies and diamonds before losing steam. Items also range from boots to move 50% faster, a hammer to destroy Ice or hidden blocks, a key to reveal the true path on the ghost level, and special items to unlock new features. If the player touches an enemy, dangerous obstacle or is crushed, they will lose.\n\nIf you want to gain access to the final main level and get the true ending, you will need pretty much every item except the boots and map as you need a golden mushroom to break the curse of the demon lair. After completing the game however, there is more to do after the credits -- depending on how you cleared the final level and what answers you choose, you'll go on special guest character stages, and clearing these (while finding the secret item) unlocks guest character routes where you can unlock more CGs for your gallery and get additional story. The game has a simple soundtrack by Yuu Inai of \"PHOENIX Project\" with one vocal arrangement and cute graphics. Runba has a few more animation frames and voice samples now and the new stages add a few cool effects like fog, running water, etc. It is worth noting that this game is single player only.\n\nFor the equivalent of about $8, you get a cool little title and the game is still offered digitally for download (I have the physical retail release). You can get the game at:\n\nhttps://www.dlsite.com/home/work/=/product_id/RJ109629.html\nhttps://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail/detail.php?product_id=967022\nhttp://www.digiket.com/work/show/_data/ID=ITM0077307/\n\nThis is a video showing several things including the ending and partial routes.
