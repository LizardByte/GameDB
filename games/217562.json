A specialist squad of the police force known as S.T.A.R.S. has been investigating the case, and have determined that the pharmaceutical company Umbrella and their biological weapon, the T-Virus, are behind the incidents. Jill Valentine and the other surviving S.T.A.R.S. members try to make this truth known, but find that the police department itself is under Umbrella's sway and their reports are rejected out of hand. With the viral plague spreading through the town and to her very doorstep, Jill is determined to survive. However, an extremely powerful pursuer has already been dispatched to eliminate her.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-3-cloud-version", "videos": [{"id": 74669, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FZu5aZsrfCw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZu5aZsrfCw", "title": "Resident Evil cloud versions are coming to Nintendo Switch - Nintendo Direct 9.13.2022", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZu5aZsrfCw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
