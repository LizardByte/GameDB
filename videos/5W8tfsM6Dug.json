One is governed by rules and regulations with measures implemented to enforce them; the other, its polar opposite is a society that not only lacks laws and regulations but also encourages wars and chaos. To merely survive, players must utilize the raw materials that can be found in the world to gain knowledge, increase their strength and build protection to fend off wild animals and unfriendly neighbors, however, to prosper, players must set themselves apart from the others in their area of expertise, whether they are a crafter, builder, farmer, gatherer, merchant, mercenary, or any other skilled professional.
