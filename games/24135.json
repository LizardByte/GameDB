More than just a side-scrolling fighting game, River City Ransom EX features a character-building system and customization options.\n\nThe Western version is a regional port of the Japanese version, since it uses the same storyline and identities of River City Ransom, instead of the stablished characters from Downtown Nekketsu Story and the Kunio-kun franchise.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 47412, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "46D6OcENygo"}]}
