Frank is obsessed with videogames. One day there's a mysterious package by the door containing a floppy disk game called Sanctum 3-D. The more Frank plays the game, the harder it becomes to separate fantasy from reality. Now he must face his deepest fears in order to save himself from reaching the bottom of the dark spiral he's caught in.\n\nFight disturbing monsters, solve peculiar puzzles and explore the twisted and horrific environments that Frank's mind constructs in this psychological horror action game for VR. The game is set in an alternate 1990s with a surreal twist. Liminal Phase is inspired by games and movies from that era when CRT TVs, MS-DOS, and big box PC games were a thing.", "summary": "Liminal Phase is a VR action horror game set in an alternate '90s.
