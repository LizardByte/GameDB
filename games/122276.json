It is based on the 1995 children's book by Marc Brown. Players follow D.W., Arthur Read the aardvark's sister, who dislikes a lot of food because it looks disgusting to her. Items she does not like include pickles, tomatoes, pineapple, spinach, salad, parsnips etc. The story is told through narration and text on the screen and meanwhile many hotspots in the environment can be clicked for a short animation. There are also several mini-games such as decorating D.W.'s playhouse along with a game, soaking gophers with the water hose, setting the table and so on.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/living-books-dw-the-picky-eater", "collections": [{"id": 6264, "name": "Living Books"}]}
