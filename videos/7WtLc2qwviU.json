Drop the controllers and save a desert world with Hands First VR in the follow-up to award-winning IONIA.\n\nEOLIA, the symphonic fantasy-adventure follow-up in the award-winning Rhythm of the Universe series, reveals a brand-new world of storytelling on Meta Quest 2 this summer.\n\nBuilding upon the lore of IONIA, developer ROTU Entertainment\u2019s second title EOLIA uses hand tracking to deliver more immersive mechanics and rewarding exploration. Explore desert ruins with hints of a bustling civilization around every corner. Uncover a moving narrative with a timeless conservationist message by absorbing musical lessons from the environment and solving puzzles that bring balance to the world.\n\nCatastrophe looms for Eolia\u2014droughts plague once-verdant fields and extreme weather cuts open the skies. Climate change weighs heavily upon the land, and only an empathetic embrace of the world\u2019s musical mythology can save it. As adventurer Conga Dholak, you set forth on a journey of healing to stop the storm. Physically climb, jump, ride, and play instruments, uncovering melodies to restore the rhythm of the universe.\n\nTaking full advantage of Meta Quest 2\u2019s immersive Hand Tracking technology, EOLIA features dozens of interactions and intuitive controls designed for Hands First VR. Flick and pinch to play magical stringed instruments. Page through your journal to track your quests. Decipher and perform over a dozen flute melodies to unlock your powers. Collect items in your satchel for later use and view your inventory by just opening your palm. Climb ladders, ropes, and ledges, or take the reins of a mounted steed to break through obstacles and outrun storms\u2014all with your hands. With Meta Quest 2, your body is your instrument in Conga\u2019s fight against climate change.\n\nThe Rhythm of the Universe series is dedicated to real-world improvement through in-game education, but proceeds from each game also aid important causes. The philanthropic filmmakers, musicians, and visual artists of ROTU Entertainment will dedicate a portion of proceeds from EOLIA to a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting climate change.\n\n\u201cUnlike the endless worlds we explore in gaming, in reality, we only have one planet to call our own,\u201d said Jason Parks, ROTU CEO. \u201cThrough VR\u2019s ability to truly transport us and instill a tangible sense of place, we hope to inspire people to see the beauty in our natural world and consider brave actions in their daily lives.\u201d\n\nEOLIA continues a symphony of storyliving on Meta Quest 2 this summer with support for English voice and text, with text localization for additional languages coming post-launch.
