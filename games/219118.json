But humanity, akin to a virus, did not die out: some took refuge in their improvised shelters, the rich hid in the elite and comfortable \u201cLivos\u201d vault, and other exceptionally lucky people found themselves at the right moment by the walls of the \u201cOlympus\u201d skyscraper. The rest, not so lucky to protect themselves of radiation, had to adapt to the new conditions on the evolutionary, genetic level.\n\nFaced with hunger and powerlessness, a person tends to degrade quickly. Without GlobalNet and news broadcasts, people forgot about what is \u201cgood\u201d and what is \u201cbad\u201d. Eventually, everyone started to define the meanings of these words for themselves. Do you have food and shelter from the dangers of outside world? That\u2019s good! You have no food and nothing to protect yourself from wild beasts? Your buddy only has two bullets in his gun? That\u2019s bad\u2026 Now you have a gun and food? Good!\n\nMan is a social creature, so people started looking for each other. Some tried to fight hunger together by getting food in different ways. Others have found that being in a group makes easier to take things away from those who have something\u2026 Eventually, communities began to appear. Some attacked, others defended themselves. The most aggressive gathered into a group called \u201cSunset Jackals\u201d, and began terrorizing the Radius of Silicone Valley. The Jackars attacked not only loners and small families living in old houses, but also \u2013 old pre-war factories, such as the \u201cHappy Bull\u201d cannery, or the famous \u201cRainbow Pharmaceuticals\u201d chemical plant. When the victims became numerous and the benefits were not forthcoming, the communities made a deal and began trading with what they had: food, water, drugs, and weapons \u2013 the four staples of the New World.\n\nBut no matter how much the faction leaders wanted to acquire the resources of their fellows, the ultimate dream of anyone living in the Radius was, and still is, to get into the \u201cOlympus\u201d.\n\nThe fortified \u201cOlympus\u201d skyscraper rises right in the center of Radius, luring everyone who sees it. Lined with solar panels, it gleams in the sun like a beacon, attracting more and more hungry people from the remotest corners of Radius. But the gates of the tower always remain closed, and those who approach them risk encountering a patrol of Defenders. The rotting bodies of those who have dared still lie around the perimeter of the tower\u2026\n\n\u201cOlympus\u201d is a dream.\n\n\u201cOlympus\u201d is hope.\n\n\u201cOlympus\u201d is a fortress.\n\n\u201cOlympus\u201d is your cradle.\n\n\u201cOlympus\u201d is your home.\n\n\u201cOlympus\u201d is your grave\u2026", "summary": "it\u2019s a total conversion (modification) of Fallout 2, using its engine and basic mechanics, but getting completely new graphics, additional gameplay features, and a new story in a new world, not related to the Fallout series.
