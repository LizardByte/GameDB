You will build, organize and command your armies over one of the largest maps of the USA ever made for a Civil War game. There are a host of real military leaders to appoint with their own strengths and weaknesses and choosing the right man for the job is crucial. However you are not just a military leader and must make vital economics and political decisions. These can have far reaching effects and you can even influence foreign intervention from the French & British who were constantly intervening in America for power and prestige.", "summary": "Civil War II is a historical operational grand strategy game with a simultaneous turn-based engine that places players at the head of the USA or CSA during the American Civil War. It is a turn based regional game with an emphasis on playability and historical accuracy.\n\nEach turn lasts 2 weeks and you must issue your orders in advance, planning on where the enemy will be, not where they are now. Orders are executed simultaneously in 14 phases - 1 per day. Battles are resolved on the day they occur so scheduling the arrival of your forces and planning the logistics or your army are key to success.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/civil-war-ii", "videos": [{"id": 33693, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gYrX6rqhnoU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYrX6rqhnoU", "title": "Civil War II Trailer Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gYrX6rqhnoU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
