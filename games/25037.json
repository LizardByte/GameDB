It was later released for the IBM PC. The game was created by noted game designer Sid Meier, and published by MicroProse Software, which Meier founded in 1982 with Bill Stealey. The mission of the game is to fly solo over several states, delivering bags of mail. The game supported a fairly realistic flight model (for the time), and a large number of flight instruments were available. A map covering many states of the US was used, which even included altitude data (although the landscape always appeared flat due to the technology constraints of the time).", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/solo-flight", "videos": [{"id": 111188, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "m32DFMUVYEk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32DFMUVYEk", "title": "Solo Flight | Raw Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m32DFMUVYEk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
