Until...\n\nOne fateful night, a mystery assassin shows up to literally suck out Seiji\u2019s life force! His would-be killer is none other than Kanoko, a second-year at the academy\u2014and a covert magical girl tasked with protecting humans against monsters from deep space. It all seems to trace back to a tragedy in Kanoko\u2019s past when a powerful Majin massacred her family... so why target a complete nobody like Seiji?\n\nTo complicate matters, the Starry Sky Council is investigating an anomaly in Kanoko\u2019s body, which means she and Seiji must move in together until further notice. But with Kanoko\u2019s usual ice-cold retorts betraying some decidedly vulnerable weak spots, what will become of Seiji\u2019s sanity this time around\u2014and Kanoko\u2019s? Find out in this third and final(?) installment of Destiny Star Girlfriend!", "summary": "In the final(?) route of this award-winning VN series, Seiji survives an attempt on his life by Kanoko, aka secret magical girl no. 3.
