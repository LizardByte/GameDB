It was never released commercially. It was also playable on the successor DVK-1 and DVK-2 computers, although it is unknown whether that is a different version, or simply the same code running on a different computer. Minor visual differences are present, but the gameplay is the exact same.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tetris--4"}
