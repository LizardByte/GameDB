Through a series of notes, A.S. reveals his entrapment in this dimension; he has found rooms that are attached to others that have come in contact with Null, the material warping the reality around these self-contained rooms, yet linking them together. Passage is only possible when the puzzle is solved, revealing a piece of Null, which, when viewed with the player's eyepiece, reveals the next door. The letters from the friend tell the player-character to move through each room quickly, warning of the risk of insanity to those who are exposed to it too long. A.S. reveals that he had become too far gone to find an escape. While working within one of the rooms, the player discovers the body of A.S., who has been trapped with the rooms for many years due to the strange passage of time within Null. The player, on completing the final room, finds the exit leading back to the house where the first game started, but chased by tendrils of an evil entity using the Null. The player-character escapes the house in time as the tendrils cause parts of the house to implode, taking away the passage to Null with it.", "summary": "Unique events transport you to the halls of a long-forgotten crypt. The only means of escape lies locked within a stone pedestal, along with a note from your mysterious ally. His words promise assistance, but only serve to entice you into a compelling world of mystery and exploration.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-room-two", "videos": [{"id": 19844, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "soyeCXKQ6_Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soyeCXKQ6_Q", "title": "The Room Two: out now on Google Play", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/soyeCXKQ6_Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 8795, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Usd7YkKN7Zs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usd7YkKN7Zs", "title": "The Room Two: PC Edition", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Usd7YkKN7Zs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
