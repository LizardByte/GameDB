By competing in all game modes, players are able to unlock more cars and arenas.\n\nHDM was born as a quick throwaway prototype by modifying an Asteroids template project in September 2014. By adding bullet-deflecting shields, removing the danger elements from the debris and placing another player in the scene, a frantic gameplay with plenty of possibilities for mastery emerged. The team has been working on HDM as a side project ever since, managing to land the game on the market in slightly more than a year.\n\nHDM is part of the ID@Xbox programme.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hyperdrive-massacre", "videos": [{"id": 6650, "name": "STEAM Launch Trailer", "video_id": "2P0ApBTA1cQ"}, {"id": 6651, "name": "GDC Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "E-t4tLYfCdM"}]}
