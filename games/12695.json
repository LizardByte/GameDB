Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots. Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 39199, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pH6AGawY-Fw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH6AGawY-Fw", "title": "Naughty Ones - Level 1 - Amiga A1200 AGA Version", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pH6AGawY-Fw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
