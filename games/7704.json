Otherwise, the given story draws concepts from the famous religious epics Paradise Lost and the Divine Comedy.\n\nUnlike the original game, which alternately combined platform game sequences and god game sequences, ActRaiser 2 is only a platform game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 6287, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "qkExWD02Y9U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkExWD02Y9U", "title": "SNES Longplay [057] ActRaiser 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qkExWD02Y9U/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
