Marlin, with the help of the slightly confused Dory, gets underway to rescue him, while Nemo plots to escape with the other inhabitants of the aquarium.\n\nAt any time, the player can switch between Marlin and Nemo. Several puzzles must be solved to complete the game: including logic and memory puzzles and inventory-based ones.\n\nActual clips from the film illustrate the storyline.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/finding-nemo--1"}
