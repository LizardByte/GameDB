Fast-forward to the year 2009: the player takes control of Raiden, a rookie agent operating under the order of the Colonel, apparently a member of a reformed Foxhound unit. His initial assignment is to infiltrate the offshore clean-up facility Big Shell and rescue the President of the United States of America, who was kidnapped by members of a terrorist organization known as Sons of Liberty. However, the matters become increasingly complicated as almost everyone Raiden communicates with appears to have things to hide, and it is hard to tell a friend from foe...", "summary": "Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the sequel to the espionage action game Metal Gear Solid. Much of the gameplay remains the same, as the game's protagonist has to sneak past guards, outsmart them using various gadgets and defeat the tricky boss enemies. The game expanded its predecessor's cover mechanic, with Solid Snake or Raiden able to take cover behind walls or objects and pop out to shoot at enemies, while the improved enemy AI allowed enemies to also take cover from the player. Metal Gear Solid 2 is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, as well as a leading example of artistic expression in video games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "videos": [{"id": 149, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cq6L1HV5gz4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq6L1HV5gz4", "title": "Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty - E3 2000 Trailer - PS2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cq6L1HV5gz4/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 176, "name": "Peter"}, {"id": 805, "name": "Emma"}, {"id": 5117, "name": "Rosemary"}, {"id": 5122, "name": "Vamp"}, {"id": 5127, "name": "Ames"}, {"id": 5130, "name": "Hostage"}, {"id": 4961, "name": "Russian Soldier"}, {"id": 5123, "name": "Fatman"}, {"id": 5129, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 4025, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm33t.jpg"}, "name": "Mei Ling", "species": 1}, {"id": 5121, "name": "Fortune"}, {"id": 5119, "name": "Colonel"}, {"id": 5120, "name": "Solidus"}, {"id": 5126, "name": "CMC Dolph"}, {"id": 4754, "name": "SEAL"}, {"id": 5116, "name": "Otacon"}, {"id": 5128, "name": "President"}, {"id": 5118, "name": "Olga"}, {"id": 5125, "name": "Liquid"}, {"id": 2168, "gender": 0, "name": "Snake", "species": 1}, {"id": 2588, "name": "Computer Voice"}, {"id": 5124, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3864, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zc.jpg"}, "name": "Ocelot", "species": 5}, {"id": 1225, "name": "Sergei"}, {"id": 114, "name": "Jack"}]}
