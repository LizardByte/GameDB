Difficulty starts off moderate and escalates to very challenging on the later maps, though lowering skill level can ease things up significantly if needed. There are 7 main levels and one bonus level accessed through a secret exit on map 7, which is intended to be a very difficult challenge for seasoned players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warglaive"}
