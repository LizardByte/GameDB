The tournament is once again sponsored by a chain of restaurants, with famous martial artists working there as waitresses. The player chooses one of the six girls of the Jahana group and has once again to defeat all the others in battle before fighting Kotoe and her bodyguards.\n\nThe Bout of Cabalistic Goddess is the second game in the Variable Geo series. It follows the same gameplay template as its predecessor: the player has to fight the other girls in a pre-determined order, winning two rounds out of three. There are five new girls to fight in this sequel. As before, the defeated fighters undergo various humiliating treatments of sexual nature. There are now three erotic scenes per girl, but it's possible to see them only after winning the whole battle, not one scene per round, as it was the case in the first game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vg-ii-the-bout-of-cabalistic-goddess"}
