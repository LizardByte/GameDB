Demon lord Rogles extinguishes a light in Vecanti which functions as a source of power for those who live there, and in a desperate plea for salvation, its queen Valia reaches out for a brave soul who can help them in their time of despair. Yuko on Earth is the one who answers the call, being summoned by magical forces into Vecanti to liberate them from the evil of Rogles.", "summary": "The Famicom port follows the same basic story, but instead of a series of separate stages, all of Vecanti is now one big, interconnected world. The gameplay differs considerably from the other versions, being more akin to a side-scrolling action role-playing game. It is a more difficult game due to its larger maze-style levels with multiple paths, and a lack of a password or save feature.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mugen-senshi-valis-the-fantasm-soldier--1", "videos": [{"id": 102327, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3sHumuEy7z4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sHumuEy7z4", "title": "Mugen Senshi: Valis (FC \u00b7 Famicom) video game reworked port | full game completion session \ud83c\udfae", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3sHumuEy7z4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 102328, "name": "Commercial", "video_id": "J9OcT_JetVU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9OcT_JetVU", "title": "Mugen Senshi Valis Commerical [1987, FC]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J9OcT_JetVU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
