Other than most of the Italian teams, club names, as are many of the players, are fictional. However, the game has an improved edit mode so players can edit the team's name, flag, logo, team shirts, and stadium.\n\nThe shop system can unlock hidden features such as classic teams. The game also has a training and a challenge mode, in which players must dribble around cones as quickly as possible. Replays can be fast-forwarded and rewound, and the view can be rotated. The advantage rule was implemented, so a foul only stops play if the fouled team suffers for it.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-soccer-winning-eleven-7-international", "videos": [{"id": 13474, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Tmo9cJkqNU4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmo9cJkqNU4", "title": "Pro Evolution Soccer 3 - PlayStation Experience Trailer - PS2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tmo9cJkqNU4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 13473, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "qvaHYwbw_xg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvaHYwbw_xg", "title": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2003 Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvaHYwbw_xg/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 195, "name": "Pro Evolution Soccer"}, {"id": 8363, "name": "World Soccer Winning Eleven"}]}
