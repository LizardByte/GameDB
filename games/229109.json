Tolkien, especially The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. While playing the game, you can explore over 75 unique areas including: Isengard, Edoras, Midgewater, Fangorn, Shelob's Lair, Lothlorien, Rivendell, Lonely Mountain, Helms Deep, Minas Morgul, and many more. New areas are added regularly.\n\nMordor's unique multi-class system, along with its remort classes, allows you to completely customize your character. Role-play as good or evil and engage in player vs. player combat by joining an alliance, such as the Eye of Sauron, the Hand of Saruman, the Haradrims, the Last Alliance, the Northern Rangers, and the White Council. Solo and mercenary classes are also available, along with an alliance dedicated to helping out new players -- the Guardians of Mordor.\n\nAll alliances are ever evolving through the expansion of their halls and the addition of new alliance-specific equipment. We have a full time Quest Master and often offer Immortal quests.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mordor"}
