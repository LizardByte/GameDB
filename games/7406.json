Will they lead Naija to the truth?\n\nThe Kelp Forest\nTHE NATURAL WORLD\n\nThe kelp forest teems with life. As light from above pours across the multitudes of strange plants and animals that live here, one cannot help but marvel at the dynamic landscape.\n\nBut beware, its beauty belies the inherent danger inside. Careful not to lose your way.\n\nThe Abyss\nDARKNESS\n\nAs you swim deeper, to where sight cannot reach, the Abyss begins to swallow you whole. The deeper waters of Aquaria have spawned legends of frightening monstrosities that lurk where few things can survive. Are they true?\n\nBeyond\n???\n\nWhat lies beyond? Are there areas deeper than the Abyss? Or as we swim ever upward, can we find the source of the light?\n\nOnly those with great fortitude will come to know and understand the mysteries of Aquaria.", "summary": "A massive ocean world, teeming with life and filled with ancient secrets.
