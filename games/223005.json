It takes place five years after the events of the first game. The game now takes place in the town Grim Oak and features Thomas Warden again in the most important role.\n\nThe gameplay is still shown from an overhead view and consists mainly of small puzzles, usually based on light. This time there are more light sources, three hidden mini-games (a darts game, a worm game and a Pong game) and the whole town of Grim Oak to explore instead of just the hospital. The player can revisit places, battle monsters and solve item puzzles.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/darkest-fear-2-grim-oak", "videos": [{"id": 77274, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AhZpaYvXsu8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhZpaYvXsu8", "title": "Darkest Fear 2 - Grim Oak [Cinematic] (PREVIEW)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AhZpaYvXsu8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77275, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "dAF-ef99RQU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAF-ef99RQU", "title": "Darkest Fear 2 - Grim Oak [Ingame] (PREVIEW)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dAF-ef99RQU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
