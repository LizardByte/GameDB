As you help the world around you to thrive, you receive vital energy(Prana) in return. During the Autumn season, while the trees are shedding their leaves, orbs of Prana are released into the air, which you can absorb. Your own Prana can be utilized to help and change the world around you and to obtain spiritual teachings.\n\nMore than levels, puzzles or in-game progressions, Autumn\u2019s focus is on the growth of the player. Not the one in the game, but the one in the chair.\n\nThere are no time limits, no enemies to defeat, no goals to reach\u2026 except the ones you set for yourself. Relax, learn, grow\u2026 and enjoy Autumn.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/autumn", "videos": [{"id": 9229, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MSfvHPovO_c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfvHPovO_c", "title": "Autumn - Official Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MSfvHPovO_c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
