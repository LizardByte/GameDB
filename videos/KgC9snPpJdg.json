It combines the likes of film noir and samurai cinema, presenting them with 8-bit graphics, an electro-jazz soundtrack, and a comic/manga-like style creating a unique atmosphere.\n\nUnlike it's predecessor, samurai_jazz, Shin Samurai Jazz features jumping mechanics inspired by chuunori, an old technique used in kabuki theatre to give the illusion of flying. It's combat mechanics are more combo-based with the ability to juggle enemies and perform mid-air combinations also inspired by chuunori. While the adventure elements remain intact, the puzzles are more complex with varied level designs and enemy placements/attack patterns that make use of the game's mechanics. And while the game retains that 8-bit vibe, regenerating health and infinite lives/continues are fairly implement to relieve players of some of that Golden-Era frustration.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Adventure through an 8-bit city and free it from it's pixelated nightmare\n\n- Chuunori inspired platforming with double-jumping, wall-jumping, and aerial dashing abilities\n\n- Perform attack combinations on land or in mid-air and juggle enemies to overcome their strategic placement and attack patterns\n\n- Solve puzzles that'll test your platforming skills and tease the brain a bit\n\n- Supports Xbox 360 controllers\n\n- Play a retro game without some of those retro frustrations.
