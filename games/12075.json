The next morning after the arrival, the protagonists Eric and Tina discover that one of their club members is injured while others are missing, and that the whole town is crawling with monsters.", "summary": "Silent Hill: The Arcade is an arcade game based on the Silent Hill series. Being a rail shooter, the game is a large departure from the normal survival horror mechanics. Gameplay is similar to the House of the Dead series in which players use light guns to aim and shoot at enemies. Shooting away from the screen reloads the player's gun. The Arcade has a multiplayer element, a second player can join the game at any time.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/silent-hill-the-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 36241, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "93Oc5CljxHE"}]}
