{"id": "CVNR6CHdhXU", "snippet": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [251] Lemmings", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nLemmings is a puzzle video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC in 1991. The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphic creatures called Lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\nLemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports.\n\nThis game is based on the NES port, and ties with it as the worst port. Therefore, all differences which the NES version has from the original apply to this game, but with some exceptions. It lacks an intro cutscene, which means the ending cutscene makes no sense; Lemmings walk and fall much slower, which is not only annoying, but makes time limit on levels your worst enemy, some solutions will simply not work due to time limit; flickering is even worse than on NES; some levels are straight up broken, with Lemmings falling through floors, teleporting away, and solid white space not actually being solid sometimes; it is still divided into an 8-pixel grid, but digging and bashing work like they do in the original; Digging will still revert to the NES version's 8-pixel insta-digging if you assign two lemmings to dig in one spot, except Diggers will float in the air as they will still move like they are digging normally; Blockers can't be saved by digging under their feet because Digger Lemming will turn away before starting to Dig; Builders do not stop and turn away after they hit a ceiling but clip into ceiling while they finish their task instead, they still turn away after that; Miners don't start tunneling until their second strike, they also can levitate down for a while before falling, if there is no terrain under them, and they will mine all the way down a 45 degree slope, even though no tunnel will appear.\n\nOn the other hand, it can play both music and sounds; you can change tasks and move cursor when the game is paused; it displays a Lemming's current task and prioritizes Bashers and Diggers when you click on a crowd; Builders continue building after they hit a wall, which is a nice addition; tasks can properly be assigned to a lemming going down a very steep piece of terrain, except on one level.\n\nI tried to save Lemmings whenever possible, but there probably are a few levels that could've been solved better. After beating the game, I show death animations and different messages you get depending on how many Lemmings you saved. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CVNR6CHdhXU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CVNR6CHdhXU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CVNR6CHdhXU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [251] Lemmings", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nLemmings is a puzzle video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC in 1991.
