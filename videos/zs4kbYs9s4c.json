{"id": "zs4kbYs9s4c", "snippet": {"title": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers: Story Trailer", "description": "Soul Hackers delivers a first-person, dungeon-crawling RPG experience set in a future where technology and otherworldly forces meet in a macabre fusion of cyberpunk futurism and gothic horror. A first-person sci-fi RPG epic, Soul Hackers tells of a city held up as a beacon of humanity's triumph of technology, but with an infernal secret. In this would-be utopia, a group of hackers takes on a centuries-old mystic society, and a battle for control over humanity's fate is about to begin.\n \nIn the classic tradition of Shin Megami Tensei, players will have the compelling choice throughout their dungeon exploration to fight the enemy demons they encounter, or negotiate with them in an attempt to turn them into allies and teammates.  Soul Hackers on 3DS includes access to 30 additional demons, a new opening animation movie and theme song, improved controls, and quicker loading times.  Additionally players can use the 3DS' bottom screen as an auto-mapping function, and engage a COMP hack to change difficulty levels on the fly and fill out maps without walking through.  After clearing the game initially, the 3DS version of Soul Hackers also delivers an extra dungeon, where players will witness the appearance of Raidou Kuzunoha from the previous Devil Summoner games.\n\nAvailable Spring 2013 for Nintendo 3DS.\n\nFor more information, visit:\nhttp://www.atlus.com/soulhackers\n\nBe sure to like us on Facebook: \nhttp://www.facebook.com/atlususa\n\nRemember to follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/atlususa\n\nDon't forget to pre-order today: \nhttp://atlus.com/soulhackers/purchase.html", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zs4kbYs9s4c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zs4kbYs9s4c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zs4kbYs9s4c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers: Story Trailer", "description": "Soul Hackers delivers a first-person, dungeon-crawling RPG experience set in a future where technology and otherworldly forces meet in a macabre fusion of cyberpunk futurism and gothic horror.
