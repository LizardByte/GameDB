To your superiors, you're nothing but cannon fodder...\nThe open world approach lets you define your own path and story in the campaign. Push back the enemy with your comrades or go deep behind enemy lines to sabotage their efforts and loot valuable items.\n \nAs you gain experience, you are promoted with higher command over soldiers and equipment. Call in artillery fire missions or paratrooper reinforcements when the situation gets tight! Use your squad to man armed boats, tanks and APC's. Or, fine, become the expert lone wolf you always aspired to be - it's up to you!\n\n#################################\nSteam Store: http://store.steampowered.com/app/270150\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RunningWithRifles\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/runningwithrifles\nTwitter: @osumiagames\n\n#################################", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1xpv-9AwPs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1xpv-9AwPs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1xpv-9AwPs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1xpv-9AwPs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1xpv-9AwPs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "RUNNING WITH RIFLES - Steam Launch Trailer", "description": "Osumia Games is proud to announce that RUNNING WITH RIFLES is now released as a final version! \n\nRUNNING WITH RIFLES is a top-down tactical shooter with some open-world RPG elements.\nIn RWR, you join the ranks of an army as a common soldier, just like the thousands around you.
