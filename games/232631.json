Instead of powerups falling from random blocks, you get upgrade tokens. Upgrade tokens go to your upgrade bar. Pressing a button spends your upgrade tokens while the other can be used to shoot your zapper if you have that powerup. The upgrades you can get have crazy sci-fi names, but they basically do what you expect them to do. Speed up, multi ball, expand your paddle, that sort of thing. Managing your upgrades and customizing your paddle is a large part of the game and it is easily the most fun part of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberblock-metal-orange"}
