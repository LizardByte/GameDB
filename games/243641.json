It takes green haired characters from across the whole Fire Emblem series and puts them in one game. It\u2019s not a simple reskin either: many vanilla chapters have been expanded, alongside some beloved (or despised) chapters from other Fire Emblem games.\n\nGenealogy of the Holy War and Thracia 776 gave heavy inspiration for this creation, as a skill system is present, along with FE5 style magic and tradable stat-boosting rings. You don\u2019t have to worry about choosing from Eirika and Ephraim\u2019s routes either; both are played in one save file.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-emblem-midori--1"}
