You will experience the narrative from the monster's point of view and fight for your right to survive rather than playing the role of the traditional human hero saving humanity from a monster.\n\nYour character's capacity to mutate and change shape is among this game's most intriguing elements. As you advance through each level, you'll learn new skills, getting faster, stronger, and more dangerous. To further exert control over your surroundings, you will also be able to possess both people and animals.\n\nThe path to freedom will be complex, so heed this warning. You'll need to move past several barriers, such as traps, doors, elevators, and lasers, while figuring out tricky puzzles that will put your intelligence to the test. Get ready to flex your problem-solving skills and emerge victorious as the ultimate monster hero.", "summary": "Do you have what it takes to make it out of a top-secret laboratory's depths?
