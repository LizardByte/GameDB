By choosing appropriate race tactics and driving styles, and placing well in the races, the player will grow in his ability to compete at an ever-higher level, gaining access to new racing cars as well as roadsters, coup\u00e8s and eventually dream cars such as the Bugatti EB110 and the Pagani Zonda. Races take place across Europe; from the beautiful landscapes of the Scottish Highlands and the Cote d'Azur to the monumental wonders of London and Barcelona, without missing out on famous racing venues such as Laguna Seca or Hockenheim.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/corvette-evolution-gt"}
