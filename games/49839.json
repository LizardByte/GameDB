At the beginning of the round, you're given your quota to meet -- in some levels, you'll have to destroy all the enemies. In another, wipe out all the blocks in the land. In another, rescue the level's Charabomb. And in others, simply make your way to the target square in the set amount of time. But it won't be easy, since many enemies just don't stay still for you to walk up and plant a bomb next to them. It's all in the strategy of bomb-placement. Plus, once a level's complete, you'll have to pick the proper exit that appears. Released in two versions, Blue and Red.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bomberman-max-blue-champion"}
