Japanese long-distance transporters, especially independent drivers, decorate their own trucks with beautiful paint, lights, metals and other parts to show their stylishness and hot spirits.\n\nThe rule of the game is simple, reach the goal in time. Select one of 4 trucks, and run through 5 stages within the limited time. When time becomes zero on the half way, the game is over. Each stage has a lot of events, such as falling rocks jumping over the bridge, or battles with the rival truck and also death hazard deviations that make you lose the run in one hit/fall.\n\nEvery trucker is different with is own story and must drive overnight to return home his/her your loved one. Hitting other vehicles carries a time penalty with the exclusion of the evil trucker in his demonic truck who turns up once a stage 8 (in last stage he will simply suicide into police cars). \n\nIf you lose time is game over but you can continue with a score reset, same if you die in course hazard.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F_xDH4pOBKw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F_xDH4pOBKw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F_xDH4pOBKw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F_xDH4pOBKw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F_xDH4pOBKw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Truck Kyosokyoku Arcade", "description": "So, in the game you play with Japanese art trucks are also known as \"deco-tra (decorated truck)\".
