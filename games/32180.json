Instead of aiming for pockets on a flat plane, you have six degrees of freedom with which to aim your shots. There are some new obstacles that make things a little more chaotic. If you want to bend the laws of physics and get a little crazy, or are just interested in the historical significance of the game, GravPool may be up your alley."}
