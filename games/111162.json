In this way you can lift up the quality of life for every person you play, but you can also see the dark side of life, witnessing tragic choices and suffering resulting from a lack of consciousness. \n \nExploring Consciousness - Free Will Mode \n \nIn this mode you have total control and consciousness over your all your life decisions independent from Destiny points, even as a small child. You can experiment with the freedom to see where life can go if it is all up to you for a change. \n \nWriting your own Story - Self-Authoring Mode \n \nThis feature is a \u201clevel editor\u201d, allowing players to create their own story or expand the existing one with unique choices and inner dialogue that reflects their own personality. You can choose backgrounds and music that matches the mood of every new stage of life. \n \nYou can create \u201cmouse cursors\u201d from 8 different archetypes that represent different aspects of your character's personality, what they choose, what they would think and how they would respond in all the different moments of life that require a meaningful decision. \n \nWhen you discover the right approach in interacting with them, you can ask them to \u201cstep aside\u201d and let YOU make the choice \u2013 exercising free will. If they don't trust you, they might choose something you think is not a good idea, resulting in tragic consequences.", "summary": "This is your Life is a text-based life simulation game and a self-authoring interactive novel. Players follow the life of a human being from birth to death by influencing important life decisions at every stage of development, and can add their own experiences to the story. \n \nThis is an EARLY PROTOTYPE.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/this-is-your-life"}
