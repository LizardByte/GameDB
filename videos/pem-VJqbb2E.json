This is Future Millennium Sporting Action!\n\nFeatures:\n-Solo and multiplayer play!\n-Circuit mode: an 8-round tournament, playable in local co-op or single player with an AI partner.\n-Versus mode: 4 player 2v2 or 1v1 local competitive play.\n-7 arenas with dynamic gameplay and unique gimmicks, like moving goals or changing boundaries\n-7 teams with unique stories\n-Random rule sets like BIG BALL, the floor is a goal, higher gravity, and more!\n-AI tournament: let the AI battle itself, wind it up and watch it go.\n\nHyper Gunsport is all about arcade action! Precision shooting and tight jumps! Clutch saves and epic slams! But the ONLY thing you can shoot is the ball!\n\nAt its core, Hyper Gunsport is a cooperatively competitive action game where the object is to shoot the ball into goals of varying difficulty, while the opposing team tries to do the same. Each time the ball crosses the net its point value goes up, so longer volleys mean bigger points and higher stakes.\n\nA team is composed of two positions, a keeper and a striker. The keeper doesn't move, but can fire more frequently, and has a wider aiming range and shot radius - they're often used as defense. The striker can move and jump, but can take fewer shots, so they must be precise and must make them count. Will you burn shots and get aggressive, or set up an iron defense instead? The game encourages teamwork and competition by equal measures.\n\nEach team also has its own special weapons which unlock with proficient play. These weapons require players to think on their feet and change the shape of the game. Tricky bounces, shots that detonate, different strategies abound. \n\nEach arena is unique as well, with its own gimmicks, from goals that open and close or change point values, to moving nets, to unstable footing. If you've played games like Windjammers, Sportsfriends, IDARB, or Towerfall, you'll be in familiar territory.\n\nUltimately, Hyper Gunsport rewards precision shooting for the hardcore minded, but is also friendly to new players who just want to have a good time. The depth is there if you want it! \n\nPeople's Republic of Oakland: This team is new to the game and has a lot to prove. Special attacks include a short range spherical blast that hangs in the air, and a shot that can bounce once before impact.\n\nNeo Tokyo: A venerable team with custom-made weapons. Their special attacks include a chargeable buster shot and an extended shotgun blast.\n\nNew Republic of Congo: Lords of the court. Special attacks include a custom yo-yo that hits the ball coming and going, and an assault rifle.\n\nUnited Worker's Socialist Democracy: Super cybernetically enhanced team from the eastern bloc. Specials include a long laser for angled shots, and cannon fire that keeps pushing on impact.\n\nBlue Cambodia: The oldest team on the pitch, who use no cybernetics. Their specials include a double arced arrow shot and an independent detonation mortar.\n\nScrapyard Squad: They sneaked in here on faked credentials with questionable weapons. Specials include a laser bat attack and a chain that extends the length of the field.\n\nPracticebots Alliance: Recently gained sentience. Can use the specials of any other team, but at random! You never know what you'll get.\n\nEnjoy our launch trailer!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pem-VJqbb2E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pem-VJqbb2E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pem-VJqbb2E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pem-VJqbb2E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pem-VJqbb2E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hyper Gunsport - Launch trailer - Available now!", "description": "Hyper Gunsport is NOW AVAILABLE.
