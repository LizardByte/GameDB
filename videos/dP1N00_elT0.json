Sounds like a typical day at work in this silly, yet pretty tough tower defense game.\n\nLast time I experienced this game was through a demo during the October 2023 edition of Steam Next Fest. It was pretty basic, but the concept is definitely funny. With the game already nearing its February release, this got more units, more levels and now a random event system that affects your units. Some can increase the unit attack speed, strength and range, but some can cause the opposite. Some come at a cost of pressure, which if you have too much, it will not go over well for the units. And then there are some that can help you with those cranky buggers that are trying to reach the elephant in the room (pun intended), like placing rubber ducks in the middle of the road, putting a fire at the start of the route (which I do NOT recommend you try that with a real life office) or placing bear traps in front of the boss.\n\nThink you can make the boss proud?\n\nWage Slave TD (C) Stranger Games\nSpecial thanks to the developer Stranger Games for providing the Steam key, allowing me to make this video possible.\n\n#steam #steamgames #steamgame #wageslavetd #towerdefense #towerdefence #weirdgames #sillygames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dP1N00_elT0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dP1N00_elT0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dP1N00_elT0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dP1N00_elT0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dP1N00_elT0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wage Slave TD [Full Release Version] - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "Placing people with goofy rubber animal masks and have them defend the boss (who happens to be an elephant) by throwing stuff at other, angrier people with goofy rubber animal masks?
