Watch out for the red lava, dices burn in it! \n \nBlue ground is ice, which is slippery. \n \nPink malicious chunks show a symbol only for a moment, you have to memorize what you just saw. \n \nSnow white chunks have to be removed by quick taping on them. \n \nThe faster you reach the target, the more points you score.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/matchunk"}
