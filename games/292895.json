Keira manages to cause one pirate to fall from the ship, while Jak has engaged into a fistfight with the other, known as Captain Phoenix. Jak loses and tries to turn into Dark Jak, though fails to do so due to the eco instability, subsequently dealing him great pain. Phoenix witnesses Jak's attempt to transform, stating there are more people like Jak and prepares to shoot to kill him. At this point Daxter manages to run Phoenix off by shooting at him with the Hellcat's tailgun, but also shoots their own ship, causing a fuel leak, forcing Keira to crash land on to Brink Island.", "summary": "A port of Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier, enhanced with up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters. The game was originally released in 2009 as the sixth and final game in the Jak and Daxter series. The player assumes the role of Jak, the angst-ridden hero enhanced by his exposure to Light and Dark Eco.\n\nWhen their world begins to run out of Eco, Jak and Keira travel to the edge of the world in search of the ancient Precursor machinery that could reverse the planet's decline. They're not the only interested factions out on the Brink, however; Jak must contend with Sky Pirates while struggling to control his own Eco powers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jak-and-daxter-the-lost-frontier--1"}
