One or two players control three rows of players: the goalkeeper, three middle fielders and two attackers. To control the goalkeeper, the player to the left has to use the up-left and down-left directions of the joystick. To control the middle fielders, the player uses the up and down directions. To control the attackers, the player uses the up-right and down-right directions. The opposite applies to the right player.\n\nThe ball stops each time it touches a moving foosman and rebounds if it touches a still one. The score is marked with \"/\" (for one point) and \"X\" (for two points) symbols. The game ends when one of the players reaches ten points (XXXXX).", "summary": "Press 1 on the alpha-numeric keyboard.\n\nA full size tournament soccer table appears on your screen.

Press the action button or move the joystick of the hand control to tell the computer how many people are in the game.

When the joystick is in the center position, it will control the center file of three team members. When the joystick is in the far right position, it will control the file of two team members on the right side of your screen. For the right hand control, the reverse is true.\n\nThe ball will come into play from the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe ball will stop when it hits a player and the joystick is controlling the player's row. To kick, press the action button and simultaneously move the joystick in the direction you wish the ball to go.\n\nThe ball will rebound off a player whose row is not under control of the joystick.\n\nWhen a goal is scored, a ring will slide along the scoring rack at the bottom of the screen. /=1 point.
