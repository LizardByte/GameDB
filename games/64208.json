The game has two user-selectable speed levels. When serving and returning shots, the tennis players automatically swing forehand or backhand as the situation demands, and all shots automatically clear the net and land in bounds.\nThe first player to win one six-game set is declared the winner of the match (if the set ends in a 6-6 tie, the set restarts from 0-0). This differs from professional tennis, in which player must win at least two out of three six-game sets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tennis--2", "videos": [{"id": 15778, "name": "VR", "video_id": "FW7A0U7WN3s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW7A0U7WN3s", "title": "Classic Game Room - TENNIS review for Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FW7A0U7WN3s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118245, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "py6JZC2000s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6JZC2000s", "title": "[Atari 2600] Tennis (1981) Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/py6JZC2000s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
