While one player can move his units, the other can attack and vice versa. The results of battles are shown in animated sequences that can be turned off or on depending on a player's choice.\n\nTerrain affects the performance of units during battles adding a little variety factor. The more damage a unit causes to opponents the more experienced it becomes. It has a huge influence on its accuracy and strength. Units have different weapon and movement range depending on the type and the purpose of the unit. Different units are introduced as the game and war progress with more air and sea battles later on. Maps are filled with depots where a player can repair damaged units and factories where units can also be produced. During the game, seasons change with an impact on the terrain and the battles.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-great-war-1914-1918", "videos": [{"id": 23440, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "cLd3XIPuXFs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLd3XIPuXFs", "title": "History Line 1914-18 by BlueByte Old Dos PCGame", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cLd3XIPuXFs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
