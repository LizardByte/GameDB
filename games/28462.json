You can stop the ball shooted by your enemy with your balls. Its a shooting game, but not in the average style of shooting and the balls dont get destroyed just after 10 seconds, which can give you a lot of options for targeting your enemy. You can hit your enemy through rebounding. And we are at the first steps of the development, but we want to introduce new weapons and think about new type of \"bullets\".", "summary": "We have just released 2 days ago a new FPS game, but we have tried to make it look and shoot different, than what is average on this type of games. Its a shooters game, but instead of bullets that you cannot see or interact with, shoots balls, that bounce and do sparks all around what it hits. Because the game is still in development, there are some bugs and some issues to be improved, but in general its very playable. We got it in LAN and Multiplayer versions, so we would love to have the chance that somebody who loves this type of games review it, and give us feedback, excellent or horrible, but the opinion of an gameris vital to improve the game or stop it.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 13668, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "xt4iDHQ-9EY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt4iDHQ-9EY", "title": "Videoprincipal2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xt4iDHQ-9EY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 13669, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "PnQCTiGfgwU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnQCTiGfgwU", "title": "PromocionUNET", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PnQCTiGfgwU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
