Then, a woman named Kikyou, who claims to be a demon, also appears before him. After that, it isn't long before a pretty detective at the police department comes knocking on his door, imploring him to take up his family's duty of helping wandering spirits pass on to the afterlife and assist the police with any and all supernatural crimes reported in town. But when a case that's bigger than any of them ever imagined comes his way, will he be able to handle it? With the power of clairvoyance, an ability passed down through his family that allows him to see spirits, maybe he and his demon familiars can pull through, and he can be a proper successor to his family's legacy.", "summary": "Join spirit detective Kagami Makoto and his demon familiars as they hunt down the wandering ghosts disrupting the peace of his small town.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nanairo-reincarnation"}
