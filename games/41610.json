The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action that has been taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving in the form of fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.\n\nThe player can explore various locations in the fictional setting of Arcadia Bay and communicate with non-playable characters. Dialogue exchanges can be rewound while branching options are used for conversation. Once an event is reset, the details provided earlier are permitted to avail themselves in the future. In some instances, choices in dialogue will alter and affect the story through short or long-term consequences. For each one of the choices, something good in the short-term could turn out worse later.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/life-is-strange-limited-edition", "videos": [{"id": 20779, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Y60Rp3QbT58", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y60Rp3QbT58", "title": "Life is Strange Limited Edition Trailer (PEGI)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y60Rp3QbT58/sddefault.jpg"}]}
