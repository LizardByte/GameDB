According to the system itself, it was manufactured under license by Sega, though the production values are very unprofessional. The following year it was released in Japan as the Mega Drive 21.\n\nThe console doubles up as a controller which can be plugged into a TV, and the unit itself is a similar shape to the Tectoy Master System Handy. Rather than have a cartridge slot, it contains 20 built-in Sega Mega Drive games (though in actuality, there are only 8 - the rest are duplicates). The system is sold in a number of colors, including transparent-green and transparent-purple.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-drive-3--3"}
