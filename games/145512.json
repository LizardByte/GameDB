It combines traditional golf and minigolf with elements of puzzle platforming, and a twist of fantasy magic.\n\nMage Drops evolves the hit-and-wait formula of golf by adding magic: shots can be influenced mid-flight and elements of the world can be influenced like pinball bumpers, flippers, bullets, clouds, portals and more!\n\nThe environment itself is full of magical capabilities. Some can be used to your advantage, and some are hazards and traps: shots can cling to jelly walls, bounce off bubbles, be propelled by explosions, float on clouds, burn away obstacles with fire, gain powers by flying through magic rings, stimulate plants to grow into new platforms and much more!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
