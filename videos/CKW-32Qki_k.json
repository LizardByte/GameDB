He has trained extensively in the Elemental arts for the past decade of his young life, under the discerning eyes of the Mage Masters of Iginor.

The young Initiate is tasked with completing three quests which will test his magical and mental strength to full capacity.

Brave the perilous Bloodbark forest where the Redcap goblins stalk. Trek across a barren desert wasteland rife with lawless Bandits and savage Burrowers.
