Man has ceased his journey on the path to creation, and has instead begun dismantling the past.\n\nBeneath the shattered city of Vaelthorne, past the sundered gates and broken spires, lies the Grim Gauntlet Beneath-a labyrinthine underworld of cursed vaults and horrors unchained. None know who built it, nor why its halls refuse to stay still. Some say it was a prison for gods; others claim it was a treasury for an empire that suddenly collapsed into ruin.\n\nAll agree on one thing: for those who enter it, it is a tomb.\n\nStep forth, bold adventurer. Step forth and venture into the Gauntlet with naught but your steel, your wits, and your life. Beneath, death lurks. But so too does wealth beyond reckoning, relics of forgotten kings, and powers that defy mortal understanding.\n\nMany have tried. Most have perished. Will you be the latest to gain riches and glory from the GRIM GAUNTLET BENEATH?", "summary": "STANDARD DEV1ATIONS is an homage to the classic PLATO computer system and a clone of pedit5, the oldest CRPG to survive today.\n\nEnter the sprawling dungeons beneath Vaelthorne and face the horrors within for a chance at gold and glory.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/standard-dev1ations-ggb-grim-gauntlet-beneath"}
