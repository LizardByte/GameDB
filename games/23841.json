You first must qualify in the Desert Scramble where you race across the desert avoiding the prickly cactus, desert creatures, rocks, etc., in a race of speed and time. Hit an object and your dirt bike slows down. Hit too many and you won't qualify for the next race. The Hill Climb is a torturous race up a switchback mountain full of obstacles. Speed is important but control is vital or you'll be out of the race. Qualify with a fast time and you're in the Beach Sprint against other qualifiers in an all-out dash for the championship.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/motocross-racer"}
