Players navigate a hostile landscape, learn about their surroundings, and unravel a classic sci-fi story in the process. Best played in a dark room with headphones.\n\nIn a strange and hostile place, something has gone very, very wrong. You wake up inside a small capsule, trapped, with no view of the outside world. The only way to survive is to use the radar screen and the capsule's simple controls to try and find more oxygen and more fuel... and to find out what happened.\n\nCapsule is a short game, approximately 2 hours for most players. Capsule is not a game for everyone; if you are claustrophobic, misophonic, and/or have anxiety or triggers related to asphyxiation and/or darkness Capsule may not be a good game for you.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/capsule", "videos": [{"id": 83421, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jSt4Ab7NcMQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSt4Ab7NcMQ", "title": "MILSCI.INFO EXPOSED - BLACKBOX RECOVERED", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jSt4Ab7NcMQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
