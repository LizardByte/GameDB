Grabbing hold of a pick-axe, Snowy will travel to three different worlds in order to scamper around platforms and outwit enemies while collecting plenty of treasures. If he's lucky he'll outrun and outsmart the Cyclopses, Barbarians, and Mummies that are guarding these said treasures. But Snowy shouldn't fear because he's also going to get help from explosives and traps which will aid him in his quest.", "summary": "The first in the Snowy: Treasure Hunter platform puzzler series of games has the titular bear travel to three worlds with distinct graphic themes; an Egyptian world, a Greek mythological world and the final Norse inspired world. Each of these worlds presents twenty different levels with an additional ten levels devoted to training. There is also another difficulty level and additional levels for kids. The object for Snowy on each level is to collect all the treasures, some of which are buried beneath platforms while avoiding the enemies. Other things to avoid are re-filling pits that Snowy will dig, falling into his own mechanical traps, and, of course, getting stuck in dead-end. The player must use all the tricks in his/her arsenal to make sure Snowy doesn't get stuck while reaching for that last piece of treasure. Some levels also need the player to locate a key before moving onto the next level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snowy-treasure-hunter--1", "videos": [{"id": 121636, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IVQA_jPCTno", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVQA_jPCTno", "title": "SNOWY TREASURE HUNTER (free full game)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IVQA_jPCTno/sddefault.jpg"}]}
