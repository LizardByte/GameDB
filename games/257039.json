The game places players in the role of Mujaffa, an immigrant cruising through Copenhagen's streets in a stylish BMW to earn 'Street respect points.' The score builds through interactions with blondes, evading the police, and collecting items like gold chains and condoms.\n\nIn 2003, Norway's public broadcaster NRK adapted the game to fit the local context, changing the setting to Oslo. Despite initial controversy due to its challenging portrayal of societal taboos, the game continues to provoke discussions about societal preconceptions. While no longer officially available due to the discontinuation of Adobe Flash, 'Mujaffa-spillet' continues to resonate on various online platforms.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mujaffa-spillet"}
