However, it's not a port of any existing episodes, but a separate entry based on the rules of the second and the third games. Graphically, it's also similar to Civilization II, however the interface was adapted for device' much smaller screen size and resolution, as well as for its cell phone-like keyboard.\n\nThe goal of the game is the same -- to advance your society from the stone age to the space age, destroying your opponents or signing diplomatic treaties on the way. There are twenty one different civilizations to choose from, and generally the list of features is the same. There's a full Civilopedia and tutorial available as well.\n\nUnlike most of other N-Gage titles, there are no multiplayer features in Civilization.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/civilization", "videos": [{"id": 55806, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "S54X5Ti5Jok", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S54X5Ti5Jok", "title": "Civilization - Nokia N-Gage Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S54X5Ti5Jok/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
