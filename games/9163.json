The arcade version is notable both for its excessive scores (scores in the quintillions are not unheard of), and for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Treasure Co. Ltd's Radiant Silvergun), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/giga-wing-2", "videos": [{"id": 87911, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zuXho_QONns", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuXho_QONns", "title": "Gigawing 2 Full Game Play 1080P 60FPS Sega Dreamcast", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zuXho_QONns/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
