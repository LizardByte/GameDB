A bit of planning is required, as you (obviously) can move onto such a blue tile only once. The levels have a time limit, so it's required to think quickly.\n\nApart from the blue tiles the game also contains solid grey tiles that won't disappear, teleporters to move between two locations, bombs that act as a second layer for the tile (so you have to visit the tile twice to remove it) and arrows that will automatically push you into the arrow's direction.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 51737, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eUvhiDI1wfQ"}]}
