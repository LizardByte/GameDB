The game was never released in Japan. A Pocketsize version of the game was also released. The unit's model number was MG-61. In the game, you have to avoid the platforms that are coming towards the player character, Ziggy the Mazeman. The game's name comes from the fact that you'll be \"squished\" if a platform hits you. The top screen contained game information, while all of the action took place on the bottom screen. This and Zelda were the only two games to have a format like this when it came to multi-screen games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/squish", "videos": [{"id": 71204, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TiT5T0MpPn8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiT5T0MpPn8", "title": "Game & Watch: Squish (c)1986 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TiT5T0MpPn8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
