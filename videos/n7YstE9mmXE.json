Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe. Recorded by Dahlia, published 1 September 2018.\n\nDahlia's notes: This is a recording of my second playthrough of The Last Door 2 Collector's Edition. In my first playthrough I decided to save Wakefield - you can see/read this story attached right after the credits of the full game - the second playthrough when I went through the courtain and  saved Devitt. Another appendix is the episode \"The mask with noch Eyes\". The longplay unfortunately only contains the secrets I discorvered till now. Meanwhile I read a guide and figured out that there are at least five secrets missing, so if you follow this vid you will be able to get all achievements except \"Playwright: discover all secrets\".\n\nThe Last Door Season 2 playthrough content:\n0:00:00 Episode 1 The Playwright \n0:53:32 Episode 2 My Dearest Visitor\n2:01:30 Episode 3 The Reunion\n2:56:56 Episode 4 Beyond the Curtain\n3:36:00 Save Devitt's Life (ending)\n3:43:01 Save Wakefield's Life (ending)\n3:46:25 The Mask With No Eyes\n\nThe Last Door Season 2 release dates:\n- Windows PC: 31 October 2014 (episode 1)\n- Mac OS: 31 October 2014 (episode 1)\n- Linux: 31 October 2014 (episode 1)\n- iOS: 27 October 27 2016 (Collector's Edition)\n- Android: 27 October 2016 (Collector's Edition)\n\nGet The Last Door Collector's Edition at Humble Bundle:\nhttps://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-door-season-2-collectors-edition?partner=Ludophiles\n\nThe Last Door Season 1 longplay:\n- https://youtu.be/UK-WVobPvOk\n\nThe Last Door 2 is longplay No. 242 of the Ludophiles longplays project:\n- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFXG3BI19O5rpA9sB1_-K_x5s207hoahb\n- http://www.ludophiles.com/threads/ludophiles-longplays-project.180/\n\n#ludophiles #ludophilia #gaming #indiegame #longplay #playthrough #walkthrough #PointAndClick #adventure #horror", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n7YstE9mmXE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n7YstE9mmXE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n7YstE9mmXE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n7YstE9mmXE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n7YstE9mmXE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Last Door Season 2 - Full Playthrough / Longplay / Walkthrough (no commentary)", "description": "Longplay / full playthrough of The Last Door Season 2 Collector's Edition, a classic point and click adventure with a pixel art retro look and feel and a setting inspired by the works of H.P.
