This 3D survival game and animal simulator will set you into a realistic simulation of the insect world. Establish your own Ant Colony. Search for food resources in order to feed the ant queen and the larvae. Explore a large and detailed ant habitat populated with other insects which will attack your ant colony. After the required amount of food the ant queen will lay eggs that evolve to lavae.\n\nEnforce attacks to overwhelm other insects with the power of the swarm and get protein for the ant larvae. You have to plan ant battles against enemy insects like huge Scorpions, Spiders or Praying Mantis. Get in war with those creatures by the force of many soldier ants. Create amazing ant trails with pheromones to get support from the solider ants or worker ants, grub tunnels to enlarge the ant hill.\n\nAn animal simulator and 3d survival game - 3D Ant Simulator function overview:\n\nAnimalsimulator\n- 3d simulator and survival game\n- very realistic ant and insect behaviour (ant trails, pheromone communication)\n- Ant AI - watch their swarm behaviour, see how they create pheromone trails\n- open world game with a huge map, explore a detailed, huge 3d natural ant habitat\n- forest environment, different plants, realistic textures, water\n- Insect Simulator - other insects as protein source like spider, praying mantis worms, fly etc.\n- attack and fight against enemy insects with the ant colony\n- overwhelm them with the power of the swarm\n- collect food in the form of fruit to feed the queen and larvae\n- high-quality animation of the 3D ants, spiders and other insects\n- multiple cameras, easy touch control\n- explore underground caves and build a huge subterrrainian nest\n-enlarge the ant hill and dig new chambers\n\n#taptapgameplay #android #ios", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFrn-Om1q9s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFrn-Om1q9s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFrn-Om1q9s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFrn-Om1q9s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFrn-Om1q9s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ant Simulation 3D - Insect Survival Game - Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1 (iOS, Android)", "description": "Ant Simulation 3D - Insect Survival Game - Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1 (iOS, Android)\n\n\ud83d\ude3b - Support Us https://bit.ly/39Guuji\n\ud83d\udd25 - Subscribe TapTapGameplay https://bit.ly/3fE2BvK\n\nIn Ant Simulator 3D you can expire adventures from the perspective of a tiny ant.
