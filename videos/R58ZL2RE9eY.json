So far I've tested it on various versions of Project64, mupen64, Wii64, and Not64 and it works on all of those.\n\nQ: Does this work on Everdrive64?\nA: Yes, at least on 3.0.\nIt also works on this thing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhdOf3RU3x8\n\nQ: Why not Gohan?\nA: The character sprites were made by taking screenshots of character models in Garry's Mod. The only model for Gohan that anyone's ported to Gmod so far is a crappy fan-made model from 10 years ago.\n\nQ: What's up with Cell, Beerus, and Piccolo's voices?\nA: They've been placed over Bowser, DK, and Yoshi. Those characters only have 2 sound files each and the game just changes the pitch to create multiple voice lines.\n\nQ: What's going to be in the final version?\nA: Additional course textures, volume adjustments for some of the custom voices, and most importantly custom music if I can figure out why I can't get both custom characters and custom music into the same rom without it crashing the emulator.\n\nQ: Is there anything I can do to help?\nA: If anyone knows about getting custom music working with custom characters please post in the comments or in my Origami64 thread:\nhttp://origami64.net/showthread.php?tid=886\n\nI already have some .m64 files made and they work in-game but no matter what I do, they crash the game at the character select screen if I try to apply them to a rom with custom karts files in it.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R58ZL2RE9eY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R58ZL2RE9eY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R58ZL2RE9eY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Dragon Ball Kart 64 Beta Release", "description": "IMPORTANT: The rom requires the Expansion Pak/8MB memory to be turned on.
