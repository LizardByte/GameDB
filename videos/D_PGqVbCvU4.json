No emulation involved.\n\nDespite its rightfully earned notoriety, I can't help but love this game. It's shoddy in just about every respect, from the janky frame-rate to the ludicrous music, the box cat and triangle mouse and more, but it somehow rises above the sum of all of its parts to make something extremely simple and fun. \n\nI show each of the tracks in the standard race mode, as well as a quick round of the ball collecting game on each course at the end end of the video before the credits. \n\nI also show each of the secrets that I could remember - there well could be some that I've forgotten over the past several years, but I made sure to include the secret Todd's World track, the hidden Atari HQ building, the T-Rex, the castle with the moat around it, and a couple of other random things. I also made sure to chase the cat and the mouse to get super loud and distorted squeak and meow noises! \n\nAt a couple of points you will see a set of numbers and letters replace the speedometer in the bottom left of the screen. This is because I hit the 4 and 6 buttons to unlock some of the more cinematic camera angles that the game typically limits based on game mode. \n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D_PGqVbCvU4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D_PGqVbCvU4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D_PGqVbCvU4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D_PGqVbCvU4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Club Drive (Jaguar) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Atari's 1994 3D racing game for the Atari Jaguar, Club Drive. \n\nThe video was recorded directly from the console with a XCapture-1 card using composite cables.
