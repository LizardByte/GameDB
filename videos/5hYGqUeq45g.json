The demon knocking on the door wasn\u2019t part of his morning routine. Before Marty was able to open, the hell breed smashed in the doors. A fierce brawl commenced and Marty lost his right arm \u2013 but at least the demon also lost his head. Unfortunately, whilst the brawl erupted more demons entered his garage and stole his last batch of limited edition Walrus Ale (tm). Now Marty has become furious! He ripped off the demon\u2019s arm and did some DIY to re-attach his arm back to himself. This demon is no looker but gee it casts some nasty fireballs.

Like an unholy\u00a0child of Quake 3 and Super Meat Boy, SEUM is truly hardcore and focuses on speed and fast reactions. Race across and jump over platforms and bounce pads while shooting fireballs as you battle to\u00a0reach an exit portal in the minimum amount of time. Reverse time and gravity. Compete with all players for top times in the online high score ladder. Only the toughest players will receive the Uber Skull medals!\u00a0\n\nIf mind-blowing speed and adrenaline blasting its way\u00a0through your body seems too boring for your speed running blitzkrieg,\u00a0then search for the beer cans hidden in each level. Who knows which secrets can be discovered by finding all of these delicious refreshments?\n\nFEATURES\n- Can\u2019t get much more old school than this!\n- 100 levels, each more devilish than the last, with secrets around every corner.\n- Shoot fireballs, reverse gravity, teleport and dodge obstacles to solve challenges.\n- Leaderboards in each level so you can see how you fare against your friends (and enemies).\n- Original soundtrack that'll have you tearing through the levels with blazing speed.\n- \\m/\n- 666\n\nWarning: SEUM has been known to cause leaning disease. Symptoms are irrational leaning forward towards your screen when making difficult jumps.
