For the Hume, feeling the wrong emotion might cause an explosion or start a pandemic. For the Eoni, feeling any emotion at all could strip you of your immortality.

Kasper and his friends must dive into a world of technology, magery, politics, and ethical ambiguity to stop an almost unspeakable horror: the world\u2019s first genocide.\nWorld\n\nAVARIA is home to two intelligent species. The first were the Eoni: immortal, intellectual, and entirely incapable of feeling emotion. It was only a few thousand years ago that an Eoni finally stumbled upon an emotion and, in so doing, transformed themselves into the first Hume. The Hume \u2013 beautiful, sexual, magical creatures \u2013 have been willing to live under the rule of the Eoni ever since, following their laws in exchange for guidance\u2026 until now.", "summary": "In Avariavs, players choose a party of 3 heroes to battle against an opponent\u2019s party. During battle, opposing players choose their actions simultaneously and then witness the mayhem of their decisions. Combat rages on until one winner reigns victorious by decimating their opponent\u2019s HP to zero.\n\nBe warned however, matches that do not conclude promptly may be subject to judgement\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/avariavs"}
