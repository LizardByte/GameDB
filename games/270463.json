He brought more adventurism and fun to the story and added many new details and changes.\n\nThe story was adapted for film, theatrical productions, and the tale itself was published in the USSR 182 times, was translated into 47 languages, and reached a total circulation of 14.5 million copies.\n\nHow different is Tolstoy's version from Carlo Collodi's tale, so unique is the graphic version by artist Ekaterina Volzhina! She retains Tolstoy's entire plot, but brings it to modern Russia! Her story is told without a single word, but with incredibly beautiful illustrations and love for the source material.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/russian-pinocchio"}
