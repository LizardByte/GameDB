And each stage that you pick next will have higher rank and bosses will have more spellcards. \nSo for example the way this run is build up is:\nHakurei Shrine - Rank 0\nMoriya Shrine - Rank 1\nHakugyokurou - Rank 2\nScarlet Devil Mansion - Rank 3\nForest of Magic - Rank 4\nFinal Stage - Rank 5\n\nI picked Hakurei Shrine first because it's complete hell on high rank. \nIt's worth noting that you only need to beat three stages to access the final stage. If you go to the final level early it will be at a lower respective rank. So the earliest will be rank 3. \n\nThe player characters you can pick in this game are Ran and Mamizou. If you pick Mamizou as your character than Ran will be the final boss.\n\nThe system in this game seems to revolve around the green barrier. Once you fill up the green bar up you can unleash a very short bomb that turns all items into green items. The trick is timing it when a lot of items are on screen so that you can regain most of your green bar in an instant. \n\nI love how every single Touhou fangame these days has laser wheels in them. \n\nDownload for Danmakufu ph3:\nhttp://www1.axfc.net/uploader/so/2867499.zip", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mucvzgeuV6s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mucvzgeuV6s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mucvzgeuV6s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mucvzgeuV6s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mucvzgeuV6s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou \u5996\u602a\u72d0\u72f8\u5408\u6226 ~ War of Fox and Badger (Danmakufu) - Full Route Lunatic 1cc", "description": "Catastrophe War of Fox and Raccoon Dog is another entry in the line of Touhou fangames. \n\nIt doesn't show in the replay, but the way this game works is that you pick the order of the stages yourself.
