Across five savage, fully-animated tables, from the ricochet riot of Firestorm to the intense overload of Duke Nukem, Balls of Steel delivers all the authentic gravitational pyrotechnics of real pinball. View all the tables at once or get close for some whiplash scrolling action! Go gonzo with the 5 ball multi-ball mayhem! Squash scampering aliens to bloody oblivion! Hit rails, flippers, pops, sinkholes, targets, magnetic flippers, ramps, the 'cyclotron' ball accelerator -- every conceivable pinball feature in all its glory! Its authentic pinball action -- whiplash fast and finger-burning good! And hey, if it\u2019s good enough for Duke... then it\u2019s good for you!\n\nBalls of Steel is realistic, first and foremost, with real physics behind the ball movement and table obstacles. Each table behaves like you'd expect it to. On top of that, there are many special effects and table animations. Rock out to event-triggered music, and go wild about characters that speak during the gameplay, to you and to each other. Balls of Steel! More tables! More Duke! More balls!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 10345, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "tAMRUdMZc9Q"}]}
