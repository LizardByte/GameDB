The episode opens with a cut-scene of Mr. Blackstone (a.k.a. the G-man) arriving at Dr. Newell's office. As we soon discover, Dr. Newell has had Mr. Blackstone in his control all along, and has his own intentions for the exploitation of Xen's biological uniqueness. . .\n\nIts up to you, Gordon, to stop your evil colleague from unleashing the horror of Xen on humanity. . . if its not too late. . .", "summary": "Todesangst is a single player Half-Life modification, which follows an alternate timeline where the nuclear destruction of Black Mesa and the Seven Hour War never happened.\n\nGordon is back from Xen, and it's all business as usual.
