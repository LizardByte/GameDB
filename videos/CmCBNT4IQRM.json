You're tasked with fighting your way through a randomly generated alien world, trapped in an endless search for your ship\u2019s emergency distress beacon \u2014 your only hope to signal for rescue after crash landing.\n\nIn your search you\u2019ll not only find weapons and items to help you; you\u2019ll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. When you inevitably die, you\u2019re given the opportunity to integrate the DNA you've collected into your genome, allowing you to alter your statistics and gain gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next clone's life.\n\nBeacon aims to combine fast, frenetic action with ambient exploration, giving the player a rich world to scavenge on their mission to find rescue.\n\nFind out more about Beacon here:\nhttp://beacon.monothetic.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/MONOTHETIC\nhttps://www.facebook.com/monothetic\nhttps://soundcloud.com/beacon-ost\nhttps://discord.gg/UJqcWM6", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CmCBNT4IQRM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CmCBNT4IQRM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CmCBNT4IQRM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CmCBNT4IQRM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CmCBNT4IQRM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "BEACON First Access Trailer", "description": "Join us in our journey to take Beacon from First Access to Full Release!\n\nhttps://monothetic.itch.io/beacon\n\nBeacon is a sci-fi action roguelite that plays like a top-down shooter.
