Ragnald is saved by the accompanying wolf and must find his loved ones. The Viking and his companion are forced not only to survive but properly manage time, space, and energy to achieve the goal.\n\nEarly Middle Ages, 9th century, Eastern Europe. The Viking boats are drifting inland, looking for a convenient place for settlement. One of the greatest and the smartest warrior who was the leader of the expedition was Ragnald. Together with his wife as well as travel companions, they were looking for a safe land, rich in water, vegetation, and animals.\n\nHe was also accompanied by his faithful friend, Raga the wolf. It was supposed to be a peaceful voyage, but the expedition fell into an ambush set by women from the Kingdom of Women. Ruthless warriors captured women and killed all men. Almost everyone...\n\nWith the help of Raga, the wounded Ragnald survived, and with little strength left the wolfhound pulled him to the other side of the river. Just before he fainted, he noticed his beloved Tove among the captives. When he awoke, his faithful wolf was laying next to him, and apart from the voices of nature, there was no sign of the attackers or the captured women.\n\nThis is how Ragnald started his adventure into the unknown, through wild, dangerous areas, but also villages and settlements, though not always friendly. Raga's loyal companion will often prove to be a savior, rescuing him from wild animals, or helping in the hunt.\n\nRagnald and the wolf are facing a difficult path, the fight against the weather, wild forest, animals, fight for food, medicine, fight against hostile tribes... but the main motivation is to regain the loved one.\n\nBut once they reach the village of women, it turns out that this is not an ordinary village ... but let's not get ahead of oneself for now.", "summary": "While traveling to the East the Vikings fall into a trap.
