You assume the role of an experimental AI that maintains ship functions and engages with the crew on board. As you explore the mining colony, you will take on new missions, expand ships and bases using various modules, add survivors to your crew, engage in space fights, and repair the damage left by enemy fire and onboard accidents.\n\nJitter is designed as a linear game that tells an engaging sci-fi story but gives players the freedom to tackle each mission in any way they want. Need to eliminate an outpost? You can barrage it with cannon fire, infiltrate to take it over from the inside, or wipe out a nearby asteroid to watch the debris break its hull and deplete the oxygen within.\n\nA mysterious accident devastates a mining colony in the Main Asteroid Belt. Your programming tells you to find and rescue the survivors. It\u2019s up to you how to do it\u2026 or how to fail.\n\n\nFOLLOW JITTER ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nX: https://twitter.com/JitterGame\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/mucJ4UQ\nWebsite: https://jittergame.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIjMlIqJFQs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIjMlIqJFQs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIjMlIqJFQs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Jitter  - Indie Game Alpha Trailer", "description": "WISHLIST JITTER ON STEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877660/Jitter/\n\nJitter is an immersive sci-fi exploration and survival game set on a mining colony and its outskirts in the Main Asteroid Belt.
