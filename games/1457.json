The events of the game take place between the second and the upcoming third game, and fill the story gap between them. The story centers on the rebellion that has taken place in the Grasslands. It has been three months since the end of the Dunan Unification Wars. A legend telling about the Fire Brigands lead by the mysterious Fire Champion who united the Grassland nations is being spread around. Is the legend true, and can the Fire Champion, a holder of one of the 27 True Runes, be found? Nash, a special agent of Holy Kingdom of Harmonia's Southern Fringe Security Force, is sent to investigate the matter.\n\nYou take control over Nash' actions in a fashion similar to the one implemented in Japanese \"dating sims\" or some hentai games: reading the text, looking at the background images, and sometimes interfering and choosing the path on which the story should proceed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/genso-suikogaiden-volume-2-duel-at-the-crystal-valley", "collections": [{"id": 304, "name": "Suikoden"}]}
