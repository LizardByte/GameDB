The best ending is shown, since I didn't lose any matches. \n\nA pretty excellent playing port. It suffers a bit compared in some respects to the Genesis port because of the smaller ROM size (the SNES version is 32mbit/4mbyte, while the Genesis cart is 40mbits/5mbyte), it still retains just about everything that made the arcade original so good.\n\nThe only real negative in my mind here - this game was among the first of Capcom's SNES games that threw as much reverb at the music as possible, making the music pretty tinny and grating, and well below the quality of the music in SF2T (sound quality that is, I like Super's remixed versions of the music well enough).  At least it isn't as bad in SSF2T as it got in games like Final Fight 3 and Mega Man X2/X3. \n\n\n________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5VwfabLT4E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5VwfabLT4E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5VwfabLT4E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5VwfabLT4E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Street Fighter II (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1994 Super Nintendo versus fighter, Super Street Fighter II.\n\nPlayed through with Cammy on the highest difficulty level.
