Instead the story dictates which character is controllable. And although the game is a classic point and click adventure, it uses optimized controls to work for both PC and consoles. While the interaction with items on screen still work through a context-sensitive cursor, the player now moves the characters around directly instead of giving them move to-orders. Besides this change, the player still goes around the various locations, talks and interacts with people and collects everything that isn't nailed to the wall in order to solve the different riddles and advance the storyline.", "summary": "Wallace & Gromit in The Last Resort is the second episode of Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures.\n\nWallace & Gromit are finally ready for some vacation. Sadly before they go the water main bursts and the cellar get's flooded. And to make things worse, after the leak has been dealt with the weather changes and it starts to rain heavily. Of course Wallace wouldn't be Wallace if he didn't think of an alternative: If they can't go to the beach, why not bring the beach to them? With all the water already in the cellar, only a few more ingredients are missing. After everything is finished, Wallace also senses a new business idea: West Wallaby Street's Waterworld.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures-episode-2-the-last-resort", "videos": [{"id": 32235, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5kgMwW5rDwc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kgMwW5rDwc", "title": "Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kgMwW5rDwc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
