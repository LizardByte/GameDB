In the beginning of the game, Blade can only punch the guards, but your team members Abigail and Hannibal King will provide new weapons: a gun with silver bullets, a sword and a throwing weapon. Not all weapons work equally well on all enemies, so you will need to use them strategically. Health can be replenished with syringes scattered around. To progress, you often need to find computer terminals to unlock doors. These entrances can also be blocked with furniture to hinder incoming enemies. A mini-map in the top left corner shows your position and objectives at all times.", "summary": "In this Marvel-licensed game you are Blade: half human, half vampire, and a feared vampire hunter. You need to track humans collaborating with the vampires, and then take on the creatures themselves with your gang of Nightstalkers - human vampire hunters. Vampire leader Danica has resurrected Drake, the original vampire, and they plan to use his blood to make all vampires immune to daylight. The action is shown with a top-down perspective as you move Blade through different locations. In the beginning of the game, you are locked up because you have killed a human disguised as a vampire. You soon discover that your interrogators, Chief Reede and Dr. Vance, are slaves of the vampires themselves.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blade-trinity", "videos": [{"id": 133161, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HYI_T9Vo-YY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYI_T9Vo-YY", "title": "[100%] Blade: Trinity (Java) v 1.0.2 - Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HYI_T9Vo-YY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
