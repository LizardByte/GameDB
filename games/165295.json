The game always pits one player playing against another (or against a computer). Your objective is to darken and dull out your opponent's colors and end the game with the brighter overall colors. Each player begins the game with a number of hexagonal pieces each with a different color and random number of outward-pointing arrows. Each turn, a colored piece is placed on the board. If a piece is placed on a space with one of the piece's arrows pointing at a previously placed piece, then the piece being pointed at will change color (and already placed pieces with arrows facing in the correct position will \"retaliate\" against the piece just played). When \"attacked,\" a piece will darken. The greater the color difference between the interacting pieces, the more attacked pieces will darken. A slider at the bottom of the screen indicates which player has the overall brightest colors and is thus winning. There is also a color wheel players can consult at any point during gameplay when strategizing.", "summary": "Live the experience of being a painter. Drawing from the process of mixing colors on a palette, Sature offers an engrossing turn-based strategy game. Each turn, players place colored tiles on the board. These tiles mix with neighboring colors to create new tactical situations and opportunities for inventive play. The result is a chess-like dance where players rely on their wits to outmaneuver their opponent. When the board is complete and a game is finished, a unique palette emerges from the way the colors have mixed as they were played on the board.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 53695, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-7TlN6sO-nw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7TlN6sO-nw", "title": "Sature Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-7TlN6sO-nw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
