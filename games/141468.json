The text and 3D modes have been completely revised and made clearer and more user-friendly. Buyers of the previous version were offered an inexpensive exchange for the new edition. This edition was considered a kind of compensation for the fans; shortly before Christmas 2003, Ascaron released a free fan patch that integrated some of the features requested by fans into the game."}
