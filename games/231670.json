Get ready for this fun new version of Millipede! Defend yourself in Millipede 5200!", "summary": "Millipede 5200 is an unreleased version of Millipede which happens to be the most accurate version to that of the original arcade. Sadly was never released due to it's arcade version's poor performance. Originally slated to be releasing in March of 1984, however it can be assumed that not only did the poor performance in it's arcade versions caused it to never be released, but also due to the fact that the 5200 was a commercial flop due to it's lack of innovation in the technology it had built within it, along with it's awful controller, and lack of exclusives worth playing. Another factor most likely was due to Atari's reputation after the Video Game Crash of 1983.\nMillipede 5200 is tragic victim of Atari, being the most accurate emulation of the Arcade experience except with a more of the Home Console touch of quality worth experiencing.\n\nThe game was later released as part of Atari compilations.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/millipede--4"}
