The story is that Bobby has to clean his room, and he has daydreams when he starts cleaning certain parts of his room. This game appears to be complete, and it is possible to finish the game without any issues. It isn't a very long game, though, and can be beaten in less than an hour. There is a split between platforming and shooting levels.\"\nMore Info: https://snescentral.com/article.php?id=0119", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD2Vf5c0Dms/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD2Vf5c0Dms/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD2Vf5c0Dms/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD2Vf5c0Dms/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD2Vf5c0Dms/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bobby's World - Unreleased SNES Game - Longplay", "description": "\ud83c\udd82\ud83c\udd84\ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udd82\ud83c\udd72\ud83c\udd81\ud83c\udd78\ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udd74 to my other channel:\nhttps://youtube.com/@DoujinGamesPlay\n\n\"This is a prototype Bobby's World, an unreleased game by Hi Tech Expressions, which was based off the cartoon of the same name.\nThis game is based on the Howie Mandell cartoon of the same name.
