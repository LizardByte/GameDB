Their main purpose is to provide a more challenging game experience while not artificially limiting the player. The premier feature of Rutile Ruby and Star Sapphire is the ground-up redesign of Pok\u00e9mon Trainers in the world to increase the game\u2019s challenge. Every trainer in the game has been edited, and the level curve expects use of the Experience Share, which means that you level up very quickly. You should be hitting Level 100 by the time you get to the Elite Four.\n\nThe secondary focus of RR/SS is to function as a sort of \u201c20XX Hack Pack\u201d where everything obtainable is 100% legal for real online battles, and some features are designed to make preparing competitive teams much less of a hassle.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-rutile-ruby"}
