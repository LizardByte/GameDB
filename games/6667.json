To move the ball the playfield needs to be tilted. In the Wii version, tilt the Wii Remote (or lean on the Wii Balance Board) and the playfield will move. The ball is fragile; don't let it fall too far. Don't touch deadly obstacles like spikes or acid pools.\n\nThere are 64 levels to complete (60 levels for the iPhone version) and 25 goals to accomplish. The difficulty of the game adjusts itself according to player skill. There are 5 special balls with different abilities (rubber ball, paper ball, steel ball, ... ) Some balls are more fragile than others. Each level has its own high scores. There are five game modes, from a general unlock level-per-level conquest mode to the much harder Challenge levels. Levels can be skipped optionally. The Wii version includes two multiplayer modes with up to four players simultaneously.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/equilibrio", "videos": [{"id": 26398, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "WqxB1sfK83k"}]}
