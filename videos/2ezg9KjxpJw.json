{"id": "2ezg9KjxpJw", "snippet": {"title": "Rayman 4 Leaked Build - Gameplay", "description": "Best Christmas gift ever. Merry Christmas everyone!\n\nThis is, finally, Rayman 4. A build from 2008 featuring many test levels and a surprising amount of functional mechanics. It is rather buggy as is to be expected, and it may crash or run too fast on good enough hardware. The levels are simply selected from a list, and you can't really \"complete\" any of them, no level transitions or anything of the sort appear to be implemented yet. I couldn't get it to play any audio, but certain maps appear to test footstep sounds, and one of the debug menu mentions music, so it might be that I'm missing required hardware or the included build is indeed mute.\n\nMany of the levels also crash on load unfortunately, so they can only be seen in the editor (which I couldn't get working, always froze when loading the project).\n\nThis is a short video compilation featuring footage of around 7 levels. I tried picking the more interesting ones, the ones resembling actual gameplay the most. Very few are like this though and the vast majority are test levels for individual mechanics.\n\nVery low quality footage.
