Rousseau the Thief), you take the role as a thief who is trying to hide from the police. Rousseau has one very tricky ability, which is to change the shape and look of his face. By drawing images on the Nintendo DS touch screen, you can adapt Rousseau to the current surroundings and thereby evade his chasers. For example, you can draw a picture of a girl to throw off the cops when in a crowd or quickly sketch what's on a nearby wall to blend in with the background.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
