{"id": "a_cfMrrsPjM", "snippet": {"title": "Northbury Grove: King's Comfort | Survival Horror Game", "description": "Just 3 miles up Route 20 from the postponed Rock the Warehouse festival stands King's Comfort. This retro resort motel features a beautiful view of the Zakeenian mountains, an indoor pool-house with saunas, a cozy local bar called \"The Bard's Tavern,\" and 12 luxuriously quaint rooms. Sure, this motel might not have the fanciest rooms, but the solitude is...to die for.\n\nTrevor is waking up from a crazy few days of partying. He collects his bearings despite a pounding headache and uneasy gut. Where did all his friends go? Did they all head to the festival to start setting up? And why hasn't he heard from his sister Crystal, or their friend Connor? They're supposed to be meeting Grace at the festival grounds...\n\nTrevor needs to get in touch with his sister. So off he goes into the night. But where is everyone? King's Comfort is eerily empty...\n\nWe're glad to present King's Comfort, our second game! This takes place during (and after) the events of Northbury Grove. Trevor is waking up as the slasher stalks Connor in the parking lot. This game is inspired by retro horror movies. Big inspirations this time around would be The Hitcher, Duel, Psycho, and even No Country For Old Men. We hope you enjoy this second glimpse into the Scythe Saga universe!\n\nKing's Comfort motel: discount rooms with a view to DIE for....\n\nGAME\nhttps://scythedevteam.itch.io/kings-comfort\nSCYTHE DEV PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/ScytheDevTeam\nSCYTHE DISCORD\nhttps://discord.gg/XgErdnm\nOFFICIAL HOMEPAGE\nhttp://www.scythesaga.com/Home\nSCYTHE SAGA RECORDS\nhttp://www.scythesaga.bandcamp.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_cfMrrsPjM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_cfMrrsPjM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_cfMrrsPjM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_cfMrrsPjM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_cfMrrsPjM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Northbury Grove: King's Comfort | Survival Horror Game", "description": "Just 3 miles up Route 20 from the postponed Rock the Warehouse festival stands King's Comfort.
