It's built off of RPG Maker 2003. It's basically a spiritual successor to Jack to the Future, one of @jacksfilms's most infamous videos. I do not claim to be a video editor, I am not a very good video editor at all, and this is edited very poorly, but uhhhh yeah, just kinda wanted to throw something together.\n\nPlay the demo here! It's around 40% of what the full game's length will be.\nhttps://rbxgemini.itch.io/jack3thefuture\n\nMusic is a remixed version of Jacksfilms's \"Twitter for Android\" that's used in J3TF.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujZcM-DSamA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5-C9r4lan7o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5-C9r4lan7o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5-C9r4lan7o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5-C9r4lan7o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Jack 3 The Future Trailer", "description": "Erm, THAT just happened.\n\nThis is the trailer for my upcoming Jacksfilms RPG fangame called \"Jack 3 the Future\".
