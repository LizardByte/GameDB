The player can either beat a level by removing all bricks from the screen or finish a valid Mahjong hand by collecting the falling bricks that turned to Mahjong pieces. In the original arcade version the player is rewarded with a picture of an anime-style girl in a sexy outfit after each level. These bonus pictures have been removed from the Nintendo Famicom version.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jongbou"}
