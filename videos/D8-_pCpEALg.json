The player uses a paddle at the bottom of the screen to reflect a ball that bounces around the screen. The screen is constantly being filled with bricks and the idea is to destroy these by hitting them with the ball. If the ball goes past the paddle the player loses a life. He has three lives in total. The goal is simply to get as many points as possible. There is no end to it as new bricks are continuously added to the screen.
