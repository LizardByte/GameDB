Although this game never went outside Japan, it still managed to reach over 3.9 million download counts.\n\nThe game's main focus is the \"Success Mode\", which is a game mode where you create your own character while advancing through one of several story modes, developing his baseball stats until you finally get to use the character freely after you've completed the Success Mode. All the stories are high school-themed, with the Koshien Stadium's tournament as the goal.\n\nAlso available are free play and Pennant Race modes to put your Pawapuro-kuns in, as well as competitive matches between players.\n\nAs a Japanese mobile game, you can open gachapon/loot boxes to unlock new characters. You can choose which ones will be featured into any of the Success Mode scenarios as CPU-controlled allies and then change your character's default skin to one of them after clearing a scenario.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jikkyou-pawafuru-puroyakyu--1", "collections": [{"id": 8500, "name": "Jikkyou Pawafuru Puroyakyu"}]}
