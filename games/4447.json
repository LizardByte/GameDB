Members of the underworld killed my family and got away with it. I'm settling the score.\n\nAnd I get paid to do it. A clandestine group finances my missions because I accomplish what the justice system can't. I eliminate drug dealers, expose corruption - I terrorize the terrorists themselves. I'm a professional vigilante, and I work in Manhattan, where many consider me a hero.\n\nBut I've got enemies. One of them is seven feet tall and weighs 450 pounds. His name is Kingpin and he's New York's undisputed head of organized crime. I've terminated his best assassins time and time again.\n\nNow I've got a chance to nail Kingpin himself. For $500,000, an informant will reveal the fat man's location. It's a limited-time offer, so I've got to act now. If I can complete enough missions, should be able to raise the money.\n\nHalf a million bucks. That means a lot of overtime.", "summary": "EVIL CAN RUN, BUT IT CAN'T HIDE!\n\nLeft for dead when his family accidentally stumbled on a Mob hit, Frank Castle refused to die.
