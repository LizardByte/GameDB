Furthermore, we add a lot of fancy elements, like leaping grand canyons and hunting deer. While  \nskiing, players try their best to avoid obstacles including dynamic ones to ski as far as they can and speed also plays an import role in your final score. \nYou can sit down to play the game if you feel a bit sick."}
