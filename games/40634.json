The cartridge won't do much without the tapes. At the beginning of each game, Actual Factual Bear takes off while you control Brother Bear on his unicycle. Avoid the boulders and cross the bridge to reach one of the games, chosen by the particular tape you are listening to. The games are: \nBig Number Hunt: Catch the correct numbers as they fall from the tree \nGreat Letter Roundup: Catch the correct letters as they fall from the tree \nSpooky Spelling Bee: Spell a word by catching the letters falling from the tree", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
