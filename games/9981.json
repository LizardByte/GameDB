Like in a FPS, you can prone, crouch, switch active weapons, throw grenades, and loot corpses. Soldiers in Apox have limited ammo, but ammo sharing is done seamlessly. Soldiers can be placed in vehicles, and this essentially lets you create your own unit designs. Apox keeps everything that makes RTS great like making bases, controlling strategic sites, and managing your resources.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/apox"}
