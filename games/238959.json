A group of people interested in the mysterious events that happened in The Popgoes Pizzeria and Freddy Fazbear's Pizza creates an internet forum, where they theorise about these events, often coming to the false conclusions, just to keep the story going. They decide to create a movie in a warehouse, they changed into a Production Studio, based on their fake stories.\n\nThey create their own versions of the Popgoes' and Freddy's animatronics, X Animatronics. They weren't accurate, they were malformed, designed to scare the audience. Later, Popgoes Encore and Freddy Encore were possessed by Fritz Glade and Mike Schmidt Jr.. They killed every worker, and stuffed them in the animatronic, they were working on, except the player.\n\nNow, he has to survive the single night, and run from the Production Studio, when everything is over. To survive, he needs to create barricades that will stop the animatronics until they use all the power from the solar powered generator.", "summary": "Popgoes Encore was a scrapped sequel to Popgoes 2015 conceptualised in late 2015. It never reached a coding phase and it only had one fully \"finished\" model, made by Gunkystuff, and a bunch of Concept Art made by Pan Darcy and Pokefan993.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popgoes-encore"}
