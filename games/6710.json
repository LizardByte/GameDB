The victor is unknown, although it is implied Chun-Li won, as the child is returned.\nNecro vs. Twelve - Upon learning the Necro and his female companion, Effie, survived the events of 2nd Impact, Necro's successor, Twelve, is ordered by either Gill or Urien to hunt down and exterminate them. While the official outcome of this battle is unknown, Necro's ending reveals that he and Effie likely survived the encounter. Twelve, in the meantime, is returned to Dr. Woo's lab to recuperate, and it is hinted that he has gained sentience, as his hollow eyes gain red irises.\nAkuma vs. Oro - Both have fought each other after an encounter, but declared to cease combat as there was no clear winner and both believed that a mutual death would occur had they continued.", "summary": "Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike is the second follow-up to Street Fighter III. The game increased the character roster by adding five new characters and also added further refinements to the previous game's play mechanics and rules. All the returning characters from the previous Street Fighter III games were given new stages, endings, and voice actors for certain characters, continuing the overall storyline from where the first two games left off.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike", "videos": [{"id": 36663, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Vz4d2Gl3NbM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz4d2Gl3NbM", "title": "Arcade Longplay [373] Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vz4d2Gl3NbM/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70371, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "f_TVw9u0WW0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_TVw9u0WW0", "title": "Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future - Arcade Intro - HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f_TVw9u0WW0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
