Michael is a bit miffed at this to say the least, and pausing only to jump into his Smooth Criminal designer gear, decides to risk five levels of Mr Big's domain in an effort to rescue the kids and bring Mr Big to justice. Hooray!\n\nThere's four rounds to each level and in each, Michael has to run around the platform environment dishing out magical death to any crony that decides to cross his path. Our hero must search the level, opening doors and moving scenery to find and rescue the kids. When all the kids have been safely rescued, Mr Big appears and sends some of his most terrifying henchmen to try and dispatch Michael.\n\nWhen they're safely out of the way, it's on to the next round with yet more kids to rescue. Each level has its own Michael soundtrack, including the funky Smooth Criminal, Beat It and Bad!", "summary": "Michael Jackson's Moonwalker involves the player controlling the pop star in a quest to save all the kids that have been kidnapped by Mr. Big.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on finding children, who are scattered throughout the levels, some behind objects such as doors.\n\nThe game's levels and music were borrowed from the 1988 Michael Jackson film \"Moonwalker\" (though many of the music tracks were taken from Jackson's Thriller album as well) and the player has the ability to destroy enemies by making them dance.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/michael-jacksons-moonwalker--2"}
