They switch sides when they are convinced that their side is better at throwing giant tiles in a temple like structure.", "summary": "Slide-A-Lama is a two player 2D strategy/puzzle game. The goal is to collect most points by matching at least three tiles of the same type in a five-by-five grid. Players take turns to insert their current tile in one of the rows or columns. If a column is full, the bottom most tiles is crushed, if a row is full, tile falls at the opposite end out of the grid. Once three or more tiles of a kind form a line, the player is awarded points depending on type and number of tiles. With each 60 points of difference between the two players, one of the ten lamas switches the side. The game ends once the first player has all the lamas on their side.\n\nThe game became popular as a flash game ICQ users could play against their contacts. It later appeared on several mobile platforms and as a website.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slide-a-lama"}
