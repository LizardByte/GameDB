A remarkable journey from Spain, across the Mediterranean, to distant Africa; a quest to save his own soul and lives of those he holds most dear. \n\nTwo brothers operate a workshop that is well ahead of its time in Barcelona of 1514. It's the time of the golden epoch of the Renaissance, a time of discoveries and inventions; but also the brutal age of the Inquisition. \n\nOne brother puts all his efforts into building a flying machine, while the other dreams of Egypt and mysterious art treasures. The advanced ideas and exotic fantasies weaved by the pair arouses the suspicions of the Grand Inquisitor. \n\nQuite suddenly their small world is turned upside down as one brother is taken away by the Inquisition; leaving the other  alone to search for answers that will set his imprisoned sibling free. \n\nExplore the ravishingly beautiful and detailed locations of this remarkable adventure as you become immersed in this mysterious medieval tale and solve a unique combination of puzzles, mini-games, and other challenges that are perfectly integrated within this breathtaking storyline. \n\nEvade further attacks by the inquisition, and forge strong alliances with those you meet along the way.  Trek across different countries and cultures and eventually to the legendary desert city of ZERZURA, where an ancient terror guards over powerful secrets - and poses the greatest challenge of all.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
