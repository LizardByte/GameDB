The mod itself is based on the site 4chan and its culture. There are also bonus materials, such as the original \"Epic Frustration\" comic series by 3 Angled Blue, which can be read by going to the \"3AB Comics\" section in the mod's main menu. In this mod, Boyfriend and Girlfriend insert a rhythm game disk into a PC, which transports them to the website known as 4chan, unaware that they have been caught in a scheme by Daddy Dearest.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/friday-night-funkin-vs-slash-v-slash"}
