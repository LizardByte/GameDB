The light tactical fighter is an upgraded version based on previous F-5A developments. The F-5s\u2019 combat role encompasses air superiority, ground support, and ground attack. Given its mission flexibility, ease of operation, and low cost, the Tiger II has and continues to serve air forces across the globe. \n\nThe F-5E has trapeziform wings, two turbojet engines equipped with afterburners, and tricycle landing gear. Pitch, roll, and yaw control systems are hydraulically actuated in order to relieve control stick and rudder pedals forces. Artificial feel system is built in pitch and roll control systems to simulate aerodynamic loads for the pilot. For example: after the landing gear is retracted, left and right movement of the control stick is limited by a spring mechanism to prevent excessive roll rates.\n\nA pressurized cockpit and air conditioning system ensures pilot safety at all altitudes up to the service ceiling. The pilot is also provided with an oxygen mask and anti-g suit. The cockpit is fitted with a Martin Baker SIII S-3 ejection seat, two UHF radios, automatic direction finder, radio navigation system, and a standard set of navigation lights. Landing-taxi lights are located on the underside of each engine inlet duct are extended together with the landing gear. The cockpit canopy provides a superb in-flight view appropriate for air-to-air operations.\n\nThe F-5\u0415 is armed with two 20-mm \u041c39-\u04103 cannons with 280 rounds per each cannon. The cannons are located in the nose section, forward of the cockpit. Special deflectors are used to avoid compressor stall conditions caused by hot gas ingestion as a bi-product of operating the M-39-A3. Each cannon is capable of firing at a rate of 1500 to 1700 rounds per minute.\n\nEach wingtip incorporates a launcher rail capable of firing AIM-9 infrared-guided missiles.\n\nFive hard points (one centerline pylon and four underwing pylons) allow the aircraft to carry different types of air-to-ground weapons (bombs, cluster munitions, and rockets) 6,400 pounds (about 3000 kg) in total. In addition, illumination ammunition and cargo containers can be attached. To increase flight duration and range, external fuel tanks can be attached to three hard points (a centerline pylon and two inboard pylons). Maneuverability and speed can be maximized in combat by jettisoning all external stores.\n\nKey Features of the DCS: F-5E TIGER II:\n\u2022 Professional Flight Model that accurately mimics the performance and flight characteristics of this legendary fighter\n\u2022 Highly detailed, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) cockpit\n\u2022 Interact with cockpit controls with your mouse\n\u2022 Fully modelled weapon system\n\u2022 Accurate F-5E model with multiple country markings\n\u2022 Detailed modelling of the F-5E instruments, engine, radios, fuel, electrical, and hydraulic systems\n\u2022 Single missions and full set of training missions will be created while in Early Access\n\u2022 Full and Quick Start manuals in Russian and English languages\n\u2022 Extended Campaign for the F-5E by Maple Flags Missions Developer (not included in the module package)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Un32oyrXud0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Un32oyrXud0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Un32oyrXud0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Un32oyrXud0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Un32oyrXud0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DCS: F-5E Tiger II Teaser", "description": "Pre-purchase from: http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/shop/\n\nThe F-5E was developed by Northrop Corporation in early 1970s.
