It has a new compilation of songs: \"HIBIKI TurquoiseBlueMIX\". While the rest of the original mixes contain the idols' image color, Hibiki's image color (light blue) is replaced with \"Turquoise Blue\". This volume also marked Ai Hidaka's second HD appearance, featuring her in a special mode of the game. This mode allows players to take pictures of her while wearing the \"Exercise Wear NEO\" costume and allows them to listen to her sing the BGM music. Another unique option for this volume is the ability to add the accessory \"Heartbreak Glasses\" to the \"Rough Time School\" costume.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-idolmaster-gravure-for-you-vol-7"}
