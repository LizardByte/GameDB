Sixteen college girls will conveniently be at his disposal. His aging uncle, Larry Laffer, from the original games, provides brief advice and appears at a local bar. Larry also must outsmart a sorority house and a fraternity house, known as Dio, where they recite lines that are actually modified lyrics of Black Sabbath songs.\n\nA brief subplot involves the college's arena football team going against a rival team known as the Maiming Maggots.

The final scene shows the team name is actually the Flaming Fantasticks after the Swingles van leaves the school.", "summary": "Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude is a 2004 video game, part of the Leisure Suit Larry series.
