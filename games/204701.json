All of tech, magic and adventure aspects can be found in this pack but it's focusing mainly on adventure. At the same time, the modpack aims to completely change your Minecraft gaming experience, instead of boring grinding, you enjoy the process while making your way to the final goal.\n\nThe modpack is named GreedyCraft because it's for the greedy modpack searchers that are never satisfied with the amount of features a modpack can provide!\n\nIf you have ever attempted to add all of your favorite mods together but then give up because they keep crashing and don't work together, this modpack is definitely for you. The amount of mods does not make the modpack sound any better, the main point is to make this big amount of mods to work together and form a clear route that the player can follow to gain progress and fun constantly, instead of facing a lot of mods and don't know what to do. That's what GreedyCraft aims to do - we stage the mods behind a progression system and a questline so the player can clearly know what to do. We make boring and repetitive work that is found in almost every mod optional, and simplify the non-optional ones, so the player don't immediately get boring at the moment they look at the recipes. We also aim to produce chemical reactions between mods, which means when some mods are put together they can provide unexpectedly good results, the third person mode in this modpack is an example. Additionally, we add tons of customized stuff, QoL changes and graphic improvements to make you feel completely different from other modpacks.\n\nIn short, this modpack isn't about putting a lot of mods together and make sure it can run. It's optimized, and heavily modified, adding lots of new custom content and balancing all of the mods together. We aim to make all of these mods work together and form a unique progression system, associations between mods are not just recipes, but in many different ways.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/greedycraft"}
