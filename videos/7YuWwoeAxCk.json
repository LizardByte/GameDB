Functioning in he same way of enhancement chip for the system like the DSP and SFX chip, It allows streaming of both audio and video onto regular Super Nintendo / Famicom games. And what better way to demomstrate that same chip power by porting Data East's driving Laserdic 1985 classic \"Road Blasters\" into the SNES? That was exactly what dforce3000 and although what you are about to see is played on emulator (only bsnes and higan support this), the SD2SNES flash cart supports the MSU-1 and this will run on your real hardware SNES! Enjoy a few minutes of gameplay. Stunning animation, stunning music and the usual, early CD-rom based interactive gameplay. Would this be how games would be on Sony's cancelled SNES Super CD? Yes indeed! That was byuu's intentions when developing the chip. Enjoy!\n\nMore on the MSU-1: http://helmet.kafuka.org/msu1.htm\n\ndforce3000: http://www.dforce3000.de/\n\nbyuu's homepage: http://byuu.org/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7YuWwoeAxCk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7YuWwoeAxCk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7YuWwoeAxCk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7YuWwoeAxCk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES MSU1 Super Road Blaster", "description": "byuu of bsnes and higan fame developed back in 2012 the MSU-1 add-on chip for the Super Nintendo.
