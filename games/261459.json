Difficulty starts low and gradually builds through this set as your journey unfolds across a planet lost to Hell 25 years ago. Will this be the mission that finally defeats the demons? No jumping or crouching, please! Do feel free to use mouse look (I do), and if gameplay mods are your thing, go ahead - this should be compatible with everything. The megaWAD is designed for continuous play, but every map is beatable from pistol starts if that's how you prefer to do things!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/25-years-on-earth"}
