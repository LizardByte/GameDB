Unlike KEYBOARDMANIA, all the songs in KEYBOARDMANIA 2ndMIX have song comments on the official website for the game. LIGHT difficulty is introduced, which is a more simple difficulty that only uses 13 keys instead of 24. NORMAL is renamed LIGHT+. PRESSURE mode is introduced, which consists of four song courses. The gauge starts at 100%, but does not recover from any MISSes, even between songs. Videos for returning KEYBOARDMANIA songs were changed to generic videos that use various KEYBOARMANIA song clips.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/keyboardmania-2ndmix", "videos": [{"id": 19242, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "XZgbL-2487E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZgbL-2487E", "title": "KEYBOARDMANIA 2ndMIX - Game Playing & Ending", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZgbL-2487E/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3528, "name": "Bemani"}]}
