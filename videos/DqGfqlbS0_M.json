Dirty (no default settings), nub (Easy Moodo and not knowing WHAT the hell to do), non-perfect (didn't fight all of Stage 2 boss forms.) 1CC.  I did try to record Normal with Crueltear after completing the game with Exelica, but I gave up on the first stage. -_-  I also go for the True Ending, which demands spawning Faintear in Stage 1 and Stage 3, which demands having a high Item Counter.  Maybe when I get better at this game (which will be never), I will reupload it on Normal difficulty.  I STILL can't get all the boss forms in Stage 2. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqGfqlbS0_M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqGfqlbS0_M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqGfqlbS0_M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqGfqlbS0_M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqGfqlbS0_M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Xbox 360 Longplay [081] Triggerheart Exelica", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed By: Tsunao \n\nShmup by Warashi.\n\nSomething about a war, a portal, and some robot girls.
