You are all alone and have to fight against the enemy soldiers who keep appearing from almost everywhere. \n \nYou will fight through the marshes, the tropical forest & the clearing by the temple to attempt to prevent you from reaching your goal - to reach the base at Khe Sanh and free the soldiers from the enemy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
