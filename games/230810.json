It has 86 built-in games, the majority of them being regular Mega Drive games, with some licensed from Namco and Taito, but also includes four ports of mobile games originally by Electronic Arts, as well as various original games that were also seen on other similar \"consoles on a chip\", and does not have a cartridge slot for playing other games. It also comes with two control pads which attach to the console via two DE-9 ports, as they would a traditional Mega Drive."}
