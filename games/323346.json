It's a short top-down game with a surreal look. The goal is to find items hidden in the worlds you reach. The game is focused on exploration, so you'll have to interact with the level to find. There's a planets order, so keep this in mind. The game has two states: When you're in the planets and when you're in the spaceship. The spaceship controls quick, while the cowboy controls at a slower pace.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sycamore--1"}
