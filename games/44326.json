It was never released outside of Japan.\n\nF-1 Pilot is a F1 racing game for the PC Engine, one that depicts the racing from the driver's seat of the vehicle. The player is able to select a car before a race, but they all appear to be functionally identical except for the color. The player can also choose to have engine noises or BGM, but not both. Selecting either of the BGM modes will disable all sound effects from the game, including tire screeching and crashing noises.\n\nThe game has some odd uses of English (the game was never fully localized into English): For instance, it refers to F1 drivers as \"pilots\" and the title screen affirms that the player is the King of Kings.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-pilot"}
