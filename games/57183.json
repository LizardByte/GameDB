The game focused mainly on rudimentary PvE gameplay, with a heavy emphasis on socializing. Players would explore the isometric world, discovering new places, completing quests, and acquiring gear. There were many secrets and hidden places, making the world feel enticing to explore.\n\nThe game also features a PvP Arena inside of the castle, in which players would queue into single-file lines to be transported to a free-for-all death match. There, 2-8 players would attempt to \"tag\" each other, timing attacks which would send opponents back to the line queue room. Sometimes players would organize tournaments in which the winners of arena battles would win prizes.\n\nThe main server is now offline, but there have been attempts to re-live the experience, through fan-made servers which either port the base game 1:1, or create a new world with new assets, inspired by the experience Endless once offered.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
