If you are unable to play with your pet there is a babysitter feature that does so until you return.\n\nPC Pup is the second half of the first volume in the series, alongside Splat! The Cat.\n\nOnce you name your pup, you are free to explore a handful of interactive rooms including a bedroom with a stereo, bathroom with medicine in case the pet gets sick, living room with a television, and a garden where your pet must be trained to 'do its business', as well as others. Little thought bubbles will appear over PC Pup's head indicating what he wants the player to give him, or how he is feeling.\n\nAt the end of the pets lifespan, you will see him shrink slowly and then be presented with an 'Angel's Certificate' with stats about the pet's care listed. You may then hatch your next pet and let the circle of life continue.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-pets-pc-pup"}
