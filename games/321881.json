But in the year 2035, the hospital became the scene of a series of crimes and suspicious experiments.\n\nPatients admitted to the hospital began to disappear mysteriously and some of them were found dead in strange circumstances. The hospital staff tried to keep it all quiet, but soon word spread that something terrible was happening there.\n\nThe rumors were that patients were being used as subjects for dangerous medical experiments and that some of them had developed strange abilities. Police were called in to investigate and found that hospital staff were conducting illegal and unethical experiments on patients.\n\nThe experiments included administration of drugs and hazardous substances and surgery without the consent of patients. The facility was closed immediately and staff arrested and tried. Patients who survived the experiments were discharged and transferred to other psychiatric hospitals where they received appropriate treatment.\n\nThe \"San Lucas\" hospital became an abandoned and mysterious place that many people avoided visiting. People said they could hear the screams and cries of patients who had been abused there. The legend of \"Saint Luke\" became a popular topic of conversation in the city and many wondered what had really happened there. Would there still be someone out there seeking revenge?", "summary": "The \"San Lucas\" psychiatric hospital, which was built in 1985 to help people with mental illnesses, became the scene of crimes and suspicious experiments in the year 2035.
