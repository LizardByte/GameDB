The game contains depictions of the real teams, stadiums, stats, and players that reflect their real life counterparts. The modes returning from the previous game include quick play, season, playoffs, spring training, and home run derby. One of the new modes is general manager mode. In this mode, players can draft, create, trade, call up, waive, release, and sign players. Another new mode is the manager mode. In this mode, players can check out scouting reports during the game, warm up relievers in the bullpen, and try to get their team to the World Series and hopefully win it.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mlb-2000", "collections": [{"id": 2669, "name": "MLB"}]}
