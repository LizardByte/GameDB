There doesn't seem to be a walkthrough I can find anywhere online so I got a copy of the PC version and created one.\n\nThis instalment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is probably the most faithful to the books - if you know the story it help substantially. This is generally much easier and shorter than the previous two, probably taking about the same time to complete as the Hobbit.\n\nThis was the quickest way I found to complete the game. Possibly you can do other stuff I haven't tried here. You can for instance take items of clothing of dead Orcs. In the books Frodo and Sam use this as a disguise - although here it is simply quicker to dodge the patrols as the game gives you a warning you can hear them coming.\n\nThe hardest part is probably finding your way through the Tower of Cirith Ungol and the Plateau of Gorgoroth. Several locations look identical and retracing your steps does not always get you back to location you came from previously - often attempting to leave by some routes simply returns you to where you are now. The best way to find the correct route is to drop items in your inventory to identify where you are - and create a map.\n\nPrevious games on the RZX archive:\nHobbit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9LuK5Tcgg\nLord of the Rings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUVLYsJyBnI&t=11434s\nShadows of Mordor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_NwPFiuwgA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgiWTXO4-yM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgiWTXO4-yM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgiWTXO4-yM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgiWTXO4-yM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KgiWTXO4-yM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Crack of Doom (1989 Lord of the Rings Text Adventure by Melbourne House )", "description": "I played the Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings and the Shadows of Modor text adventures on my ZX Spectrum as a child, but the final instalment, the Crack of Doom, was never released on that platform.
