It's controlled, though, using the keyboard or a gamepad, and is filled with examples from lots of genres, ranging from races in cars from the 20s to stealth, fighting and shoot \u2018em up missions.\n\nJohn, who has always had awful luck in every aspect of his life, finds himself one day heir of a successful casino from a distant relative. It seems that his luck has finally changed, but nothing further from reality: the Mafia is in charge of every casino in the area except for his, and now that his previous owner is dead, they are pushing to get hold of it. The game starts with John in jail, a consequence of the strings pulled by the Mafia itself.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/evil-days-of-luckless-john"}
