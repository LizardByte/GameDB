One such knight is Max, whose enthusiasm for combat is surpassed only by his love of rare and valuable loot.\n\nJoin Max as he battles hordes of evil (or just evil-looking) monsters, rescues a wealthy princess, and accumulates the loot and xp that make good worth doing. If Max suffers a defeat, never fear! He will return in the next game with all of his hard-won loot and experience levels intact."}
