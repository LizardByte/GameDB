The comedic meerkat and warthog team are \"going off on an adventure to broaden their horizons\", and wise old Rafiki advises them to bring along his keyboard. When they demur, Rafiki enjoins the player to assist them in their travels, and the typing tutorial begins.\n\nThe game employs standard practice routines, beginning with proper posture and placement of the fingers on the keys, followed by letter repetitions as each section of the keyboard is mastered. At first the exercises focus on accuracy, later working up to increasing the player's typing speed. Keyboard exercises are interspersed with mini typing games that become available as the player progresses:\n\nMilestones are rewarded with printable certificates, and Rafiki keeps a progress report of the player's WPM (words per minute) and accuracy statistics, as well as showing which keys the player needs to work on. There is a Ctrl + P option at the sign-in page that allows the unlocking of all the games and lessons.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-adventures-in-typing-with-timon-and-pumbaa", "videos": [{"id": 54439, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CzOEqqAwbvA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzOEqqAwbvA", "title": "Adventures in Typing with Timon and Pumbaa - Full Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzOEqqAwbvA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
