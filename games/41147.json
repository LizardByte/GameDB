To move between cogs you press the space bar at the point they meet. Holding down W will allow you to move the opposite way the cog is moving but here you move slower, releasing W allows you to travel faster the way the cog is moving. Some cogs have baddies on them and you must time your transfer to it without being hit by it. \n \nOn the screen you see a small part of the game area. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, lives, level and parts of the formula collected.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pi-r-squared"}
