The runestones are scattered through time and across the continents and you must find them before the Warlock does.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You go through different stages fighting of creatures and then finding the runestones. You fight off enemies by simply blasting them with this energy, using this orb you have with you, or you can use a spell to kill them. There are some puzzles in the game too. Some of the battles with the tougher enemies require some strategy to defeat them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warlock--1", "videos": [{"id": 86079, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ViM2nAO6EFE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViM2nAO6EFE", "title": "Warlock ~ Preview Trailer for Super Nintendo / Sega Genesis/ Megadrive (1995)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ViM2nAO6EFE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
