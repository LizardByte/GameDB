It's a life and death struggle that demands all your tactical genius and shoot-em-up know-how before you battle through to confront the four planetary Guardians. \n \nWith its vast bit-mapped graphics, superb animation, blistering sound, devilish obstacles, awesome firepower and 1 or 2 player options, Blood Money is the greatest challenge yet faced by any games player with a passport to outer space. \n \nBlood Money, It's here. It's in your trembling, sweaty hands. It's ready and waiting for you.
