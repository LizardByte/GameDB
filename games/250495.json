For those that still wish to live on this dead land, a temple was established. It was known as Saint Sheol of the Underworld.\n\nWith the help of a distant relative, I moved to the capital that I had longed to live in, and began work as a trainee priest at Saint Sheol.\n\nEvery day I endured pain and suffering in this unfamiliar land.

I knew the face of that angel.\n\nBefore the looming disaster stood 6 girls. Within the deepest corner of the temple was fear, miracles, love\u2026 and lust.\n\nHaving touched the darkest darkness the world has seen, one must now face the dazzling light.\n\nThus I pose this question.\nWhose wings did I see that day?", "summary": "Two thousand years ago, the Pestis Disaster swept through the land, corrupting all living things and making it too difficult to live on the land.
