We developed it entirely in a month in Unreal Engine 5 and it's based on a project we developed for the Mojam 2 charity drive in 2013.\n\nThe unique gameplay of LLC is designed to make matches feel intense and fast paced. To achieve this, the game ties health, ammo, stamina, and more, to a single resource: time. As the clock runs down you will need to act fast to eliminate other players but be careful, because even the act of firing your gun causes you to lose time and inch closer to death.\n\nBut time isn\u2019t the only thing that you\u2019ll have to keep an eye on. A crucial aspect of Low Light Combat\u2019s gameplay is, of course, light. Matches feature a rapidly changing day and night cycle, which means you\u2019ll frequently be competing in darkness. To combat the darkness you can launch flares, turn on your flashlight, and you even glow when firing your gun. However, all these helpful tools also make you a target for other players, who may be lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce.\n\nLow Light Combat is one of the first games to be developed for Unreal Engine 5 Early Access. It takes full advantage of Lumen, which powers the real time dynamic global illumination featured in the game, and Nanite, which enables an astounding level of detail in the geometry. As the game is available for free it allows players to demo these cutting edge features running in UE5 for themselves. Furthermore we also provided free access to the project files for anyone to learn from.\n\nTrailer Produced, Written, and Edited by\nJack 'Moz' Morris\n\nTrailer Quality Control\nRudolf Kremers\nLukas Orsv\u00e4rn\n\nABOUT THE CHANNEL\nAt Wolfire, we create innovative and experimental games, and share the lessons we learn to help make game development accessible to everyone. We're most known for our games Overgrowth and Receiver, and for our spin-off company Humble Bundle.\n\u2022 Subscribe - https://www.youtube.com/WolfireGames?sub_confirmation=1\n\u2022 Discord - https://discord.gg/Wolfire\n\u2022 Merchandise - https://wolfiregames.creator-spring.com\n\u2022 Twitch - https://twitch.tv/WolfireGames\n\u2022 Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/WolfireGram\n\u2022 Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/Wolfire\n\u2022 TikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@WolfireGames\n\u2022 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/WolfireGames\n\nABOUT THE GAME\nLow Light Combat is a free competitive multiplayer shooter where light is your only weapon.
