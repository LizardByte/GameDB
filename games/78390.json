The solution to her task may not be obvious and there will be times when you will have to place your life in the hands of the Gods if success is to be yours!", "summary": "A notoriously difficult platformer for Amiga and Atari ST, where you take the part of Yolanda, offspring of the mighty Hercules himself, cursed by Hera.\n\nThere are twelve tasks to complete and a trainer level, over fifty levels randomly selected.
