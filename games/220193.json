Notes are presented in a vertical-scrolling fashion from top to bottom and fall down in lanes; the player must hit these notes when they overlap the judgement line at the bottom to earn points.\n\nIt is notable for the dynamic nature of its lanes. Note lanes may move, widen, narrow, and may either disappear or extra lanes may spawn on the playfield.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/takumi-3"}
