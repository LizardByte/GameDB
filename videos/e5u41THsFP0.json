In this VR game, you can play on the virtual piano according to the visual instructions. You don't need to be a piano player at all. It's my first game and is still in development and will be released to public in May 2021. I would love to hear some feedback, if you have any questions or suggestions :)\n\nYou can find more information about this project here:\nhttps://vrpianist.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/VRPianist\n\nThank you for watching and have a nice day!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e5u41THsFP0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e5u41THsFP0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e5u41THsFP0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e5u41THsFP0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e5u41THsFP0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Piano in VR - The Entertainer by Scott Joplin on a virtual piano", "description": "This video is a recorded demo version of VRPianist app, developed by me :) (= a solo indie developer/student Tereza Preislerov\u00e1).
