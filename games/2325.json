In Colosseum Battle Mode, your goal is to battle your way through a series of Colosseums, each with its own set of rules and challenges.\n\nIn DS Battle Mode, two to four players can get together to watch their Pok\u00e9mon battle on the big screen while using their Nintendo DS systems as controllers. To participate in this mode, each player will need his or her own Nintendo DS and copy of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond or Pok\u00e9mon Pearl.\n\nThings get really interesting in Wi-Fi Battle Mode, which allows you to battle your friends over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection using Friend Codes. You can also square off against Trainers from around the world using Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution's Wi-Fi Rank system, which pits you against Trainers that have skill levels similar to your own.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-battle-revolution", "videos": [{"id": 3358, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "74bNxp1Citk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74bNxp1Citk", "title": "Pokemon Battle Revolution Nintendo Wii Trailer - 30", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/74bNxp1Citk/sddefault.jpg"}]}
