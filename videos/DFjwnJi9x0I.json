A co-ordinated team and individual skill leads to a swift victory.\n\nFirefight can have quick rounds if a team works together like this. All three objectives must be controlled, or eliminate all enemy, to win. Players only respawn when an objective is secured, so matches can last much longer if both teams manage to secure multiple times.\n\nRelease date is January 22nd, 2014 so this footage shows the game in Beta.\n\nBuy Insurgency here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/222880/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFjwnJi9x0I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFjwnJi9x0I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFjwnJi9x0I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFjwnJi9x0I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFjwnJi9x0I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Official Insurgency Gameplay: Firefight on Market", "description": "This is raw gameplay footage from a single round of Firefight on Market level.
