Here is your chance. \n \nBlind Wars is very similar to RISK, except that you cannot see your opponents' armies, nor can your opponents see yours. This makes for unpredictable outcomes to the game. This game is a four player game, where three of the players are computer-controlled. \n \nAlthough it is similar to RISK, you are not playing on a true world map. You play on a group of countries and you are trying to take control of the 77 cities. \n \nAlso in the game are various random occurrences that can affect the outcome of the game. Occurrences such as a city defecting to the enemy, or increased armies in a city or country happen randomly throughout the game making the game even more unpredictable.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blind-wars", "videos": [{"id": 17827, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "1kmCg3LT53w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kmCg3LT53w", "title": "Blind Wars - Gameplay video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1kmCg3LT53w/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
