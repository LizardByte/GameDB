It was published by Acclaim Entertainment and released on November 26, 2002 for both the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. It was then released later for the Xbox on December 5, 2002. Legends II contains 24 wrestlers that were not in the first game, though also excludes Rob Van Dam, presumably because he had recently been signed to a WWF contract. The game did contain Eddie Guerrero, however, who, although unemployed at the time he signed a likeness deal, re-signed with WWF when the game was released.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions included video interviews with many of the legends featured in the game while the European version of the game exclusively included four legends from the United Kingdom: Kendo Nagasaki, Big Daddy, Mick McManus and Giant Haystacks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legends-of-wrestling-ii", "videos": [{"id": 52191, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "d3ejUuw2QVg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3ejUuw2QVg", "title": "Legends of Wrestling II (PS2)(Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d3ejUuw2QVg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
