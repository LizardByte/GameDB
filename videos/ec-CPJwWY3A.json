This version of the mode has additional custom assets from the first basic one which was limited to cod4 only assets besides the custom mini map, and now a ton of MW3 assets are added to make the whole survival experience much closer to MW3! Source files for the MW3 Mod assets will be probably ready for upload a few days after this upload on the moddb page of the mode. If there are problems with the custom asset collection the upload will either take longer or in the worst case scenario, not take place at all.\n\nCredits:\n\nA ton of thanks to my very good online friend and programmer helper Scillman.\nMost of the features I implemented would either take too much time or never been\ncompleted if it wasn't for his valuable help.
