It's a game about mastering different monster behaviors and using them creatively in combat. \n \nYou will dive deep into different types of procedurally-generated dungeons, each with its unique difficulty, size and creatures. Death in each one means starting over from the very beginning of the dungeon, with no upgrades nor monsters in your loadout. But with death comes understanding and hidden knowledge of the dungeons' secrets. \n \nAs you master each unique creature, you will be able to optimize your strategy by exploiting their weaknesses when fighting against them, and leveraging their strengths when summoning them. Every creature you defeat can be added to your loadout, from a half-witted spider to the great Morthgaal.", "summary": "Rogue Summoner is a turn-based tactics roguelike about strategically conjuring monsters to fight in your stead.
