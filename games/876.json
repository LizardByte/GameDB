A grave new threat has arisen in the North, a threat that seeks to seal off the Ten-Towns from the rest of Faer\u00fbn in a bitter power struggle. The town of Bremen has fallen, and a vicious horde of goblins, orcs, and bugbears have gathered beneath the mysterious banner of the Chimera and are marching on the port town of Targos. Fearing that they will be overrun, Targos has sent out a call for all able-bodied adventurers, soldiers, and mercenaries to sail north to stand with the town\u2019s defenders against the encroaching horde. You and your companions have answered the call.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/icewind-dale-ii", "videos": [{"id": 2079, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VFPb33wXAy8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFPb33wXAy8", "title": "Icewind Dale II PC Games Trailer - Icewind Dale 2 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VFPb33wXAy8/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 706, "name": "VO Talent"}]}
