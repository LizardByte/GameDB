One button shoots the gun, the other allows the player to jump enemy bullets and other attacks. The 8-way joystick is used to specify the direction of movement, pointing down to crouch and the different up directions to indicate angle of the shot. At the start of the game, player must practice in the target practice room, then play through the next 7 stages to beat the game; however, the game will loop after the 7th stage is completed. In stages 1 thru 8, the object is to shoot a certain number of criminals and avoid shooting civilians. If the player is hit by an enemy or if the player shoots a civilian, the player will lose a life. When all lives are lost, the game ends. Besides criminals and civilians, some objects in the backgrounds of the seven stages can be shot to earn extra points, such as amusement park rides and signs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 54749, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hUMH9HfbZ6I"}]}
