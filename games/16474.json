Its story is unrelated to the original FINAL FANTASY, and its gameplay is a major departure from the previous title for eliminating the traditional experience-based progression system.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-ii--1"}
