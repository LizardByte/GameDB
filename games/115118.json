Use a complex conversational simulation system to interrogate and psychologically manipulate realistic suspects in a noir game about political radicalization and authority abuse.\n\nRich or poor, progressive or conservative, women or men, the Liberation Front's potent lure fills its ranks with people from all layers and corners of society. They want to violently dismantle social order as we know it and to rebuild it from the ground up. Can you stop them? Will you stop them?\n\nIn the pursuit of terrorist organization The Liberation Front, you have to coordinate your team to gather information, manage your limited budget and deal with the press hot on your heels for a good story. But that is only half of it:Your main task as lead investigator is interrogating suspects. Understanding their backgrounds, and thus their motivations, is key in choosing whether intimidation, guile or empathy is the right approach. There is no universal solution \u2013 but the clock is ticking relentlessly.\n\nAs you\u2019re closing in on the true culprits and your suspects are getting more resistant, the interrogations become increasingly difficult. Uncover the truth through complex conversations, psychological manipulation and other techniques.\n\nThe Liberation Front will not be easily dismantled.", "summary": "As a police detective tasked with bringing down a dangerous terrorist group, you fight on two fronts: interrogating suspects & managing your team and its reputation. With time running out, how far will you go to stop these criminals? Manipulation, threats or even torture? Does the end justify the means? Interrogation is a narratively immersive convo-puzzle game that challenges common preconceptions about highly relevant contemporary subjects like terrorism, police brutality and the power imbalances between citizens, the state and large corporations. The game tries to raise important moral, ideological and practical questions in the minds of the players.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/interrogation-you-will-be-deceived", "videos": [{"id": 29243, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "wJHSOmjxqiY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJHSOmjxqiY", "title": "Interrogation: You will be deceived - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wJHSOmjxqiY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 31312, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zv3xNX35Kak", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv3xNX35Kak", "title": "Interrogation: You will be deceived - Release Date Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zv3xNX35Kak/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
