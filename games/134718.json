These resource-stripping activities threaten the local flora and fauna, especially the Mountain Wampus, who get hunted for their treasure. \n \nAs a young wampus, players set out to rid Irata of the settler invaders and restore harmony to the land. While a fun lark, Wampus explores themes of environmentalism, conservationism, stewardship of the land, and the destructive nature of colonialism.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wampus"}
