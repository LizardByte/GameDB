The game takes the player on a series of assignments with different targets that need to be dispatched with a scoped rifle.\n\nAt the end of each assignment the player is treated to on screen display of their performance. For each assignment successfully completed a large sum of cash is added to the player\u2019s total, plus an extra sum is awarded for hitting the target zone. If however the player fails to complete the objective or the timer reaches zero, the player\u2019s accuracy rating is reduced and the player is then moved on to choose the next assignment. The game is over when the player\u2019s accuracy rating reaches zero.\n\nAt the start of the player\u2019s career, 5 different assignments are available to choose from and can be completed in any order. Once all 5 assignments have been undertaken a new round of assignments becomes available. In total there are 4 rounds each consisting of 5 assignments, with each round becoming progressively harder.\n\nThe last round includes a special stage which can only be selected after all the assignments have been completed. Upon completion of the special stage the credits roll and the game ends. The player is then once again returned to the start of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "videos": [{"id": 59869, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cZpOXo_jMY0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZpOXo_jMY0", "title": "Golgo 13 Arcade (1999)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cZpOXo_jMY0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
