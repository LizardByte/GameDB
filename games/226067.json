The player must place LEGO bricks to form paths and stairways so Junkbot can reach and consume all the recycling bins in a level. The game would receive a sequel titled \"Junkbot Undercover\" in 2003.\n\nDespite being officially licensed by LEGO, Junkbot never appeared in any physical LEGO sets, though the \"Haunted House\" set from 2021 features a hidden box containing his parts.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/junkbot"}
