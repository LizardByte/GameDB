A city ruled by corporations. A city ruled by the elite.\nA city that exemplifies the best and worst of the American Dream.\nMillions live their lives in almost blissful ignorance of the excesses of the rich, or the degradation of the poor. Executives hold more power than politicians, the police hold less power than corporate mercenaries.\nYou are one of those mercenaries, one of the best, and elite tier called Ghosts... but you haven't taken a job in months. That is about to change.\nElsewhere in the city, a young girl is about to become the center of a conflict that could tear the city apart.\nAs you track her down you'll have allies and enemies, others like you who have been used by the city and spit out. Who will you trust? Who can you afford to?\nEach of them has their own dreams, their own motivations, each is broken in their own way. All of it will come together...\nIn the City of Broken Dreamers", "summary": "City of Broken Dreamers is a mature, adults-only cyberpunk visual novel.
