Going for a walk in the woods should be enough to invigorate her, and fill her with newfound passion for Romanticism.\n\nThat was Ethel's plan, at least - but she wasn't counting on meeting a mysterious, dark-haired beauty in the woods, who is much more than she seems.", "summary": "A dark lesbian horror/romance story so toxic it's emitting spores.
