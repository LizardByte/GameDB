An unlikely party \u2013 a dutiful knight, an auspicious student of magic and his roguish friend \u2013 couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that a quest to find the baron\u2019s assassin would lead them in the middle of a battle between gods.\n\nSaregnar lets you role-play through a deep and engaging story filled with murder, mystery, intrigue and suspense. The world is an original fantasy setting inspired by a range of historical nations. You\u2019ll be pleased to find that giant rats and slimes have been evicted from this universe.\n\nThere are 12 gods to please and gain their favor, each god being a source of unique magic spells. To gain divine favor, pray and give offerings in the form of money, food or other valuables, but mind you, not every deity can be easily pleased.", "summary": "Call of Saregnar is a nod to the era of party-based RPGs from the 90's. Follow an intriguing story with interesting characters in a unique low-fantasy medieval setting. Enjoy a lush handcrafted 3D world that just begs to be explored. The graphics are charmingly old-school with billboard trees and a low-poly 3D world. All the characters are photographs and frame sequences of real actors, that you can interact with, see them in the world, and fight with. The combat system is a turn-based hex grid affair with many tactical options.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 62612, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "igjNzMW9_qU"}]}
