Unfortunately, the elevator is broken and you need to go through 50 floors on the stairs, but there are 3 simple rules:\n\n1. If there is no anomaly, go down to the floor below.\n2. If there is an anomaly, return to the floor above.\n3. The corridor is safe, but if it changes, the rules will change.\n\n50 Floors: The Paranormal Investigators Prologue is inspired by games like The Stanley Parable, PT, The Exit 8, and narrates what happened a couple of hours before the events in the Paranormal Investigators.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/50-floors-the-paranormal-investigators-prologue"}
