The fan-made sequel to Wily Wars will let you relieve the underrated Mega Man 4-6 trilogy with a fresh 16-bit coat of paint.

Fight new enemies, bosses and hazards as you traverse through a re-imagined series of levels.\nEPISODE RED is the first release in this project and will cover the entirety of Mega Man 4 in both original and reimagined form. A demo release with a limited selection of levels will come in December, while the full game release is slated for 2022.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MMSequelWars\n\nLike and subscribe for more!
