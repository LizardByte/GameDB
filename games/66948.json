Extreme Sprint seemed to be a perfect solution: its rules were simple, yet it had a huge entertainment factor. The \"Runner\" had to complete 3 laps in specially created stadiums, while he was chased by the \"Hunter\". If the \"Runner\" was caught - he disappeared and he was never seen again...", "summary": "Extreme Sprint 3010 is a single-player running jumping kind of a game. Set in the year 3010, this game envisions a world where evil governments are desperate for something good to put on TV to entertain their teeming masses. The solution - a race. In this race the runner races around an obstacle strewn track chased by a machine that is a cross between a tank and a steam roller. Stay ahead and you win, get caught and you're history.  \n \nThe player's point of view is always above and in front of the runner, looking back at them as they run towards the camera. The track is littered with objects which the runner must either avoid, jump over, or duck under. These obstacles can just pop up out of the track as the runner approaches so quick reactions are needed. \n \nThere are three game modes:  \n \nStandard Mode: here there is the Single sprint mode where the player can practice any unlocked circuit. Then there's the Multiple Sprint mode which is locked until Tournament Mode has been completed, completing the Multiple Sprint mode unlocks 16th stadium.  \n \nTournament Mode: here there are five leagues, completing a league will unlock further stadiums and hence give access to the next league. Completing the final league unlocks stadium fifteen and the Multiple Sprints mode  \n \nExploration Mode: Here the player has to complete series of races that unlock new characters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/extreme-sprint-3010", "videos": [{"id": 45509, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NTJiD-L_Th8"}]}
