He has served a decade in jail in England and the royal authorities were relieved to find out that he departed the islands to become a problem for the US government.\n\nMost people look in the face of Johnny Hastings and think he is a monster but little do they know what kind of monster he is. Deadeye Hastings has always had problems with self-esteem and with keeping calm under pressure. He is constantly trying to compensate this with reckless demeanor dragging his comrades into unpredictable situations. Anyone who wants to have dealings with him should mind that he is far from reliable but Hastings himself cares little about what people think about him - he just wants to have fun!\n\nNow, a military contractor bought the old canneries at the edge of the city and turned them into weapons factories, which caused quite a stir among Atlantic City's most wanted. Every thief, crook and hood wants a piece of the pie. Make sure to get yours!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/omerta-city-of-gangsters-the-arms-industry"}
