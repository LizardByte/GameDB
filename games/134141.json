Fortunately, Nott is a formidable archer, so she'll be able to collect special arrows along the way to help her overcome the evil monsters drawn straight from Nordic legends.\n\nAlong her journey, Nott will also have to gain the support of several Viking heroes fallen in battle. They will help her complete her Odyssey, and in return, once reunited with Oder, Nott and her faithful companion will get them out of hell.", "summary": "With its minimalist graphic style, this mix between a \"shoot 'em up\" and \"infinite runner\" game will delight a whole range of players: the game is easy to learn but difficult to master!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vikings-an-archers-journey", "videos": [{"id": 36303, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AmXBs1z0M7g"}]}
