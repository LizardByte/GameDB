It is a world of automation, a utopia gone wrong in which all of humanity have transferred their minds into robotic imposter bodies and are ruled by a deranged computer. It\u2019s being published by Adult Swim, and has Stacking\u2019s Lee Petty at the helm here on the good ship Double Fine.\n\nYou are the last known human in the universe, and all that\u2019s left of you is a disembodied head. Seeking clues to your fractured past, you must travel through a hostile world of machines, using a special helmet that allows you to dock into and take control of any robotic host body. As you launch from one body to the next, you\u2019ll start to discover that things are not quite what they appear to be, and the fate of humanity has yet to be decided\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 6634, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "tl2hFZkwwNI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl2hFZkwwNI", "title": "The First 11 Minutes of Headlander - IGN First", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tl2hFZkwwNI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6635, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wrfQNcJ54hU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrfQNcJ54hU", "title": "Headlander Official Announce Trailer | Adult Swim Games (HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wrfQNcJ54hU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 8910, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EmbrHyh5OWk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbrHyh5OWk", "title": "Headlander Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EmbrHyh5OWk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9052, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "6Roobeb0Hv8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Roobeb0Hv8", "title": "Headlander - Gameplay Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Roobeb0Hv8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
