Most of the 32 levels contained are vanilla-compatible, but errors could appear at a few points while using the original executable, so it is better to play through a limit removing source port; another reason is that additional graphics are present. Almost all of the maps could be played in deathmatch or cooperative mode.\n\nA DeHackEd patch is used to change the levels' names and par times. This WAD is widely known not only by the means of detail and texture alignment or frequent use of non-standard graphics, but also by enhancing gameplay on some of the levels, most notably on the super secret level, which contains 32 secrets that should be accessed one by one using various techniques including rocket jumping, waiting for a monster to open a locked door from behind or just by careful observation of the level's objects.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
