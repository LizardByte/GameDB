The MechWarrior dons the prototype Battle Armor to fend off the invaders, and uses the new NeuroHacking feature to take over several light 'Mechs, such as the Cougar and Uller. Later the Wolf's Dragoons steal an APC and a tank in order to make it to the spaceport. A pair of Raptors arrive to stop the escape, but the MechWarrior defeats them using the tank, an Owens or a Belial. The Dragoons recover yet another data core (focusing on invisibility), and escape with it and the company of a space pirate named Alera.", "summary": "MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf is a 2004 Xbox video game developed by Day 1 Studios and the sequel to MechAssault, published exclusively on the Xbox console, and being compatible with the Xbox 360. \n \nUnlike the previous game, MechAssault 2 places emphasis on the out-of-'Mech experience, with the pilot being given options such at the BattleArmor, tanks, or even being able to plant pilot bombs. Also unlike the previous games, the plot takes place on multiple planets, instead of different environments in Helios. \n \nLike the original game, this game was released in two editions: Standard and Limited. The Standard Edition came with the disc, cover, and manual, while the Limited Edition came with an extra's disc detailing the making of the game and additional maps to download for multiplayer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 36829, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GC6SkDbsHDc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC6SkDbsHDc", "title": "MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf [XBOX] FULL Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GC6SkDbsHDc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
