Each ship is designed to meet specialized standards so that no matter how young or old you are you can enjoy them just the same.\n\nMost PixelShips are only a foot or two long and are flown using special devices called PICCs, or PixelShip Interface Command Consoles. The consoles have two joysticks and six buttons on each stick and can interface with any ship that has been registered into it. Some PICCs also have LCD displays so that you don't need a TV to see what your PixelShip sees while it flies.\n\nEach PixelShip uses batteries, just like any other toy, though some use Micro-Reactors instead and are fueled at special facilities so that childeren cannot actually access the fuel inside. They are also designed out of segments held together by micro-magnets. When the ship is \"destroyed\" in combat, its micro-magnets disengage and the ship flies apart into its seperate segments, each still carrying a residual charge from the ship's anti-gravity unit. If all of the segments are then tagged by another PixelShip, that collector may then, under official guidelines, possess the ship if he so desires.\n\nClassic PixelShips takes place in the year 2076 when a very secretive PixelShip has supposedly been built. Your task is to collect all 160 known PixelShips by earning them through campaign battles at the arena. Afterwards, you will be given access to a special campaign where you may earn this unique and unheard of PixelShip.", "summary": "PixelShips is a side-scrolling 2D shooter consisting of randomly generated levels and missions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pixelships"}
