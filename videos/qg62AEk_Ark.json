{"id": "qg62AEk_Ark", "snippet": {"title": "SNES Longplay [109] Darius Twin", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Tsunao\n\nI could've probably had this as a two player playthrough, but I can't since some people at Longplays are in different timezones. =/  It probably would've been awesome.\n\nDidn't bother going to the options, since there is only Normal and Easy difficulty.  Increasing lives is useless since I am going for the best ending (or at least I think it is). One of my all-time favorite shmup series.\n\nIf you haven't heard of the Darius series, these are things you need to know:\n\n-The ships are called Silver Hawks.\n\n-The pilots are usually always a male (piloting the red Silver Hawk) and a female (piloting the blue Silver Hawk).  Exception to Darius Burst, where a \"female\" (actually an AI) pilots a red Silver Hawk (Legend), while a male pilots a blue Silver Hawk (Next).  No clue on the 3rd Silver Hawk (Origin).\n\n-The bosses are based on marine critters. (how many shmups can you name that uses marine critters as the main bosses?)\n\n-The message before ANY boss fight:  \"WARNING!  A huge battleship [insert boss name here] is approaching fast\"\n\n-Clearing zones will end with \"We are now rushing into [Zone name here].  Be on your guard\"\n\n-Many paths and stages to choose from.  Darius Gaiden takes the cake for most stages.\n\n-Anything Taito usually have music by Zuntata (or its members), who are responsible for the Darius series music.  Might I mention they are awesome.\n\n-Milking a boss or taking too long to defeat a boss will prompt the appearance of cubes, which make things harder (usually in the other Darius games).\n\n-Going down the bottom path = Hard mode, which, 9 times out of 10, the last boss of said path will be Great Thing, a hugeass sperm whale that shoots A LOT of crap at you (drills included).  Kitchen sinks MAY be included.  Usually IS the hardest boss in the Darius series.  Too bad it isn't the final boss in this one. =/\n\n-Difficulty, depending on the game, WILL make you cry and possibly make you eat a baby or a puppy. (read:  hard-as-hell)\n\nWith that said...\nGoing for the best ending for Darius Twin (or at least I think), which calls for taking a certain path (A-C-D-F-H-K-L), NOT losing a single life (especially against Hyper Greatthing), and defeating Super Alloylantern.  Since I am going down that path, I can't enjoy Zone G and I music. =(\n\nZone A - 0:55\nZone C - 3:47\nZone D - 7:06\nZone F - 10:35\nZone H - 13:39 (the boss in this stage is \"UGH!\".)\nZone K - 17:24 (goddamn Hyper Greatthing)\nZone L - 20:54 (captains to the left, captains to the right.)\n\nZones B and C, E and F, G and I, and J and K are identical.  The only difference is usually color of background (G and I), color of boss (E and F), or the boss (J has a goddamn turtle, K has a goddamn sperm whale.  Plus they go in a different direction).\n\nI didn't fight back in Zone L because that will only make it harder (goddamn My Home Daddy...thing, which is the hermit crab captain.  They make me RAEG!)  At least the bosses are easy.  Taking too long defeat Super Alloylantern gives a bad ending (then again, you HAVE to purposely run out of time.  You get a lot of time to defeat it.) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qg62AEk_Ark/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qg62AEk_Ark/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qg62AEk_Ark/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [109] Darius Twin", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Tsunao\n\nI could've probably had this as a two player playthrough, but I can't since some people at Longplays are in different timezones. =/  It probably would've been awesome.\n\nDidn't bother going to the options, since there is only Normal and Easy difficulty.
