Still, I am so so so SO proud of how this turned out. Big big shoutouts to Eric, AG's new composer, for making such a wonderful tune. This was a joy to work on, even if it was a bit exhausting at times! I really wanted to push myself after last year's trailer; showing gameplay, animation, new tunes, the works!! I wanted to outdo last year and really get people on board for the project. So far, it's succeeded!! Thank you all so much for the support, it means a ton to me.
