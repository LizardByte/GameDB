Racing against time and the plot of King Philip to destroy the Templars, you soon come to realize there is more at stake than just the order itself. Control over powerful artifacts, knowledge of life's true origins, \u200band the fate of mankind itself are revealed to you in the course of this epic and expansive retro adventure.\n\nThis, the first chapter of the game is being released for free/by donation exclusively for the Playdate (playable on handheld or on the free desktop simulator).\n\n\nBACKGROUND ON THE GAME:\n\nHaving a love for Indiana Jones, The X-Files, Oak Island, religious artifacts, cover-ups, conspiracies, and alien encounters, I began designing Quest For The X in late spring of 2023 after breaking my ankle mountain biking in New Zealand and finding myself with plenty of free time and zero excuses.\n\nA retro-style story-driven adventure, the game pays homage to others which have gone before it, and many from my childhood including: Pitfall II: The Lost Caverns (Atari 2600), Conan (Apple IIe), The Return of Heracles (Atari 800), Bruce Lee and Zorro (C64), Out Of This World (SNES), and Space Quest 3, The Secret of Monkey Island, and Indiana Jones & The Fate Of Atlantis (PC).\n\nQuest For The X is my second game for Playdate, written with Pulp, and my intention is now to move to Lua + the SDK to complete the full game.  See below how you can help!\n\nIt also is the second game created in collaboration with BeepsNBoops, who produced the inspiring sounds and songs featured in the game. Working with him on the development of these worlds for Playdate has been amazing.\n\nPLEASE SUPPORT:\n\nIf you like what you see, and are hungry for more, please support us by leaving a comment, feedback, and donating what you feel the game is worth to you.
