Once it is fully trained, your P.I.T. can then explore its virtual world in search of valuable AI-chips that can later be used to build the ultimate Gold P.I.T. pet.\n\nEach P.I.T. has its own personality, which you can choose before it is \"born\"; cheeky ones tend to be more adventurous, quiet ones more obedient - the choice of P.I.T. personality governs just how you and your P.I.T. will get along!", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 73499, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ClnPD4NPJ3w"}]}
