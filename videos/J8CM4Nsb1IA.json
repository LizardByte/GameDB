By infesting the Intergalactic Zoo with creatures called Qwirks, the Warlords hoped to destroy the Alliance's scientific showpiece.\n\nAt first, the plan worked well. The Qwirks began multiplying quickly, threatening to overrun the entire facility. Furthermore, their telepathic powers overwhelmed the minds of several Zoo creatures, turning them into evil monsters.\n\nBut the Alliance scientists fought back. They captured and domesticated two Qwirks, whom they named Cosmo and Bigelow, to help in their lab experiments. They discovered that Qwirks of the same color have a special telepathic affinity and link up when they're next to one another. When four or more Qwirks are linked this way, they transmigrate into the eighth dimention. By herding the Qwirks into the proper groups, the scientists have learned to make enough Qwirks transmigrate so that there is now some hope of defeating the evil Warlords' plans...\n\nEach mode in the game uses their own exclusive background, except for \"Challenge Mode\", which has two. Players can start from as high as the eighth stage.\n\nEasy levels\nWuzzer - A small orange-colored bee with lazy eyes.\nFeegle - A two-headed green eagle with limited brain capacity.\nGloth - A small creature that can be described as a cross between an ostrich, a walrus, and some kind of insect.\nScump - A giant red ant said to be \"too smart for it's own good\".\n\nNormal levels\nHammat - An orange rodent that resembles a mongoose or prairie dog.\nBlupp - An oversized shrimp with lazy eyes and a habit of mouthing.\nRachis - A two-foot-long spider that makes optimal use of it's eight legs.\nFrild - A mischievous reptile with a horn on his head.\n\nFinal levels\nNuzard - A carnivorous red snake monster with huge jaws.\nTwang - A long-limbed blue frog said to be tall enough to squish anyone beneath his webbed feet.\nGrillus - A female cyclops gorilla who is quick to anger.\nNout - A humanoid creature with a large beak.\nSpirtl - The primary main foe and the one leading the Qwirk Invasion.\n\nThis is a a good Tetris variation with difficult computer opponents, each with unique playing style. Players can manipulate the path of falling Qwirk, rotate its position, and speed up its rate of descent. When four Qwirks of the same color connect horizontally or vertically, they explode and are eliminated, yielding points. As the player removes Qwirks from his field, he sends extra Qwirks to his opponent. Overall, a fun puzzler that's still Tetris at heart.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8CM4Nsb1IA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8CM4Nsb1IA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8CM4Nsb1IA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8CM4Nsb1IA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8CM4Nsb1IA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Qwirks - Challenges (1995) [WINDOWS]", "description": "In the year 2581, the evil Warlords of Zapf saw their chance to discredit Earth's Alliance of Worlds.
