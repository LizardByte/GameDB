But, one day as he was leaving for work, his little sister told him, \"If Yuki isn't going to college then I won't either.\" He knew he couldn't put such a burden upon his little sister.\n\nSo, in order to gather the necessary sum of money to enter university, Yuki signed up for a \"human employment rental\" website. It seemed extremely suspicious, but desperate times call for desperate measures.\n\nHe starts his new job...and for some reason, a girl in his class asks him to be her pretend boyfriend. Then he's hired to pretend to be a woman's lover, another girl's friend, and even the older brother to a pair of twins!\n\nThe details of his fake relationships with these girls begin as soon as he takes their money!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/renai-karichaimashita", "videos": [{"id": 52317, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "lLJHa5mTPSI"}]}
