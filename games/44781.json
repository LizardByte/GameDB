As Sun Puyos were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (\u4e09, \"san\" is the Japanese word for the number 3), the name suited the game. The Ketteiban (Definitive) edition of the game introduces a nazo puyo puzzle mode. Rerecorded audio tracks and voice acting, using higher quality audio tracks from the arcade version as a source.\n\nJust like the predecessors, Puyos fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise by 90\u00b0. The rule of Sousai and Zenkesei still remained, but every time you countered, special garbage would fall on the screen in a preset pattern. Every time you cleared the screen however, Sun Puyos would fall on the screen, and the All Clear bonus removed.\n\nThe game features 3 story modes featuring their own character and difficulty: Draco Centauros (Easy), Arle Nadja (Normal) and Schezo Wegey (Hard).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-sun-ketteiban", "videos": [{"id": 89901, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "M4pD7YdaAR4"}]}
