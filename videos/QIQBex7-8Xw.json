Housed in an adorable plastic LCD toy, your new pixelated best friend will need pizza, fizzy drinks, and only the best entertainment provided by Freddy Fazbear himself. And if Popgoes doesn't receive what he desperately needs, he passes out. Or maybe he straight up dies. Up to your imagination.\n\nIn this special Steam release of myPOPGOES, you'll have access to brand new challenges with unique gameplay mechanics, such as the Sticky, Expire, and Blind modes. And as you play through the game, you'll also be able to collect stickers to put on your toy, cartridges to unlock other playable characters, different toy designs entirely, and more!\n\nAnd don't be misled by this game's surreal premise and modest gameplay - it is a canon entry to the POPGOES series with real lore implications and interesting story tidbits! If you're a fan of the POPGOES series, give it a go! \n\n#madewithfusion #indiegame #fnaf #fanverse", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QIQBex7-8Xw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QIQBex7-8Xw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QIQBex7-8Xw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QIQBex7-8Xw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QIQBex7-8Xw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "myPOPGOES | Fazbear Fanverse - Wishlist on Steam now!", "description": "Wishlist on Steam today: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2429350/myPOPGOES/\n\nDon't forget to subscribe!\n\nPOPGOES is an official Five Nights at Freddy's spinoff series, produced by Scott Cawthon and developed by fans as part of the \"Fazbear Fanverse Initiative\".\n\nmyPOPGOES is a short and simple resource management minigame, where you take care of an extremely needy weasel named Popgoes.
