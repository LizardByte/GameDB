It was designed with elite challenge runners in mind, and unless you have extensive knowledge of Paper Mario, you may struggle with much of the content.\n\nFor those players there is Paper Mario: Master Quest Jr. which has all of the content the original has, with a much more reasonable difficulty curve. If you want to stream the mod, starting with Jr. is recommended.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paper-mario-master-quest-plus-jr"}
