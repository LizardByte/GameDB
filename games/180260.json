No blood-feast!\nAbout 20 artists have been invited to exhibit in the virtual museum located\nin the Brucknerhaus in Linz, where every year an exhibition for the worlds\ngreatest computer art contest, the prix ars electronica is celebrated.\nSo people around the world who cannot come to Linz this time participate at\nthe exhibition in the virtual Brucknerhaus. All the artists are there\nvirtually (at least there heads and projects). Some personally, some\ncomputer generated. Max. 4 of them on the net, the other 20\nas monsters. And have fun interacting with the different projects, be an\nartist like Arnulf Rainer, Hermann Nitsch, Baselitz or Nam June Paik."}
