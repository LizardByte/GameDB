Select officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battlefield, each of the officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at their disposal which can be controlled at any point. Level-ups bring additional special attacks to both officers and their troops.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kessen-iii", "videos": [{"id": 10171, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FzegAkn_3IU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzegAkn_3IU", "title": "Kessen III PlayStation 2 Trailer - Direct Feed Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FzegAkn_3IU/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1350, "name": "Kessen"}]}
