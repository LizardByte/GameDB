It was designed by Adrian Stephens and Ronald J. Fortier and published by Disney Interactive. The game, marketed as \"The Stunt Flying and Filming Simulation\", provides an island which contains a number of different film sets, such as a city, an oil rig, a canyon, and an aircraft carrier. The player can position cameras and props around these sets, and create triggers to start actions including the camera panning and an object moving. The game also has an editing mode where the player can splice together taped footage and insert sound effects. It was re-released in 2016 on GOG.com with support for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, Stunt Island description and game cover image, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_Island", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stunt-island", "videos": [{"id": 16252, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "2vqBu3EgZTM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vqBu3EgZTM", "title": "Stunt Island gameplay (PC Game, 1992)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vqBu3EgZTM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
