A version with Portuguese text was released in Brazil in August, 2010, under the title Um Jogo de Ovos.\n\nThe game features all the main characters from Una Pel\u00edcula de Huevos, including Toto, Willy, Confi, Serp, Cuache and Tlacua, voiced by the same actors used in the movie. The story is also based on the film, but follows an alternative plotline. Un Juego de Huevos is the first videogame based on a Mexican license. The goal of the game is to explore and battle through a series of increasingly difficult challenges. The game provides 25 levels, 5 battles with bosses and 10 unlockable levels of competition. It supports one or two players in cooperative or competitive modes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 57221, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "msS-TJtZb6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msS-TJtZb6g", "title": "[ZeePlay] Gameplay Un Juego de Huevos (Compila\u00e7\u00e3o)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/msS-TJtZb6g/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
