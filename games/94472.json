Nevertheless, even if you're a seasoned Pontifex player there is much to discover in this game. More materials have been added, suspension bridges can now be made. And if your bridges could hardly withstand the weight of a single train, just think of several crossing at once your bridge... But the most interesting new aspect of this game is probably the possibilty of making drawbridges: at last, you can prove that if you had been the engineer of the tower bridge, it would have ended being a much more fun - but maybe not as reliable - bridge.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pontifex-2"}
