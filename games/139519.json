You may probably tell what is going to happen next.\n----------------------\nStramedia: my_MISADVENTURE is an indie horror themed adventure game where you step into the shoes of Nathan Philips, the class president and warden who accepted an invitation offer to what soon transformed to be the most bizarre and the most deadly school trip tour in his and his surviving classmates' lives due to a, uh... a teeny-tiny little containment incident.\n\nWell, now, he and his friends (fiend? frienemies?) have no other choice, but do whatever it takes to safely get out of the safehouse facility - the ironic certain death trap - while also retaining what remains of their mental health.\n...or get to the thick of it. They really don't get to decide, because YOU are the one who gets to decide how the game ends!\n\nThough, with the situation worsening every hour as the entire facility is being overrun with 'monsters' on the loose, their time for a swift, easy escape is limited.", "summary": "It's one weird comedic horror themed adventure, and it's a school trip of a lifetime.
