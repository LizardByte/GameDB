Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the aliens and reverse the inevitable. It's up to you to lead the Phoenix Project: research and develop new technologies and techniques, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and fight hard battles.\n\nBut you won't be alone. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as offshoot subfactions, have their own values and view of the Pandorans. You can choose to work with factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, or you can simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, it won't be an easy victory.", "summary": "The definitive edition of the acclaimed strategy game from the creator of X-COM.
