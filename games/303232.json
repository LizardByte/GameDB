In level 2, you're suddenly bombarded with flying debris. Avoid at all costs. Level 3 has you jumping from one part of a highway two another. In level 4, you grind along the rails of a train track. Futuristic cars try to ram you from behind in the mad metropolis of level 5. In level 6, you are equipped with a gun to fight some kind of giant caterpillar. An even larger mutant creature attacks in level 7 and you must survive for set a mount of time. Level 8 is a beach littered with bones and craters on which you have to evade fast-moving tricycles. The final level is a city street littered with turds, mushrooms, skeletons and, weirdly enough, sunbathing citizens.\n\nhttps://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/161725-skate-tribe", "summary": "A vertical scrolling skateboarding game from 1990, featuring nine levels.
