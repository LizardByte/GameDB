Meanwhile, Gotham City itself has degenerated into a police state managed by Mayor Sharp, where citizens with the slightest trace of a criminal record find themselves shipped to the prison district. Those who dare to challenge Sharp's policies are the target of arranged disappearances, becoming political prisoners trapped behind Arkham's walls. Among these is Bruce Wayne, who holds a rally attacking the proposal of turning half his city into a walled-off reserve for criminally inclined persons. Segregated from society, he argues, they have become responsible for their own survival in an anarchic urban hell which is characterized by bloody gang wars.\n\nWelcome to Arkham City\nWayne, as the latest focus of Sharp's vendetta, is kidnapped by TYGER Security operatives working for Hugo Strange, who is privy to his dual identity as Batman. Strange intends to unveil new plans for Arkham City before the night is up, an operation codenamed Protocol 10, which will establish himself as supreme ruler of Gotham. Now an inmate, the Dark Knight manages to have Alfred Pennyworth deliver his crimefighting equipment to him directly via an airdrop, and he prepares to save Catwoman from Two-Face for the sake of their past relationship while uncovering the true nature of Protocol 10.", "summary": "Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition includes the following DLC:\n\nCatwoman Pack\nNightwing Bundle Pack\nRobin Bundle Pack\nHarley Quinn\u2019s Revenge\nChallenge Map Pack\nArkham City Skins Pack\n\nBatman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition packages new gameplay content, seven maps, three playable characters, and 12 skins beyond the original retail release:\n\nMaps: Wayne Manor, Main Hall, Freight Train, Black Mask, The Joker's Carnival, Iceberg Long, and Batcave\nPlayable Characters: Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing\nSkins: 1970s Batsuit, Year One Batman, The Dark Knight Returns, Earth One Batman, Batman Beyond Batman, Animated Batman, Sinestro Corps Batman, Long Halloween Catwoman, Animated Catwoman, Animated Robin, Red Robin and Animated Nightwing", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-arkham-city-game-of-the-year-edition", "videos": [{"id": 32298, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "944Ty9YpjEs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=944Ty9YpjEs", "title": "Batman: Arkham City - Game of the Year Edition", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/944Ty9YpjEs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
