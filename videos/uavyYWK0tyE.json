It's a western game with futuristic elements. The female character, Annie, has searched down a bounty hunter by the name of Clint to help her get revenge and to rescue the few family members she has left. Another notable point is the possibily to change the color of the clothes of the characters (in the character select menu)! It's a classic western game, like SunsetRiders, but with different perspective!\nSo I decided to make one more longplay of this great game!
