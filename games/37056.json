Think again. Stop tapping. Stop swiping. In fact, stop touching the screen at all. To crack Blackbox\u2019s puzzles you\u2019ll need to find solitude and stillness, climb mountains, call on friends, get in tune with the cosmos, and think outside the box.\nMinimalistic visual clues make for incredibly satisfying \u201cAha!\u201d moments, while sonic interfaces provide an extra level of guidance and nuance that makes Blackbox accessible with or without vision. Thoughtful haptic feedback, Easter eggs on Easter eggs, and solutions that can\u2019t be found beneath the glass of your screen redefine what a puzzle can be. You\u2019ll never see your device the same way again.\nThink you\u2019re clever?
