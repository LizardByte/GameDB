It is a simple Sonic X-themed game of bowling.\nThe game is based around the traditional ten-pin bowling game. Here, the player assumes control of Sonic on a bowling lane with ten bowling pins at the end. The player can send Sonic down the bowling lane as a curled-up ball so he can knock down the pins like an actual bowling ball. When having to roll Sonic, he will spin in one place while a blue arrow automatically swings left and right in front of him. When Sonic is then thrown, he will head in the direction that the arrow was pointing in at the time of the throw, before making a small turn in the opposite direction. How Sonic is aimed will determine the number of pins knocked down.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-x-bowling--1", "videos": [{"id": 112709, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XNYunMxiEH4"}]}
