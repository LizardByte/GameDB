The 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim trailer doesn\u2019t much dive into the game\u2019s plot, but it has a wild one. The game follows 13 high-school students (from the 1980\u2019s) who time travel to the future and get pulled into a war between mechs and Kajiu. Unfortunately, the game trailer doesn\u2019t have much 13 Sentinels Ageis Rim gameplay (so we wouldn\u2019t classify it as a 13 Sentinels Ageis Rim gameplay trailer), but it\u2019s still worth checking out.\n\nFor more info on the 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim game, stay tuned to IGN.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be collecting YOUR video comments for our Summer of Gaming coverage.
