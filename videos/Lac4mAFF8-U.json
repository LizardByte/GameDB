The game is a collection of reworked puzzle games such as Battleship, Poker, Slots, Cryptograms, and Memory loosely tied together with an overarching goal to save two princesses. Prince Hodj and Prince Podj, twin princes from some other faraway land compete to save the princesses and ultimately marry one and be crowned King.\n\nBoffo's first game, it was published by Virgin Interactive but was originally developed for Media Vision. Media Vision restructured after a massive securities fraud scandal in 1994 and the title was purchased by Virgin at the bankruptcy auctions.\n\nThe game itself plays similarly to Mario Party, being a competitive board game that ties together several minigames.\n\nThe Animation in the intro is superb for a 90's PC game and the voice actors are of a quality similar to a children's TV series. It's a shame it wasn't ported to more platforms.\n\nWould have been interesting to have a version on home consoles like the Playstation. Not to be sadly.\n\n\n\nBY THE WAY!\n\nIf you want to watch me try to play the game just let me know. :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lac4mAFF8-U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lac4mAFF8-U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lac4mAFF8-U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lac4mAFF8-U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Hodj 'n Podj Official Trailer (1995, Virgin/Boffo)", "description": "Hodj 'n' Podj is a video game released in 1995 designed by video game veteran Steven Meretzky.
