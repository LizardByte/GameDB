It has the highest amount of endings based on choices you made throughout the story and which girl you pick for your love interest. Just like in TK3 you can choose between a male or female protagonist - the game more or less becomes a yuri harem if you play as a girl.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yoru-no-umi-de-otsukisama-wo-tsuru", "videos": [{"id": 49230, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QQSamRHNf4k"}]}
