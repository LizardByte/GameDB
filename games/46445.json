Curious, Mario attempts to type on it. However, he proves to be a terrible typist. Before Mario can go on any further, the Magical Typewriter explodes. In place of the typewriter is a scroll, which is also floating in the air. Mario takes the typewriter and sees a picture of three pieces of the Magical Typewriter. Mario and Luigi decide to recover all of the pieces and improve Mario's typing skills.", "summary": "Mario Teaches Typing 2 is the sequel to Mario Teaches Typing. It includes several new features, including a certificate of achievement, a keyboard that is color-coded for easy reference, an on-screen keyboard, specially customizable lesson plans, and new levels. Additionally, Mario's face also makes small talk with the player throughout the levels. Many of Mario's face's antics in this game are cultural references. This is also the last educational Mario game to be released.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-teaches-typing-2", "videos": [{"id": 35155, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FpbeR7fzDQo"}]}
