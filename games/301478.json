You are a robot vacuum cleaner tasked with maintaining the cleanliness of your owner's home during the night. You must make sure that you collect all of the dust within the house, or you may be returned to the store and/or scrapped for parts. Be wary for any sounds you hear; they may be indications of more dust appearing in the house.\n\nYou perceive your surroundings through your advanced LiDar scanner. Pressing space will scan the environment around you, creating a 3d snapshot for you to explore. Keep in mind, picking up dust will not remove the scanned version of it. However, it will not pick up on scans again. Make sure to scan often so that you have a clear view of your surroundings.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/domovoy"}
