The fate of their civilization hangs in the balance, and the mission to return home has never been more urgent.\n\nWill the Astronaut find a way to reunite with their crew and save their home from total annihilation?

During the course of each level, the gameplay evolves from a focus on turret placement strategy to all out chaos and mostly running for your life during the later waves.\n\nExperience a story mode with differing environments, enemies, and unique boss fights and a challenge mode that offers replay-able sandbox customization for turret usage, enemy combatants, difficulty settings, and achievement hunting.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/astronaut-assault"}
