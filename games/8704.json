Peter Pan, who is now living a normal adult life, is compelled to relive his roguish past when his old nemesis Captain Hook kidnaps his children. Vibrant graphics, charming Tinkerbell as your sidekick, and decent puzzles can't hide the below-average writing, awkward interface, and the fact that the adventure is over all too soon.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
