But now, finally, a Release date is set and hopefully everything will be done until September 30th. I apologize for taking such a long time, even if I'm doing everything (that's not made by Nintendo already) by myself, it really shouldn't have taken this long. \n\nTrailer edited and Gameplay captured by myself.\nMusic : Mario Kart 8 Deluxe OST - Shroom Ridge", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2O-fZmfrw8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2O-fZmfrw8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2O-fZmfrw8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2O-fZmfrw8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2O-fZmfrw8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Trailer 2 - NSMB2: Mushroom Madness", "description": "This is the Teaser Trailer that was seen in Rimea's \"New Super Mario Bros.
