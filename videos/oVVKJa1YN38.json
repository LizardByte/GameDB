This actually makes a great difference in the gameplay, since one is more dynamic (15Ak) and one is more of finger independence I guess (15Bk)? Basically, 15Ak is to 11k and 15Bk is to 11Lk, if you know what I mean! It's also part of why I've been putting off making a video of 15Ak for a while since it is difficult to show the difference in a video back then, but now that I have the keyboard overlay, I hope it makes it a bit easier to understand?\n\nOh, speaking of keyboard overlay, this time I put it in the middle of the playfield and adjusted the transparency a bit! And honestly, I'm not too sure if I like it! I was hoping that it would make it easier to follow the movement when the overlay is close to the playfield instead of far, but did it really do that much of a difference? Actually, does the keyboard overlay really help you guys follow the movement of the keypresses other than letting you know what the keyboard layout basically looks like? Unfortunately, the difference between what a keyboard overlay and hand cam can do seems to get a lot bigger every time I try to make a video with it (granted, I only did two videos with it)! I just can't win *SOB* \n\nThis seems to be the highest rated chart for 15Ak, but to be honest, I'm still not too sure how to play this! It really is very challenging, and I legitimately thought I was not going to pass this anytime soon! Granted, that notion was true, since I encountered this chart like two months ago a.k.a when it was first uploaded in January for the latest event! Technically took me two months to beat this, but it wasn't like as if I played this for two months really! No, I have no idea how much time I took to pass this, but it did feel quite long!\n\nActually, this chart is actually part of a collab with a lot of danoni charters and has a lot of keymodes! Each keymode should have more than one difficulty if I remember correctly! Why not try to look at them yourselves? Chart link at the bottom of the description as always! Also, while you do that, you can always check out the event page of the latest event which this collab was part of! \nhttps://vorhandensein.sakura.ne.jp/event/nfes21_returns/\n\nAnyways, I hope you try to play this game or any 10+k games! Or else\n\nShorts ver: https://youtu.be/zrmHeAm4JWA\n\n#danoni\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nSong: Nota - \u3044\u3093\u305b\u304f\u3068\uff01\nMaker: Tarwil\nChart Link: https://mfv2.sakura.ne.jp/do/main/?id=insect&scoreId=53", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVVKJa1YN38/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVVKJa1YN38/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVVKJa1YN38/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[15Ak Danoni] Basically 11k + 11Lk but not 15Bk (Nota - \u3044\u3093\u305b\u304f\u3068\uff01)", "description": "Like as said in the title, 15Ak is kind of like mixing 11k and 11Lk keybinds together, and 15Ak IS different from 15Bk despite the playfield looking very identical! 15Bk is more like 11Lk and 11Rk (basically 11Lk but mirrored, also not the same as 11k) mixed together!
