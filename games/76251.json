The game renders the randomly-generated isle terrain and its features with tiny isometric graphics, with areas gradually becoming visible as the main character explores the surroundings. The large right side interface shows a small map of the revealed terrain at the top, a menu with action commands below it and several meters at the bottom for daylight time, water, food, and health. \n \nThe player has to guide the little man around the land, and give him orders to search around for food, useful materials and other essentials. Unlucky but resourceful, he can assemble tools, build tents, set SOS signs and do other work, foraging nearby bushes for food and drinking water from winding streams. When evening starts, he automatically collapses on the floor and goes to sleep, and the player must make sure he's near his makeshift hut at night, otherwise the next day starts with a substantial health hit. His chances of being rescued are displayed as a percentage number below a lifesaver icon at the top. The game ends, of course, when the main character dies for some reason.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}]}
