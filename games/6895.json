Packed with 35 playable characters, bonus stages and cinematic Ultra combos, Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition expands the action by allowing you to fight your friends around the world using Wi-Fi. New to the franchise are the figurine mode, which utilizes the Street Pass feature to add a collectible meta-game, and the 3D over-the-shoulder camera option that takes fighting to new depths. For those new to the franchise, a simple mode has been added allowing players to pull off challenging moves with a single touch of the screen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition", "videos": [{"id": 39896, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FZeREaEc4LY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZeREaEc4LY", "title": "Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition - Nintendo 3DS - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZeREaEc4LY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39897, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SteP3FjRzIU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SteP3FjRzIU", "title": "N3DS\u300e\u30b9\u30d1IV 3D Edition\u300fCM\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\uff3b\u767a\u58f2\u524d\uff3d", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SteP3FjRzIU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
