This game seems to be a port of MiG-29 Fulcrum, which was released by Domark in 1990 for the Acorn Archimedes, Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS PC platforms. In 1991 an enhanced version of that game was released as MiG-29M Super Fulcrum. Even though the Mega Drive port was sold as MiG-29 Fighter pilot, the game's title screen still reads MiG-29 Fulcrum.\n\nThe player flies a Mikoyan MiG-29 on six solo missions. The MiG-29 is armed with AA-8 Aphid air-to-air missiles, AS-7 Kerry air-to-surface missiles, S-240 rockets, as well as a cannon. Enemies include anti-air guns, SAMs, some gunships, gun boats and frigates, Harriers, Shenyang F-7s, Mirage Jets.\n\nThis port lags quite a lot, which takes away from the immersion and overall playing experience. It also has a number of differences from the computer versions, from graphics and cutscenes to missions themselves.\n\nI try to destroy as many targets as possible, except for aircraft, because those spawn indefinitely and get immediately replaced once you kill them. After completing the game, I show extra stuff like animations and game over screens.\n\nAll of the game's plot is absent from the game and is described in its manual:\n\n\"The Middle Eastern state of Arzaria under the command of General Hasouz has invaded the oil-rich principality of Sautar. Western concern hinges on the fact that General Hasouz now has control of a quarter of the World's oil production as well as having a springboard to attack the neighboring country of Yabal. If this were to happen sources close to the government say that the whole balance of power in the region would be over-turned. The Secretary General of the United Nations has stated that the air forces of the Commonwealth of Soviet States will fly alongside NATO forces in an attempt to liberate Sautar. The Russian built MiG-29 will be the spearhead of the operation...\n\nOPERATION: RED WITCH: In order to allow NATO's Quick Response Force to embark on a land offensive to recapture Sautar, the Arzarian Command Control and Communications system (CCU) has to be destroyed. It is housed in the dusty town of Al Tamas deep in enemy held territory. The main target, the CCC itself, is made up of four buildings in the center of town. It is vital that these buildings and no others be destroyed. Public opinion of the military operation could turn if there is any collateral damage.\n\nOPERATION: BLUE SEA-SPRITE: The \"Chester\", a Dallas class ICBM submarine carrying a crack QRF commando group, has run aground and been captured by the Arzarian navy. Arzarian gunships have managed to attach high-tensile steel cables to the sub and are towing it to the artificial harbor at Tabor. Your mission is to free the Chester and escort it back to safety. The mission will only be complete when the sub docks at friendly harbor. \"Spy in the Sky\" satellites show that a fully operational Arzarian navy battle-group consisting of two frigates is heading to the area at full speed to give support to the towing gun-ships. This battle group will almost certainly be protected by helicopter patrols. The satellites also show an enemy frigate in dock at the harbor at Tabor. This makes the whole harbor area a valid military target. You must destroy all enemy gunboats to prevent them from attacking the sub once you've freed it. If the submarine is destroyed, the mission is a failure.\n\nOPERATION: YELLOW DRAGON: The tide of the battle is turning. QRF ground forces are advancing, over-running Arzarian front-lines and cutting their supply lines. Now, however, a new danger exists. As our ground forces advance, they put themselves in danger from attack by medium range \"Freedom\" missiles. Military intelligence has given you the location of the launchers. They must be destroyed at all costs. In this mission you will have to go \"Head to Head\" with the infamous Capital Guard, General Hasouz's elite and highly trained air force. The effectiveness of these pilots is greatly aided by a flying radar system installed in a nearby AWACS plane. The silos are underground and can only be destroyed by firing at them when directly overhead. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKh6ksq8r6U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKh6ksq8r6U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKh6ksq8r6U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [549] MiG 29 Fighter Pilot", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\r\n\r\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nMiG-29 Fighter pilot is a combat flight simulator video game released by Domark in 1993.
