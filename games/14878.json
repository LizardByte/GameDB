Although it is dangerous for humans to leave their homes after dark, the brave knights known as the Curia are trained to fend off the ever growing threat.\n\nAmong them is Arnice, a warrior of great skill and the protagonist of Nights of Azure. While she\u2019s skilled with a blade, her talents aren\u2019t just a product of her training. Arnice has some demon blood herself and is actually the only human that has managed to touch azure blood and survive! This event hasn\u2019t left her unscathed and its thrilling implications become apparent quite early on; among others, it allows her access to a set of impressive abilities including the power to summon monsters to her aid in battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nights-of-azure", "videos": [{"id": 11312, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "b6mHNCzrxJ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6mHNCzrxJ0", "title": "Nights of Azure Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b6mHNCzrxJ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
