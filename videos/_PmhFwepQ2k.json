Set in an isolated 1990s Polish lakeside town, players receive unsettling messages from a former coworker who is nowhere to be found. Players must venture into the town to not only find out the truth but to realize the fate of their coworker. The game uses Sonka's proprietary 2XD Rendering technology allowing for real-time lighting and a 3D camera amongst the pixel-art style. Players can also switch seamlessly between a third-person perspective for shooting and a classic top-down view for exploring. Holstin is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC with a demo available now via Steam.\n\n#Holstin #Gameplay #Horror", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_PmhFwepQ2k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_PmhFwepQ2k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_PmhFwepQ2k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_PmhFwepQ2k/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_PmhFwepQ2k/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Holstin - Official Combat Gameplay Reveal Trailer", "description": "Holstin is a retro-inspired psychological survival horror game developed by Sonka.
