{"id": "1xeKa89N4SY", "snippet": {"title": "Aquadine Trailer", "description": "A brief trailer for visual novel \"Aquadine\" from SoftColors.\n\nAquadine is a romance fantasy visual novel about secret identities, an ancient underwater civilization, and a gondolier who's trying to save his mother from a mysterious disease.\n\nEveryone wears a mask. Everyone has something they cannot share, whether it is their feelings, their regrets, or even their identities. Even the town you live in carries an ocean of secrets. Of course, Robin is no exception. Under a different name, he works part-time as a famous gondolier to pay for his mother's hospital bills. But as he lives out both of his lives, he will meet others who are willing to share that burden.\n\nFour years have passed since Robin Liyun\u2019s mother, Torrie, was diagnosed with an unknown disease that weakened her ability to see and walk. Torrie is Aquadine\u2019s most famous gondolier from the Cloud Company, but despite that, she is also a single mother. Robin has to work part-time in her place in order to pay off her hospital bills, but he could never live up to his mother\u2019s reputation. Compared to how she was able to consistently satisfy her customers, Robin is considered a disappointment - a failure. Tourists stopped coming to the Cloud Company, which left him in a financial bind and desperate to save his mother. After receiving advice from his grandfather Himmel, Robin took on an alternate identity under the alias of Ciel - a gondolier whose personality and style closely matches Torrie. The changes were successful. Cloud Company, once again, became the most requested gondolier service and Ciel was recognized as Torrie\u2019s worthy successor. Robin has been living a double life ever since, but he later meets friends who will support him.\n\nAVAILABLE NOW:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1275150/Aquadine/\nhttps://softcolors.itch.io/aquadine\n\nFOLLOW US:\nWebsite: https://www.studiosoftcolors.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/aquadinememo...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/studiosoftcolors/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/softcolorsVN\nItch: https://softcolors.itch.io/aquadine\n\n-Staff-\nDirector: Brian Trieu\nScenario: Brian Trieu\nCharacter Illustration: MyLovelyDevil, Cirel\nBackground Illustration: Zhia2chen, Closz\nMusic: Farhan Sarasin, Allan Brown\nTrailer: Adirosa", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xeKa89N4SY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xeKa89N4SY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xeKa89N4SY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xeKa89N4SY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xeKa89N4SY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Aquadine Trailer", "description": "A brief trailer for visual novel \"Aquadine\" from SoftColors.\n\nAquadine is a romance fantasy visual novel about secret identities, an ancient underwater civilization, and a gondolier who's trying to save his mother from a mysterious disease.\n\nEveryone wears a mask.
