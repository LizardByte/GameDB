Players leave out toys and Japari Buns to attract Friends. The player doesn't directly interact with the Friends when they visit, but can watch them while they play and receive gifts of Pikapika crystals when they leave. Crystals can be spent on new toys or fancier Japari Buns. In addition, the player can complete various challenges by observing special events in-game; witnessing these requires the player to attract particular combinations of Friends to the park at once."}
