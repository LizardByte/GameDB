This involves bringing together your band, perform many heroic deeds to change the public impression of you from \"villain\" to \"hero\" - heroic acts increase Robin's popularity among NPC - and killing the Sheriff and his guards. \n \nThe gameplay can be described as an action RPG. The player controls Robin as he robs from the rich to give to the poor, adventures through Sherwood Forest, defeats the sheriff's henchmen, saves peasants and gathers special objects. \nThere are around 6 extra items you can find in the game, most of which aren't essential but make the game a lot easier. \nArchery plays an important role in gameplay. \n \nThe isometric interface developed for The Adventures of Robin Hood by Millennium Interactive is similar to the interface used in Populous. Robin Hood's interface was later used for Rome: Pathway to Power by Millennium Interactive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-adventures-of-robin-hood", "videos": [{"id": 18796, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "4nfirIeZmNc"}]}
