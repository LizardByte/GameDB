You are defending your base against an oncoming army.  Ground troops, tanks and helicopters are all on aproach, ready to take you out.  They advance from bunker to bunker getting closer and closer... your only hope is to pick 'em off one-by-one before they can get close enough to destroy your base (yes, ala Space Invaders - game over when they get to the bottom of the screen).  Pretty cool.  It alternates between this one level, and a type of bonus round where individual troops are trying to run across the battlefield in an attempt to detonate the mines strewn around the base.  If you pick them off, you're back to another Wave of the army.  \n\nIt would've been a much better game had they not had the issues with speed-up/slow-down.  It's so sporadic it hits a point where it's almost impossible to predict... and the only way to slow it back down it seems is to hit something (easier said than done).  That really destroys the long-term playability and unfortunately I'd never seen this game other than MAME so couldn't tell you what it's supposed to be like.  I think I was on Wave 4 of the army and the speed pretty much shut me down from advancing any further.
