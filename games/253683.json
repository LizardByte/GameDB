It was released in selected Asian countries on December 23, 2019 following an open beta in the Philippines beginning on November 20, 2019. It is available in five languages: English, Malaysian, Indonesian, Thai, and Traditional Chinese.\n\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Medallion Battle, two players face off with teams consisting of six Pok\u00e9mon. Up to two of these Pok\u00e9mon may either be Great Ball or Ultra Ball tier; this amount increases as players progress through the various Gyms. In addition, no two Pok\u00e9mon from the same evolutionary family may be used simultaneously, and no more than two Legendary Pok\u00e9mon (as indicated by a Crown at the top of each medal) per team.\n\nPlayers take turns playing Pok\u00e9mon from their Bench face down; their tier is visible on the back of the medallion, putting the player who goes first at a disadvantage. On the first turn, the player with the higher Rating goes first; otherwise, the winner of the previous turn goes first. After both medallions are played, they are turned face up and any applicable powers activate. Once a power is activated, it cannot be used again for the remainder of the match.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon with the higher CP wins the fight, scoring their side a point. The player who goes first wins any tie. The first player to score 3 points wins the match.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-medallion-battle"}
