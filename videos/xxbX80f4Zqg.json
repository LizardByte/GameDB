It's quite easy to tell, as the animation here is mediocre compared to the later HE games and how you can't skip movement phases. I visited every location this game has, even all of the caves.

This was the first HE game I ever played (at least, it feels like it), and even though I have high nostalgia for this game, honestly it doesn't stand up to the later HE games. It does have my favorite HE music ever, though (The Sunken Ship). With such an awesome theme, you would expect there to be more great ones, but the rest of the soundtrack is simply solid, to say the least. There's really nothing else that stands out except for a couple of other background themes.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xxbX80f4Zqg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xxbX80f4Zqg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xxbX80f4Zqg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xxbX80f4Zqg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds Walkthrough", "description": "Buy this game on Steam! http://store.steampowered.com/app/283940/\nAll illegal download requests and/or links will be removed on the spot, no questions asked.\nI AM NOT UPLOADING ANY MORE WALKTHROUGHS TO THIS ACCOUNT.
