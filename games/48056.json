Versions were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and Apple II. The game is based on the 1986-1989 version hosted by John Davidson. The photo of the set is from the 1985 series pilot (the actual show had no gold stars on the studio floor and more elaborate risers for the cars).\n\nPlayers have to either agree or disagree with fictitious celebrities to earn squares and make tic-tac-toe. Much like the TV series, winning one of the first two games is worth $500, the third game is worth $1,000 and the second game is always the \"Secret Square\" game. The winner then goes on to the bonus round, where they have to choose one of five keys and insert it into the proper car among the five offered.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hollywood-squares"}
