The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...\n\nLike most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a \"hub\" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 48126, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "K8ip8frzPZc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8ip8frzPZc", "title": "The Addams Family (TurboGrafx CD) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8ip8frzPZc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
