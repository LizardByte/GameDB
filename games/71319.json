Both are action-based helicopter sims very similar to the original Comanche. A notable difference is that in some missions you are allowed to land and refill your helicopter with fuel and ammo. The only real difference between the two games is the helicopter you fly: either the RAH-66 Comanche or the Ka-50 Hokum. There's an option to link both games to play over a network.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/werewolf-vs-comanche-2-dot-0"}
