Each player (which the game supports a simultaneous two player mode) controls one member of their team on offense and defense and the basic objective is to move the ball up the field to reach the opposition end zone. This is done using a series of \"downs\", there being four downs available to move the ball ten yards forward. If a player fails to achieve that then the ball turns over to the opposition offense. The player can also score by opting to attempt to kick the ball between the opponent's goal (called a field goal and worth fewer points than a touchdown).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blitz", "videos": [{"id": 106200, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9qend3Al4Rw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qend3Al4Rw", "title": "Vectrex - Blitz!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9qend3Al4Rw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
