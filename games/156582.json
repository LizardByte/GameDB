Each character has their own fighting style to fight against as well as a perk and a weakness.\n\nBlock attacks with your hands or forearms, or bob and weave, push their arms out the way, or move about, how you fight is up to you. But your opponents might use different strategies also, so you must learn how to foresee their attacks and how best to attack them.\n\nYour opponents all have the same controls as you, no advantage, no disadvantage. Except on easier levels they will have less strength - they will also have their speed and intelligence reduced.", "summary": "First person VR Kung Fu combat against a variety of different opponents, with a variety of different fighting styles, special moves and back stories", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-fist-vr-kung-fu", "videos": [{"id": 102425, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RXGBED4gr4M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXGBED4gr4M", "title": "Dragon Fist   Quest 2 & Steam VR Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RXGBED4gr4M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
