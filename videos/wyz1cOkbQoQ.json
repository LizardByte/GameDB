That was until the Skystone shattered, spreading noxious Haze across the land and leaving foul Mimic creatures in its wake. The survivors took refuge in a floating city in the sky while the land below was consumed, and remained there for 200 years. Today, the three factions have united to return to the Ground, exterminate the Mimics, and reclaim the land.\n\nIn Remnants of Skystone, players can choose to play as one of three distinct classes \u2014 the jetpack-wearing Aeronauts, the agile Ferrics, or the rope-swinging Crags \u2014 and will explore areas on the Ground with 2D, side-scrolling, platforming gameplay. Main missions and quests are undertaken in single-player gameplay, and players can team up with others in Co-op Trailblazing missions that change weekly. Spoils from missions can be used to decorate the players' personal housing called Floats, where other players can also visit to socialize. Players can also visit the central floating city of Nidaria to meet up with other players, take on missions and quests, and shop for new clothing, furniture, or restoratives.\n\n\nMusic is \"Call for Heroes (no choir version)\" by Pierre Gerwig Langer.\n\nThis game is no longer in development and shut down on May 30th, 2014.\n\nThe game's official website is still up but not active:\nhttp://www.remnantsofskystone.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyz1cOkbQoQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyz1cOkbQoQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyz1cOkbQoQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyz1cOkbQoQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyz1cOkbQoQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Remnants of Skystone Trailer", "description": "Long ago the mysterious Skystone loomed over the land of Etherea, where it became central in the development of three surrounding societies.
