Among the members of this team is Jameson, an old soldier with a dark past he\u2019s trying to forget.\n\nJust as the ship carrying Jameson and his team arrives, it experiences a catastrophic electrical failure and crash-lands upon the planet\u2019s surface, with Jameson the only apparent survivor. Trying to reopen communications with the Ravenwood corporation, he comes across what\u2019s left of the mining operations upon this desolate planetscape, and learns a truth far more sinister than he ever could have imagined...\"", "summary": "\"Japan's take on classic Commodore 64/Amiga action-adventure games. NOT a Metroidvania. Use your wits and your weapons to discover an ancient secret and gain your redemption. Art and music by Japanese legends of console gaming.\n\nExile's End is an homage to early 90's action-adventure PC games like Flashback and Another World, but with a Japanese flair. The core of the game is from Australian game maker Magnetic Realms with art, cutscenes, and music provided by legends of the 8 and 16-bit eras from Japan. It draws its thematic influence from the science-fiction films and anime of the 80's and its gameplay from classic Amiga and Commodore 64 action-adventures.\n\n- Music From Keiji Yamagishi (Ninja Gaiden NES, Tecmo Bowl, Captain Tsubasa)\n- Art by staff from Secret of Mana,First Kiss Story, Mother 3, and more!\n- NES-style cutscenes by OPUS (Half-Minute Hero)\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 10365, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4hhc97FNd2s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hhc97FNd2s", "title": "Exile's End: New Survival Mode", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4hhc97FNd2s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
