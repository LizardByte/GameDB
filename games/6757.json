He's a brilliant, eccentric, sarcastic professor with few friends but a healthy obsession for solving mysteries. One day, a woman named Marie visits Lautrec bearing a curious gadget. The mysterious map that the gadget displayed seemed to point the way to a fantastic hidden treasure belonging to Louis XIV of the House of Bourbon, a dynasty that had collapsed a century earlier. As they search for the treasure, they find themselves targeted by a mysterious man named Vidocq. They are blocked at every turn by the Knights of the Iron Mask, a mysterious group of men with iron masks and claws. Work as Doctor Lautrec, aided by his perky and emotional sidekick Sophie, to unlock the mysteries within and search for the lost treasure of Louis XIV. Search for clues, solve puzzles to unlock new mysteries and gain more information as the quest continues. The story is told in both 2D and uses the power of the Nintendo 3DS in 3D to enhance game play giving gamers the ability to look around for clues like they're in the game. Immerse yourself in the world of Doctor Lautrec where mystery and adventure can be found around every corner.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doctor-lautrec-and-the-forgotten-knights"}
