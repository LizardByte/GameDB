The golfer has been identified as Mario in supplemental material, albeit not wearing his traditional shirt and overalls. The gameplay of Golf is relatively simple. The player is given a ball, and a map on the right side of the screen shows the hole that they must hit the ball into. The obstacles on the way are also displayed on the map. The player will get more points depending on how many times they hit the ball to get it into the hole. Many different types of clubs are also available to choose from by pressing Up/Down on the + Control Pad.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 27660, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "yejohkOqqD4"}]}
