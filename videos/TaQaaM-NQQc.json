{"id": "TaQaaM-NQQc", "snippet": {"title": "Samba de Amigo (Dreamcast) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 2000 music/rhythm game for the Sega Dreamcast, Samba de Amigo.\n\nThis playthrough shows the arcade and original modes played on the hard difficulty level. I showed every song in the game that I could (including DLC) without triggering Youtube's copyright warnings (so sorry if one of your favorites is missing - I did my best to make it as all-inclusive as I could!). Please do keep in mind that this is the original US version - the Japanese-exclusive update (Samba De Amigo 2000) had a somewhat different list of songs. \n\n3:39 Arcade mode \n  -The Cup of Life\n  -La Bamba\n \n9:43 Original mode\n  -Tubthumping\n  -Macarena\n  -Livin' la Vida Loca\n\n16:45 Other songs in the game begin here, all played through on Original mode but with most of the menu screens cut out between stages\n  -Open Your Heart (from Sonic Adventure)\n  -Sonic, You Can Do Anything (from Sonic CD)\n  -Super Sonic Racing (from Sonic R)\n  -Burning Hearts (from Burning Rangers)\n  -Dreams Dreams (from Nights into Dreams)\n  -Magical Sound Shower (from Out Run)\n  -After Burner (from After Burner)\n  -Opa Opa (from Fantasy Zone)\n  -Rent a Hero No. 1 (from Rent a Hero)\n\nI bought this the day it came out for the Dreamcast way back in 2000. I had no idea what it was when I bought it, but the cover was bright and colorful, it was done by Sonic Team, and it was a music game, so I figured I was safe in buying it. It was uncommonly sound judgment for me at 18 years old, I have to say!\n\nThe game could be played with the (insanely expensive) maraca controllers (iirc the game and the controllers together were close to $100), but what a fantastic experience it offered. The maracas worked incredibly well without any of the nonsense that the broken Wii-version's controls introduced. The controller worked just fine (and actually makes the game a fair amount easier), but you're shorting yourself a bit on the fun factor if you never try it with the intended controls.\n\nAnyways, this game was one of the major faces of the Dreamcast, and it celebrated just about everything that made Sega just a force back in the 90s. The graphics were excellent on a technical level, and the super loud, bright, spastically ADHD stages looked fantastic and changed dynamically with how well you were playing, and the song list was surprisingly good and long (remember, DVDs were not a thing yet in home video game consoles - even if the DC discs held a gigabyte, that was still fairly limited for stuff like video and high-quality audio), and they were all good. The soundtrack was a mix of famous Latin American songs with some other pop trappings thrown in (alongside the Sega branded tracks that were unlocked week-by-week for free as DLC if you connected to the website through the Dreamcast's 56k modem), and even though many of them are covers instead of the original radio tracks, they all have been done pretty well. I always did wonder, though - why the apparent obsession with Ricky Martin? I know he was popular at the time, but did they expect Livin' la Vida Loca to sell game discs? Funny thought, to be sure.\n\nThe gameplay is wicked simple in traditional Sega fashion, and is just hard enough to challenge without become too frustrating. If you have a Dreamcast, this really is a must play. It certainly earned its place alongside the other epic DC exclusives and arcade ports, and is an essential experience for any Sega fan.  \n\nFinally, I'd recommend watching this at the 1080p60 option. The original game is only 480p, but the data used for the 1080p setting smooths out most of the compression artifacts YouTube introduces. Crazy colors, fast moving backgrounds, analog signal artifacts, and lots of red  = a nightmare combination to compress well at low bitrates. Red is a just a pain to compress no matter what, since it bleeds so badly with most codecs!\n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TaQaaM-NQQc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TaQaaM-NQQc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TaQaaM-NQQc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TaQaaM-NQQc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TaQaaM-NQQc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Samba de Amigo (Dreamcast) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 2000 music/rhythm game for the Sega Dreamcast, Samba de Amigo.\n\nThis playthrough shows the arcade and original modes played on the hard difficulty level.
