She attracts Relics to herself without the aide of a buddy character (except when she's on her last hit, you'll have to manually collect then), and will change colors on her highlights to show her own health.\n\nWe've begun tweaking mechanics, and replacing important stuff like Gems with our own type of collectables known as Relics. Their color is what determines their value, and they increment a bit differently, and have far more variety in terms of their looks. They have a lot of common models that can be used (as color is always what determines their value), some level specific models, and even some easter eggs!\n\nAll in all, we've been pretty busy and productive with the changes lately... there's still quite a bit of Spyro assets in the game in the process of being swapped (most of the sounds), but for now, we thought we'd give you a little taste of what's up with the project since the C&D!\n\nHopefully we'll be able to get out a new demo in the next few months, since we had to remove the previous ones, but for now, if you want to keep more up to date on things regarding the new direction of the project, you can go here, to the Zera: Myths Awaken Discord:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/nsHK9q4\n\nOr you can check on our new subreddit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ZeraOfficial/\n\nAnd even further details can be found on our new Wikia here:\n\nhttps://zera-myths-awaken.wikia.com\n\nAs always though, thanks for watching, and stay tuned for more information about this in the near future!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xVE1VNxRmE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xVE1VNxRmE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xVE1VNxRmE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xVE1VNxRmE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xVE1VNxRmE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Zera: Myths Awaken", "description": "So... with the recent news, I'm sure you all know by now that we could no longer continue as a Spyro fan game, and instead would have to either stop development or continue the game as it's own brand new IP and spiritual successor (we chose the latter :D).\n\nWell, we've been hard at work since the C&D trying to figure out things and replace stuff, and today I'm finally back here to reveal what that new IP is... \n\nZera!\n\nShe is an Axolotl/Sugar-Glider hybrid inspired creature of our own design, partially bi-pedal and freaking adorable all around.
