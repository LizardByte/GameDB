Looking around your house, you begin to notice things are different than what you remember. You use a camera to take photos to reveal the truth, to remember what was there. Your memory is fading; the longer things remain different, the faster you succumb. Keys to find, mysteries to solve, a home to explore. You need to keep your memory intact to put together pieces of your life and remember who you are and what has happened. Only then will you get the peace that you desire.", "summary": "Your memory is fading. Things around your home keep changing; they are not what they appear to be.
