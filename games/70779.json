Five years have passed since the events described in EVE: The Fatal Attraction. One day, Kojiroh bumps into a young girl on the street, accompanied by a foreigner. Immediately afterwards he receives a call from his ex-girlfriend, who tells him a girl has been kidnapped, and sends him a picture of that girl. To his astonishment, Kojiroh realizes this is the very same girl he just saw on the street... Meanwhile, Marina encounters a young man who jumps from the roof of a high building in front of her eyes. Examining the body, Marina notices a strange tattoo on the young man's hand. What was the reason for the suicide? What is the meaning of the tattoo? And how is this case connected to the one Kojiroh is investigating? Like all the previous EVE games, this is a traditional Japanese adventure without puzzles. The standard menu-based and point-and-click interfaces are replaced by a new one; whenever you have the freedom of action, you press a combination of buttons on your gamepad. For example, circle button and the left directional button pressed together will make you examine the objects you see to your left, etc. True to the tradition of EVE series, you control both Kojiroh and Marina. You can switch between their scenarios at any time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eve-new-generation"}
