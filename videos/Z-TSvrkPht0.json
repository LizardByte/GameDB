{"id": "Z-TSvrkPht0", "snippet": {"title": "Neo Bomberman (Neo Geo MVS) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Hudson Soft's 1997 action-puzzle game for the Neo Geo MVS, Neo Bomberman.\n\nPlayed through the normal mode on the default difficulty level.\n\nBomberman is quite the man about town, having appeared on more than platforms than just about any other franchise out there in the 1990s. Neo Bomberman was one of the three Neo Geo games that Hudson ever published, and their only system-exclusive in-house developed title for the system. (They also developed Panic Bomber, but that was an upgraded port from the original PC Engine SuperCD2 game.)\n\nIt's a simple game - even by Bomberman standards - largely owing to it being designed specifically for the arcade platform. This one never received any official release on the AES.\n\nThe game is split into two mode - the classic battle mode, and the single-player \"normal\" mode that gives you a series of themed stages to blast your way through. You pick up all the standard sorts of power-ups anyone familiar with the Bomberman series will instantly recognize. It doesn't really add much to the traditional gameplay, but it never seems interested in reinventing the wheel to any degree. The mechanics are as solid and as fast-paced as ever, and it plays exactly like 2D Bomberman should.\n\nThe real draw to this edition of Bomberman is the arcade-style presentation. There are some really cool animated cutscenes throughout: I don't believe that there are any FMV clips, but rather, it looks like the \"moving picture\" style of cutscenes we used to see on the Sega CD and TurboGrafx-CD, just with much more detail and far more frames of animation. The in-game graphics are all prerendered CGI models, somewhat like what we saw in the 32-bit Bomberman titles, and even though they are a bit bland and lack character compared to the older games, they are clean, well-defined, and they animate nicely. \n\nThe sound is classic Bomberman all the way. The sound effects are they same as they always have been, the explosions are loud and bassy, and the music is just as catchy and cheesy as ever. I only wish that the samples were a bit higher quality - the distortion in the digital sound is a bit disappointing for a game that was released in 1997.\n\nNeo Bomberman one of the most obscure widely-released titles in the series, and all nitpicking aside, it's s a lot of fun to blow an hour or two on. It might not live up to the lofty standards set by the Super Bomberman games, but that doesn't stop it from being thoroughly entertaining while it lasts.    \n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z-TSvrkPht0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z-TSvrkPht0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z-TSvrkPht0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z-TSvrkPht0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Neo Bomberman (Neo Geo MVS) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Hudson Soft's 1997 action-puzzle game for the Neo Geo MVS, Neo Bomberman.\n\nPlayed through the normal mode on the default difficulty level.\n\nBomberman is quite the man about town, having appeared on more than platforms than just about any other franchise out there in the 1990s.
