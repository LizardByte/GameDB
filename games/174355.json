This isn't a typical flight simulator, it's a pilot simulator. Our engineers are dedicated to delivering an ultra realistic F18 simulator. Every aspect of landing on an aircraft carrier is in this simulator, including multiple arresting cables, pilot nav system, cockpit chatter, and more. The advanced physics system results in spectacular crashes. In some cases, failed landings are the most rewarding. Upload your crash replays directly to Youtube or save them on your device. Think you can master landing on an aircraft carrier? Try your skills at Night, guided by the vis system, carrier lights, cockpit chatter, and the light of the moon. No two landings are ever the same. See if you can rise the ranks of the leader board.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/f18-pilot-simulator"}
