You are Special Agent Dale Cooper and you\u2019ve found yourself trapped inside of the Black Lodge, a surreal and dangerous place between worlds.\n\nTry as you might, you can\u2019t seem to find anything but the same room and hallway no matter which way you turn. Worse yet, your doppelganger is in hot pursuit! You have no choice but to keep running through the room and hallway (or is it more than one?) and above all else, don\u2019t let your doppelganger touch you! Your extensive physical training in the FBI will provide you a seemingly limitless supply of energy to run as long as necessary, but running out of breath is the least of your worries!\n\nYou\u2019ll find quickly that you\u2019re not alone in the Black Lodge, though your friends are few and far between. Not only that, the lodge itself seems to be actively trying to trip you up at all times! You\u2019ll be dodging chairs and crazed Lodge residents all while trying to keep your own insanity. How long can this go on?\n\nNo time to think of that now -here comes that doppelganger again. Just keep on running through the curtains or it will surely be curtains for you!", "summary": "The Black Lodge is an Atari 2600-style Twin Peaks video game for PC and Mac, complete with retro 8-bit graphics and a chiptune soundtrack.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twin-peaks-black-lodge-2600"}
