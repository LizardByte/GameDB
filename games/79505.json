It is the Playstation version of the 3rd arcade game in the beatmania series. It is the second game to be released for the Playstation. \n \nSince this is an APPEND release, it needs another beatmania title to act as a key disc to boot the game. \n \nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. \n \nUnlike the arcade counterpart, the Playstation version does not have a combo counter. EXPERT mode is also missing from this version of the game. \n \nThe game features all songs from the arcade release except for 4: Beginning of life, DJ BATTLE, jam jam reggae (FUNKY jam Cookie mix), and SKA a go go. The game has a total of 23 songs.", "videos": [{"id": 38068, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "9xxtXvBmvhE"}, {"id": 38069, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZsmWXwhWDS8"}]}
