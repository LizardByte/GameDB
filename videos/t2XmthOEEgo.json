If you like movies and games in the Star Wars or Star Trek series then you may enjoy this early, 1970's video game about traveling through the deep, dark regions of space.  It's like Starfighter a bit, sort of in a first person shooter cockpit view mode.  You fly your spaceship through space and shoot aliens and enemy space craft with your mighty laser beams.  This is a serious old school arcade style retro classic game for gamers who enjoy the history of where modern next gen gaming came from.  There's lots of games out there now on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 and Wii and PS2 that owe a lot to Starship on the Atari VCS.  This is a rare, collectible, obscure game that has a copyright of 1977 and is worthy of owning.  There is not much of a story in Star Ship, it isn't an RPG or straight up 1st person shooter FPS, nor is it a third person shooter TPS or Wing Commander type of game.  It is however a lot of fun and practically ancient with graphics that hark back to the last century and beyond.  We liked it a lot and would live to compare is vs. other games on the newest, upcoming game consoles like PS4 and Xbox 720 (ha ha, joking).  \n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, PS2, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360.
