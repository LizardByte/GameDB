If you have an Interface II joystick adaptor, all 4 of these can be human controlled.\n\nThe control method is unusual, in that the accelerator and the throttle are controlled in combination - releasing the throttle while at the current gear's highest speed will move you up to the next one of the 8 gears. The brake turns into reverse when you reach zero velocity.\n\nThe game has 24 circuits, and points are awarded 7-4-2-1 for each of these, with the championship going to the driver with the most points by the end. Before each race there is a 3-minute qualifying session, in which you lap continuously with the aim of getting the fastest lap.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-stock-car-championship", "videos": [{"id": 19168, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "FXmLPjFLXmE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXmLPjFLXmE", "title": "3D STOCK CAR CHAMPIONSHIP Zx Spectrum", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FXmLPjFLXmE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
