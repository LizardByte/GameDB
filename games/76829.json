And this time, the Perfect Possession is obviously yet another Urban Legend Incident.\n\nThis story is about those who keep watch on Perfect Possession, those who exploit it, those unwittingly dragged into it, and those working to expose the threat behind it...\nThose who have made the mistake of seeing themselves as the strongest duo. This is a bittersweet story about them.", "summary": "Touhou Hyouibana: Antinomy of Common Flowers is the 15.5th official installment of the Touhou Project, developed by Team Shanghai Alice in conjuction with Twilight Frontier.
