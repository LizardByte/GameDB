As mentioned above, one of the virtues of the game is its realism. More than 70 real fighters, real tricks and strikes, development and training of athletes, real tournaments and awards.\nSeparately it is worthwhile to dwell on the chart here all the above praise, thanks to new technologies, developers have been able to realize completely new visual effects such as deformation of the whole body, visualization of tension, appearance and facial expressions. And the newest physical engine has allowed to make movements of sportsmen even more realistic. The EA SPORTS  UFC is one of those simulators in which you will not only strike and hold receptions, but also quickly and accurately assess the situation and make decisions."}
