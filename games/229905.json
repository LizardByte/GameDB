It is the evil Istvan who is behind it and he is demanding a ransom of 1.000.000 gold. Now it's your job to rescue her. You can choose to play one of three characters: Skeeve, Garkin or Frumple. Your adventure takes place in the land of Khlad, a land with two castles and six towns. A grid divides the map into 8 x 7 squares. At the games main menu you can select you desired action: Rest, Eat, Drink, Move, Cast spell, check your stats or remind yourself of your quest. After each move there might be a fight.\n\nThere are two difficulty settings; hard and easy. If you select hard you have to search for the boat (Istvan lives on an island) by going to various towns and listen to the hints the towns people offers you. If you select easy you can ignore that and go straight to the town on the North Peninsula and someone there will tell you how to defeat Istvan.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quest-for-tanda"}
