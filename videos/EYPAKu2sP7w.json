Critically acclaimed, the game was followed by Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 in 1991.\n\nIn the game, the player takes on the role of a pilot flying missions of varying difficulty over four geographic locations: Gaddafi's Libya, the Persian Gulf, the North Cape, and Central Europe. The player was immersed in a Cold War era battlefield, flying missions against Iranian, Libyan, Soviet or Warsaw Pact opponents. The game can be played under conditions of conventional warfare, limited warfare, or cold war (in the latter, even being detected by the enemy could lead to a major diplomatic incident).\n\n\u2588NORTH CAPE\u2588\n- Cold War\n- Air-to-Air Missions\n- Elite Opponents\n- Realistic Landings\n\n\u2588PERSIAN GULF\u2588\n- Conventional War\n- Strike Missions\n- Elite Opponents\n- Realistic Landings\n", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EYPAKu2sP7w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EYPAKu2sP7w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EYPAKu2sP7w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EYPAKu2sP7w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "F-19 Stealth Fighter (PC/DOS) Elite Difficulty, North Cape & Persian Gulf, 1988, MicroProse", "description": "F-19 Stealth Fighter is a combat flight simulator developed and released in 1988 (DOS) and 1990 (Amiga and Atari ST) by MicroProse, featuring a fictional United States military aircraft.
