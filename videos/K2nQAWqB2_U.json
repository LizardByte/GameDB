That unfortunately did not become the case but it's been sitting in my drive ever since then and I finally decided to upload it with sound in full since it was unfortunately muted because I was limited in the technology I had then. I've played it ever since it's inception and It was always my go to game on the site and often become the winner in most outcomes. As you can see I had still kept up with it in 2017 but it's unfortunately now defunct and now unplayable on the official site. I wish I had gotten the chance to document the game to the fullest or at least someone else but it seems to be unlikely by now. I do miss playing this game and would still play it today if I could. I hope for it to become revived whether through official means or by fan support/servers. Maybe it could possibly be renewed as an official game because the concept of seperate cartoon characters coming together fighting and bringing in their own worlds and weapons with them will be one of the coolest things there is in this world. It got me to play and love fighting games even more like Smash Bros and the ones who's song you see here. It's a hidden gem and If it ever is salvaged I hope you all play it, thanks for reading  :^)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K2nQAWqB2_U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K2nQAWqB2_U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K2nQAWqB2_U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K2nQAWqB2_U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "TKO: Titanic Kungfubot Offensive, Old Gameplay on Cartoon Network", "description": "Footage Date: May 20th, 2017\nThis game is called TKO otherwise known as Titanic Kungfubot Offensive which was a flash fighting game and the footage I have here is from a while back in 2017 when I played with a friend in hope to upload it.
