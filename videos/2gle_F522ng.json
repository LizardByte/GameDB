There's infinite procedurally generated voxel based terrain complete with caves, ores, and trees, just like in Minecraft. And this is all done by generating meshes and using chunks and all that good stuff. Except there's a twist. Because this time, the physics are realistic and if you break a tree or something, it'll fall. Every block is destructible and will interact with the physics system. Also, the player and mobs are all ragdolls, which allows everything to be realistic and physics based. Need to break a block? Just hit it with your pickaxe. Need to build a house? Just throw a few blocks on the ground. Zombies annoying you? Just take a few whacks with your sword. It's great.\n\n//similar videos and inspirations\nI Made Minecraft in 24 Hours by Sam Hogan\nhttps://youtu.be/Nj8gt_92c-M\nI Made Minecraft but M Rated by Kyle Rhoads\nhttps://youtu.be/-Lecf3b7tPQ\nMinecraft in Unity Tutorial Series by b3agz\nhttps://youtu.be/h66IN1Pndd0", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2gle_F522ng/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2gle_F522ng/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2gle_F522ng/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2gle_F522ng/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2gle_F522ng/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "I Made Minecraft but with Realistic Physics", "description": "Minecraft is pretty cool, but I've always found the physics to be a little lacking.
