In the chaos that followed, the people began to deceive and backstab each other. Their King used his powerful magic to steal away people\u2019s ability to speak and hurled himself into the Abyss. His daughter, the Princess, cried an endless flood of tears until they encased her in a giant crystal teardrop.\n\nMany years after these events faded to memory, seven rainbow-colored lights flew from the Abyss. These rays of hope appeared before the Princess manifesting themselves as seven heroes, ready to answer the Princess' call for help. Why did the King abandon his daughter and his people? And why did he steal their ability to speak?", "summary": "Seven heroes, seven fighting styles.
