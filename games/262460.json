The first player or team to remove all their opponent\u2019s cups wins.\n\nBut there\u2019s a twist\u2026\n\nBounce shots can remove two cups in one go, but also allow the defending player the chance to swat the ball away.\n\nFrom the same folks who brought you the critically-acclaimed, Eleven Table Tennis, this game is simple to learn but deceptively challenging to master. Use the motion controllers to adjust the speed and angle of your throw to outthink and bluff your opponent.\n\nAnd trust us on this one\u2026 that delicious chime in your brain when you sink a perfect arcing shot into an opponent\u2019s cup never gets old.\n\nBounce Shot is a game suitable for all ages and skill levels, even those who are brand-new to VR. Want your grandparents (or your grandchildren) to have their first crack at virtual reality? This is the perfect game to introduce them to the experience.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bounce-shot"}
