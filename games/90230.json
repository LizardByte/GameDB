Medical droids serve as gatekeepers between patients and doctors. The activities of beggars and buskers are regulated and tasked. Airport security is taken to an more extreme, disconcerting level. As the player, you will have your work cut out for you finding what you're looking for when the system is stacked heavily against you.", "summary": "A Canadian point-and-click adventure game about lost identity in a bureaucratic world loosely inspired by Douglas Adams\u2019 Bureaucracy (1987)..
