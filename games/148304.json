The little witch raves about Joachim, a boy from her school. She writes him a real love letter, which she bewitches with a special love spell. This starts a big mess! Because wherever the postman comes with the letter, the Neustadt citizens fall in love: the policeman falls in love with the traffic light, the neighbors with Bernhard Blocksberg and Ms. Kolumna with their own reflection in a mirror! A funny sight, but now the city is upside down - the Neustadt newspaper cannot be printed, the cars are stuck in a traffic jam and the neighbors want to kiss Bernhard. In 12 individual games, the players help Bibi to put everything back in order and undo the witchcraft of love. They have to step in for Bibi's friends selling ice cream, sort articles for the Neustadt newspaper, take on a ship christening or save Bernhard from the kisses of the neighbors.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 54035, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NPUSjyUAUAA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPUSjyUAUAA", "title": "12) Bibi Blocksberg und der verhexte Liebesbrief - PC Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NPUSjyUAUAA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
