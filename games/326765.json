Panicked screams erupted, as her innards splattered on the pavement.\nTurning back time to see for himself what in the world happened, he frantically made his way up to the roof and threw open the door. He was greeted by a scene he never expected.\nSuzuki Miu, a first-year girl, was right in the middle of confessing her feelings to his best friend... as Rei waltzed in at the worst possible moment.\n\nNot only is Miu painfully shy, but luck never seems to be on her side. Naturally, it took her everything she had and more just to work up the courage to convey her feelings.\nIn contrast, Rei is only able to confess his feelings with the help of his pocket watch \u2014 something he admits himself. Moved by the strange girl and her determination, he decides to do everything in his power to make her second confession succeed.\nThat is how their bizarre three-way relationship came to be.\n\nMeanwhile, our protagonist has to somehow gather up the courage to confess his feelings to one of the other heroines.\n\nThis is only the first page of Rei Sawatari's story.", "summary": "Next in line to manage a multi-million dollar corporation is our protagonist, Rei Sawatari.
