It was released in Japan on August 26, 2010. The word airou is the Japanese equivalent of felyne, a fictional sapient cat species that appears in all of the Monster Hunter games. The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-hunter-diary-poka-poka-airu-village"}
