A world populated with industrious inhabitants enjoying a comfortable and free lifestyle. A breakaway faction has developed, set on disrupting the peace and stability.\n\nThey have evolved a new kind of science, enabling them to build a super defence shield which will make them invincible. In order to construct this, they need to find a curious array objects located across this strange planet. Jellyhead, a special volunteer from the group, takes on this hazardous mission.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a little problem. The existing powers know of this cunning plan and have dispatched their own formidable agent: Dr. Subtech Plus. This most positive agent needs to reach the objects first to thwart the schemes of the negative faction. Confident of success, they will then be rid of this irritating breakaway group and can restore the planet to normal.\n\nThese two sides have opposite ways of looking at the world and everything appears back to front to the other. Who is going to win? Which side are you on?", "summary": "Big Bang is an undeniably psychedelic platformer created by the mysterious coding group known as Psycore.
