Watch out when facing the bosses of the Arachnid Quarter, or you\u2019ll soon see yourself become nothing but another careless fly caught in their cunning webs.\n\nThe Plague Quarter\nThere are two pretty good indicators you\u2019ve set foot in the Plague Quarter: one, the feeling that you\u2019ve just stepped into something that\u2019ll necessitate an immediate change of footwear, and two, the unmistakable smell of Heigan. He\u2019s the guy the other undead call \u201cthe Unclean.\u201d\n\nThe Military Quarter\nAtteeen-shun! The Scourge is an army, and the Military Quarter is where useless undead who don\u2019t know which end of the stick to point at the enemy are turned into ministers of death, praying for war.\n\nThe Construct Quarter\nThe Construct Quarter is home to the most terrifying experiments in reanimation and foul necromancy ever attempted, and they\u2019re always looking for new specimens.\n\nThe Frostwyrm Lair\nThe final challenge of Curse of Naxxramas. Only two bosses lie between you and ultimate triumph. All you need to do is defeat a giant flying undead dragon that breathes ice and eats adventurers for breakfast, and a cunning necromancer whose mastery of the dark arts has granted him immortality in undeath and who rules over Naxxramas with an iron fist.", "summary": "Curse of Naxxramas is Hearthstone's first adventure.\n\nSet in the Scourge necropolis of Naxxramas, Curse of Naxxramas is a five-wing adventure, with each wing representing one of the wings of the World of Warcraft Naxxramas raid instance.
