Every 30 days the Reactor melts down, releasing an enormous wave of energy that restarts the loop. Only a few lancers are aware of the loop at first, and to stop it they\u2019ll need to get back to the Reactor (or die trying).\n\nUnfortunately, only the 3 Trusts \u2014 OmniTrust, Evolution Solutions, and Hyperbotics \u2014 have access codes to the Reactor\u2019s AI brain, and they won\u2019t give up these \u201ckeys\u201d willingly.", "summary": "Time is ticking in the city of Atlas. It\u2019s up to you to prevent the Reactor from melting down. Recruit your team from an ever-growing roster of fierce freelancers to recover the Reactor keys from the evil Trusts.\n\nExperience rogue-lite gameplay like never before as you complete dynamic missions and navigate deadly combat zones to kill the Necrolancers while evading their attacks. Fail to stop the meltdown and watch as time loops back, filling every new run with unique content.\n\nWhether playing solo or with a group of friends in exhilarating co-op, every move matters in turn-based PvE combat, so strategize wisely how to grow your power and gather the intel you need to defeat the Trust bosses. Your squad has to work together to survive together in this thrilling addition to the Atlas universe.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atlas-rogues", "videos": [{"id": 43770, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "qgFh09UwzoY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgFh09UwzoY", "title": "Atlas Rogues - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qgFh09UwzoY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 43771, "name": "Early Access Trailer", "video_id": "NsKU5lcTHvg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsKU5lcTHvg", "title": "Atlas Rogues - Early Access Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NsKU5lcTHvg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
