They are field agents of The Museum of Fantastic Phenomena, and travel through time collecting unique items. In the games, the arch-villain Ram Axis, a virus spawned in the great crash of 2093, will often pop up in disguise in order to prevent their efforts. Players explore a virtual environment by clicking on the onscreen knobs and directional controls to move through the game. They click on images to talk to people, collect treasure and other items that may boost or diminish their energy level or are needed to solve puzzles. Information can also be retrieved from Yondo's data bank collar.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-awesome-adventures-of-victor-vector-and-yondo-the-hypnotic-harp", "collections": [{"id": 5776, "name": "The Awesome Adventures of Victor Vector & Yondo"}]}
