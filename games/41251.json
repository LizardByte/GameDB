In the game, players can choose to play alone or with other cars. Cars have a certain amount of health and fuel, which decreases whenever the player crashes into a wall or another car, as well as whenever he or she drives off of the road. This game, along with its sequel, was possibly an ancestor to the Mario Kart series, most likely due to the fact that it features Mario and possesses similar 2D racing mechanics, which was later carried on to Super Mario Kart.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/famicom-grand-prix-f-1-race", "videos": [{"id": 35338, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5j2dYVlw7Ek"}]}
