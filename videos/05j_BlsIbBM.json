{"id": "05j_BlsIbBM", "snippet": {"title": "Amiga Longplay Breathless", "description": "http://www.recordedamigagames.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nRelease date: 1995\n\nI started out spraying bullets, noticing later that the enemies needs more and more damage to die, so I started to run out of ammo. I had to upgrade to a better weapon, which uses more ammo per bullet, so ammo still went down fast. I began trying to aim more carefully, shooting one bullet a a time and stuff. Later in the game there were just tons of ammo everywhere but I now still played with the ammo-saving habit anyway. As the game is fairly easy and I skipped most health packages, at later levels I just didn't bother trying to avoid enemy fire as much, sometimes standing still to better aim while taking damage.\n\nI played the first 4 levels once before playing again and recording, to know what to do and where to go etc, for a smoother longplay. But that takes too much time so after that I play all levels for the first time. I pretend to be careful, moving slowly around corners and stuff, which of course is not needed (as the game is fairly easy), but I did it for fun and to make it more exciting :P. I could just as well have run straight into everything, which is how I would have played if I didn't record.\n\nAs I didn't know how easy credits would be to obtain, I wanted to use the starting weapon as long as possible, not spending credits on upgrades as I wanted to have enough later on for the best weapon. But like I said above, I had to upgrade later. Turned out there were way more credits than I expected. At the end of the game I could have bought all weapons if I wanted to, but didn't. I only went with the best one + its upgrade. Most of them look pretty much the same anyway, so I didn't feel it was necessary to include the others.\n\nThe game has several bugs (emulator related? donno, but probably not). (1)At one point I got stuck in an elevator, couldn't get out of it, it was when it was going down, the player froze in place and couldn't move, so had to load a save state. (2)Another one is with those teleports, this was easily replicated. Just walk on a level above where there's a teleporter beneath + had to be against a wall (somewhat difficult to explain), and you would fall through the floor down to the teleporter. (3)You will probably notice me rotating to the left several times now and then, that's because right before that, you maybe notice how when I try to turn to the right, the view just resets back. There seems to be a lame limit of how many times you can turn around clockwise, when you reach that limit (happened several times), you can't go further and have to turn around the other way to be able to turn right again. (4)The music on the first level, which is used on every first level of the four worlds is broken/doesn't emulate probably/working as intended/donno. At a certain point in that tune, one of the instruments doesn't cancel and keeps on going (annoying sound) until another sound is used in that sound channel again.\n\nWas hard to NOT waste a lot of ammo as the enemies move around a lot, and my mouse suck (the laser underneath reading the surface for movement is sensitive to white and shiny surfaces, which is what I'm using :P, making the cursor lose focus and jump around quite often). I need to get a mouse mat/book/magazine to use it on, used to do that, but don't play FPS games normally so it hasn't bothered me much, until now.\n\nWorld 1:\n\nArena 1: 01:11\nArena 2: 04:33\nArena 3: 09:30\nArena 4: 15:42\nArena 5: 29:39\n\n[can't be bothered to insert all the starting times for the different levels]\n\nHmm, what else... oh yeah, this game is only on 3 disks (1.8mb)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs it took forever to encode this movie on my slow computer, this time there won't be a HD version (I usually encode a special 720p+ version for YT), which would of course look awesome compared to the crap quality it has now.\n\nIf you care for quality and are planning to watch most of this longplay, I suggest you download it from our site, as 50fps is waaaay more enjoyable to watch than the crap fps it gets here on YouTube + the video quality will be better.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05j_BlsIbBM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05j_BlsIbBM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05j_BlsIbBM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05j_BlsIbBM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay Breathless", "description": "http://www.recordedamigagames.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nRelease date: 1995\n\nI started out spraying bullets, noticing later that the enemies needs more and more damage to die, so I started to run out of ammo.
