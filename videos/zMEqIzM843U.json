The story follows the exploits of the silent Main Character, who becomes a hero called the Absolute Victory Unlosing Ranger after the previous Absolute Victory Unlosing Ranger is killed.

Most dungeons, as well as the boss battles at the ends of some dungeons, feature their own unique mechanics and gimmicks, such as cannons that launch the player to a random location on the current floor. Similar to roguelike games, the player is reset to level one upon entering a dungeon. However, upon completing a dungeon or being defeated, the player's current level is added to their Total Level count, which affects their base attributes.\n\nThe gameplay of Z.H.P.
