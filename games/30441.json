Behind fans and opera glasses, audiences whisper that you are a bearer of Genius, a mysterious supernatural power to master your chosen instrument. At the brink of war, spies, generals, and royalty vie for control of the continent. Will you play them all like a fiddle? Who truly holds the strings?", "summary": "Cannonfire Concerto is a 190,000-word interactive novel where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based - without graphics or sound effects - and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Play as male, female or non-binary; gay, straight, bi, or asexual. For some, romance is a means to an end. For some, it's a sonata duet of love and sex. Perhaps both.\n\nWill you and your Genius achieve immortality, or will the poisoned pens of critics slaughter your career? Will you overthrow the church, bringing forth a new era of enlightenment, or defend your kingdom from a secular invasion? The concert hall is silent. The Cannonfire Concerto is about to begin.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cannonfire-concerto"}
