{"id": "r_pDTtSCUR0", "snippet": {"title": "Yakuza (PS2) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 2005 PlayStation 2 RPG beat 'em up hybrid, Yakuza. \n\nI didn't hit all of the side missions, since that would make this way too long, but I cover many of them alongside the main story missions. It shares so many traits with Shenmue it's amazing, it almost feels like they wanted to follow up with the idea but didn't have Suzuki on board, so they came up with something similar. \n\nMy only real qualm with it, and thank god one fixed somewhat for the sequel, was the fighting system. Grrrr - multiple enemies can really be a nightmare when the controls don't cooperate in any reasonable manner. Certainly not enough to ruin the game, but certainly enough to bring it down a few notches from the classic status that it easily could have had. \n\nIt's surprisingly close the setting is to the real thing, too. I spent every night for months in Kabukicho going to bars, Sega arcades, and karaoke places - the representation of the area is spot on. I've been to the fourth floor bowling alley that the game shows in \"Theatre Square!\" And I saw Saw IV subtitled in Japanese at that same theatre near it, hahaha.  So, rest assured, if you want a close look at what one of the funnest places in Tokyo looks like after dark, this will do it with few concessions. I can't believe they even put the real Donki (Don Quixote ;)) in - it's just as claustrophobic and color vomit coated as it looks. \n\nOverall, a sweet game. And damn, does it look nice for a PS2 game! Loads of famous actors too, if you care to check out the credits. \n\n________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_pDTtSCUR0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_pDTtSCUR0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_pDTtSCUR0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_pDTtSCUR0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Yakuza (PS2) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 2005 PlayStation 2 RPG beat 'em up hybrid, Yakuza. \n\nI didn't hit all of the side missions, since that would make this way too long, but I cover many of them alongside the main story missions.
