The player uses the mouse to swap adjacent balls to make rows of three or more, such rows disappear, the remaining balls fall down and new balls are added. Black balls if/when they appear cannot be swapped with anything. The objective is to clear a specified number of balls on each level within a time limit, as the player progresses the time limit gets shorter.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-bounce-out"}
