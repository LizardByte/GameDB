In GunBound, players are assigned to two opposing teams which take turns firing at each other with vehicles called \"Mobiles\" in GunBound parlance. Each Mobile has three unique weapons, labeled \"1\", \"2\", and \"SS\" (Special Shot).\n\nFactors like terrain condition, wind currents and elemental phenomena force players to continuously change their aim and trajectory power setting while rethinking their strategy at the same time. GunBound also implements a \"delay\" turn system which is influenced by the Mobile, the weapon and/or item a player uses\u2014using items or taking time with actions results in a longer wait before the player's next turn.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
