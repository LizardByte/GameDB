Plus, the Namco Museum Evercade carts are Legacy carts, thus they are no longer in active production. And in all fairness, it came out a year before both Evercade and Namco Museum Archives, so it wasn't too bad of a novelty.\n\nIB Review: https://infinitebacklog.net/users/aklim95/reviews/pocket-player-dig-dug\n\nDig Dug, Dig Dug II, The Tower of Druaga (C) Bandai Namco\nMyArcade, MyArcade Pocket Player (C) dreamGEAR\nRecorded via Motorola Moto G 5G Plus\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #myarcade #myarcadepocketplayer #pocketplayer #dreamgear #digdug #digdugii #digdug2 #druaga #thetowerofdruaga #towerofdruaga #famicom #nes #nesgames #famicomgames #namco #namcot #bandainamco", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMTnLESO7is/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMTnLESO7is/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMTnLESO7is/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMTnLESO7is/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZMTnLESO7is/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "MyArcade Pocket Player: Dig Dug - Console Demonstration (Live)", "description": "While the entirety of Ireland was dealing with the power outage for three days as a result of Storm ISHA, I needed to find something to do to keep my sanity in check.
