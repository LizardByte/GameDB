You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.\n\nInitially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trolls", "videos": [{"id": 80380, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "g8Weo9pm9UI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Weo9pm9UI", "title": "Trolls - Intro - Amiga 500", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g8Weo9pm9UI/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4352, "name": "Trolls"}]}
