The\ndestructive nuclear horrors unleashed upon the planet and its population\ncreated uncountable amounts of death and devastation. In the wake of this\nsweeping havoc arose the planet itself to retaliate against the violence\nforced upon it. Polar shifts and massive earthquakes swallowed entire\ncontinents. From seething seas and walls of water arose angry volcanoes,\nspewing flame and death into the sky. Hungry fires, searing blizzards, and\nbrutal storms ran rampant across the planet's surface for years, in an attempt\nto wash away the man-made horrors that it was forced to endure.\n\nAt last the earth settled into a new pattern, starting to find some\nsemblance of balance and peace. The global changes had left a much harsher\nplanet, and the remaining life forms adapted slowly to the new environment.\nThe Earth's land masses, altered by man-made weaponry and ended through\nelemental means, had evolved into ten isolated provinces. The remaining\npopulations within these new provinces found life difficult at first, but\nslowly evolution and natural selection allowed the human race to adapt and\nonce again gain control of their destiny. Some of the provinces had strong\nnatural forces, exposed through the abrupt upheaval, and the resourceful\npost-humans began to master these new powers. Other provinces continued to\ndevelop through the use of science and technology, creating elaborate life\nsupport systems and protection against the harsh environments.\n\nAs the years progressed, eight of the provinces began to communicate and\ntrade together. An alliance was formed and a global quasi-government was\nestablished. The social structure evolved into a mixture of medieval\npractices, hybrid technology, and barbarism and barter.\n\nCenturies have passed and the present day Earth finds mankind again at the\nbrink of savagery and destruction. Life is now a series of hardships,\ndeceptions, and lies for the members of the Provincial Alliance. The frozen\ntundra of Polaria and the volcanic Scorch are very close to all out war,\nhalted only by the desolate, radioactive Death Zone that separates them. The\nDeath Zone, once a founding member of the Planet Alliance, has remained silent\nfor almost two centuries, hiding behind the mysterious and deadly red mists\nthat define its borders. Obsel, the desert province, has been taken over by\ndesperate and brutal female terrorists. The Ebony Coast, known for its trade\nand bartering systems, is now led by a mysterious and greedy leader whom no\none trusts, yet all must tolerate. The people of Cyberia, a land inhabitable\nonly through technological means, have re-engineered their population, and are\nlosing their humanity to the machine.\n\nWith tensions running high, the Planet Alliance is beginning to falter and\nthe provinces are no longer considered allies. And now the High Emperor, the\none guiding force that all provinces had agreed to abide by, has been\nmysteriously and horribly murdered.\n\nThe ancient Provincial Agreement declares that a new ruler must be chosen\nthrough combat between the rulers of each province. Each province will come\nprepared for battle with their own Gauntlet of Ascension, a gloved weapon that\nonly those in power may don. These ancient gauntlets are treasured and\nrevered by their people, for they are the foremost symbol of power and honor\neach province can have.\n\nBut it is painfully clear that this tournament will not have the honor of\nprevious BloodStorm contests. There have even been rumors that the combatants\nwill bring back the Sunder Attack, a brutal combat move that separated the\nopponent's legs from his body without killing him. This horrible and\nhumiliating maneuver has never been officially banned from the BloodStorm\ncontest, yet it is so brutal and degrading that no honorable combatant has\nused it for centuries. However, these champions from radically different\nprovinces are blind to the mysterious evil that surrounds the High Emperor's\ndeath, and instead only see their opportunity for personal gain, provincial\nexpansion, or race domination and will do anything to achieve their goals.\n\nThe BloodStorm is about to begin!", "summary": "One of the bloodiest fighting games of the '90s, BloodStorm introduces a post-apocalyptic grimdark story where leaders of multiple provinces fight to the death to rule Earth.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloodstorm", "videos": [{"id": 10342, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "ade9hmVbDbI"}]}
