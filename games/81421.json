An in-game radar is provided, showing the area around the submarine and any units in the vicinity.", "summary": "The Game Boy version offers the option to play as Ramius or the convoy commander of the Soviet Navy.

The fifth stage shows Greek architecture, an Easter egg where the lost city of Atlantis has been unknowingly discovered. As the convoy commander, the player's mission is to sink the Red October, sparing no expense.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-hunt-for-red-october--1", "videos": [{"id": 119736, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6fetObeULMg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fetObeULMg", "title": "The Hunt For Red October [GB] - Real Time Longplay (No death)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6fetObeULMg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
