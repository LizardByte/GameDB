In the game, players will be training with no-nonsense boxing coach Simon, throwing different punch combos at the pads on his hands by for example tapping to throw a jab or swiping to throw a hook. With continuously incrementing sequences and increasing speed, the game quickly becomes a real challenge, allowing you to effectively train your memory, reactions and coordination while playing. Punch Perfect is the first of many more original games that indie game studio Handprint Games is hoping to release in the coming years.", "summary": "Punch Perfect is a free memory and reaction boxing game now available to download on iOS and Android.
