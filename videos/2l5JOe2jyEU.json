It was one of the three budget compilations as part of their collaboration with Atari SA.\n\nWhile Pong and Asteroids were fine conversions, since the two are generally hard to screw up, Yars' Revenge seems to be off. Although the sound is actually fine, the GBA conversion is actually slower than the original on the Atari 2600.\n\nBeing a budget game for the GBA, there's almost no documentation regarding critic reviews. The only critic review that does exist online is from GameSpot, who gave it a 5/10, stating that \"while this compilation offers a marginally enjoyable trip down memory lane with three Atari classics, it's tough to recommend because the games are so ancient--not to mention that there's a total lack of any ancillary features. The inability to save high scores is particularly tragic.\"\n\nGranted, they aren't exact ports, but credit where it's due, EC-Interactive did a fine job, even if Yars' Revenge isn't exactly as fast as on the 2600.\n\nYars' Revenge, PONG, Asteroids (C) Atari SA\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #atari #atari2600 #arcade #atariarcade #pong #yarsrevenge #asteroids #gba #gameboyadvance \n\nFUN FACT: I actually owned a boxed copy of this game during my vacation in Tenerife a long time ago when I was a kid, probably sometime around 2009 (or was it 2010? 2011?).

When I returned to Tenerife last year, the store that sold this and other retro games sadly closed down.
