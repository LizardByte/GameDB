The game features five playable characters with three partners each. Your player's weaponry depends on the partner chosen at the player select screen.\n\nThe main game mechanic is the Assist Spirit Strike system. By collecting coin items dropped by defeated enemies, you fill up a gauge at the bottom of the screen. Once you have enough money, you can spend some of these coins by pressing C to activate an Assist Spirit Strike, the exact kind varying widely depending on your player character.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-monjusen-bubbling-imaginary-treasures", "videos": [{"id": 131038, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lcPhviBD4UA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcPhviBD4UA", "title": "Touhou: Bubbling Imaginary Treasures (v1.02a) || Lunatic 1 Miss No Bomb No Special Clear", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lcPhviBD4UA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
