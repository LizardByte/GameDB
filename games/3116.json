Ever since she was transformed into a vampire by Shrowdy and whisked off to Draxsylvania, her greatest wish has been to return to Paris, continue her singing career, and one day become a star at the Paris Opera.\n\nWhen Shrowdy fails to return from a nightly foray, she at last sees an opportunity to flee. Together with her only friend and confidant, a cheeky bat named Froderick, she escapes from her prison and tries to find her way back to Paris. During her flight through Draxsylvania, where she encounters some strange inhabitants and some even stranger challenges, Mona must learn not only to accept her vampire nature, but also to use the abilities she has acquired to her advantage.", "summary": "Help Mona De Lafitte escape from Baron Shrowdy von Kiefer and return to Paris!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 68014, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3rH4Xj3nwE0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rH4Xj3nwE0", "title": "A Vampyre Story - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3rH4Xj3nwE0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
