They are lying. You've heard there are fortunes to be made by those brave enough - or hungry enough - to dare the deeps.\n\nDisturb the aberrant societies that flourish in the dark.. Defy wreckers. Seduce a Drownie. Embrace or condemn the distinctly un-British customs of these cold, fathomless places.\n\nYou will definitely die.

Dive into unplumbed abysses and claim their eerie blessings. Seek immortality.\n\n\n- More beautiful, hand drawn art. Let your curiosity take you to what lies beneath the Sea of Statues, Mount Palmerston, and the dread Dawn Machine.\n\n- Convert your ship into a Zubmarine and dive anywhere in open water to discover new cities, zee-beasts and environments to terrify your crew and slake your hungers.\n\n\n- 11 new underzee ports, each with their own tales and opportunities for the enterprising Trespasser.
