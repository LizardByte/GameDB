The basic plot follows the events that began in the first installment, but it is told in an entirely different fashion, with different scenes, dialogues, etc. For example, the game begins a short while before the starting point of the first chapter, and contains conversations between the protagonist Miyu Izawa and the murder victim Marie, which were not present in the original story. The visual style of the game is also quite different, with bright anime-like graphics atypical of the previous entries.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yami-no-ketsuzoku-haruka-naru-kioku"}
