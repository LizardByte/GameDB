Upon their arrival, the detectives witness one of the hospital\u2019s therapists falling out of the window to his death.\n\nShortly after starting their investigation, they learn that much darker things are going on at Mnemosyne Asylum. No one is willing to speak of the devastating fire, which engulfed the hospital four years ago, or the victims who died. The fact that the staff does everything they can in order to obscure the asylum\u2019s story, makes everything even more suspicious.\n\nEach clue uncovered only raises new questions. Who killed Doctor Crow? What caused one of the asylum\u2019s male staff to lose his mind? Who is Zed Rascov? What connects the doctor\u2019s death to the name of the little girl, Ginger, carved into the wood-paneled wall of his office?", "summary": "9 Clues 2: The Ward is the second installment of Tap It Games' casual adventure series with hidden object puzzles, set in the 1950s America in which a young detective and her partner respond to a distress call from a psychiatric hospital on a secluded island.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/9-clues-2-the-ward", "videos": [{"id": 30690, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DWvaBRcAnIk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWvaBRcAnIk", "title": "9 Clues 2 : The Ward - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DWvaBRcAnIk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
