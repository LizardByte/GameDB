But upstanding citizens aren\u2019t the only Senecans benefiting from the city's spoils. In its underbelly, Seneca's criminals, and worse, are finding homes and lairs in all sectors of society.\nYou are Jim Baylor; Seneca's former top detective and law enforcement officer fallen from grace. A man falsely accused of crimes he never committed, stripped of rank, title and honor, and incarcerated with the very people he put away.\n\nBut you don't stay locked up for long. You're released from jail under questionable circumstances. You seek to clear your name, get the dirt on the people responsible for your demise and discover the greater machinations at play. To that aim, and with the help of friends and former colleagues, you open and run a private security agency that hires, manages, trains and deploys agents all across Seneca.\n\nTo root out the cancer gnawing the city you'll have to use all the power and resources available to you from agents, modern surveillance technology, friends in high places, and trust built through your ever-growing network of sources. What better way to righteously clear your name, than by gathering Seneca's best and brightest.", "summary": "Do what it takes to make your fledgling security agency thrive in this 80s noir crime bustin', dirty crossing, vengeance-seeking board game inspired strategy game with dice and cards.
