The result is a photorealistic layout, set in the steam/diesel transition era, that users can submerge themselves in for a complete interactive rail experience.\n\nWhether a steam-era NG enthusiast, or solely interested in SG steam or diesel operation, the 440 board Murchison 2 layout contains a huge variety of interactive and inter-related industries that will keep the train enthusiast immersed for many hours of operational pleasure.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trainz-simulator-murchison-2"}
