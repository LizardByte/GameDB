It stood for over fifty years before the great storm of 1984 brought the ancient structure crashing down. It was only several days later that local police discovered the twelve bodies buried in the ruins. The coach they had been traveling in was forced off the road by the storm. The passengers had taken refuge in the old building.\n\nInvestigators found that a severed central beam, probably snapped by the ferocity of the wind, was the cause of the tragedy. The victims\u2019 remains were hideous crushed, buried deep in wreckage, their twisted bodies mashed together under the weight of the collapse. Only the grim slurry that oozed out from the base made locating the victims possible.\n\nIt is only recently that a sealed suitcase full of clothes emerged from the ruins and was found by a group of happy few (...soon to be fewer). A welcome change as well as a tribute to the golden age of slashers.", "summary": "Our five dear victi\u2026 friends, have decided that if they were to be savagely murdered, they might as well do it with style!\n\nDress your favourite survivor with iconic pieces of fashion from the 80\u2019s!\nThe 80\u2019s Suitcase includes:\n- The Tartan Special Top, The Skull Print Top, the Siberian Tiger Legs, the Stripes of Power and the Ripped Leggings, for Nea\n- The Patches Denim Jacket, the Ripped Jeans and the Leather Pants, for Jake\n- The College Letterman, the Hooded Training Top, the Sports Leggings and the Mauve Presentation Pants, for Meg\n- The Two-tone Coat, the Electric Jacket, the Pale Jeans and the Red Flash Boots, for Claudette\n- The Surf Tones and Dwight Cubed t-shirts, the Brown Slacks and the Watermelon Pants, for Dwight\n\nThese cosmetics were included in the base game for console releases.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-by-daylight-the-80-s-suitcase"}
