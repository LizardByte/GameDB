He's also looking for some stickers he has misplaced, and the player is encouraged to click on everything and visit every room in the house to find all the missing items. As he uncovers animations and plays games, the player will sometimes be directed to Stanley's \"Big Book of Everything\", which he totes around in a wagon along with the items he finds. This book has a page and at least one animal for every letter of the alphabet except X - each page tells a few facts about the animal and offers a printable picture. As the player uncovers Stanley's stickers, they will appear in the book as well. Sometimes Stanley will seize upon an object the player has clicked and use it in imaginative play; for instance, finding his bear slippers makes Stanley pretend to be a bear reaching for a hive full of honey, and upon finding a cardboard tube Stanley puts it on his nose and pretends to be an anteater. These play scenes are accompanied by interesting tidbits about whatever animal he is being.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stanley-tiger-tales"}
