Both Abe and Munch are playable as you use their powers to get past the guards, or use them to your own advantage. Abe's people can also lend a helping hand in fighting off creatures or solving puzzles, while you guide them away from danger. Munch can also control Fuzzles, small critters that can be deadly in packs against enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 71640, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "X6m5kCs4_uc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6m5kCs4_uc", "title": "Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee [GBA] Longplay Walkthrough Playthrough Full Game (HD, 60FPS)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X6m5kCs4_uc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
