Players start with a blank board on which they must place 35 game pieces that appear one by one during the timed turns. Points are scored by fitting the pieces to form solid blocks and clearing the blocks from the board. You've got to move quickly but carefully because missed pieces lose points. \n \nTringo was developed first by Nathan Keir within Second Life, a virtual world that encourages players to create their own content. Brought to the GBA, this handheld version is optimized for portable play for quick play and multiplayer gaming."}
