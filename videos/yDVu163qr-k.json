Explore the island's depths as shipwrecked biologists Amy, Ing-wen, and Riyou, unravelling mysteries both scientific and spiritual, watched over by a supernatural being who exists beyond human history.\n\nSephonie is the newest game from Analgesic Productions' Marina Kittaka and Melos Han-Tani, creators of the Anodyne series, Even the Ocean, All Our Asias and more.\n\n~Parkour-esque platforming~\n\nThe caves of Sephonie vary wildly from lush, jade chasms to reddish flora-filled sandstone caverns. Their physical and rocky layouts demand a fitting moveset! Fling yourself over high ledges using the satisfying Teledash Vault, activate the quick-but-risky Sprint when you need to cover long distances, and deftly Wallrun across dangerous outcroppings.\n\nWhen the obstacles become insurmountable, use the plants and animals of the environment to unlock powerful new abilities like soaring high jumps and swift grapples.\n\n\n~The Relaxing and Casual Puzzle Grid System~\n\nThe trio must research the island's unknown creatures by Linking with them. Using the one-of-a-kind \"Puzzle Grid\" system, you'll rotate and place a series of multi-colored puzzle pieces onto the board, and connect large, same-colored islands. Each creature has different challenges to overcome!\n\nThere's no 'right' solution to Linking: use your intuition to react to the creature's moves and what appears on the board, and you will soon be on your way to success!\n\nThe caves are full of both small and massive creatures, each with their own importance to the cave's ecosystem.\n\n~A Research Trip Gone Awry~\nIn the near future, three biologists are on a joint research trip to use their ONYX implants to research the creatures of the uninhabited Sephonie Island. However, a mysterious phenomenon destroys their ship, leaving them shipwrecked.\n\nAmy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.\n\nThe trio will find their motivations and loyalties put to the test as they navigate Sephonie\u2019s caverns, facing not only rocks and creatures but also their deepest memories and dreams. As they grow more intimate with each other and the island, an ancient force, brewing deep in the island's abyss, may threaten their newfound relationship, and the world...\n\n~Features~\n\n    - A deep, emotional story about the close bonds of a trio, the priorities of nations, and the delicate connection of humans and nature, spanning beyond human history.\n    - A human experience crafted entirely by the IGF Grand Prize-nominated duo of Marina Kittaka and Melos Han-Tani, behind works such as Anodyne 1 & 2, Even the Ocean, and All Our Asias.\n    - Master a parkour-esque moveset to sprint, wallrun, jump, and fling yourself through Sephonie Island\u2019s rocky and physical caverns!\n    - A novel and accessible Puzzle Grid System that will stretch your brain in fun ways.\n    - A beautiful and varied cave system filled with all manner of large and surprising creatures, visually brought to life by Marina Kittaka.\n    - A lush, melodic and ambient soundtrack by Melos Han-Tani.\n\n\n\n\nJoin us on Discord to chat about the game: https://discord.com/invite/analgesic\n\nJoin our newsletter to stay up to date on the game's news! https://analgesic.productions/\nFollow co-developer Melos Han-Tani on Twitter: https://twitter.com/han_tani\n\n\n\n~Frequently Inquired Questions (FIQ)~\n\nQ: When?\nA: Windows, Mac in Q2/Q3 2021.\n\nQ: Where?\nA: Steam, GOG (tentative), others TBD\n\nQ: Switch?
