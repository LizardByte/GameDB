The game differs from Monopoly in that players can buy and sell stocks of a block, affecting the value of block's stock up by buying or down by selling that block's stock or by developing a player-owned property of that block which increases the value per share for that block's stock. Also unlike Monopoly, it is not necessary to own the entire block to develop a property, though controlling more than one property of a block allows the player to develop their properties into larger buildings to collect more from opponents when they land on them. Players must collect a set of four suits, heart, diamond, clover and spade, to level up and collect additional gold when the pass the starting position/bank. To win a player must make it back to the bank with the board's required amount, which includes the total value of the player's stocks, property value, and gold on hand.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/itadaki-street-special", "collections": [{"id": 3490, "name": "Itadaki Street"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Final Fantasy"}, {"id": 7988, "name": "Dragon Quest"}]}
