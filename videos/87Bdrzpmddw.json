For the Nintendo Entertainment System\u00ae and Famicom.\n\nGame in active development. Demo download on our website: https://www.eastpixel.de/anna\n\nTHIS VIDEO\nCurrent gameplay, May 2023.\n\n\n\nFurther information: https://www.eastpixel.de/anna\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF THE GAME\n\nThe magic of words gave you everything and suddenly took everything from you.\n\nA little sad and disappointed you make your way through a dangerous world. Embark on the difficult journey through the jungle, icy landscapes and dangerous caves. Collect scrolls and combine their words, face your fear and the ticking clock.\n\nBut whatever happens, never forget your most important goal: find Anna.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEEPER MEANING BEHIND THE STORY OF THE GAME\n\nThe game is more than a typical 1980s platformer. The game itself is just a shell. The shell for a process of self-discovery, healing, motivation and the strong will not to give up. The character embarks on an arduous journey and search for Anna.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve already guessed it, Anna doesn\u2019t have to be human or animal. Anna can just as well be representative of a favourite place, a feeling, family, being at home, feeling good or the satisfaction of a completed task or with yourself, but of course also a single person.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to the meaning of the game title. You decide. You are also welcome to simply ignore the psychological aspect and concentrate fully on playing this challenging platforming title. Just pay attention to the little hearts and the ticking clock. ;-)\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREEN RIBBON\n\nEASTPIXEL supports the Green Ribbon and projects that support people and integration. The author of the video game Anna: The Magic of Words is one of these people himself. A long time ago, he set out on his own search for contentment and his own well-being. The project development helps him to focus on his goals and the motivation to keep going should also help other people. The author has already found his Anna.\n\nThe green ribbon is the international symbol of mental health awareness.\n\n\nFurther information:\nGame development in progress.\nhttps://www.eastpixel.de/anna\n\n#nintendo #nintendoentertainmentsystem #nes #famicom #platformer  #anna #pixelart #retro #gametrailer #retrogaming #indiedev #eastpixel\n\nANNA (\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca) IS A GAME BY EASTPIXEL.\nDeveloped to run on the Nintendo\u00ae Family Computer/Nintendo\u00ae Entertainment System.  \nNintendo Family Computer and Nintendo\u00ae Entertainment System are trademarks of Nintendo\u00ae.\nEASTPIXEL are not affiliated to Nintendo\u00ae.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87Bdrzpmddw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87Bdrzpmddw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87Bdrzpmddw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87Bdrzpmddw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87Bdrzpmddw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Anna: The Magic of Words (NES/Famicom) - Gameplay update, May 2023", "description": "Anna: The Magic of Words is a hard to beat 1980s like platformer game with a serious story.
