The gameplay is geared towards more of an arcade feel rather than simulation and does not feature any NBA license but resembles actual teams and modeled after top players of the time. \n \nIt also features the obligatory modes such as Exhibition, Playoffs and Season and the ability to let friends go head-to-head.
