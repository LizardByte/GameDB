Its difficulty is 'medium' and its duration is 'very long'. This is the first level out of four in this release; there are thirteen levels overall.

To be honest, I think this was my goal for the channel all along; anything that comes after this is a bonus :)\n2) There used to be an 'enhanced version' included in the download package but it was removed a while back because there were some game-breaking bugs in the new data files. I'm using the modified .exe from that former package to play this series with (in fact I use this .exe with almost all the levels I'm playing from this era) since it rarely causes issues and has many handy improvements - if you want to use the .exe too then you can still find the enhanced version of this series on TREditor.\n3) The (very, very long) flyby in the title sequence shows the second level in the series, as well as some areas that cannot be accessed in-game.\n4) I believe the builder's intention with the movable globe puzzle starting at 37:24 is to move the globes the long way around the room until you find their places, but if you already know what the trick is then it makes it a lot quicker.\n5) At 38:20, if the gate to the lever closes when you move the first vase over the trick coloured tile, then you can move the other vase off and back onto the circular tile to open it up again - no need to reload!\n6) At 53:10, if you move the vase onto the left-hand circular tile then a gate will close over the junction that allows you to move it to the right-hand tile. You can reopen this gate by going into the water, travelling all the way back to the room with the slopes and dropping on the tile after the monkeyswing at 50:33.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Com-9uvQuI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Com-9uvQuI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Com-9uvQuI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Com-9uvQuI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Com-9uvQuI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Rescue 1-4 - Level 1: The Secret Temple", "description": "Released on 28th May 2001 and admitted to the trle.net Hall of Fame in December 2002, this levelset has an average rating of 9.00 on trle.net at the time of recording and was created by MagPlus.
