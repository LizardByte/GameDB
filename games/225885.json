My beloved magic tools are gathering dust now.\n\nBut then, I received an invitation for a magic show held on a luxurious cruise ship.\nI wasn't invited as a guest, but as a performer.\nIf I do well, I could potentially become a pro magician.\nI was happy. I started dreaming again. I couldn't stop thinking about the possibilities.\n\nBut waiting for me were men of unbelievable status and a strange fox plushie. That plushie then said:\n\n\"Use those skills of yours to snatch some money off them.
