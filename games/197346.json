In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\nPartia 3: The Knight of Partia is the third installment of the Partia series that wraps up the 'Granian Trilogy'. However, the game is designed as a stand-alone set in hundreds of years after the events of Partia 2, hence no knowledge of the prior games is required. The game includes 30 stages (including 5 hidden stages) that should provide solid 30 plus hours of game play if not 50 or 100."}
