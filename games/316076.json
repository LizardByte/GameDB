Our source of aura and dreams, the Waterfall of Dreams, has gone missing! How is that even possible?! To make matters worse, many who live in the wild have gone berserk!

Aren't I so great?? Now go stop these menaces to society, and I'll generously pay you!\n\n...You do like money, don't you? I sure do, and if I were you, I would graciously accept that!", "summary": "Astropods: Starside Glaze is a 2D Action Platformer with Platform Fighter styled combat.
