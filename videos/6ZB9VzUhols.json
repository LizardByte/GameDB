It might take a while depending on your computer. If the mod isn't there, you probably didn't extract everything. And don't try running it on an older version of Unitale. If it crashes despite being on the newest version, let me know.\n\n\"Mac or Linux version?\"\nUnitale does have a Mac and Linux version, download it from the subreddit and then copy the Mods folder in this download over to that, should work. (Note: the links are probably not there anymore)\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/unitale\n\n\"why does she have gaster blasters waaaaah\"\nGaster was the Royal Scientist. Alphys is the Royal Scientist. Alphys has some mysterious connection to Sans that's briefly hinted at during some endings.\nI understand that gaster blasters are overused in fan content; however, Alphys is one of the three characters where it actually makes sense for her to have them. So this complaint REALLY annoys me.\n\n\"why is your heart yellow if she never upgraded your phone waaaaah\"\nVideo games. I honestly can't believe this is something people actually care about.\nFun fact: One of the \"upgrades\" is that your phone is given a keychain. In a genocide run though, you still attach the New Home keys to your phone's keychain. In other words, Toby didn't care about this and neither should you. It's like Sans making you blue or Undyne making you green.\n\n=====\n\nSo here it is. My first Unitale battle. Little bit more detail than most peoples' first :P\n\n[C] can be used to skip the intro cutscene. I didn't want to put that little fact into the actual battle, it would have been out of place.\n\nThere's a Hard Mode of this fight included in the download. Hard Mode is how I originally created the battle, blinded by my own hubris. It's pretty insane, especially with keyboard. If you find the normal battle too easy, give it a try!\nI have a video here of me playing through Hard Mode that might help you out (SPOILER WARNING): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib9A45agjTg\n\nAlso, there's a secret stupid easter egg. But I bet you only have a 3.1% chance of finding it. ;)\nNah, just kidding, it's easy as pie to find.\nHere's a video of that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPQ6FVi2Ad8\n\nI tried beating this a few years later and succeeded! Here's the stream of that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VArGACz0lbM\n\nI worked extremely hard on this for over a month, so if you like it, please share it with any of your friends that have finished Undertale! Anyone that might be into it!
