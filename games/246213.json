The controllers communicate with the console via infrared technology, which is the same technology used in television remote controls. The console appears to have \"motion-sensing\" technology of some sense, but it doesn't quite work properly.\n\nAs its name suggests, the console includes 60 games, which are all designed poorly and difficult to play. The games are split into two categories: sports, and arcade. A few of the games also recycle characters from old Disney movies.\n\nWritten on the box is also a note which reads, \"If you're looking to purchase an Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, or equivalent, this product does not compare or compete with these technologies. The Wireless 60 is a family entertainment console, great for ages 5 and up.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wireless-60"}
