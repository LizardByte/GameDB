Many games were made for it, and finally, some of those amazing classics are finding their way to the Nintendo Switch though the NEOGEO POCKET COLOR SELECTION. Not only are these games perfectly emulated to look and play as they did back on the NEOGEO POCKET COLOR, but advancements in technology have enabled them to be played together with a friend with just one copy, and you can even change the virtual exterior designs on a whim! Classic titles that fans adore are coming to the Nintendo Switch for your enjoyment!"}
