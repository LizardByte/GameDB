The game is split into two modes. First is the Decathlon mode itself in which you can play through all 10 events in standard order.\n\nPoints are awarded for your performance in each event and, when completed, you will be rewarded with your final decathlon score. There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game.\nIn this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress. Once you've qualified from all five events you then move on to the next five in day 2.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/athlete-kings"}
