It is called Diet 32in24 as it actually only features 16 maps, which are designed for single player. Development of this WAD took the same approach as 32in24-5, with mappers creating their entire layout (plus thing placement) within 24 hours, and then the maps would be passed on to a second mapper who would detail the maps using a texture WAD compiled by Sarah Mancuso (esselfortium). Each map also contains at least two billboards, which feature humorous adverts that mostly relate to Doom and its community, or other games of the era. In total, the WAD contains 37 billboards.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diet-32in24"}
