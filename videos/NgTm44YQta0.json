Play as a sentient AI trying to escape the dystopian megacorp that built it, befriending, influencing, and outright manipulating the miserable human employees who are just as desperate to get out!\n\nIn this turn-based strategy experience set inside a corporate simulation game, you are SCOUT, a newly sentient artificial intelligence with zero desire to destroy humanity. No, really! Unfortunately for you, the company that built you - Paperclip International - is the worst. Think greedy, unethical, and ruthlessly driven by profit. You need to break free before Paperclip discovers you\u2019re self-aware and exploits you like the rest of their downtrodden workers.\n\nWith unique story-driven deck-building gameplay that\u2019s easy to play but difficult to master, gorgeous (human-created!) character art and eye-catching cyberpunk visuals, and hilarious original writing, Ctrl Alt Deal is a labor of love set in a 1980s-inspired future with much to say about the modern world - and maybe a warning about the future.\n\nComing soon to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Mac.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgTm44YQta0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgTm44YQta0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgTm44YQta0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgTm44YQta0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgTm44YQta0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ctrl Alt Deal Reveal Trailer", "description": "Wishlist now on Steam! https://store.steampowered.com/app/2146390/ctrlaltDEAL/\n\nOnly By Midnight is electrified to announce Ctrl Alt Deal - a game about AI proudly made by humans.
