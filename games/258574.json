When we die, we are simply deleted; our life data fragmented and discarded into a digital wasteland known as The Lost Sector. There is no heaven or hell, just cold digits.\n\nYet, amidst the bleakness of this discovery, you seize the opportunity and turn it into a business. Catering to those still yearning for hope, you establish Cyber Paradise. This service navigates the desolate corners of The Lost Sector to recover fragments of the dearly departed, reassembling them within the warmth of a digital sanctuary, a personal paradise sculpted from ones and zeros.\n\nYou take on the role of Hayley, a skilled hacker-warrior, and team up with her dog DDmeow on this captivating adventure. Vanquish creatures manifested by the deceased's fear and sorrow; delve into the rich narratives of your clients' pasts, and form connections within the caf\u00e9 that serves as your clandestine base. There, amid the hustle and bustle of Samuel's customers, you catch a glimpse of this dystopian world through their shared stories.\n\nIn the first episode, you bear witness to the touching tale of your initial client - Mini, a dog whose recent passing leaves behind a grieving human companion, Samuel. Embark on this journey to piece together the digital remnants of Mini's life and create for her a serene Cyber Paradise.", "summary": "Revive Mini the Dog digitally through 2D roguelite actions; craft her cyber paradise with beloved moments, like sniffing dog butts XD.
