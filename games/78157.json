Rosalia gives the protagonist clothes for combat and a legendary rod, Ellicia the Gray, to prepare her for her journey. The protagonist must locate her allies and rescue the Queen of the Sacred Bird Cosmos from the Emperor.", "summary": "Angelique Tenkuu no Requiem is the first Neoromance role-playing game. Canonically this game is the direct sequel to Angelique Special 2 and Angelique Maren no Rokukishi.\n\nRuby Party members later commented that its conception began when written questionnaires indicated a high demand for a Koei role-playing game, a genre which experienced a boost in popularity due to titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII. Since Team-Infinite was simultaneously developing a game for male appeal, Ruby Party was given the inquiry for an Angelique adaptation targeting the female side.\n\nThe Premium Box edition includes a fully colored leather-bound manual. Consumers who purchased this title during Koei's 1999 double campaign obtained an original clear file."}
