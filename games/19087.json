Carter knew in some way that the key would led him to his land of dreams. When he found the key in his attic next to an unintelligible scroll, he set out to Arkham, the city of his ancestors, and there, in the snake cave, he disappeared from the sight of man. Nobody knows what happened, some say he finally found a portal to his dreams and now he\u00b4s looking for the last door, inside a dimension full of mystery and threats. But there is one problem: Carter left the parchment that came with the key and he can only move forward if he remembers what was written in there.", "summary": "The SIlver Key is an adventure, puzzle game.\nYour spells have succeeded and you've just got through the first door to an unknown dimension, very different from the one you are used to. Your eyes have never seen scenarios such as the ones you are going to discover and your mind will have to be adaptive in order to immerse yourself in a Tim Burton style side-scrolling game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-silver-key", "videos": [{"id": 8033, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "L6rVoyz-YYQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6rVoyz-YYQ", "title": "The Silver Key - The Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L6rVoyz-YYQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
