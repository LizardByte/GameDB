Upon arriving Mexico, he was arrested by a fat Mexican. The only way to bail out is to defeat the fat Mexican with a burrito eating contest. Once the fat Mexican is defeated, Mario boards the Americano bus and heads toward the US while border patrols are pursuing the bus. When the bus arrived in the border, many Mexicans start to jump across the border by using a springboard. This enraged the obese border patrol and Mario has to stop him. After arriving in the US, Mario jumps into a pipe and get himself back into the Mushroom Kingdom.", "summary": "Burritos (or Mario in Mexico el Game) is Supernova's first attempt on making a jokegame.
