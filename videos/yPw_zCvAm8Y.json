One year later Liberator was released once again by Alternative Software Ltd in 1987 and sold by it's self this time round.\n\nLiberator is one of the best space shooters created for the C16/Plus4 from the machines commercial era and was a big surprise when it showed up. Not the type of game would would expect to see from a machine that has no hardware sprites yet here we have a massive battle star like ship to fly over, a number of routine enemies to fire at and loads of gun turrets to take out. On top of that your ship requires fuel which can be picked up along the way and if you can survive to the end of each one your be faced with the ships reactor which you have to blast through.\n\nAll sounds basic enough but as it happens it can be quite addictive to play just mashing the fire button and trying to stay alive and dodging enemy fire. With all this action going on you'd think game play would be the last thing you'd expect to see but when the fire button can be fired as fast or as slow and you like with no interruption what so ever unlike many C16/Plus4 space shooters before and after then this game was a winner from the start. Clever stuff for a 12k game and a lot of fun for high score freaks!\n\nA Magnificent arcade game. :)\n\nMIK", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yPw_zCvAm8Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yPw_zCvAm8Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yPw_zCvAm8Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Liberator - Commodore C16 Plus4 game play", "description": "Video recording taken from a real Commodore 16 using the genuine tape release of Liberator.\n\nRelease version used: Alternative Software Ltd\nJoystick used: Zip Stik - Auto Fire OFF (Great for button bashing this one)\n\nLiberator was coded by D.R Gamon and released by Magnificent 7 Software in 1986 having been release on the same tape as Space Fiends.
