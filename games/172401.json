The game was advertised during 1981-1982 but was never released at the time. It later changed name again, this time to Quest For The Orb. Neither Quest for the Orb would see a release as Astrovision/Astrocade hit financial troubles. Eventually a working prototype made its way to Dave Carson Software in 1985 and was released under the Conan the Barbarian name.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 55052, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "g3MU8YywoHk"}]}
