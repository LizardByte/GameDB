The final duty of the day is to tend to your clan's prized rooftop garden. While tending to the flowers, you hear a noise from below. Peering over the edge of the building confirms your worst fears. A rival ninja clan has broken into the compound to stage an attack!\n\nAlthough you locked the doors, the windows are wide open (it's a hot day after all) and the rival ninjas are already scaling the building. With only potted flowers at your disposal, your mission is to stop them from getting in for as long as you can.", "summary": "Ninjas attack in groups of 12, with each group using a different climbing style. Defeat four groups and they'll get faster and you'll score more points.\n\nIf six ninjas manage to get in, they'll destroy part of the building and you'll take on that group again but a slower speed.\n\nThe game ends when the ninjas have damaged the building six times.\n\nGood luck ninja!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-gardening-simulator"}
