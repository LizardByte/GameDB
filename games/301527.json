They also ran successful propaganda campaigns, encouraging these same nations to compete with one another politically and ultimately militarily. This strategy slowly but surely weakened all nations who struggled to maintain control over their people and their land as their wealth, which was tied to the very resource rights they had signed away, was stripped.\n\nWhen the nations of the world were sufficiently weakened, Praesidium moved on the world's most resource rich lands with a vast private army, which was funded by the unlimited wealth of the world's corporate powers.\n\nThis private army became known as Praesidium's Shield. They did not conquer nations, they simply moved into resource rich regions, constructed defensive strongholds and seized control of the world's various natural resources.\n\nNations crumbled as they fought against Praesidium and each other, in order to secure remnants to sustain their economies and their way of life.\n\nEventually, there were no nations powerful enough to challenge Praesidium's dominance...\n\n...until now.\n\nEndeavor is a newly formed resistance force. Made up of the most powerful military minds, technology and equipment from each of the world's once mighty nation states who have combined into a single fighting force powerful enough to make a difference.\n\nTake command, retake our lands and reclaim what is rightfully ours.", "summary": "A sci-fi real-time strategy game with free form base building and all of the typical features found in classic RTS offerings.
