Guacamelee! builds upon the classic open-world Metroid-vania style of games, by adding a strong melee combat component, a new dimension switching mechanic, and cooperative same-screen multiplayer for the entire story. The game also blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many of the moves useful and necessary for both of these.\n\nTravel through a mystical and mysterious Mexican world as a Luchador using the power of your two fists to battle evil. Uncover hidden wrestling techniques like the Rooster Uppercut, and Dimension Swap to open new areas and secrets.\"\n\nGuacamelee! Gold Edition is a port of the PlayStation 3 and Vita version of the game and includes the DLC that was released for the game. An updated version of the game called \"Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition\" was later released that includes an expanded story, 2 new areas, and a new boss.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/guacamelee-gold-edition", "videos": [{"id": 8047, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CpHN5_H4b08", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpHN5_H4b08", "title": "Guacamelee!
