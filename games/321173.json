Three cosmic spirits have lost their way in space and have to descend onto Earth, taking corporeal form. They enter the bodies of three young women who died recently: one in a traffic accident, another from disease, and the third one - a ten-year-old girl - after committing suicide. All three were avid mahjong players, and all three are now revived and endowed with mysterious mahjong powers. A special Mahjong Academy opens, and the Saver Angels (as the group begins calling itself) is ready to defeat any aliens and demons in that ancient Chinese game.\n\nSaver Angels restores adventure elements that were absent from the previous game, and even enhances them. The player is now able to move in first-person perspective by pointing and clicking on a spot on the screen. Exploring locations, the player triggers scenes, which in turn lead to mahjong games. A special \"mahjong mode\" allows the player to choose an opponent from the story mode and challenge her (or him) to a mahjong match right away.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jantei-monogatari-3-saver-angels", "videos": [{"id": 131236, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "CCfU7VdxItw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCfU7VdxItw", "title": "PC Engine CD - Jantei Monogatari 3 - Saver Angels \u00a9 1993 Natsume - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CCfU7VdxItw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
