Every egg knows that if the crystal sword, chalice and crown are removed from the temple, terrible strange things will happen to the Yolkfolk!\u201d\n\nDizzy looked outside.\nThings did look decidedly bad.\n\n\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t explain why you were jumping off the kitchen chair, Grand Dizzy\u201d said Dizzy.\n\n\u201cWell, young fella-m\u2019-egg!\u201d said Grand Dizzy puffing himself up slightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of you always sorting things out. I\u2019m going to get into shape, pack my knapsack and save the Yolkfolk myself. I was really heroic in my day, y\u2019know.\u201d\n\nA salty tear formed in Dizzy\u2019s eye.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Grand Dizzy, what are we going to do with you?\u201d gushed Dizzy in his best sympathetic, yet caring, voice.\n\nGrand Dizzy was packed off to bed.\nBut the moment everyone\u2019s back was turned, he jumped up and continued to whinge loudly at anything he could find that would listen.\n\nDizzy decided that he must begin his trek to retrieve the Yolkfolk\u2019s treasure.\nHe packed his knapsack and popped on his new safari hat.\nDizzy grimaced with gritted teeth and dramatically declared \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t fear, Grand Dizzy! The lost treasures of the Yolkfolk will soon be found!\u201d.\n\nAnd so, Dizzy began a whole new adventure \u2013 can our hero succeed again?", "summary": "Crystal Kingdom Dizzy 2017 is a remake of the 1992 Dizzy adventure but with enhanced graphics, sound and given more of a Dizzy adventure feel.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crystal-kingdom-dizzy-2017"}
