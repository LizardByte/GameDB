The primary objective is to fill up Yonda's silver key by expanding the map, collecting various items, and advance to the next stage.\n\nDon't be deceived by thinking Biblinthus is just a cute puzzle/dungeon crawler with Tetris mechanics. As a finely polished puzzle, the endless possibilities of Biblinthus bring out the best of each player's patience, strategy, and imagination!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/biblinthus", "videos": [{"id": 98120, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GoY0c4q7ztQ"}]}
