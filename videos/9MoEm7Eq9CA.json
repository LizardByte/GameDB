Diego has a raw and brutal fighting style that utilizes  hard tackles and headbutts. Being a street fighter, he uses his experience of fighting in confined quarters to execute some of his strongest blows.\n\nThis gritty fighter grew up in the back alleys of New York, earning money to support his ailing mother by competing in many street matches. Long rumored to be the strongest fighter in his neighborhood, he is seen by many locals as a hero.\n\nJoining Diego is returning taekwondo master Rig, who boasts the \u201cKicks of Truth and Deceit.\u201d Rig, who originally debuted in Dead or Alive 5, is a former oil platform worker whose kick-heavy style has evolved to incorporate more acrobatic maneuvers. To kick-off their confrontation in DOA6, the formidable brawler Rig challenges Diego in a New York alley, and the two decide the time for conversation is over; it\u2019s time to fight! \n\nDiego and Rig join the six playable characters previously announced (Helena Douglas, Hayate, Ryu Hayabusa, Zack, Kasumi, and Jann Lee), as fans in attendance at Evo will be able to test out the latest build of the game while winning exclusive swag, including DOA6 shirts, tote bags, and lanyards. \n\nBoth combatants will be showcased in the first consumer playable build of DEAD OR ALIVE 6 at the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) 2018 inside the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, August 3-4.\n\n[official site] http://teamninja-studio.com/doa6/\n[official facebook]https://facebook.com/Deadoralivegame\n[official twitter] https://twitter.com/DOATEC_OFFICIAL\n[official twitch] https://twitch.tv/Deadoralivegame\n#DEADORALIVE6 #Diego #DOA6", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9MoEm7Eq9CA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9MoEm7Eq9CA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9MoEm7Eq9CA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9MoEm7Eq9CA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9MoEm7Eq9CA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DEAD OR ALIVE 6 -  The Uncrowned Street Hero", "description": "Diego, the Uncrowned Street Hero, enters the Dead Or Alive 6 Tournament.
