It looks like it could have been an old Genesis game and weighs in at a whopping (not!) 26 megs, the lowest meg count for a Neo Geo cart (that I know of). But does that affect the quality of the game? Not really. It's an interesting Tetris-like puzzle game with an different twist for a tetris look-a-like. The point of puzzled ISN'T to eliminate all of the lines, there's a story here, and it explains the gameplay. It kind of goes like this: There was a village of men and a village of women and the two were always at war (how they ever made any new villagers I dunno..) so the gods built a tower/wall between them so they couldn't fight (or something like that) and so after a while both villages got tired of it, and sent a messenger, a boy from one and a girl from the other, in hot air balloons, (hopefully) to the top of the tower to petition the gods to remove the barrier between. That's it."}
