Even fricking RoHL had some Lunatic runs, but I guess tAA isn't as memey as that other mess.\nOnly problem with this run are the 56 FPS. I don't know why it caps at that rate, and it's not only tAA because my regular ol' danmakufu 0.12m caps at 56 to 57 FPS too. It's close to 60 so I guess I just gotta deal with it \u1555( \u141b ) \u1557\n\nI think tAA has to be one of the oldest Touhou fan games, being released back in 2005, although the oldest date back to 2003 I guess. And despite its age, it's really not thaaat bad. It definitely has some weird game design going on (looking at you Daiyousei) and didn't age that gracefully, but it still has some solid patterns and gameplay moments. Random stage fairies with invulnerabilty time is stupid though in my opinion.\nReimu A was probably the best shot type for me here because I really couldn't be bothered learning the stages and staying under a boss is often times a really hard chore.\n\n00:00 Stage 1\n03:32 Stage 2\n07:28 Stage 3\n11:29 Stage 4\n17:15 Stage 5\n22:33 Stage 6\n\nAlso, unrelated to the Lunatic content here: to unlock Extra you have to hold X while loading the script from danmakufu.\nIt doesn't have anything to do with the video, but maybe this info will help somebody who wants to play that.\n\nALSO also, as a little fun fact: the original Japanese version spells Mary's name as \"Muelberry Khan\". Yeah I don't know either.\n\nDidn't plan to upload another video so soon after RSS Overdrive, but currently I just have way too much fun with fan games. Gives me also a reason to delay going for LNBs.\nSooo here's the mandatory Twitch VOD with German Commentary: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1745032478\n\nWiki and DL: https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/The_Alternative_Age", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LMcDvDlLcw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LMcDvDlLcw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LMcDvDlLcw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LMcDvDlLcw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LMcDvDlLcw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou ...the Alternative Age - Lunatic 1cc (Reimu A)", "description": "After a quick search here, is ... is this the first recorded full Lunatic run of this game here on Youtube?
