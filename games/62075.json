Years ago, when the Holy Maiden's prayer was interrupted, an incident known as the \"Gran Forte\" occurred, causing a portion of the land to fall and split the lower city into two, separated by a cliff.\n\nIn time, the lowest layer became the dwelling of all kinds of low-lives, people who lost much of their former lives during the \"Gran Forte\", becoming known as the \"Prison\".
