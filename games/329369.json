The game's development is guided by our 'C.F.R.F' principle: 'Competitive First, Realism Follows,' which prioritizes competitive elements in gameplay decisions and design.\n\nMoE is designed to be accessible and engaging, avoiding the complex hero abilities or arcade-style power-ups that have infiltrated the genre, and instead emphasizing realistic Special Forces or Counter-Terrorist scenarios that enforce, or dare we say, demand genuine skill. Drawing inspiration from foundational titles like the SWAT and the Rainbow 6 series, as well as classics like Counter-Strike and contemporary games like Escape from Tarkov and Rainbow Six Siege, \"Method of Entry\" taps into a deep well of tactical shooter heritage.\n\nThis project is a response to the competitive community's desire for a streamlined, 5v5 tactical shooter where competitive elements take precedence. Realism is then seamlessly integrated, with attention to weapon dynamics, player movement, environmental design, hit detection, and overall intensity. However, this integration never overshadows MoE\u2019s core competitive mechanics, ensuring a balanced and stable competitive experience.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/method-of-entry", "videos": [{"id": 138776, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YH1cAhRMQcc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH1cAhRMQcc", "title": "Method of Entry - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YH1cAhRMQcc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
