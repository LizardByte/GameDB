This story is centered around Daltry, one of the main antagonists of Four Kings, and shows how he began and how he became the man he is in the main story. Of the three main antagonists of Four Kings, I felt that Daltry was the weakest one, since he didn\u2019t receive a lot of screentime or backstory, and his few appearances were kinda generic, so I wanted to remedy that with a new story all about him.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-emblem-four-kings-deposition"}
