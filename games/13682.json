The action begins aboard a ship at sea, and later to an island and then a castle. Urns with letters on them are peppered around the screen and must be touched in the correct order to spell \"ARABIAN\" for bonus points -- but beware of a huge genie that occasionally pops out of an urn to grab any adventurers within his grasp. The player's man can scale ladders and ropes, hang overhead from horizontal ropes, and hop from flying carpet to flying carpet (similar to Frogger's river logs) to navigate each level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arabian", "videos": [{"id": 89667, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Lbc7dEJ1T8M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbc7dEJ1T8M", "title": "Arabian [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lbc7dEJ1T8M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
