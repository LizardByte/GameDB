Go on a mission to increase humanity's understanding of foreign star systems and discover new stars. As new star systems can be tricky to navigate, you need to alter the flight path of the space capsule to spend as much time exploring as possible. Portals in each star system have a strong gravitational pull, forcing the capsule to take the shortest route on its own.\nFind 270 stars in 90 different star systems on your journey through three galaxies. Use cosmic dust clouds and wormholes to your advantage. Expect to be puzzled and challenged when navigating space labyrinths with hours of good fun and even longer to unlock all 270 stars."}
