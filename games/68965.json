Seven loyal minions awaken from their slumber, driven by their undying loyalty to Ragnar and the desire to set their master free. Each minion embarks on a perilous quest to obtain the fragments of a powerful magic key, which hold the key to unlocking Ragnar's prison and unleashing the darkness upon the world once more. As they traverse the treacherous landscapes of four distinct realms, facing relentless enemies and deadly traps, a fierce competition arises among the minions, for only one of them can claim the leadership of the army of darkness and shape the fate of Necromania.", "summary": "In the dark fantasy world of Necromania: Trap of Darkness, players are thrust into an isometric action-tactical adventure reminiscent of the iconic Diablo series. Set in four distinct and treacherous realms, the game introduces a refreshing twist by allowing players to assume the roles of seven sinister anti-heroes, deviating from the typical \"good heroes\" seen in other games. Developed by the Slovakian team Darksoft Game Development Studio and the Czech company Cinemax, Necromania challenges players to navigate labyrinthine environments and overcome various enemies and creatures to acquire fragments of a powerful magic key.\n\nThe story centers around the fallen dark lord, Ragnar, who finds himself imprisoned by the forces of the Absurdian king, Bill Cocoton. In a bid to set Ragnar free and seize control of the realm, seven of Ragnar's loyal minions awaken from their slumber, each vying to obtain the magic keys that can unlock their master's prison. However, only one of them can ultimately lead the army of darkness to victory. As players progress through the game's numerous levels, they must strategize, laying traps and leveraging the intricacies of the environments to outsmart their adversaries.\n\nWhile Necromania: Trap of Darkness received mixed reviews, critics praised its multiplayer mode, even though finding opponents proved challenging. However, the game faced criticism for its unrefined gameplay mechanics and notable difficulty. The title offered an interesting blend of puzzle-like elements and combat, with an emphasis on trap utilization rather than direct confrontation. The lack of balance among the character classes and dated visuals added to the overall underwhelming experience. Despite its attempts to innovate, Necromania: Trap of Darkness fell short of leaving a lasting impression in the gaming landscape.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/necromania-trap-of-darkness"}
