The combustion of Gravitae in shipborne engines has enabled massive naval vessels to take to the skies, nimble as birds. New trade routes have been discovered unimpeded by land or ocean, bringing obscene wealth in a short period of time to a select few who control the extraction of this wondrous resource.\n\nThe rich and powerful have used Gravitae to levitate the most fertile lands and valuable assets out of the reach of ordinary people. They have built floating towns and cities saturated with comfort and luxury, unburdened by the destruction caused in the extraction of Gravitae.\n\nDriving this massive change is a globe-spanning power unaccountable to any nation: the Dynamic India Company. It is rumored that the two DIC heads, only known as El Jeffe and Il Doge, are plotting to create an entire new world in the heavens for themselves to rule, by combining the stolen riches of the earth and the mass of the moon. Unstopped, this will spell certain and terminal disaster for everyone left on earth.\n\nIt is not too late yet.", "summary": "Pirates of Gravitae is an action roguelike game with fast-paced aerial dogfights, set in a fictional version of the Golden Age of Piracy.\n\nThe player commands a rocket propelled pirate ship that they can equip with various weapons and abilities, as they fight against a variety of enemies. They can choose from a selection of different bonuses at the end of every battle, to customize their ship as they go. These bonuses expire at the end of a run. They can also unlock new abilities or upgrade crew members, for perks that persist between runs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 62150, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uvTSPoyG7xc"}]}
