The Point Man is thus forced to seek out an alternate extraction point, and this becomes the overarching goal of the title. F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate concerns a parallel plot line which takes place at the same time as F.E.A.R., as well as during some of the events from F.E.A.R. Extraction Point. A second F.E.A.R. team, including the player character, the Sergeant, is sent to investigate Armacham Technology Corporation. New game elements include a new enemy faction, the Nightcrawlers, who are dangerous human mercenaries equipped with specialized weaponry, more new weapons, and new locations.", "summary": "F.E.A.R.
