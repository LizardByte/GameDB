Naturally, you'll need to discover a plethora of recipes, gather a ton of resources, combine those through crafting to get stronger... So much work. But why do it yourself when there are plenty of souls just waiting for a benevolent master to manifest and start ordering them around?\n\nEmbark on a journey through various procedurally-generated areas of Limbo to recruit your very own legion of souls to command! Even an aimlessly wandering soul might need some persuasion to sign a contract with a charming demon like yourself, but you've got plenty of tortu... ahem, arguments to win them over, right? And don't forget: the more diverse \"tools\" you collect, the easier it will be to turn any situation in your favor!\n\nIt's not enough to simply proclaim yourself a ruler (unfortunately). Only the one who comes out on top of the annual Infernal Tournament will be recognized by other demons as their rightful overlord. Use the arcane knowledge of soul types and abilities to crush your rivals through soul battles, collect the runestones that make your servants ever stronger, and, eventually, you might stand a chance against the acting Infernal Champion herself!", "summary": "In this card-based roguelite, you'll be a demon specializing in the souls of inanimate objects.
