The Magician has hidden the Chalice in either the Fire Kingdom or the Ice Kingdom, and has resurrected his three dragons, Yorgle, Grundle, and Rhindle, to hinder the player's journey. He has also created a Bat to steal items from the player once again.", "summary": "Adventure II is an Atari 2600 homebrew developed by Curt Vendel as a fanmade sequel to Warren Robinett's original 1979 Adventure. Vendel took inspiration from Ron Lloyd's Atari 5200 Adventure homebrew, also called Adventure II, which was in early development at the time.\n\nVendel's Adventure II was released on the Atari Flashback 2 plug-and-play console in August 2005, and has been included in every subsequent Flashback console. It was also included in Atari Flashback Classics on the Nintendo Switch, and Atari Flashback Classics Vol. 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nLike the original game, the player controls a solid square avatar, navigating through mazes and collecting items in order to find the Enchanted Chalice and return it to the Golden Castle. The three dragons and bat also return, this time much more aggressive. The map is also larger, boasting 47 rooms.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adventure-ii"}
