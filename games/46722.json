These Puppets are based off prominent characters in Gensokyo\u2019s modern history, specifically every named character from Touhou 01: Highly Responsive to Prayers all the way up to Touhou 14: Double Dealing Character. All of them are available to capture, train, and do battle with against others while you make your way through Gensokyo.\n\nAlong the way, the protagonist runs across an organization called the Puppet Liberation Front. Their goals are to liberate Puppets from their trainers, and let them live unoppressed by humans and youkai alike. You'll be running to and from various locales of Gensokyo; from the Hakurei Shrine, to the expansive Forest of Magic, to climbing the towering peaks of Youkai Mountain, as well as the depths of the Ancient Capital, and far beyond that! Several of the actual prominent characters have their own team of Puppets, and can even be engaged in battle if you meet them. For the Touhou and Pokemon fan, there's plenty here to keep you hooked!", "summary": "Touhou Puppet Dance Performance is a spiritual successor to the Pok\u00e9mon FireRed hack Touhou Puppet Play, involving training and collecting puppets of various Touhou characters.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
