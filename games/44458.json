Some of the artists included are: Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Naughty By Nature, Queen Latifah (!), Yo-Yo, House of Pain, Onyx, Warren G. and Coolio. The gameplay is modeled after the fast-paced NBA Jam and takes place on various outdoor courts in 5 different U.S. cities. Up to four players can compete, and the \"Xtra\" button works similar to turbo. There's a shot meter that enables you to sink jumpers and rattle the rim. No 3-point shots exist and there are no fouls in the game."}
