However, 70 extras have popped up that he isn't aware of... sort of. It is up to Luigi, because Mario is busy with the green ones, the yellow ones, the blue ones, and the red ones, to collect these stars and give Bowser the boot.\n\nDo not let your kids play this game as it has vulgar language.\n\nThis game may start out extremely easy, but its difficulty curve goes up quicker than a roller coaster. Don't let your guard down. There is also purple coin comes in some of the levels, which make them very long and very hard. I don't recommend 100%-ing this unless you REALLY want to. Or you want bragging rights... Though, any%ing it is incredibly easy...", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/luigi-and-the-violet-stars", "videos": [{"id": 95360, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LReR9ouT_Uc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LReR9ouT_Uc", "title": "Luigi and the Violet Stars (Savestateless)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LReR9ouT_Uc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
