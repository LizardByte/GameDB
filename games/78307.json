While at first not knowing the difference between a slam dunk and a Sherman tank, he slowly becomes an important part of the Shohoku High School team, which fights against the odds on the road towards the regional championships.\n\nSlam Dunk: Ky\u014dg\u014d Makk\u014d Taiketsu! (Champion Front Showdown!) is a five-on-five basketball game based on the anime and manga created by Takehiko Inoue. Following the story, starting from the first exhibition matches, the player can take control of either a single player or the whole Shohoku team in an arcade-style basketball game. The game uses a side-view for the center court, and zooms in for a head-on view when near the basket. There is also an exhibition mode for up to five players, where six different school teams from the series are available for play.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/from-tv-animation-slam-dunk-kyougou-makkou-taiketsu"}
