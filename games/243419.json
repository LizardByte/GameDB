Despite the turmoil in the Holy Spirit Agencies, the world had calmed down, and the peaceful days had returned to Gyoen Girl's Academy.\n\nHowever, one month ago, the aftermath of the boundary melting phenomenon, which had been prevented before, appeared in a clear form. Large-scale dimensional distortions were observed in large quantities throughout the Kanto region. The Japan Holy Spirit Agency began to bring the situation under control, and some students of Gyoen Girl's School, who had sensed the anomaly, also stood up. In the midst of all this, saints from the Holy Spirit Offices overseas arrived in Japan under the guise of dispatching the Holy Spirit of Disaster.\n\nThere are only seven days left until the Great Kanto Collapse.", "summary": "On October 30, 2008, Examu released a major update to Arcana Heart 2 called Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2. This version further balanced the game and fixed some bugs. It also featured some design changes, such as new character illustrations and a red redesign for Kaya Hirotaka. New additions included an additional stage; three new characters: Akane Inuwaka, Nazuna Inuwaka, and Parace L'Sia; their respective Arcana: Fenex (Sound), Kayatsuhime (Flower), Parace L'sia (Life); new color palettes for each character, available by pressing the Start button on the character select screen; and an additional training mode. Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2 was further updated to version 2.6 on February 27, 2009.\n\nAQ Interactive handled the PlayStation 2 port of Suggoi! Arcana Heart 2, which was released only in Japan on April 9, 2009. It was planned for a worldwide release but was cancelled due to low sales of the first one, as well as poor performance and slowdown in gameplay, making the port weaker than the arcade perfect port of the first one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/suggoi-arcana-heart-2--1", "videos": [{"id": 87071, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LOG485GbYco", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOG485GbYco", "title": "PS2 Longplay [025] Suggoi Arcana Heart 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LOG485GbYco/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 87072, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "GsCn_mYn2fw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsCn_mYn2fw", "title": "Suggoi!!
