The originality comes in his duo with Dr. Cortex, as he can throw him to places he can't reach himself or use him as a hammer to slap enemies. The consistent conflict between both heroes causes many funny situations.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crash-twinsanity", "videos": [{"id": 38182, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7Io0INNFPGE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Io0INNFPGE", "title": "Crash Twinsanity - E3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Io0INNFPGE/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 268, "name": "Crash Bandicoot"}]}
