Experience the magic of \u2018presence\u2019 in VR, exploring moments that feel as real as they are fantastically impossible. We've built a magic box full of toys and a robot guide; make a new friend, then touch, tap, bounce, hold and throw things, and play together.\n\nOculus Rex designed First Contact, and is the team that brought you Dreamdeck, Farlands, Prologue and the original Toybox demo. We drew from the inspiration of the 80s: A magical decade when computers and game consoles moved from science fiction to household items and everything seemed possible."}
