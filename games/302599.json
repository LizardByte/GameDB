With even the long-standing local police corruption rearing its ugly head, there's more to fight against than the cases themselves as friends become almost indistinguishable from enemies \u2013 the very future of law and order hangs in the balance, from forces both inside and out.\n\nJoin Storm and investigate crime scenes, defend clients in court, achieve justice for the innocent and \u2013 with a bit of luck \u2013 uncover the truth of the fateful terrorist attack and the sprawling cult behind it.", "summary": "Acquittal: Induction, the first installment in a planned series, was born from inspiration from Capcom's Ace Attorney series and is in many ways a homage. Alternating between investigating criminal cases at the crime scene and defending clients in heated courtroom trials, it inherits its basic mechanics from the classic visual novel series, while taking and running with those core concepts.\n\nIt has been on an indefinite hiatus since April 06, 2018.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/acquittal-induction", "videos": [{"id": 114244, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "HbTF2vPJq7s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbTF2vPJq7s", "title": "Acquittal: Induction - DEMO Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HbTF2vPJq7s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
