However, the calamity known as Storm-9 tore the region apart.\nThe Aevium Region has lived a time of peace since then. Pok\u00e9mon and Trainers alike band together to create a region worth living in. However, the dark and sinister organization, Team Xen, rises from the shadows to destroy what little peace the region has left. Explore the Aevium Region while also defending the land from Team Xen. Discover the dark secrets this world has kept hidden under the cracks that separate Aevium and shakes it to its very core.\n\nThis world needs you.\n\nWill you lend us your strength?", "summary": "Pokemon Rejuvenation is an episodically released Pok\u00e9mon fan game and Spiritual Successor to Pok\u00e9mon Reborn. Similarly to Pokemon Reborn, Pokemon Rejuvenation is not a ROM Hack, but rather an RPG Maker game.\n\nThe game takes place in the Aevium region, which was split into several islands after some catastrophic event in the past. The protagonist and his/her/their mother, Nancy, are in the process of arriving there on the S.S. Oceana when it gets attacked by the local villainous team, Team Xen. Despite the ship being destroyed and the protagonist's mother being captured, the protagonist manages to escape thanks to the fire-type Elite 8 member, Tesla. With her help, they arrive in Eastern Gearen City on the mainland of Aevium, ready to battle the Pokemon League, defeat Team Xen, and hopefully rescue their mother in the process.\n\nLike its inspiration, Pokemon Reborn, Pokemon Rejuvenation has a story that's more mature than the main Pokemon games, albeit not as dark as Pokemon Reborn's story (for the most part, anyway). It's also very, very difficult, arguably even more so than its inspiraton. The game borrows Pokemon Reborn's ideas of a field effect system, 18 Gym Leaders, and a level cap, but also adds an Elite 8 instead of the traditional Elite 4, as well as new, unique moves for every gym leader. In addition, the game brings back Shadow Pokemon from Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum and Pok\u00e9mon XD (although they get a Nerf, with their attacks being not very effective against Fairy-type Pokemon).\n\nThe game, and the supplementary spin-off game Where Love Lies, can be downloaded on its own official subforum of the Pok\u00e9mon Reborn forums here or here.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
