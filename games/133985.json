Experiment to discover their purpose. Search the island for a way into the mansion. Talk to people and get to know them (or don't, it's up to you.) Who you choose to interact with can change the way the game unfolds. There is more than one way to approach this story, and more than one tale to be told. \n \n \nDiscover Curious Creatures \n \nDuring your journey you'll encounter a variety of strange and wonderful creatures to interact with. Some might be friendly, others might be afraid of you, and others still can be dangerous if handled the wrong way. But if you take the time to observe them, you might learn a thing or two, and get to know them better.", "summary": "What happens when we die?
