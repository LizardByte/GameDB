The South American environment provides a premise which is naturally beautiful and full of new millennium conflicts.\n\nMarginal governments, involved in local expansionism, continually scuffle with one another and with major global powers. Complicating matters, drug cartels have evolved beyond money to political forces rivaling established governments. Influenced by current events, the game is both topical and novel.\n\nThe sometimes local philosophy of \u201cyour enemy is my friend and your friend is my enemy\u201d gives rise to a multitude of ever-changing alliances and conflicts which drive the game\u2019s rapid action. The culmination of the conflict takes place in the Angel Falls area of Venezuela providing both a spectacular setting and a surprise ending.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 3665, "name": "Beta trailer", "video_id": "IeCAMDVk4tE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeCAMDVk4tE", "title": "Delta Force Angel Falls BETA - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IeCAMDVk4tE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
