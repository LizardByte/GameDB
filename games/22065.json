It is an offshoot of the Resident Evil light gun shooter games, but based on the story of the Dino Crisis series. Though it can be played by other means, a light gun is recommended, as the game is one in a number of Capcom games that try to bridge the gap between light gun games and traditional games that allow the player greater range of control over their movements in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dino-stalker", "videos": [{"id": 36005, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gmcVFJPlyuk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmcVFJPlyuk", "title": "Dino Stalker - Stage 6 - Trinity", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gmcVFJPlyuk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
