You're a contract killer; a sleek, stylish, feline predator that trades in scalps and briefcases full of cash. Your mission: eliminate a target for Ludum-Tek in an \"unconventional way\".\n\nPacking pixelart and a brooding soundtrack, Badass plunges you into a city wracked with desperation. Revel in the apathy of the protagonist as you work through situational puzzles, interspersed with cinematic action scenes and tense shootouts. It's an in and out job, take out the target and get paid, right?", "videos": [{"id": 35726, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YWaLj65ps5o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWaLj65ps5o", "title": "Badass Inc gameplay (Indiecade 2015)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YWaLj65ps5o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
