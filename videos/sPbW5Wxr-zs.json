I had gotten permission from the creator to post this video publicly.\n\nSomsnosa is a game/demo by Mason Lindroth released in 2013, this game was originally made for Ludum Dare 26, which had the theme of Minimalism, it also seems like Mason planned on making more for this game as there are leftover assets in hylics that are in a much more finished state. this game is now considered lost media as Mason had removed any existing download of the game, now few people own the game. there are videos of the game but all videos go through the game as fast as possible without exploring and getting any items, so I figure I'd record a 100% run with my own copy. This video is made with the purpose of preservation whilst featuring all content the game has to offer.
