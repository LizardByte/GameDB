Will you help the remaining survivors reach their families, help the terminally ill or will you be greedy and make the most out of the dire situation by hoarding all the supplies you get from them? All the decisions that you take will shape the story and affect the world around you.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-train-final-ride"}
