He created a series of \u201cBuddha dance.\u201d \nHe does behave rather differently and in the game, the player attack just like whatever he does in real life, such as rolling on the ground over and over and over\u2026 oh yes, that Buddha Dance too, which is something you don\u2019t want to miss. \nI did refer to objects in history for the costumes and buildings, but the story plot is a work of fiction.
