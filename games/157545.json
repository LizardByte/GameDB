To do this, you build a maze in her dreamworld to keep the Nightmares from her until the morning arrives. Use a variety of fun structures to build a labyrinth full of intricate Rube Goldberg-esque chains of traps and distractions.\n\nLife is crazy. Sweet Dreams Alex is a peaceful game to take a break with. You don\u2019t destroy any monsters, but just hold them off until the morning. You don\u2019t battle some terrible evil; you just help Alex process her days and get a good night\u2019s sleep. The game\u2019s plot is a simple slice-of-life story about Alex discovering the world\u2014and all the adventures she has on the way. There are no antagonists (except for a group of particularly nasty ducks) and the tone is consistently light and happy. Sweet Dreams Alex is comfort food in a challenging world.", "summary": "Sweet Dreams Alex is a cute, relaxing puzzle game in which you build labyrinths to keep Nightmares away.
