There is already AMIGA longplay of this game and I played SNES port of this game for my Youtube channel. This port is something between of those two ports. Sega port has some levels from SNES port, but most were from original AMIGA port. There is no chainmachine, which is also missing from SNES port. Sega has 50 lemmings in each tribe (AMIGA 60 and SNES 40). There is also few other little differenses,but Im too lazy to list them. I managed to save EVERY lemming on each tribe, except Polar. One poor lemming died at polar 8 level. Very sad... \r\n\r\nI also tried some faster solutions. Video is splitted on two parts. Each video includes 6 tribes, starting from Beach and ending to Sports. I also showed all those amazingly long passwords at the end of video after ending. This port also got buch of glitches too. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CuiL8KjiNbs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CuiL8KjiNbs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CuiL8KjiNbs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [103] Lemmings 2: The Tribes (Part 1 of 2)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org \r\n\r\nPlayed By: Lemmy556\r\n\r\nMy favorite game from Lemmings series.
