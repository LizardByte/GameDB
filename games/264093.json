While it adapted characters, art and music loosely from Dodonpachi Sai-Dai-Ou-Jou, its gameplay had little in common with other games in the series. It lacks the core combo and scoring mechanics from the core Dodonpachi series, instead opting for a very basic set of shooting mechanics. Like many of Mobirix's other shooters, the base game is free to play but players are able to play for single-use powerups, and the game is balanced to be difficult to play without using them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dodonpachi-unlimited", "videos": [{"id": 96823, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "uKEVw1KAwI8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKEVw1KAwI8", "title": "Dodonpachi Unlimited (Android Gameplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uKEVw1KAwI8/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6845, "name": "Dodonpachi"}]}
