Originally intended to be told through the eyes of another marine escaping the invasion on Earth in during Doom II, Demon Eclipse went through multiple iterations but was ultimately dropped due to real-life and the loss of motivation for the project by the author. The project had succumbed to multiple rounds of scope-bloat and become too much to manage. The first episode of first dropped from the mod, but was later made standalone by Blue Shadow. The intent was to focus and refine the second episodes 'hell-tech' theme in the \"Hell-Forged Edition\", but that also fell thru in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Amuscaria had revive the project in a complete reboot of the second episode by the name of Hell-Forged, with a much narrower focus around the Gothic hell-tech theme.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/demon-eclipse"}
