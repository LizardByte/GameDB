In Obstacle mode, you race around a track and must complete the track in time and collect enough points by wake boarding through rings and over jumps. In Trick mode, you compete to score as many points as possible by performing tricks. There are over 45 tricks in total.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burstrick-wake-boarding"}
