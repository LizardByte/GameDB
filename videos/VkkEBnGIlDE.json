One could say that it is a cross between both. A queue of Cuthberts wait to be rescued from the mine, which means climbing up through several levels of rails with ore wagons before reaching the surface. This can be described as similar to the road in Frogger in gameplay, but is complicated by the ladder on which Satan himself climbs back and forth, firing a bolt of fire at Cuthbert whenever he finds himself at the same layer. Being hit by the fire means that Cuthbert is sent falling to a certain death in the flaming pits of hell which is found beneath the rails. Being hit by a rail car, on the other hand, simply means that he is sent back to a lower rail. If he is hit by another wagon there, the procedure is repeated, until he eventually winds up in the flames anyway. The line of Cuthberts is seemingly infinite, but after five are killed, it's game over. As they reach the surface, the skill level is raised, which means that the cars go at a faster pace and with smaller gaps between them.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkkEBnGIlDE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkkEBnGIlDE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkkEBnGIlDE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkkEBnGIlDE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkkEBnGIlDE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cuthbert in the Mines for the TRS-80 CoCo", "description": "Came also out for:\n\nDragon 32/64\n\n\nGame description:\n\nIn this episode in Cuthbert's adventurous life, he finds himself in something that could be described as hell, even though the title tells us that it is a mine.
