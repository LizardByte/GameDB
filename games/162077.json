Use binoculars to spy into the homes of neighbors, discover lurking enemies, and look over the city of Toronto to find important clues and put the pieces together.\n\nStraddle the line between reality and the game as you depend on your natural intuition to guide you to your next step. With no dialogue prompts revealing answers it will be up to you to save Sala. Get lost in time loops as you discover if your past is all an illusion, or if it really is as you remember. Can all be forgiven? Is redemption possible? Or is there truly no way out?", "summary": "Become an investigator in Keyword, a narrative thriller where you\u2019ll depend on skills of logical deduction, hacking, and social engineering to solve challenging puzzles as the only means of finding your missing daughter.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/keyword-a-spiders-thread", "videos": [{"id": 55301, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wXbow5Qsd7M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXbow5Qsd7M", "title": "Keyword: A Spider's Thread - An Interactive Detective Thriller", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wXbow5Qsd7M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
