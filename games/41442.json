His goal is to exhaust your life energy; yours is to destroy his power source! It will take time to reach it because he has laid many barriers that you need to penetrate. Lucky for you, your power balls mix with his shields to give you zapping deflectors, larger deflectors and even extra life power! Stay sharp, you have a long journey ahead of you! \n \nYou control the reflector located at the bottom of the screen. You start with a ball on the paddle and use it to destroy the shields above. Bonuses will randomly fall from the shields so be quick and collect the ones you need. Clear the screen and advance through the levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
