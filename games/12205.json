The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/risky-woods", "videos": [{"id": 40473, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EChseE1P65A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EChseE1P65A", "title": "Risky Woods Longplay (Amiga) [50 FPS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EChseE1P65A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
