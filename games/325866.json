It's a game where creativity and freedom take center stage. We offer a variety of modes: sandbox, classic shooters, arcade racing, social dynamic modes like Mafia, and even an editor where you can create your own maps, stories, and worlds.\n\nLepozhdian presents a unique game that knows it\u2019s a game. In this experience, reality and the game world intertwine, breaking the fourth wall. Characters discuss their roles, the game\u2019s rules, and even address the player directly, creating an unforgettable experience. It\u2019s more than a game \u2014 it\u2019s a reflection on what a game truly is.\n\nThere are no strict boundaries in the game. Want to build a city? Go ahead. Prefer competition? Host races or battles with friends. It's all up to you.\n\nOur game supports multiplayer, style customization, and VR. Want to play in your own atmosphere, with personalized interface settings and weapons? No problem. Most importantly, we've added modding capabilities through a built-in programming language. Everything you need for creativity is already in the game.\n\nLepozhdian Vibe is a free game with no microtransactions. However, the project's support relies entirely on you. Subscribe to our Patreon if you'd like to help us make the game even better.\n\nThis format allows us to continually develop and improve the game, respond promptly to your feedback, add new content, fix bugs, and implement innovative ideas. This gives us the flexibility to keep the game fresh and engaging for you over a long period of time.\n\nWe are confident that this approach will allow us to create something truly special and captivating. Together with you, we can develop a game that will bring joy for years to come.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lepozhdianvibe", "videos": [{"id": 136856, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "5wsMnHPP4ns", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wsMnHPP4ns", "title": "LepozhdianVibe - Indie Game Trailer | Your Synthwave Paradise", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wsMnHPP4ns/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
