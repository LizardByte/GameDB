The magimanders were the last race of magic-casting creatures, hidden away at the base of an angry volcano filled with monsters. As the young wizard's skills grew, so did the invasions of swamp slimes and quarry rockmen. Soon, the wizard knew he might be the magimander's last hope of survival.\n\nIn ancient days, magic stones had been placed to block access to the village, and the only artifacts that could break those barriers were wands that had been given to four land demons as offerings. The wizard knew that if he wanted to move forward to challenge the evil forces of the Volcano Dragon, he would have to retrieve the wands from the four land demons. In addition to the wands, it was told that four barriers protected the core of the volcano. Each barrier was powered by an amulet of the same color, buried deep in a hidden cave.", "summary": "Elemage is another lost old Scott Cawthon game that was made on February 10, 2003. The game actually has quite a few old screenshots available and from them, the game shows to be an RPG revolving around a blue-cloaked wizard fighting beasts in a medieval land.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elemage"}
