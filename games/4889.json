The camera views and turns show the 3D view, but essentially the game is played as a 2D platformer with a linear path on a single plane. Often George needs to manipulate objects in the environment, for instance moving boxes to create a platform, to continue.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/george-of-the-jungle-and-the-search-for-the-secret"}
