It was published by WARP in Japan in 1999 and then by Sega in North America in 2000.[D2 was written and directed by #Kenji #Eno, and serves as the third and final entry in the D series after D and Enemy Zero. Like the previous two games, D2 stars the digital actress Laura and serves as an independent story unrelated to either game.\nDevelopment for D2 started as a premier game for the cancelled Panasonic #M2 console, the successor for the #3DO console.\n\nIn this early version, a pregnant Laura was to have been attacked by a supernatural force during a passenger flight, her unborn child kidnapped from her womb, magically aged, and sent back in time. The player would have taken the role of Laura's son - now a teenager - trapped in a large, European castle, from which he had to escape while being assaulted by supernatural phenomena.\n\nThe game was \"about 50 percent finished\" when Panasonic officially announced that the M2 was not going to be released, leaving WARP with no way to sell the title. When given the chance to release D2 for other systems, Kenji Eno decided to abandon this concept and create an entirely new game for the Dreamcast.\n\nLike the M2 version, D2 became the first officially announced game for a new console, the Dreamcast.\n\u25ba Portal SEGA-SKY - http://sega.c0.pl\n\u25ba Twitter - https://twitter.com/SEGA_SKY\n\u25ba GameFaqs - http://www.gamefaqs.com/users/SEGASupportSite/contributions\n\u25ba Support - https://sellfy.com/segasky", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6azIWjcDeps/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6azIWjcDeps/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6azIWjcDeps/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 D2 - Gameplay |  SEGA Dreamcast", "description": "#D2 (#\uff24\u306e\u98df\u53532 D\u012b no Shokutaku Ts\u016b?) is a survival horror +rpg elements video game developed by #WARP for the #Dreamcast.
