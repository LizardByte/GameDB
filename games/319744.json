With a different and greatly expanded story and many new locations, you will find yourself battling many more zombies, headcrabs and more in a bid to free the town from this horrific, nightmarish infestation.\n\nThe atmosphere in the original HL2 game was both interesting, and terrefying, and that is the driving force behind our choice on creating a modifacation on that enviroment alone. All maps from this modifacation have a very similar kind of feel of atmosphere and gameplay from the original Ravenholm, but with an different and expanded story, and many new locations. So, you will find yourself battleing many more Zombies, Headcrabs, and more.\n\nThe sequel to the story after John (our player) escapes from Ravenholm goes on to Eye of the Storm.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ravenholm", "videos": [{"id": 129815, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mGEGY5hUljs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGEGY5hUljs", "title": "Half Life 2 - Ravenholm Mod Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mGEGY5hUljs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
