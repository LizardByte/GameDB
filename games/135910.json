But then the king died, and the sorcerer sealed his body in a temple on a distant island, while the egg was lost to history. \n \nThe game starts when the egg hatches into a tiny blue creature with a little red antenna atop his head. Now he has to make his way through a series of rooms, buildings and outdoor environments until he reaches the far island where he can break the spell that would bring the evil king back to life, to enslave the world once again.", "summary": "In Search of the Lost Words (1996) is an enchanting educational game geared toward building reading and comprehension skills in older children. The graphics are charming, and the gameplay quickly becomes immersive, drawing the player into a simple but interesting storyline. \n \nGameplay \n \nThe interface is intuitive and easy to use; a simple point and click selects and names objects, some of which are highlighted for later use in a sidebar. Each object when clicked will reward you with a cute animation, and some are gateways to minigames, mostly memory and match-up challenges, all the way through the main action that give you extra adverbs and adjectives that come in useful later. At the end of each stage, there is a section of the story of the egg, and by extension the creature, that has gaps in it that you must fill with the \u201clost words\u201d of the title. \n \nOnce you\u2019ve found every word (and some of them are not obvious at all, like clicking on a large vase only to have it called a parrot because that\u2019s what was hiding in it) you can proceed to the next phase of your journey.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "videos": [{"id": 38713, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "URfdCD4VP00"}]}
