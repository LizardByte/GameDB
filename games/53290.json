Late-term capitalism has made everything very bad. You live in the gritty cyberpunk city of Neo Detroit, making just enough to afford the memes you need to get by.

Take a trip to the party spa for a night of R&R. Bribe the bouncer with a meme. Buy illegal vape juice. Browse the sauna and talk to the patrons. Who knows, you might just find love (spoiler: you will).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/love-is-the-plan-the-plan-is-death"}
