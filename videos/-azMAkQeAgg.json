This game was only released in Japan in 1998 and in Europe in 2000. This game is also on the Playstation store for PS3 and PSP  (I did get buy the game for PSP aswell but it's way harder).\r\n\r\nThis gameplay footage and I was going to upload more of it but I had to cut it down to under 10 mins. \r\n\r\nThe video features a bit of Super Bishi Bashi but most has Hyper Bishi Bashi as I think it's a better mode.  But what I do think is that Nintendo got there idea making Wario Ware from Bishi Bashi which Bishi Bashi is a better game.\r\n\r\nI just wish the others did make a release over here shame as they only stayed in Japan.\r\n\r\nI am using the pSX 1.13 emulator and playing this game off the original disc.  Also I did get the chance to play this game once in the arcade while I was on holiday at Great Yarmouth back in 2005 that's the only time I have ever seen this game in arcades in the UK. \r\n\r\n\u30d3\u30b7\u30d0\u30b7\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-azMAkQeAgg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-azMAkQeAgg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-azMAkQeAgg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Bishi Bashi Special (PS1) \u30d3\u30b7\u30d0\u30b7\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb", "description": "The game features over 80 mini games and in this video I show you some.
