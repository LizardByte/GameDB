The catch is that different characters fall at different speeds: Toads bounce the highest, while Donkey Kong Jrs. bounce the lowest. Yoshi Eggs also appear and contain either a Bob-omb or a Moon (a Super Star in the first game); the eggs break open when they are caught or hit the ground. The player receives two points for catching an egg. If a Bob-omb reaches the carriage, everyone, including the Mario Bros., runs away as the carriage explodes, and the player gets a miss. If the Mario Bros. catch a Moon, the player receives five points. At 200, 500, and 700 points, Peach appears and blows a kiss, sending out a heart for Mario or Luigi to catch to remove a miss. Music is also featured in this version, with the tempo changing depending on the speed of the game. In the Game & Watch Gallery 4 version, the time of day changes every 200 points collected.\n\nIf the player selects this game in Game & Watch Gallery 4 yet does not start playing it, a humorous sequence plays. In particular, Mario and Luigi catch a Toad sent flying to the left and a Yoshi sent flying to the right, only to narrowly stop when discovering their next \"rescue\" was in fact a Bob-omb, which detonates inches from them, and are then forced to flee as a dozen Bob-ombs are raining from the sky.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire--6", "collections": [{"id": 5205, "name": "Game & Watch"}]}
