What you just watched was a trailer for our game \"Whispers of Prague\", of which you may have seen brief previews in my tutorial videos. It's a point-and-click adventure game created using the Godot Engine, and we are currently very pleased with the results. The entire game system is practically complete. We have fully developed the first two chapters of the story and aim to expand the final game to at least five chapters. The story will branch, based on player decisions, leading to several different endings, which will definitely enhance the game's replayability. According to our estimates, the complete game should provide a minimum of 8 hours of entertainment, and likely more if you choose to tackle many side quests presented to the protagonist.\nOur Steam page is already published, and we would be very grateful if you could add Whispers of Prague to your wishlist. It only takes one click, and it would tremendously help us in the future visibility of the game on the Steam store. You can find the link to the page in the description of this video.\nAlong with the game, we will definitely release a soundtrack, which currently includes 17 original compositions, with many more to come. We strive to make the gaming experience as immersive as possible, and both the music and a substantial amount of text and dialogue are designed to significantly contribute to the overall atmosphere of the game.\nThank you for watching, and if you want to stay informed about all the news regarding our game, don't forget to subscribe to this channel. We appreciate your support and wish you a wonderful day.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acufKoisB4M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acufKoisB4M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acufKoisB4M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acufKoisB4M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acufKoisB4M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Whispers of Prague: The Executioner's Last Cut (trailer and look inside the Godot editor)", "description": "Wishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767990/Whispers_of_Prague_The_Executioners_Last_Cut\n\ud83d\udca1 Get exclusive content on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/FencerDevLog\n\nThe game website: https://shadermess.com\n\nHi everyone!
