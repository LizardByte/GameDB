You\u2019ll have to learn how to control your powers including Spider Sense, web-slinging, and wall crawling, and the all-new aerial combat moves. The world\u2019s toughest villains, including Shocker, Vulture, and the Green Goblin will all be after you. Are you up for the challenge?", "summary": "Spider-Man is an action-adventure game released in 2002 on the Xbox, Playstation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows. Developped by Treyarch and published by Activision, the game has you playing as Spider-Man in the events of the movie while also adding new ennemies like the Shocker and Vulture. The gameplay consists of successive levels where you need to defeat thugs with your fists and web and save someone/something from multiple sources of danger until you reach the boss of the section.
