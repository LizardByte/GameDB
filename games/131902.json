It was featured as an upcoming game in the Official Nintendo Player's Guide in 1987.\n\nNot much is known about the title aside from the fact that it was considered a follow-up to Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., Donkey Kong Jr. Math and Donkey Kong 3. The two blurbs describing the game suggest that barrel-throwing would return as a mechanic, and that Donkey Kong would appear as a playable character for the first time. No images were ever shown of the game and it is not known if Return of Donkey Kong ever existed past the conceptual stage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
