The urban side of the town is quite developed, adorned with contemporary landmarks, while the seaside offers a stark contrast with its untouched nature. Shizunomiya Academy, a central institution in this town, is where the athletic types find solace in the expansive nearby park. The more urban-spirited students venture into the city after school to indulge in activities befitting their age.\n\nAmong the students is Kazuma Tachibana, a newcomer this spring who possesses a unique ability: he can perceive the thoughts and emotions of others. It may sound like a valuable asset, but it\u2019s far from perfect. Determining the origin of these mental images is a challenge, and when multiple people are involved, their thoughts intertwine in overwhelming chaos. Despite the uncontrollable nature of this innate ability, Kazuma devotes himself daily to mastering it, managing to live an average school life amid the challenge.\n\nShizunomiya Academy espouses a distinctive educational ethos, encouraging students to form 'action squads.' These groups, assembled to partake in various events throughout the year, are not chosen based on compatibility or shared interests; instead, the squad members are selected by the ruthless hand of fate - a simple drawing of lots.\n\nThe group that gathers around the socially awkward Kazuma is an eclectic mix of personalities. There's the reserved yet cool Sakura Yukimoto, the endearing and whimsical Moka Momozono, the vivacious and physically gifted Natsuki Kazama, the enigmatic Saya Kurotsuki, who proclaims herself as a psychic, the strikingly beautiful Yuriko Ootori from the drama club, the athletically proficient but intellectually lacking Yoichi Kitagami, and the unapologetically flirtatious Shunta Takanaga.\n\nAlthough the eight seldom gel, they find themselves tied together under the banner of their 'action squad,' maintaining a semblance of camaraderie. Amidst this dynamic, an unexpected event rocks the academy: thievery in the girls' locker room. Little does anyone know that this incident will mark the advent of Kazuma Tachibana's unexpected journey as the so-called 'Reception Detective'...", "summary": "This is a mystery/suspense ADV, so you must use your detective skills to solve puzzles and crimes.
