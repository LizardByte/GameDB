Navigate an island in an old train, upgrade it over time, and use it to fight an evil sentient train that terrorizes your home. Charles is hungry; don't be his next meal.\n\nIn Choo-Choo Charles you're given the task of eradicating a monster known by the locals as \"Charles\". Nobody knows where he came from, but they know why; to eat the flesh of puny humans. You have a small yellow train, with a map, mounted machine gun, and an exquisite collection of bobble-heads on the dashboard. You'll use this train to get from place to place, while you complete missions for the townspeople, or loot scraps from around the island. Over time you\u2019ll use your scraps to upgrade your train\u2019s speed, armor, and damage. You\u2019ll grow your arsenal, and (hopefully) become an unstoppable force, ready to take on the great and mighty Charles.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4jOvGjxM1xg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4jOvGjxM1xg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4jOvGjxM1xg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4jOvGjxM1xg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Choo-Choo Charles - Announcement Trailer", "description": "Add Choo-Choo Charles to your Steam wishlist now! https://store.steampowered.com/app/1766740?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=trailer1\n\nChoo-Choo Charles is a survival horror, open world, shooter game.
