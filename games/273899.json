Dear Esther is a ghost story told using first-person gaming technologies. Rather than traditional gameplay, the focus here is on exploration, uncovering the mystery of the island, of who you are and why you are here.\n\nFragments of story are randomly triggered by moving around the environments, making every telling unique. Features a stunning, specially commissioned soundtrack. Forget the normal rules of play; if nothing seems real here, it's because it may just be all a delusion.\n\nWhat is the significance of the aerial - What happened on the motorway - is the island real or imagined - who is Esther and why has she chosen to summon you here? The answers are out there, on the lost beach and the tunnels under the island. Or then again, they may just not be, after all...", "summary": "Dear Esther is an award-winning, critically acclaimed, experimental first-person game. Built in the Source engine, it abandons traditional gameplay, leaving only a rich world soaked in atmosphere, and an abstract, poetic story to explore. Dear Esther was originally launched in 2008 and was later rebuilt by Robert Briscoe in 2012 and 2016.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dear-esther--1", "videos": [{"id": 100409, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "INVUttEs-UY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INVUttEs-UY", "title": "Half-Life 2-Dear Esther Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/INVUttEs-UY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
