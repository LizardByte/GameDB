Only now, with the gaming power made possible by the PlayStation is a world as vast and detailed as King's Field a reality. This first-person game is completely rendered in beautiful 3D polygon graphics, with texture mapping and fully controllable 360\u00b0 viewing.\n\nImagine a universe where you can travel freely - being able to look up and down, climb ancient ruins, traverse across oceans, jump off ridges, and duel enemies - all in real time, non-linear play. This visual world will not only astound you, but will pull you right into its universe. You will embark on a journey to an island of evil-ridden dungeons, villages, and castles as you seek the Moonlight Sword, which had been stolen by a cult of insidious worshipers of evil.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-s-field", "videos": [{"id": 65992, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7J2WTVjnSvQ"}], "collections": [{"id": 1450, "name": "King's Field"}]}
