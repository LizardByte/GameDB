It was released in Japan on October 5, 1984 and in Europe on July 15, 1987. The game was also released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 22, 2008 and in Europe and Australia on October 31, 2008. The game has similar gameplay to that of Pac-Man. It is the only game designed by Shigeru Miyamoto that has not been released in North America, despite the fact that the game is simple and in English. This was due to Nintendo of America's strict policies on the use of religious icons in games, which were at their strictest level at the time of the game's original release, but there would eventually be a North American release for the first time in October 2023 as part of the Nintendo Switch Online lineup.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/devil-world"}
