My first playthrough had sound-sync issues and I got lost many times. This is still the second time I've ever played this version, so it's not 100% perfect. Due to not being able to read anything and there being some monumental differences from the U.S. Super Nintendo version...I know that I missed some things. There are some items, like the jar of gold liquid, the letter, etc that I'm guessing have some sort of significance in a side quest. **You will see some video transitions from time to time. This is where I stopped Camtasia to make sure the sound was ok, I did not want to record for too long just in case. I also do need to take breaks myself, but I started again from the same point.**\n\nI would really love to see this version translated someday. It is superior in every possible way to the Super Nintendo game that I grew up playing! It is a very interesting and unique experience. I went 20 years on the SNES game, to discover the Sharp x68000 game and realize I had the watered-down version all along. I would like to do a comparison video between the two to really point out just how screwed over we got. Nobody outside of Japan had the Sharp x68000, which is a shame, it was a better console. The occasional \"hiccup\" you will see is due to me running Camtasia - when it's off, the game is smooth as a baby's bottom.\n\nAnyway. This is how you fire up the game and get through it. It is a little bit harder than the SNES game. Due to the jousting style of combat, it can be easy to get trapped by an enemy and watch your HP deplete in seconds - which is the same effective strategy you should be using on them. There are so many more people and landmarks and items that were not in the English version, I would love to know how they fit into the story. Not to mention the graphics and music are SO MUCH BETTER!! *Note: I did not include level-grinding on the camera, I put the status screen up if I remembered to show what level I got to...use proper discretion to succeed.\n\nI've typed up a fairly simple walkthrough of where to get the tools to play the game, how to get started, and how to finish it. Please comment if you have a specific question.\n\nhttp://textuploader.com/5sthv\n\nHere is my Super Nintendo longplay:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1HNfjh_NWw\n\nCheck out ReyVGM's page for ending screenshots plus an ENGLISH translation!\n\nhttp://www.vgmuseum.com/end/x68/a/lagoon.htm", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1VA3UU4xDc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1VA3UU4xDc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1VA3UU4xDc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1VA3UU4xDc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1VA3UU4xDc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lagoon \u30e9\u30b0\u30fc\u30f3 (1990, Sharp x68000) Longplay/Playthrough [JAPANESE]", "description": "Here we go again.
