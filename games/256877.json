Each map was designed to be played from pistol-start; continuous play is fine but will make the play through much easier. This map set originally started out as a single map contribution to the Vinesauce map contest held in 2016 by Joel \"Vargskelethor\". The map in question (MAP02) was started on in early September, and finished on September 9th. Afterwards, I officially started the project on October 10th (shortly after finishing MAP04).\n\nMy goal with this project was to exercise with the Doom II texture assets, and to create some maps for practice. All maps use stock Doom II textures (aside from skies and minor extras). The maps are medium-to-large in size and have many different paths that you can take. Replayability was a design goal I tried to aim for. Difficulty is somewhat middling, but should ramp up a bit towards the end.\n\nAlso note that you shouldn't use jumping or crouching in these maps. It has been disabled in ZDoom, but some ports will still allow it. If you do use jumping or crouching, you may break the maps. Mouselook is ok but it may make certain secret triggers easier than intended.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/counterattack--1"}
