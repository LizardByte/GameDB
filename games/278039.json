So much has been crammed into this game; amazing colour and graphics courtesy of Jarrod Bentley, more visitors and options. There are more rides than Amusement Park 4000, and AI and strategy is more sophisticated than the 16K Spectrum version of Fun Park.\n\nYou've never seen a ZX81 game that looks and plays like this.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fun-park-zx81", "videos": [{"id": 102241, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pVJQIYEgyFU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVJQIYEgyFU", "title": "Game Under - ZX81 Fun Park", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pVJQIYEgyFU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
