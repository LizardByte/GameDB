As the numbers dwindled, the fighting became more desparate. The survivors knew that there could only be one winner.\n\nFinally, there were only two soldiers left standing. They faced each other across the bedroom field, both exhausted but still determinded to win.\n\nAll you could hear is the sound of a rifle - and is was quiet.
