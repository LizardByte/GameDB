The gameplay resembles that of \"dungeon crawlers\", meaning that there are no friendly areas; though the view for exploration is top-down rather than first-person (which is reserved for the turn-based battles). The gameplay mechanics are mostly confined to fighting random enemies and earning enough experience points to go up a level and standing a chance against the next \"boss\" enemy. There is no equipment system, and battle commands are restricted to \"Attack\", \"Escape\", and \"Item\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/angel-hearts"}
