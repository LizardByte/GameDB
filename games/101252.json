They finally found a balance and formed the world of today, known as the Continent of Elwes.\n\nThe Continent of Elwes is a land divided between Abyss Empire, Landar Kingdom, and many other nations.\n\nThree years ago, Abyss Empire, the most powerful nation on the continent, started a series of wars, intending to bring the whole continent under its control,\n\nOverwhelmed by the military power of Abyss Empire, nations bent their knees one after another, subjecting themselves to the yoke of their conqueror. Not long after, the only powers that could stand up to Abyss Empire were Landar Kingdom and a few other remaining factions.\n\nHowever, the ruler of Abyss Empire, Abyss III, seems to have greater ambitions...\n\nBy chance, a village boy named Ire meets Byin and his friend Leed, who is blessed by the Light Elf. Leed and Byin have learned that King Abyss' source of power comes from the Dark Elf. To keep the world from being consumed by the dark power, they set out to find a way to seal the Dark Elf. Desiring to leave the village since he was a young boy, Ire grabs the chance of a life time and begins a journey to save the world with Leed and Byin.", "summary": "Yanzhong de Shijie: Conviction is a role-playing game developed by Maker\u88fd\u9020\u6a5f.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yanzhong-de-shijie-conviction", "videos": [{"id": 39327, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qveeUmdlFJw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qveeUmdlFJw", "title": "\u773c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e16\u754c  - CONVICTION - \u9810\u544a\u5f71\u7247 ver3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qveeUmdlFJw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
