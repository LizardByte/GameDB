On the surface of these planets, the alpha researchers found many stone heads that seem to emit an unknown frequency. Further analysis shows the heads to be connected through these frequencies, but the purpose of the signals has not yet been uncovered. When the scientists moved one of the stones, they found several ancient texts left by a long extinct civilization. The old writings seem to warn about a great cataclysm 'when the heads awaken'. First it was thought to be nothing but superstition, however this prophecy may not entirely be made up! The exact details are still classified. The high council thus decided to destroy these heads, as they serve no purpose to us and might pose a threat to our galaxy. Since the stones are protected by a strange kind of force field, lasers as well as explosives have been proven unsuccessful to destroy them. You will be sent top secret drones which are able to penetrate the protective layer around these heads to neutralize them. The drones will be put under your command and are available at your request. Please be careful, supply is limited to 3 for each marked area. This should be enough to eliminate all nearby threats... If you aim properly. We count on you to finish this job ASAP, good luck!", "summary": "Lost Worlds Prophecy is a fun and relaxing casual puzzle game for the whole family. \nFire bouncy drones through the screen to collect shiny gems and hit your enemies to collect points and get to the next level. \n \nTop Puzzle fun and action for the complete family! \nUse your puzzle solving skills to beat the highscore and become the best! \ud83d\ude80 \nThe game is beautifully designed and features music+soundfx by German Techno producer 0x7f. \n \nPlease Note: The free version is Ad supported, however if you want the best puzzle action without ads, you can get the premium version of this challenging game in the play store as well, which is completely ad-free. \n \nThe whole game (from coding and design to music) is made by a single developer. \nOnly some graphic layers are purchased assets, so if you like it, please show your support by sharing the game on social media, or your own websites. \nThe more response it gets, the more updates and new levels it will receive. \nThank you! \ud83d\ude09 \n \nFYI: This is only the first version, more bonuses and items will be included soon for even more puzzle fun!
