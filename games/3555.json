Called Shinseki Evangelion in Japan, the Gainax-produced anime series originally aired from October '95 to March '96 and soon spawned a feature movie release in '97. The N64 game starts in the year 2015, 15 years after Second Impact. The Angels have returned and suddenly attack Tokyo-3. Using so-called \"terror-fields\" that cannot be penetrated by ordinary weapons, the Angels are taking on every human force sent out to oppose them. That's where you come in. As the pilot of the NERV-designed Evangelions, Shinji Ikari, you take your giant humanoid combat mech into battle with the Angels. Gameplay can best be described as interactive anime, as it relies heavily on timed button presses.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neon-genesis-evangelion", "videos": [{"id": 136503, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VUAE-VGvcsw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUAE-VGvcsw", "title": "Nintendo 64 Longplay [045] Neon Genesis Evangelion", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VUAE-VGvcsw/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4077, "name": "Neon Genesis Evangelion"}]}
