Keneda and Resistance member Kei make their way through the sewers where they are attacked by the military and flying bikes. Keneda manages to grab a bike and flies away, taking Kei on the back. They make their way through the tunnels guided by Kyoko, who has possessed Kei in order to use her to fight against Tetsuo. Tetsuo is taken by the authorities and experimented upon by the team that lead the Akira project. A matching pattern is found between Tetsuo and Akira and as the experiment continues, Tetsuo mutates and is now out of anyone's control.
