An unlicensed port of Sega's 1991 Sega Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog, the game was sold primarily around Asia, Russia, and other regions where pirate NES cartridges were distributed. Like the original, players venture to defeat the mad scientist Doctor Robotnik, who plots to turn the animal population of the fictional South Island into evil robots. Unlike the original, the game features Nintendo's mascot Mario as the main character rather than Sonic. The title is a portmanteau of \"Sonic\" and \"Mario\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/somari", "videos": [{"id": 49964, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "DNRBcjhT2Wc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNRBcjhT2Wc", "title": "Somari (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DNRBcjhT2Wc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6170, "name": "Somari"}]}
