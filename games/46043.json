Starting with three divers (lives) on a motor boat you were to drop into the deep blue and gather underwater riches such as pearls and treasure. Nothing like this had been released on the ZX Spectrum before, a game based around wet suit shenanigans was totally original.\n\nControlling your sprite was a little tricky at first, but once you got the hang of it you would be moving through the underwater caverns with the grace of Shelly Winters. Well nearly.\n\nYou could rotate your character clockwise or anti-clockwise then 'swim' in the direction you were facing. Acceleration to full speed took a couple of seconds (realistic) as did slowing down to a halt (again, realistic).\n\nIt was up to you to collect pearls from oyster shells (which would open and shut, timing to swoop in and nab the pearl was key), and to locate lost treasure (but only in the deepest parts of the underwater cavern).\n\nThere were hazards to avoid in the water such as sharks, jellyfish, eels and giant octupus. Colliding with any of these would take away one of your lives and lose all three and it was game over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scuba-dive", "videos": [{"id": 111025, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JW8nX7x9ML0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW8nX7x9ML0", "title": "Scuba Dive ZX Spectrum (c) 1983 Durell Software", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JW8nX7x9ML0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
