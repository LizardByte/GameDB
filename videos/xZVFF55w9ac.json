The game featured better graphics, music and controls, but most people dislikes it being a bit more action oriented. A part of the problem is that fighting is still quite a bit random and not funny at all. Probably the problem is just that they didn't work the first and last parts enough and they filled the with combat. Anyway, I personally love the game for its music, characters and some beautiful artwork in sequences and background.\n\nThe game still has some books that I read. I won't recommend you to read any, since they aren't relevant for the story (usually just present the minor characters). But if you are still interested, in 1:19:36 there is a book with some link with the first AITD and in 1:28:18 it's explained why you are fighting against Jack's crew again. The rest of the books are just about puzzles and presenting secondary characters (and there are quite a few).\n\nI also included Jack in the Dark, that was a promo demo included on the CD versions of AITD 1 and 2. It's not a bad idea, but probably not worth the time. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xZVFF55w9ac/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xZVFF55w9ac/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xZVFF55w9ac/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xZVFF55w9ac/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PC Longplay [254] Alone in the Dark 2 - Bonus - Jack in the Dark", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by Deskawa\n\nThis is the sequel to Alone in the Dark, launched 1993, a year after the first one.
