Some of the artists included are: Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Naughty By Nature, Queen Latifah (!), Yo-Yo, House of Pain, Onyx, Warren G. and Coolio. The gameplay is modeled after the fast-paced NBA Jam and takes place on various outdoor courts in 5 different U.S. cities. Up to four players can compete, and the \"Xtra\" button works similar to turbo. There's a shot meter that enables you to sink jumpers and rattle the rim. No 3-point shots exist and there are no fouls in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rap-jam-volume-one", "videos": [{"id": 115488, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "uvcSb5qR03M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvcSb5qR03M", "title": "Rap Jam Volume 1 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uvcSb5qR03M/sddefault.jpg"}]}
