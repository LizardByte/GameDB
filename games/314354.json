MANIAC is available for both 6 and 10 Switches mode. However, unlike the other difficulties, 10-Switches MANIAC charts are intended for one player instead of two. In MANIAC, most characters' palettes are changed to their 3P colors. The few exceptions are White day dream and full moon, which switch their characters' palettes to their 4P colors, and A LOVE WE NEVER KNEW which changes its character to Nyami [pns-3P]. BEGINNER and NORMAL MODEs were renamed to NORMAL and ANOTHER MODEs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popn-stage-ex"}
