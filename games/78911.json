The fate of defending China against this invasion falls to Zhang Daoling, a revered Taoist cleric able to confront these demons. On the emperor's behalf, only you can subdue Dou Xian and restore peace to the land!\n\nIn this game you are a Chinese hero who fights against many dark opponents with his sword and by casting magical arrows, fireballs and other attacking spells. Progressing from one area to another, you need to gain some new magical weapons to kill the dragons and other bosses. The energy of your weapons is lost when you use them, so think carefully what weapon you need to kill that monster and what you need for another.
