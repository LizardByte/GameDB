Going by the name, this hack is based on levels made before SR1 and SR2.\n\nThe 7 main courses of this hack aren't too complex and are from the times before work on SR1 was restarted because of the release of bigger level patches. The cap switch levels are based on the TTM demo levels, which were made before SR2 NoD was started.\n\nThe hack has 65 stars and isn't too hard. Also a \"feature\" of this update is that you will find a lot of owo and uwu in star names. Why? Because why not.\n\nThere is also the remake of this hack called \"Star Revenge 5: Neo Blue Realm\" which is better than this hack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-revenge-0-dot-5-the-unused-levels", "videos": [{"id": 95335, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HEsjdZv5m3I"}]}
