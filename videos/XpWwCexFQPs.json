A living world of infographics, driven by your input. All the bar charts, line diagrams and pie charts react to what the player is doing. One bar diagram might grow for every step you walk to the left, while another could decline with every jump you make. \n\nA New Perspective\nYou will have to explore Metrico and carefully analyze your every move to see how it affects the world, and whether it will get you further. This mechanic is called \u201cInput Morphing\u201d and it makes you think about actions you normally don\u2019t think about. \n\nThere are 6 unique worlds to explore with distinct challenges, mechanics, looks, sounds, and original music by Palmbomen. \nMetrico+ is a combination of exploration, skill, experimentation, but most of all: thinking outside of the box. \n\nWelcome to Metrico.
