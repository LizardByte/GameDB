GO GO GO!\n\nHere's a link to a discord server for the game: https://discord.com/invite/gnKWbCxZeg\nThis is the best place to reach me about bugs or comments about the game and would also be a pretty neat place to place gnarly gamer clips, if you want to.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOh no! Jerma985 has fallen into a spooky cavern filled with ROBOT dinosaurs and EVIL warlocks. In this wacky action-platformer, fight to escape the treacherous cavern while a live studio chat cheers you on!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHowdy Jermamites, last time I mentioned this game I said it would release in 1-2 weeks. That was a month ago. I apologize for the delay, but I thought a delay was necessary to be a proper Jerma985 project.\n\nStick around the Jerma reddit or discord or this youtube channel for updates. I'll probably also be making a wacky behind-the-scenes video to explain how and why this project exists.\n\nAlso, check out the first trailer for the game if you haven't: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-8wQ1HFXDs\n\nNote: This game is unaffiliated with Jerma985, was not commissioned by him, and does not represent his views. This is a completely free fan-project made for fun by a solo developer.\n\nTrailer music:\nGold Rush Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvjaGVuo2Fk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvjaGVuo2Fk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvjaGVuo2Fk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvjaGVuo2Fk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvjaGVuo2Fk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jerma's Big Adventure | Steam Announcement and Release Date", "description": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1722570/Jermas_Big_Adventure/\nAVAILABLE NOW FOR FREE.
