It all started 1993 with the smooth but simple Zen Nihon Pro Wrestling. Then the updated version \"Dash\" was released with new performers, tag team wrestling moves, and the 4 way elimination match.\n\n'Budoukan has the same basic look as the first 2 but everything has been re-drawn. The roster is bigger with 19 wrestlers! And the gameplay is deeper with more moves and a submission system. The music which was excellent in the previous games has been improved further. This is real wrestling, it's All Japan Pro Wrestling!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zen-nippon-pro-wrestling-2-3-4-budokan"}
