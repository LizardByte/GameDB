Bowser and the Doctor joined forces, and they used the power of technology to create a star-hungry monster \u2013 which they would use to crush the wishes of people and make them submit to their power.\n\nNow Mario must stop them!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-bros-dot-the-8th-star"}
