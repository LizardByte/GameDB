While the Autobots longed for a peaceful existence, the Decepticons only dreamed of domination. The ensuing war between the two factions devastated the planet, and expanded into the reaches of space once Cybertron's rich resources became depleted.\n\nCaught in Earth's gravitational field, two spaceships carrying a team of each faction respectively crash onto this new planet. The Cybertronians within lay dormant for four million years. They awaken when the Autobots' ship is reactivated by an eruption from the active volcano into which their craft had embedded itself. The robots are repaired in the form of modern machinery; all the Decepticons become fighter planes, whereas the Autobots are reformatted into cars and trucks. Their conflict has escalated on the Earth ever since.\n\nThe Decepticons have recently formulated a new plan to pilfer Earth's resources and destroy the Autobots. But the Autobots have intercepted a map and information, aiding them in organizing their troops onto the battlefield. You must deploy a small team of Autobots and stop the Decepticon threat.\n\nThe Decepticons begin with attacking an oil platform. Once thwarted at this location, they will attack the nuclear plant until they succeed in stealing a cooling rod from this location. This rod will then be brought to Dinosaur Park in order to activate a mechanical dinosaur. The Decepticons then lead this robot to the shuttle base to destroy the space shuttle, while simultaneously attacking the JTEK Industries. facilities to steal a laser device. Once both these objectives are met by the Decepticons, they proceed to steal comet dust from the shuttle base. The dust and the laser are then brought to the Andreas Zoo, and used in conjunction in order to enlarge a hippopotamus to a colossal scale, which is then dispatched to the pipeline junction so that the Decepticons may acquire oil from this location.\n\nOnce these events come to an end, if you have helped the Autobots acquire an energy surplus that exceeds the Decepticon legions', you are presented with a Robotic Achievement award, in the form of a medal.", "summary": "The Transformers: Battle to Save the Earth is a computer game for the Commodore 64 designed by David Crane with music by Russell Lieblich, released in 1986 by Activision. In the game, the Autobot team must defend a number of sites from Decepticon attack. These sites are presented on an overworld map, and the player can dispatch Autobots to these sites via connecting roads. In an attack, gameplay consists of a first-person fixed-perspective shooting game, where the player must prevent an endless army of multi-colored Seekers from stealing various materials.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/transformers-the-battle-to-save-the-earth", "videos": [{"id": 142773, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "WeH5CdAC6Vg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeH5CdAC6Vg", "title": "Commodore 64 Longplay [120] The Transformers: Battle to Save the Earth [Disk] (US)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WeH5CdAC6Vg/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3197, "name": "Transformers"}]}
