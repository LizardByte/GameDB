Released by Erik Alm in June of 2005. It was re-released July 10th 2009 with the three missing levels. It has been regarded by many as a spiritual successor to Scythe rather than a direct sequel. While the original featured small, action-packed levels, Scythe 2 is filled with large, complex and detailed maps, and is sometimes compared to the style of Alien Vendetta.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scythe-ii"}
