It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys-4--1"}
