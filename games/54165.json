If that weren\u2019t enough, demons walk right by you, and scary symbols keep appearing in the morgue following enigmatic murders. Are you ready to confront the overwhelming evil to save your old town \u2026 and maybe the whole world?\n\nSeven years have passed since your parents Audrey and Patrick went missing and you left Hazewich. When your granddad asks you to come back urgently, it\u2019s clear that strange things are happening again. No one meets you at the station upon arrival, the town and its people are gloomily silent, electricity goes out for no reason and windows are framed with strange datura plants. Worse, there is no return date on your ticket! Are you doomed to stay here forever? Is this world even real? And could this all be related to the mysterious Mirror of Avatifa that broke many years ago?\n\nMeet lovely Amanda living next door and fight the devilry together. Wander the desolate streets and rid Hazewich of the spooky forces that are trying to destroy your world!", "summary": "A hidden object game where the player tries to find Audrey's husband.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/letters-from-nowhere", "videos": [{"id": 55821, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jetyK3M7Pf8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jetyK3M7Pf8", "title": "Letters From Nowhere\u00ae, June 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jetyK3M7Pf8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
