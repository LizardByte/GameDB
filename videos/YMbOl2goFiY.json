Can you guess what this game is about? If you said it's a Soft Circle French-Bread game made prior to the company becoming SCFB (back when the company was called Watanabe Seisakujo) that revolves around Key's popular anime and visual novel (among other things), \"Air\", and is literally a clone of Sega's Flicky, then you must be a psychic or something. I never would've guessed that someone would revamp the old Flicky formula, much less revamp it with \"Air\" characters, but here it is... and it's a cool game. You can basically tell it's Flicky mixed with Air just by the title.\n\nOf course, if you're thinking it's as simple as Flicky, then you are mistaken. This game has nice, clean, simple visuals with decent character animations, cool music from the \"Air\" series (though remixed and the like), power-ups that never existed in the old bird and cat game, and bosses, not to mention a few other playable characters and modes. This kinda makes the game easier than Flicky as a result, but that's okay. I can say with a good deal of confidence that many people have not gotten towards the \"end\" of Flicky, so an adjustment in the difficulty department doesn't hurt this game. If this game doesn't prove tough enough, you can adjust the default difficulty anyway.\n\nContrary to what this game might lead you to believe, Air is not a particularly cheerful or silly visual novel or concept. It actually holds a lot of dark, mature subjects and sad occurrences that are occassionally overshadowed by humourous bits. This game takes some of the brighter and milder aspects of Air and exaggerates them further. For instance, Misuzu's foster mother and aunt, Haruko Kamio, is known for enjoying her motorcycle and drinking.  In this game, you fight her as a boss as she recklessly rides her motorcycle like she did in the anime or visual novel.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YMbOl2goFiY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YMbOl2goFiY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YMbOl2goFiY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YMbOl2goFiY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YMbOl2goFiY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "AirFli [\u3048\u3042\u3075\u308a] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Original Air Date: November 11, 2009\n\nHere's our surprise video for the day.
