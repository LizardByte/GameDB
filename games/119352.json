The goal of the game is to bring the chosen team from the fourth into the first German soccer league; the game is won when a certain goal (chosen before the game starts) is reached. Besides the German league of the season 1991/1992 (with 18 instead of the real 20 teams) there are also a few fictional scenarios available, e.g. one in which first and return match are directly behind each other or a world league with national teams. \n \nDuring the game, the player has the usual options to choose from, e.g. lineup, tactics, training camps, transfer market, expanding the stadium or merchandising. The strength of an athlete is calculated from the factors position (how well he can play on the position he has to play), shape (if and how well he played in the past) and energy (physical shape). After each season the manager has to have a certain amount of money on the club's account (how much depends on the chosen difficulty level) in order to avoid being fired. The game also rates the manager's performance which is mostly interesting when multiple players are participating. Controls are completely menu based.", "videos": [{"id": 27956, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "012L4oAtN38", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=012L4oAtN38", "title": "Starbyte Super Soccer (Amiga) (Gameplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/012L4oAtN38/sddefault.jpg"}]}
