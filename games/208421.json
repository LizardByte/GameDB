You will venture into a world much like ours before you are \"taken\" to another world, a fantasy world. Which isn't much like your last. You will face Orks, Trolls, Demons, and worst of all, Humans. We hope you take it more seriously than your last in this new fantasy world. You may be summoned by the King of Cainfelte Islet, but the King starts you out with nothing, and you have to build your way to defeating the Demon King.\n\nIn single-player, everything you do in your world will determine your skills in the fantasy one; learn all you can because you'll be able to take what you know to the other world. They may have magic and demons running around, but they are stuck in the Modern & Contemporary Age.\nYou start off in a small town late for a job convention. After choosing a job, you will learn & train as much as you can, for it will determine your skills in the new fantasy world. You may have died or been transported to another world, but you keep all your past life memories. It will be necessary for your survival to craft advanced weapons, tools, buildings, etc.", "summary": "You will venture into a world much like ours before you are \"taken\" to another world, a fantasy world.
