When you touch them, they start following you around. These creatures are often hidden on the map, and it requires you to explore each map to find them all. Once you have one (or more) you can drop them off at specialized safe zones. If you die, any happylanders following you will be returned to their original location. In order to finish a level you must drop off a certain amount of happylanders.\n\nWhen you have done so a message will tell you that the level exit is open\nAlong the way you meet people that you can talk to in order to get hints as to where to go next in order to proceed through the level. You can also pick up fruits that you find to gain more points, and hearts that function as a health bar. Each enemy you hit will take one heart away, if you hit an enemy when you have no hearts left you will die.\n\nYou are out to rescue the happylanders, small animal like creatures. Rescuing these will rid the world of evilness.\n\nAs a nice bonus,\nthe download includes a level editor you can use to create your own levels, and you can download extra ones from the game's website.\n\nThumbs up for this charming freeware underdog.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 32605, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "paDdin4lzVk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paDdin4lzVk", "title": "Happyland Adventures", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/paDdin4lzVk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
