It allows you to compose your own melodies and even has the capability to play flute and piano harmony with rhythm sections of snare and cymbals. \nYou can create your own electronic musical masterpiece and amaze your friends that this interactive cartridge in a quarter century old gaming system allowed you to compose it. \nThere is also a tutorial program for those of us who are not musically inclined. The \"Songman\" teaches you to recognize notes and identify other concepts of musical notation. It is a true interactive educational and creative experience. \nIn my opinion, the feel of this cartridge rates 9-10, controls 7-10, and overall 8-10. It is a fun software title to sink hours of creative fun into on your Vectrex.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/melody-master"}
