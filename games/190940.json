Meek and mild, she prefers to keep her head down, and fears drawing undue attention to herself. As a governess to the wealthy Mortimer family, Letitia devotes her humdrum days in London to the schooling of her pupil, Clara, to better mould her into the image of an ideal lady.\n\nLurking beneath Letitia\u2019s placid mannerisms, however, lay desires so intense they begin to unnerve her. As Clara matures, Letitia finds her feelings towards her maturing too \u2013 until, in the end, she can no longer bear it.\n\nDriven to distraction by Clara\u2019s sensuous brown eyes and her sweet, seraphic laughter, Letitia soon begins to question her sanity. Fearful that, eventually, something within her might snap, and she will do something she regrets, Letitia is bidden to leave her former place of employment, and to seek out work elsewhere.\n\nFortunately, Letitia soon discovers, in the pages of The Morning Post, a job offer which will grant her a means to escape her predicament. The Langley family are searching for a governess for their daughter, the unruly Genevieve \u2013 and, best of all, the family resides in the isolated Yorkshire moors, which seems as far away from London as it is possible to get.\n\nUpon reading this advertisement, Letitia soon decides to hand in her notice. She will travel to Yorkshire, become Genevieve\u2019s governess, and then \u2013 God willing \u2013 she will be able to forget about Clara.\n\nSuch was Letitia\u2019s plan \u2013 but this plan, alas, soon goes horribly awry. Genevieve is not quite so young as Letitia first believed, and is, instead, a grown woman: already eighteen years of age. Genevieve is wilful and impetuous, but impossibly charming, and Letitia soon falls for her.\n\nAs time passes, the two women get far closer than a governess and her pupil ought, and then\u2026", "summary": "A lesbian gothic romance tale set in Victorian England, in which an anxious governess is aggressively pursued by her unruly, tempestuous pupil.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/salomes-kiss", "videos": [{"id": 100069, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tjiLkV4U-v4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjiLkV4U-v4", "title": "Salome's Kiss trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tjiLkV4U-v4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
