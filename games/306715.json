Made entirely over the 2ish weeks of the 1st Retro Platform Jam, with our progress streamed every few days on my Twitch channel for long, messy hours. This was our first time messing with MPAGD and it certainly shows. We had a lot of fun and would love to make more, especially whenever an MSX2 engine rolls around.\n\nThis release is stripped back compared to some earlier builds as it's more optimized for playability and less glitches, though it certainly has its fair share still. In the future we'll most likely be adding music (which was planned but scrapped at the last second due to scheduling conflicts), fixing many bugs, adding a Screen 2 intro screen, re-implementing a double jump (which was swapped to a high jump last second due to glitches), finishing the ZX spectrum port, and prettying up the graphics/animation.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kiwi-khaos", "videos": [{"id": 117106, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EzRomR56JAQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzRomR56JAQ", "title": "Kiwi Khaos MSX Jam build", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EzRomR56JAQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
