The 2600 version only has three levels as opposed to six on the 7800, but those three levels are well utilized considering the limitations of the 2600.\nAs an Ornithologist, you must protect the eggs of the South American Hornbill that are nested in your tree. Various predators attempt to steal the eggs from under your nose. Using your slingshot, you must defend the eggs until the timer runs out. If a predator steals an egg you still have a chance to save it, but you risk losing other eggs from the tree while you are distracted.\nNext you must protect the Hornbills that have chosen to nest in the sewers, where the gameplay is the same as the tree level. Finally you move onto a bonus round at the Rooster Ranch, here you must shoot roosters that pop out of windows.\nThe Atari 2600 version of Crack'ed was released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, complete with a unique label, box and instructions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cracked"}
