They discovered the means to breach the walls of our verse and create a gateway to the other side, the Metaverse.\n\nOnce there, the Holy Caste began their research into the newly discovered realm. Blinded by their eagerness for knowledge, they created an abomination known only as the Metacell. This monstrosity is a single-celled organism born from both meta and prime material, and mere moments after its creation it began to evolve and adapt at astronomical rates, escaping its containment and threatening the entirety of existence.\n\nNow only one man and his crew have even the slightest chance to defeat the Metacell and save both of the verses.\n\nThe entry point into the saga this starts when the Imperium Palace gets word that the Genesis Project has gone terribly wrong and the Metacell has escaped and threatens the verses if not stopped. The protagonist High Paladin Dominic Moore and his crew are called in from their much needed vacation to put their lives on the line for what could be their last mission as they head to the H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen Abyss where Heaven\u2019s Gate lies and enter the metaverse to defeat their foe.", "summary": "Metacell: Genesis ARCADE is an arcade game inspired by old-school arcade games, with the match 3 mechanic. The basic gist of Arcade mode is a score attack mechanic where you want to survive to level 100 with the highest score. Fight back a never ending spawn of game pieces by making matches of 3 or more before the board fills up, or even worse, you are killed by one of the traps that could spawn at any moment. There are some things to make it not so hopeless; like some pickups, bombs and even extra lives.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metacell-genesis-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 53982, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "N_iOyqlaxAo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_iOyqlaxAo", "title": "Metacell: Genesis ARCADE [Early Access Trailer]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N_iOyqlaxAo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
