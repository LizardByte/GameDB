Your ancestors rode free, looking for a new home. It took three hundred years, but your clan finally settled here, in the valley where you hope to find your gods, recruit spirits, and win respect from your fellow Riders. Can you protect your people and claim your destiny when you\u2019re beset by wizards, lizards, and worse, your barbaric neighbors, the Orlanthi?", "summary": "\"Life between myths. Clans, cows, choices. \n \nThe spiritual successor to King of Dragon Pass, Six Ages combines interactive stories and turn-based strategy. Your small clan\u2019s survival depends on its relations with the warring gods and their followers. Play involves actions such as improving pastures, exploration, trading with your neighbors, and raiding. You can even travel to the Otherworld to visit your gods. You also need to deal with crises ranging from marauding dinosaurs to diplomatic requests to illicit love. Your choices have a politico-economic impact, but some consequences might not be obvious for decades. \n \nIt\u2019s set in Glorantha (the world of the games RuneQuest, HeroQuest, and 13th Age), where the laws of physics are subordinate to the whims of the gods and spirits. \n \nSix Ages is immensely replayable, thanks to over 400 interactive scenes with multiple outcomes. Short episodes and automatic saving mean you can play even when you only have a minute or two. The built-in saga writes down the story for you. And advisors with distinctive personalities help you track your cows.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 20434, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oXl7zCaRI9M"}]}
