It was released in 1983. Donkey Kong Jr. has to touch a key, then it moves up to the top screen. Donkey Kong Jr. has to climb to the top screen while avoiding things such as electrical wires. When he gets to the top screen, Donkey Kong Jr. will have to touch the key again, and it will move to the keyhole of one of the chains. Donkey Kong Jr has to climb up the rope below the keyhole, while avoiding birds. When he gets to the top of the rope, one of the chains will unlock. He has to do this 4 times until he saves Donkey Kong. After that, the game will start over, at a somewhat faster pace.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/donkey-kong-ii", "videos": [{"id": 35220, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rEno8A2WM_w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEno8A2WM_w", "title": "DONKEY KONG II (Nintendo - Game & Watch - 1983)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rEno8A2WM_w/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 71200, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FDbu20ai5QE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDbu20ai5QE", "title": "Game & Watch - Donkey Kong II (c)1983 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDbu20ai5QE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
