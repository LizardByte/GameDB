The author was not shy about his program's prowess. Built into the program is a pull-down menu, giving it's performance against Chessmaster 2000, Chessmaster 2100 and Colossus X, in 10 games apiece.\n\nThe game was designed to improve as it played, so over time a game that played against good players would be much better than when it first began.
