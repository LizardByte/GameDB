I was very addictive to Flappy Bird and soon I became a pro in that game(High Score - 315). I thought this Android 5.0 Easter Egg would be easy too but it wasn't the case.\n\nAnyways, after lots of tries, I scored 35 and posted the screenshot of my score on G+ where one of the guys believed I had photoshopped my score. I promiced him to upload a video of gameplay and just after 2-3 tries, I broke my own score of 35 while recording! Was expecting 50 but I am satisfied with this score. \n\nI hope you guys like the video.\nQuick Tip: The jumping of Android Robo depends upon for how much time you keep on touching the screen. Make sure that you touch the screen very lightly. Be cautious here as sometimes you may miss the touch totally while trying to touch lightly just like I did.\n\nEnjoy Guys", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cgMrIA24_9M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cgMrIA24_9M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cgMrIA24_9M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cgMrIA24_9M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cgMrIA24_9M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Android 5.0 Lollipop Easter Egg High Score", "description": "Hello Guys,\nThis is Mak from India.\n\nI just updated my Nexus 5 to Android Lollipop and as you all already know, Easter Egg of Lollipop is a game based on Flappy Bird.
