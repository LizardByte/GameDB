Show off your superior skill by battling your friends via Wi-Fi.\n\nThis PSP exclusive port features the additional characters from the GBA version as well as Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution. This version is a near-faithful port of the arcade version with minimal (almost non-existent) loading times and all frames and sprites intact. All of the added characters now feature their own in-game storylines and endings. The Dramatic Battle mode in this version is the only one where both the player and partner characters can be selected individually (allowing for any character pairing). It also includes the Reverse Dramatic Battle mode from the Saturn version, an exclusive tag mode called \"Variable Battle\", which is similar to the Dramatic Battle mode but in which the player can tag in and out their partner, and a mode called \"100 Kumite\" (a 100-fight series).", "videos": [{"id": 66189, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "roReTYQ0OuE"}]}
