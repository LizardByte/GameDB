It is the successor to Victory Goal and was later followed by three more titles: Sega Worldwide Soccer '98 still on the 32-bit console and two editions of Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000, the second being Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 Euro Edition for the Dreamcast.\n\nSega Worldwide Soccer 97, produced by Sega themselves was one of the killer apps in the peak of popularity for the console. It was preceded by Victory Goal, an already ageing football game (one of the debut titles of the console). The game featured international teams and league, play-off and tournament modes. Although it used fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of names. The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised, and was the top-rated football game until ISS 64 was released one year later. Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 was later ported to the PC, under the title of Sega Worldwide Soccer PC.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-worldwide-soccer-97", "collections": [{"id": 4910, "name": "Sega Worldwide Soccer"}]}
