All of this combines to make the game feel like a live broadcast.\n\nIf realism is not what you are looking for, or if the refs keep rewarding your play with red cards, then switch from the Simulation mode to Arcade mode. With fewer rules and faster play, Arcade mode creates a wide-open game with lots of scoring.
