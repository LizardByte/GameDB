Thus begins We Love Katamari, where the King of All Cosmos seeks to help fulfill the wishes of his fans\u2014with the help from his son and his son's cousins, who again travel Earth, rolling things up into a Katamari.\n\nThe King of All Cosmos\u2019s origin:\nThe King of All Cosmos's history is told in We Love Katamari\u2019s cut scenes, interspersed between the game\u2019s stages.\nThe King of All Cosmos was not always the King. His father was the previous King of All Cosmos (also called Emperor of the Cosmos, or Papa). The future King of All Cosmos grew up either on Earth itself or a planet very much like it, in a giant castle on a hill surrounded by green fields.
