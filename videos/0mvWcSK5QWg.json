They lit up the entire forest, and enchanted all the other animals. \n\nUnfortunately, at some point recently, humans began to expand their city closer to this forest. As a result, the light of the fireflies was completely overshadowed by the brightness of the artificial lights. And then the firefly population began to decline rapidly.\n\nTo the village's relief, the four firefly gods, the Beluflins, watched intently. So they decide to combine their powers to interfere in the situation.\n\nThe Beluflins' plan is to turn off all the unnecessary night lights in this city, so that the fireflies can reproduce again.\n\nBELUFLIN is a game inspired by a NES classic, Binary Land. Here you control 4 fireflies at the same time as they change color to activate four switches in 10 minutes. There are 6 worlds with 5 stages each. You will have to create new colors by combining the colors previously existing in the scene to make each firefly correspond to the color of a lever.\n\nI created Beluflin in just one month and made all the codes, art, interface, sounds, levels and concept. The softwares I used are: Unity 3D, Microsoft Visual Studio, Autodesk Maya, Image-Line FL Studio, Adobe Flash and Adobe Photoshop.\n\n=====\n\n#indiegames #jogoindie #itchio", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0mvWcSK5QWg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0mvWcSK5QWg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0mvWcSK5QWg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0mvWcSK5QWg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0mvWcSK5QWg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Beluflin | Game Trailer [ CO-OP-BR ] #indiegame", "description": "Link do jogo: https://giarosart.itch.io/beluflin\n\n=====\n\nIn the small forest of Flin Woods there was a huge village of fireflies.
