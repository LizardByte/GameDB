Billions of lives and uncounted resources have been saved by this alternative to wasteful warfare.\nYou can now resolve your own interstellar conflict in the Mechorg's arenas.\nBattles take place in one of the 30+ arena layouts prepared by the Mechorgs or in your own custom arenas. Three battle modes are available depending on how advanced your civilisation is: Assimilation, Elimination and Strata:Gem. Each battle mode presents a different set of rules, drone units and strategies.\nYou can battle any of six alien species or bring your own opponent. NebulArena battles can be fought using a single shared device or between devices on the local network. Battles can be televised on your AppleTV so all can see your NebulArena prowess (or demise).\nThe Mechorg Arena Master, has prepared more than 50 challenges to test the skills of newcomers and veterans alike. Completing these challenges as well as other specific accomplishments will earn you achievement points so you can compare your proficiency with friends.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nebularena"}
