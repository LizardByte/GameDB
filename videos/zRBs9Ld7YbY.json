I decided to play this game off the hard drive instead of the disk to eliminate any loading (I don't know if you ever noticed, but when playing off the CD drive, once a scene gets loaded the data gets stored into the RAM, loading it faster every time after). This sped it up quite a bit, and it makes me wish I thought about it earlier. Since this game allows you to set the paths yourself in-game, I didn't have to mess with debug mode thankfully. Although, I did have to get I path I really despise: the B.C.S. 4000 path. When sorting, it goes incredibly slow and the only switch you have to tinker with is the last one if you set it up right. I missed one bean just to show what happens, but there was one part where I got so bored I zoned out and missed two beans. It says quite a bit if I zone out during a minigame.\nThis seems to be everyone's favorite Pajama Sam game. For me, it's my second, behind Pajama Sam 2 (my all-time favorite HE game, mind you). Don't get me wrong, this game was great, but I personally didn't enjoy it nearly as much as PJS2. It's still a close rival. I loved the colorful scenery (a breath of fresh air after Freddi Fish 4), the amazing George \"The Fat Man\" Sanger composed soundtrack (one of the few to rival Jeremy Soule's work!), and memorable characters. It was also quite funny and reasonably challenging. There are several things that put it behind the second game though, mainly that I liked the puzzles, the minigames, the setting, and the characters better.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zRBs9Ld7YbY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zRBs9Ld7YbY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zRBs9Ld7YbY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zRBs9Ld7YbY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Pajama Sam 3: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet Walkthrough", "description": "Buy this game on Steam! http://store.steampowered.com/app/292800/\nAll illegal download requests and/or links will be removed on the spot, no questions asked.\nI AM NOT UPLOADING ANY MORE WALKTHROUGHS TO THIS ACCOUNT.
