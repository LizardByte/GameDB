The story begins with Myra being visited in a dream by a mysterious woman calling herself Selphia, only to meet her in real life the next day. On the advice of Selphia, Myra heads to Eltois, the Wind Forest, hoping to catch up with a man who may know about her past. Shortly after arriving at the Wind Forest, Myra joins up with Lenardo, an old scientist who's hunting for the Reincarnation, a legendary flower whose scent is said to have the power to bring the dead back to life...\n\nEnergy Breaker utilizes a Tactics Ogre-style battle system, but it also allows the player to freely explore the world. It also includes character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow of Trigun fame.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/energy-breaker"}
