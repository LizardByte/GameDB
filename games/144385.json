There are four playing modes: racing against opponents, racing against the clock, police chases and a campaign which has nothing to do with the movie. The difference to the regular races is that the player sometimes has to ram stolen car dealers off the road.The connection to the movie are film sequences, biographies of the actors, the original soundtrack and similar cars.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/autobahn-raser-das-spiel-zum-film", "collections": [{"id": 8098, "name": "Autobahn Raser"}]}
