Through the use of an arsenal of advanced weapons and high-tech gadgets, Cole\u2019s mission is to infiltrate the suspicious military laboratories controlled by DNA scientist Jacek Parecki and uncover what\u2019s hidden beneath. Soldier Elite is a high-quality and competitively priced modern 3rd person tactical shooter for the PC that combines stealth aspects with action sequences that can be enjoyed by the casual gamer.", "summary": "Metropolis Software's Soldier Elite is like a low-budget, direct-to-video version of Metal Gear Solid. It doesn't have the big names, the peerless production values, or the engaging, intricate plot line. Instead, this Polish-developed third-person stealth action game is saddled with frustrating, half-realized sneaking mechanics, English-as-a-second-language voice acting, and very little inspiration or originality. In short, this is a bad facsimile of a much better game and has a hard time justifying its existence.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soldier-elite-aurora-watching", "videos": [{"id": 11134, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "WIFbbPrGP7o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIFbbPrGP7o", "title": "Soldier Elite footage", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIFbbPrGP7o/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
