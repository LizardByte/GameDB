The goal is to align each new section perfectly on top of the previous one. If the placement isn't accurate, the misaligned part gets cut off, making subsequent placements more challenging. The game ends when a section completely misses the tower. How high can you build before it all comes crashing down?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tower-hover"}
