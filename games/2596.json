Its gameplay is very similar to that of its predecessor, The Settlers, albeit with a Roman theme and improved graphics. It is the second game in The Settlers series. \n \nMany fans of the franchise consider this the best game of the series, primarily because future instalments changed the transport management aspect considerably. This popularity encouraged Blue Byte to publish a remake of the game, The Settlers II (10th Anniversary) for Windows and release a port of the original game on Nintendo DS.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-settlers-ii-veni-vidi-vici", "videos": [{"id": 5712, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2vSjHp8ERkc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vSjHp8ERkc", "title": "The Settlers II - Veni, Vidi, Vici - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vSjHp8ERkc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35569, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Qua2kb5GgQI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qua2kb5GgQI", "title": "The Settlers 2 gameplay (PC Game, 1996)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qua2kb5GgQI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
