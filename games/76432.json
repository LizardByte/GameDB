Explore roads leading through the Apennines, where tunnels and bridges alternate with scenic vistas and curvy segments, opening the view to distant horizons. Descend from the height of mountain passes to the shores of the seas, travel from manicured farmland to wilder and more arid places.\n\nThe geography and shape of Italy have led to a comparatively high concentration of cities in the Italia map expansion. Local industries contain, among others, famous places like Carrara marble quarries and Europe\u2018s largest Steelworks in Taranto.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 16961, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OtYNJ077oWA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtYNJ077oWA", "title": "Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Italia DLC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OtYNJ077oWA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
