In this reimagining of 1980s Sweden, hostile machines have invaded the serene countryside, and you need to fight back while unravelling the mystery of what is really going on. By utilizing battle tested guerrilla tactics, you\u2019ll be able to lure, cripple, or destroy enemies in intense, creative sandbox skirmishes.\n\nGo it alone, or team-up with up to three of your friends in seamless co-op multiplayer. Collaborate and combine your unique skills to take down enemies, support downed friends by reviving them, and share the loot after an enemy is defeated.\n\nAll enemies are persistently simulated in the world and roam the landscape with intent and purpose. When you manage to destroy a specific enemy component, be it armour, weapons or sensory equipment, the damage is permanent. Enemies will bear those scars until you face them again, whether that is minutes, hours or weeks later.\n\nExplore a vast open world, rendered with the award-winning Apex engine, featuring a full day/night cycle with unpredictable weather, complex AI behaviour, simulated ballistics, highly realistic acoustics and a dynamic 1980\u2019s soundtrack. In Generation Zero, living is winning.\n\nFor more updates, follow us on the social medias!\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/THQNordic\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/thqnordic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/THQNordic\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/thqnordic", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mspbpX8NNew/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mspbpX8NNew/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mspbpX8NNew/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mspbpX8NNew/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mspbpX8NNew/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Generation Zero - Release Trailer", "description": "GENERATION ZERO\u00ae is now available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation\u00ae4!\n\nOrder here: https://order.generationzero.com/\nWebsite: https://generationzero.com/\n\nGet it at Walmart: http://n.thq.com/IcUO30onUsu\nGet it at Gamestop: http://n.thq.com/pSoJ30osj6P\n\nAbout Generation Zero\n\nExperience an explosive game of cat and mouse set in a vast open world.
