According to the reports, the game is in development at Brass Lion Entertainment, a new studio formed in 2019 by Manveer Heir.\n\nThe gameplay evolves around fast-paced melee combat in third-person, with a strong focus on having both music and combat intertwined. Players can choose from four different weapons that all have different and unique playstyles (single swords, dual swords, etc.). It\u2019s understood that the game features a massive catalog of the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s music, most of which has been re-imagined by producer and DJ Just Blaze for the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-shaolin"}
