The story line runs up in the nearest future in the world of unsteadiness, chaos, espionage, terrorism, desperate fight for world supremacy and possession of sophisticated biological weapon.\n\nUsage of realistic physical effects in the underwater environment enforces players to feel all the deepness of fear and unpredictability of combats in Deep Black.\nPlayers will take to the murky depths armed with a wrath of underwater equipment from specialized underwater suit with jet pack and integrated harpoon and other high tech equipment in pursuit of enemies. With the majority of the game play taking place below the water\u2019s surface, action-adventure fans will need to master new skills to fight hostile enemies and infiltrate enemy bases.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
