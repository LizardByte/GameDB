Whilst integrating the traditional attributes of the FPS genre, Combat Arms advances it further by evolving a whole new set of striking features, allowing character customization as well as weapon modification, enabling the player to adjust their weapons with attachments such as scopes, silencers, and extended magazines.\n\nAn additional eye-catching feature is the unique backpack system, which allows players to combine a set of multiple weapons from the extensive armoury for a more sophisticated combat experience on the battlefield. Moreover, the extensive community features within the game actively support the clan system, where players can easily recruit, manage, and communicate with their other clan members.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/combat-arms", "videos": [{"id": 7987, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lTEn8qd6HT4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTEn8qd6HT4", "title": "Combat Arms: Promotional Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lTEn8qd6HT4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
