Along the way they\u2019ll find mechs, hostile scavengers, and other baddies in the deck to fight. Coordination, strategy, and using the right tools is the only way to make it to the end of the deck.", "summary": "A cooperative collectible card crawler about retaking Earth one scrapyard at a time.", "videos": [{"id": 45910, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JEBM7ErIPJs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEBM7ErIPJs", "title": "Wastenauts - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JEBM7ErIPJs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
