Starting out with a shell of a tavern in the backwaters of the kingdom, you build rooms, place items, stock the larder and hire staff to satisfy the demands of the oddball locals and misfit heroes that stumble through your door. Run your business well and you'll progress to larger taverns with more demanding patrons where you'll need to expand your offerings to include new meals, drinks, rooms and services.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tavern-keeper", "videos": [{"id": 119664, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "mJYb8j9n4dM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJYb8j9n4dM", "title": "Tavern Keeper - Cinematic Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mJYb8j9n4dM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119665, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "32vdOG-Jjeo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32vdOG-Jjeo", "title": "Tavern Keeper \ud83c\udf7b Official Gameplay Trailer [4K] | Greenheart Games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32vdOG-Jjeo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
