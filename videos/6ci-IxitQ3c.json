Note the two secret characters which are shown in the video, both unlock via gameplay time. One unlocks after ten hours of gameplay the other at twenty.\n\nThe best game in the Asuka 120% series and the last one to be developed by the original team Fill-In Cafe who would sadly go bankrupt a year later. Asuka 120% is an all women fighter, usually these type of fighters tend to be pretty bad. The Asuka 120% series ups the trend however and is a solid fighter. That gives the Capcom, Sega and SNK fighting games of the same era a run for their money. If you're a fighting fan this is one title worth investing in. As with almost all the great Saturn games it is another Japanese only title, so you'll need the right import set up to play it. \n\nAsuka 120% is a combo fighter at its core meaning it's possible to chain with easy almost every single move together including multiple super attacks. While this does mean than you can spend a lot of time being juggled in matches, the design of the game means you know what to expect. You also have a huge set of defensive moves in your arsenal from counters, evades and even parries. Something even the recent Street Fighter games don't correctly understand as they've gone too combo heavy in a style of fighter that doesn't give players the needed defensive moves or makes combos easy for amateur players to master. While many modern fighters these days suffer from one punch victory combos, Asuka 120% is so over the top the system works in this case.  \n\nOn a rather interesting note Fill-In Cafe appear to have been working on an update for Asuka 120% Burning Fest. Limited when they closed for business. As an unofficial patch was released which was developed by ex-team members to adjust the in-game balancing. While the patch doesn't work on unmodded consoles it does exist and goes by the name of Asuka 120% Limit Over it's likely this patch contains the fixes intended for the rumoured ST-V arcade version of Asuka 120% Burning Fest.
