In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and Sega's \"Super Scaler\" technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates. It also introduced a motion-controlled arcade cabinet, where the player's body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character's movements on screen, inspiring arcade games that followed and anticipating the modern motion control trend.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hang-on", "videos": [{"id": 7272, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "z2bIOJcDpYA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2bIOJcDpYA", "title": "Hang-On playthrough - Sega Master System", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z2bIOJcDpYA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
