The Kingdom of Kinmarr was filled with monsters, undead and looters. The folk leave the fields, which have not yielded a crop for a long time, and the whole royal army went to war and did not return. It seems that Fate itself wants the country to plunge into the abyss of chaos and despair. \n \nTo counter the numerous misfortunes and regain control of the country, the king calls for the help of his most faithful servants and creates 4 guilds: Feudal Pact, Arcane Commune, Pathfinders and Heirs of Kinmarr. Each guild receives full freedom of action and a clearly stipulated contract: destroy everything that harms the crown. \n \nAt the beginning of the game, 10 years have already passed, and during this time the guilds have not succeeded in their mission. The Kingdom shrank to the capital, several large cities and war-ravaged lands in their environs. There is no clear plot line in the game, but on the cards you can find brief notes on which to learn about the world and the creatures inhabiting it.", "summary": "Fated Kingdom is a digital board game for 4 people set in a dark fantasy that puts a player in the tabletop sandbox. To survive in a grim world and save the kingdom of Kinmarr, party members have to throw dices, draw cards from the decks and move the character tokens on the board.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 20218, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qCAlmMqE1gw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCAlmMqE1gw", "title": "Fated Kingdom - Early Access Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qCAlmMqE1gw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 20219, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "3zPTNtZU5e0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zPTNtZU5e0", "title": "Fated Kingdom - Early Test Demonstration", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3zPTNtZU5e0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
