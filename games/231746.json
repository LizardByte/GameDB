Yoshi and Toad are featured instead of the drivers, with Yoshi eating the Yoshi Cookies made on the left conveyor belt and Toad packaging the Yoshi Cookies made on the right conveyor belt. Boos also occasionally appear, taking up cookie dough slots on the second floor. Unlike in Classic Mode, however, Mario is allowed to fall down onto an elevator platform, but touching the very bottom or top still earns the player a miss. When Mario amasses 200, 500, and 700 points, a heart appears for him to remove a miss. Music is also featured in this version, with the tempo changing depending on the speed of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marios-cement-factory--2"}
