While those who reside in such cities are subject to their laws and views on society by major corporations, those who reside outside them in the vast wastes (referred to as The Gap), live within tribal communities that survive on trading, hunting and other skills, with such people referred to by city dwellers as Gaplanders. The game's story is set ten years after the events of Beneath a Steel Sky, and focuses on the life of Robert Foster - a Gaplander who formally resided in Union City as a child, until certain events led to him being exiled unwillingly and raised by a local tribe that found him. The plot, written by Charles Cecil, focuses on the concept of how an AI would interpret a prime directive to make people happy.", "summary": "Beyond A Steel Sky: Beyond A SteelBook Edition Includes: Base Game, Limited Edition SteelBook featuring comic artwork by Dave Gibbons, Sticker Sheet, Digital Original Soundtrack\n\nThe World: An adventure set within a dynamic world, populated by willful characters and driven by motivations that the player can subvert; In combination with a unique hacking tool, multiple solutions to puzzles emerge from the player's choices\n\nThe Story: Unravel dark conspiracies and defeat a terrifying antagonist in this dramatic, humorous, cyberpunk thriller which explores contemporary themes, such as: social control, AI, and total surveillance\n\nThe Puzzles: Intelligent puzzles are interwoven with an intriguing dramatic narrative to deliver a compelling gameplay experience.\n\nThe Look: A beautifully detailed, comic-book styled world from the mind of legendary comic artist Dave Gibbons (Watchmen)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beyond-a-steel-sky-beyond-a-steel-book-edition", "videos": [{"id": 55892, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "lR7ffBQHTGw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR7ffBQHTGw", "title": "Beyond a Steel Sky l Official Release Date Trailer NA l Microids & Revolution Software Ltd", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lR7ffBQHTGw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
