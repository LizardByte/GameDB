Summon alien gods. Feed on your disciples.\n\nCultist Simulator is a game of apocalypse and yearning from Alexis Kennedy, creator of Fallen London and Sunless Sea. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world.\n\nIn this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it.\n\nBecome a scholar of the unseen arts. Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cultist-simulator", "videos": [{"id": 20168, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "heaH_KvB4eU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heaH_KvB4eU", "title": "Cultist Simulator launch trailer: PENETRATE THE HOUSE", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/heaH_KvB4eU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
