When you select a level, you can choose between any of the Super Freaks before playing, as well as a whole host of other unlockable characters. There are over 20 characters total!\n\nEvery level can be played in one of three difficulty modes (Easy, Normal, Hard) that changes the level layouts. You can also set the minimum amount of hearts you start with (upon death or starting a level) and the maximum amount of hearts you can have (default is 10, max is 99). You can also set three modifiers: a Mirror Mode, Fast Forward (speeds everything in the level up by 1.5x with a few exceptions to make it actually possible), and a Game Over screen so you too can suffer permadeath!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-freaks-1-ultimate-edition"}
