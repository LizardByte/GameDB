Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late. Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dumbos-flying-circus"}
