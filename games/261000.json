You will need to sneak in through means other than the front door.", "summary": "A One Rabbit Open Slay is a single Boom map for Doom 2 (MAP01) using the OTEX texture pack as a base. The wad does utilize UMAPINFO, so you will need to run it in a port that supports the format. MAPINFO and a few other enhancements were made for GZDoom as well, so that can also be used. PrBoom+ UM, Woof!, DSDA Doom, and GZDoom were used for testing.\n\nThe main objective here is slightly different in that you need to deliver presents to three Christmas trees located throughout the map. Press the \"use\" key next to one of these trees to drop off the gifts. Once they have all been delivered, return to your sleigh!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-one-rabbit-open-slay"}
