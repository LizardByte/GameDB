The player controls both Harry as well as his friends Ron and Hermione, while casting spells, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. When not engaged in a specific mission, the castle of Hogwarts can be freely explored. Scattered all around Hogwarts, usually in hidden areas, are Every Flavour Beans, Pumpkin Pasties and Cauldron Cakes, which function as a sort of currency. They can be traded for Collectors Cards, passwords for portraits that lead to more secret areas, and power-ups.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban", "videos": [{"id": 54268, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GtTo3b_SAcY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtTo3b_SAcY", "title": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban PC 100% Walkthrough - Part 4: Exploring Castle Grounds", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GtTo3b_SAcY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
