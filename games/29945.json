This unknown bacteria destroyed the lives of many people who lived in various countries around the world. When the plague was first identified by doctors, researchers started working on a cure immediately. The infected people were transported into hospitals to isolate them from other people. But this was not enough to stop it. Researchers failed in finding a cure, and there was nothing anyone could do. Slowly the plague started affecting all countries worldwide, and then that's when civilisation collapsed, and that is when the plague infected your country."}
