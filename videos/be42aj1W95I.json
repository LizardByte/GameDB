Speaking of rules, the game has four in total: SpongeBob Rules (the main selling point), Monopoly Rules (the classic rules we come to expect from the board game), Squidward Rules (choose the tokens you want to move, choose to play mini-games) and Plankton Rules (where Plankton joins the board and moves one space anytime a player rolls a 1. The game ends when Plankton finishes a lap around the board and the player with the most money wins.)\n\nYou also get to unlock additional cards for the Treasure Chest (Community Chest) and Life Preserver (Chance). But if you are a true completionist, unlocking all 12 cards will grant you a code to unlock none other than Lord Royal Highness, who any SB fan will recognize him being voiced by the late David Bowie.\n\nMonopoly (C) Hasbro\nSpongeBob SquarePants, NickArcade, Monopoly: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition (C) Nickelodeon / Viacom\n\n#spongebob #spongebobsquarepants #spongebob_squarepants #nickarcade #nickelodeon #monopoly #windows #hasbro #monopolyspongebob", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be42aj1W95I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be42aj1W95I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be42aj1W95I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be42aj1W95I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/be42aj1W95I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Monopoly: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition - PC Gameplay", "description": "Developed by Sarbakan and released for the long-defunct Nick Arcade, this game saw a physical release in the USA, although it's unknown if THQ published the physical release or if someone else handled ths one.\n\nMuch like with The Game of Life, this version of Monopoly includes a ruleset that allows you to play minigames to bend the rules.
