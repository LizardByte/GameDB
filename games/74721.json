To defeat your opponents and escape from the crypt, you'll need to steal the bodies of your enemies by possessing them. You'll be able to fly in a bat's body, fight from inside a skeleton, or even use a mimic's abilities to help yourself hide.\n\nDo you have what it takes to escape from the crypt and compel the Deranged King to meet his fate?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kharons-crypt-even-death-may-die", "videos": [{"id": 62570, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XKEfW4uYaBs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKEfW4uYaBs", "title": "Kharon's Crypt NOW on Steam!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKEfW4uYaBs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
