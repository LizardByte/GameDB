During the crash-landing, the Lifehold\u2014a device containing the majority of the human colonists\u2014is separated from the White Whale, with lifepods containing colonists being scattered across Mira. The avatar is awoken from a lifepod by Elma and brought back to New Los Angeles. While suffering from amnesia, the avatar joins BLADE, working with Elma and Lin to recover more lifepods and search for the Lifehold. During their missions across Mira, BLADE encounters multiple alien races, learning that those attacking them are part of the Ganglion coalition, an alliance of races led by the Ganglion race, who are intent on destroying humanity.", "summary": "Exclusive to Europe, the Limited Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X includes:\n- The Game\n- Steelbook Case Cover\n- Artbook\n- Game Map\n- Double-sided poster", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-limited-edition", "videos": [{"id": 134794, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Hg2PTVi7fl8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg2PTVi7fl8", "title": "Wii U - Xenoblade Chronicles X E3 2014 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hg2PTVi7fl8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
