The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to \"be evil... or really evil\", where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and gameplay. While the Overlord is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real-time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games. The game uses dark humour, and is a satirical parody of the traditional fantasy setting and plot", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/overlord", "videos": [{"id": 426, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hKL3FBjgiJM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKL3FBjgiJM", "title": "Overlord Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hKL3FBjgiJM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
