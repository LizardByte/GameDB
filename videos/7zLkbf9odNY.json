You drop blocks and must match three or more horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You can't rotate blocks normally; you must find where you would want a block to fall and once it \"touches\" a block, you can press right or left to make your column \"fall over\"...it's easier to watch the video to see what I mean. If you make a three column fall over between two blocks, the middle block will break away and fall down by itself. \r\n\r\nThe visuals are nothing to write home about, but there are a couple of cool tunes made by Yuzo(u) Koshiro (possibly most noted for his compositions for the Streets of Rage series).
