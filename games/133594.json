The player character moves around the screen on their own, following the player's cursor. Each area features a different player character, giving the player the chance to control the whole cast. Players can click on various items around the screen to interact with them. Aside from the McDonald's hub restaurant, players can travel to four different areas, each of which has its own minigame and a piece of the spaceship to find. After collecting all the pieces of the ship, players can then travel to McMars.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mission-to-mcdonaldland"}
