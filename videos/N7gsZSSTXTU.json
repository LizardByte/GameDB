Unfortunately it's the only Valve game that has not been made available on STEAM.\n\nThe plot follows Major Archer, a gunman who along with some comrades gets lurred into a trap on a foreign planet where they get ambushed by bandits led by a former gunman general who wants to take revenge for having been abandoned five years ago and now is using an alien race as a biological weapon. In general the gameplay does not differ a lot from the first Half-Life besides minor additions such as a driveable tank and weapons with rather complex configuration capabilities. The game is featuring an interesting style mixing western elements with science fiction.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N7gsZSSTXTU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N7gsZSSTXTU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N7gsZSSTXTU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Gunman Chronicles (Official Trailer)", "description": "This is the official trailer of Gunman Chronicles, a first person shooter by Rewolf Software.\n\nOriginally developed as a mod for Quake and later Half-Life the project was finally turned into a stand alone game with support from Valve.
