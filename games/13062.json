Later it seems like you can have 5 groups of 3 characters acting as one party with a mix of classes together.\n\n\"Become the living book, Tractatus de Monstrum, and command a brigade of puppet soldiers as you navigate the twisting passageways of the Labyrinth of Refrain.\n\nWhen at your base, prepare for your journey by upgrading your brigade! Create new puppet soldiers, assign them different squads and formations, synthesize better equipment, take requests from townsfolk, and get assistance from Dronya in the form of Witch Petitions.\n\nOnce you've entered the labyrinth, be sure to search every nook and cranny as you jump over barricades, solve puzzles, and smash your way through walls to delve further and further downward in search of treasure and rare artifacts. But be careful, the more riches you obtain, the more vicious the dungeon becomes. Can you survive long enough to bring your haul back?\n\nFight past terrifying monsters by giving orders to your puppet brigade. Change their formation, use special skills, or call for an all-out attack! The battles you face will be challenging, so your success depends on your preparation and your strategy.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 11627, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "xig6sWl16LA"}, {"id": 11628, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eiYkJzw51Cg"}, {"id": 11629, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Ewj9NsiVdTA"}, {"id": 18134, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dkgH0MT8pCE"}, {"id": 20989, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "w4l698iye1o"}, {"id": 21021, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9HqH088XqTs"}, {"id": 21773, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mSCcplVVshQ"}]}
