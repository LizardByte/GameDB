In return for their faith, the Gods promised humans a world of peace and prosperity and thereby a contract between humans and the Great Gods was formed.\n\nBy the contract, the Dark Gods could not interfere with the world of humans and were forever sealed inside their world of darkness. The people worshiped the Great Gods in thanks for their prosperity, and the world entered an era of peace.\n\nHowever\u2026\n\nThe humans grew complacent and allowed their faith to fade.\n\nNow, in the far-off realm of Ishmag, King Jardin ushers in an age of peace. Unknown to him, the dark powers have already begun reaching out in secret, planting the seeds to bring about the revival of the Dark Gods into the hearts of men. Foul and hideous creatures are emerging from the deep, treacherous caves of Tsun-Kurn and rumours of a rising evil are creeping across the peaceful lands.", "summary": "From the makers of the world renowned \u201cWizardry Empire\u201d titles, Starfish SD brings you the latest entry in their popular series of dungeon crawlers.
