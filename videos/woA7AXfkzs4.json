It runs on the new exA Arcadia hardware, and I'm told it features new levels a few weapon types that aren't in this game at all. Hopefully some of my skills from this version will transfer to the arcade when I get a chance to try it.\n\nAs far as the game itself, it's a hori / side-scrolling shooter so naturally I'm a fan.  It has many nods to other games, especially Dariusburst's beam/burst mechanic.  The purple weapon in B Type (which is my preferred weapon) is clearly fashioned after R-Type Leo's green laser shot that has 90 degree tracking and can be fired behind you by pressing forward.  Type B seems better from my short time with this game so far, but maybe there's something I'm missing with one of the Type A weapons. \n\nBeing a recent release (2018), I was slightly annoyed it didn't have a few more quality of life features. Being able to practice against bosses would have saved me a bunch of frustration, but being able to stage select is definitely better than nothing.  Online leaderboards and replay saving (which is included ) is cool, but a save state option like Dariusburst:AC EX has on Darius Cozmic Revelation would have been a great addition.  \n\nAs far as my run, this is my first time clearing the game and there is definitely loads of room for me to improve.  I'd definitely be more interested in raising my score on this difficulty over trying Expert or Insane difficulty modes.  The \"Arcade\" difficulty I played on seems like it should be the default, \"Normal\" feels like the game's Novice mode.\n\nOne thing I really liked about the design of this game is how it handles losing a life.  On death, your score multiplier get halved and you revert to the first weapon from your Type.  It's not a bad weapon in the least, and you are granted a full charge of your beam meter.  Most importantly, you don't get sent back to a checkpoint.  Basically, dying really only hurts your score (and it severely hurts), but you are given the tools to come back strong and continue playing.  Since the game features a speed select button (similar to Thunder Force games), there isn't a trace of Gradius / R-Type syndrome where a life lost in the wrong spot equals a game over.\n\nFinal score = 28,814,460 which is 15th place overall on the leaderboards for Arcade difficulty with Type B:\nhttps://imgur.com/MX4Srm4\n\nVritra Complete Edition is a solid 7.5 / 10.0 from me, I would recommend checking it out if you like Darius, Gradius or R-Type games.\n\nVritra Complete Edition on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/892830/VRITRA_COMPLETE_EDITION/\n\n#shmups #longplay #Vritra", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/woA7AXfkzs4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/woA7AXfkzs4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/woA7AXfkzs4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/woA7AXfkzs4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/woA7AXfkzs4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Vritra Complete Edition (PC / Steam) Completed 1 Credit, 1CC - Arcade Difficulty - Type B", "description": "I had never heard of this game (or series) until Galloping Ghost Arcade added the arcade version \"Vritra Hexa\" to their lineup of games.
