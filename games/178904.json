A peculiar plant transforming animals, a horrifying comedy trend and a strange building trapping people. Each of the three arcs explores different terrors.\n\nAs you explore this terrifying world, you'll find out more and more about how and why Scott is trapped in it and what lead up to Scott being spirited away.\n\nThe game features a manga aesthetic with animated CGs and character art drawn by a manga artist, a focus on elaborate audio implementation, as well as an honest attempt to make the game accessible by providing visual audio cues and a dyslexic font option.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mycorrhiza", "videos": [{"id": 73314, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "efzIGmFrMS4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efzIGmFrMS4", "title": "Mycorrhiza - A Love Letter To Horror Manga [Official Trailer]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efzIGmFrMS4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
