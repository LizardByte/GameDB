Vogel, based on the Dresden Files book series. The game has slightly different starting rules depending on the number players and the difficulty mode used.\n\nEach player plays a character from the novels (one of them is always Harry), taking on a shuffled scenario deck based on one of the books in the series. Using a combination of cards, dice, and teamwork, players attack foes, investigate cases, take advantages, and overcome obstacles to make sure they have the best possible odds for a win in the final showdown at the end of the book! Like any good cooperative game, it's hard to win (no fun if there's no challenge!), but always rewarding to play, and scales smoothly from one to five players.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dresden-files-cooperative-card-game", "videos": [{"id": 97108, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "MYhuf0_OCpw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYhuf0_OCpw", "title": "Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYhuf0_OCpw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97109, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "N1vnkrVIgwo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1vnkrVIgwo", "title": "Dresden Files Cooperative on Nintendo Switch\u2122 Release Date Announced", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1vnkrVIgwo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
