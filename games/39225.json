He does this by riding his bike onto ramps, through pipes, over boats, and a variety of vehicles. In order to progress to higher levels you must collect a certain amount of gold coins. Overall, the tone of Fail Hard is light-hearted and displays cheesy jokes on loading screens. \n \nMuch of Fail Hard comes down to trial and error: you'll crash a few times just to figure out where are all the coins are located and how to reach them. This isn't particularly annoying and it's nice that Fail Hard doesn't force you to make in-app purchases to play for long periods of time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fail-hard"}
