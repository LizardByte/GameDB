After catching wind of a sinister plot to destroy Mr. Moustache's Moustache Emporium, a lone savior sets out to defend the city's largest moustache provider! \n \nBy switching between radio channels (by selecting presets or typing in new ones you find), noting the enemy's movements, and piecing together the clues, you can unravel the plans of your foes and stop them! The project is aimed at being color-blind friendly and uses shades instead of color variations to indicate need of interaction. It is also non-hearing friendly as subtitles are provided throughout. We had aimed to include accessibility for the blind but ran out of time. The game is in fact playable by such a person but may require assistance for selecting channels and inputting responses. Future planned features includes keyboard as input for the game focusing on use of the numpad rather than the qwerty section of the keyboard for ease of use and possibly custom hardware for blind user interfaces.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-big-wave"}
