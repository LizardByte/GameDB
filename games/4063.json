In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the \"Golden Fruit.\" A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-man-world-2", "videos": [{"id": 36757, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0JCB_Hmzm5U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JCB_Hmzm5U", "title": "[PS2] Pacman World 2 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0JCB_Hmzm5U/sddefault.jpg"}]}
