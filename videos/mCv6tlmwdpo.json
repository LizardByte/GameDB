{"id": "mCv6tlmwdpo", "snippet": {"title": "Memody: Sindrel Song - Trailer", "description": "Memody: Sindrel Song is an original game where you mimic musical melodies to develop connections with people, and to find your own place in the world as well.\n\nGameplay involves carefully listening to melodies, and accurately playing them back using a piano-like layout of six tone keys. Unlike rhythm games, it uses memory rather than just reactions.\n\nThe story follows a 'sindrel' called Memody who awakens into life fully-grown, with just six days to live, as is typical of her species. What's not typical of her species is the dark voice in her head, a 'daemon' that fills her thoughts with constant negativity. During her limited time, she meets with other sindrels, who each have personal songs describing what life means to them. By understanding these other perspectives and forming relationships, perhaps Memody can find reason and purpose in her own life despite the darkness in her head. Perhaps she'll even choose to live forever.\n\nI made this game alone while recovering from brain cancer treatment and struggling with mental illness. It's taken a while to actually *finish* the thing because of these issues, but I've got there now, finally! There's a lot more detail about that on this site I've set up for it:\n\nhttps://sindrelsong.com\n\nI've also got another website for general games development:\n\nhttps://alorafane.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mCv6tlmwdpo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mCv6tlmwdpo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mCv6tlmwdpo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mCv6tlmwdpo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mCv6tlmwdpo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Memody: Sindrel Song - Trailer", "description": "Memody: Sindrel Song is an original game where you mimic musical melodies to develop connections with people, and to find your own place in the world as well.\n\nGameplay involves carefully listening to melodies, and accurately playing them back using a piano-like layout of six tone keys.
