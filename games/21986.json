The better price you get the more xp you will receive.\n\nDealers buy depending on criteria such as dryness and potency. You can harvest a lot more wet cannabis then you can with dry cannabis, the quality will be greatly reduced despite high potency. Depending on rank, some dealers will not buy wet cannabis buds no matter what cannabis strain it is.\n\nEvery game is different, the tower block is generated at the beginning of a new game. So dealers and rooms available to buy, will be in randomly generated positions. There's 4 ranks of dealers and the higher rank's are higher up in the 10 floor tower block. Move between floors by lift.\n\nEquipment effects your plants final yield and potency so make sure you upgrade between grows. \n\n\n- Unlock and grow over 30 different strains of cannabis.\n\n- Unlock and buy containers, hydroponics, lights, reflectors and fan systems.\n\n- Grow up to 8 plants per room.\n\n- Buy over 30 rooms in each generated account.\n\n- Sell your cannabis to build up your weed growing empire!", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "videos": [{"id": 9206, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "U9RvwExMce8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9RvwExMce8", "title": "iGrow Ep. 9 \"EPIC FINALE!!
