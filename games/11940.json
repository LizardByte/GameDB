The player controls a character walking above the stage, dropping buckets of water on the model to make their pixelated body parts show through their clothes. \n \nLast Call \nThe player is a bartender, and must serve drinks. You must use a power gauge to throw drinks up the bar to customers, before they walk away. \n \nAir Hockey \nAir Hockey. With terrible physics. \n \nPick-Up Artist \nProbably the most well known of the collection, the player receives a note from a girl, who will be 'waiting at the bar.' The player then must pick a girl, pick random conversation points and try to 'pick her up'. Most of the choices are completely nonsensical, or creepy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bar-games"}
