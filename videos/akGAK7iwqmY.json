You can only imagine what may happen when these two worlds collide and the bridge between one of the world\u2019s favourite horrors and the voxelated Halliwell estate opens and the violence gets all arty.\n\n***\nONE SHELL STRAIGHT TO HELL pits a heavily armed Padre Alexander against hordes of demons and the possessed in an isometric dungeon crawling, rogue-lite shooter with a heavy helping of base defence mechanics and a surly attitude. Developed by Shotgun with Glitters, ONE SHELL STRAIGHT TO HELL is a completely new spin on the art of exorcism and demon hunting.\n***\nMore info about ONE SHELL STRAIGHT TO HELL on:\nFACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/ThePadreGameOfficial\nTWITTER - https://twitter.com/TheSinfulPadre\nDISCORD - https://discord.gg/SZTPcfj\n***\nFollow Feardemic on:\nWEBSITE - www.feardemic-games.com\nNEWSLETTER - https://www.feardemic-games.com/newsletter-signup\nSTEAM - https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/feardemic\nTWITTER - https://twitter.com/feardemic\nFACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/Feardemic/\nINSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/feardemic/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akGAK7iwqmY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akGAK7iwqmY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akGAK7iwqmY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akGAK7iwqmY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akGAK7iwqmY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "One Shell Straight to Hell X Layers of Fear - New Gameplay Trailer + Limited Free DLC Reveal", "description": "\u2757Coming to Steam in Fall 2020\u2757 Wishlist today \ud83d\udc49 https://bit.ly/discover_OSSTH \ud83d\udc48\n\n'One Shell Straight to Hell X Layers of Fear' is a crossover DLC between the famous psychological horror from Bloober Team and the top-down dungeon-crawling shooter featuring the most badass priest ever.
