The player controls a Turtwig who must smash targets using Energy Ball. Turtwig sits on a platform that is constantly moving up and down. Targets appear on a screen in various formations, and the goal is to destroy as many as possible with one attack. The player holds down the Energy Ball button, causing Turtwig to aim. Holding it down too long results in Turtwig's aim being locked in a near-straight line, so the player must release the button when the aim is satisfactory. The more targets hit, the more powerful Energy Ball becomes. After several sets of targets are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. The entire game, including different levels, lasts 99 seconds. After the time is up, Turtwig destroys the remaining targets with Solar Beam, and the final score is displayed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/turtwigs-target-smash"}
