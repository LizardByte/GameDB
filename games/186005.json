Until one fateful day, when a massive army of creatures arrived at their gates from the \u2018Great Beyond\u2019 (the undiscovered lands beyond Opulentos\u2019s borders) and launched a brutal assault on the kingdom. The army was led by Furmalum, an evil warlock who sought to plunge the Crypto World into darkness by stealing the wealth from all Kingdoms.\n\nThe Oracle, who had ruled the Kingdom of Opulentos for centuries, summoned the aid of the great sorcerer Satoshi and his fellowship of Crypto Prophets, (a powerful species able to yield the mysterious \u201cprofit magic\u201d) to defend Opulentos\u2019s borders.\n\nAfter a gruelling war that lasted over 100 crypto-years, Furmalum and his army were defeated by Satoshi and banished to the \u2018Great Beyond\u2019 from whence they came. The Kingdom of Opulentos was victorious, yet it suffered devastating losses. Like the many neighbouring kingdoms that fell before them, they too saw thousands of Crypto Prophets perish in battle. Their Kingdom was virtually destroyed, and their economy was on the brink of ruin.\n\nEra of the Crypto Prophets\nAfter the demise of Furmalum, The Oracle passed a decree to re-open the fabled innocuous Battle Arena to help reignite Opulentos\u2019 economic growth, rebuild their Kingdom and repopulate their kind.\n\nLegend has it that Crypto Prophets love nothing more than fiscal gain, whether for personal wealth or for the benefit of friends and their kingdom. Natheless, many Crypto Prophets enter the Battle Arena, but few amass the experience, reputation and influence to forge a unique prophecy and earn said place in the fellowship.\n\nCometh the hour to nurture and prosper. Convey thy prophecy and claim one\u2019s place as the greatest Prophet in the Crypto World.\n\nThus begins the Age of the Crypto Prophets.", "summary": "A MAGICAL SHOWDOWN\n\nEnter the Crypto Kingdom of Opulentos and put your crypto prophecy to the test.
