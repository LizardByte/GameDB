Why does my job make me feel incomplete? Why do I feel like I don't fit anywhere?'\n\nHer only solace is gaming and her small group of 2 online friends, Kanaria and Lonan, who she sometimes chats and plays with.\n\nOn May 31st, taking advantage of an upcoming long weekend, Kanaria suggests they should finally meet in person at the upcoming GameCon, a medium-sized local game event from Solstice City.\n\nUnfortunately, the day of the event itself, a terrible accident happens at the Eon Building, the place where it's being held. Wren panics and doesn't know what to do until... huh?\n\nWhy is it suddenly May 31st again? Did she just go back in time?!"}
