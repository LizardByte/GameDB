Released by Morinaga, it promotes their \"Hi-Chew Mini\" and \"Caramel Mini\" candies. While defunct, this game is still fully playable via the Internet Archive.\n\nThe Hi-Chew and Caramel Mini candies encouraged \"flavor mixing\" by eating two specific flavors at once, forming a \"new\" flavor when combined. The game is adapted from the arcade original, though the Power Pellets are replaced with the respective candies; the Ghosts will turn into the actual candy flavors formed by mixing.\n\nThere are both \"Normal\" and \"Special\" game modes. In a standard game, the maze would be randomly selected to be either a Hi-Chew or Caramel maze. In the special game, the two mazes appear side-by-side, both being played at once. The special game was accessed via the UPC code on an actual candy box; this can still be played today by entering a known code, 166 and 001.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/morinaga-pac-man-mini"}
