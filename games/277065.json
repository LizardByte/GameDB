What originally started as a semi in-joke between friends spiraled out into a much larger project, with a much larger author pool contributing levels (for better or worse). Making this hack semi-unique in nature is, in persuit of MAXIMUM AUTHENTICITY, all tools, sprites, blocks, and music (barring resources made specifically for the project) are from 2007-2009 too. That's right, we're talking Lunar Magic 1.63, JonWill's Blktool, MikeyK's Sprite Tool 1.22, and Romi's Addmusic 4.04. Of course, this wouldn't be playable on hardware by default. To comply with SMWC standards, only the fixed version is available below (in both Japanese and English). It contains the usual modern hack fixes (FastROM, QoL adjustments, Blktool Optimizer, ect), but that doesn't mean it's any less difficult! For SNESGT and ZSNES enthusiasts, you can also play the original unfixed (Japanese) version through this handy link right here. One may be quick to compare this to one of my previous hacking endeavors, but this is a very stylistically different hack that goes in a different direction. If you were a fan of that hack, you may not be particularly pleased that it isn't a continuation / sequel, but I did try to throw a bone in a level or two. Regardless, I still expect this hack to be very difficult. An Author List for individual levels can be found here. Be mindful of spoilers!\n\nDifficulty curve is practically nonexistent, and levels explore various design styles, so you'll never know what's next. Whilst tagged as a Kaizo hack, take solace in the knowledge that this is primarily a Standard: Very (Very) Hard hack. However, because certain levels are played in a style and way agreed upon today to be \"Kaizo\" (one hit kill, levels played in a strict way, and lots of trial and error), I felt it was a necessity to tag it as such for the unwitting moderator or player who wishes to tackle such a hack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rakugaki-mario"}
