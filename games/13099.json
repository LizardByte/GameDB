A procedurally generated RPG-roguelike journey across the multiverse!\n\nIn One Way Heroics, you take on the role of an intrepid adventurer who must travel across the land and face the Demon Lord before a mysterious darkness engulfs everything.\n\nDarkness always approaches from the left, and with each movement, attack and action you take, the darkness creeps ever closer. Forced to run right, you'll encounter any number of monsters, allies, thieves and shops on your desperate journey to stop the end of everything.\n\nThe good news is that you don't just have access to one world. You have access to all of them. Born with the mysterious power to travel to other dimensions, you can choose which dimension you wish to travel to in order to get to the Demon Lord.\n\nDimensions vary based on their name. One might be full of lush forest landscapes full of adorable animals and cunning thieves, while another might be full of corrupted hellscapes infested with demons. You might find likeminded heroes willing to journey with you, or you might meet no one and be forced to venture into the unknown alone.\n\nLike a dimension you previously visited? Simply input the name at the Dimensional selection screen before you begin your journey. Want to try your luck with a random dimension? Type any word that pops into your head, and watch as One Way Heroics builds you a world based on the name you chose.\n\nInfinite permutations. Infinite worlds. Infinite adventure.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-way-heroics", "videos": [{"id": 5605, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qqLWhB1UaBk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqLWhB1UaBk", "title": "One Way Heroics Trailer / EN and JP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqLWhB1UaBk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
