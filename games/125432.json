Korekiyo Hanai, the leader of the band, is a peculiar man, who for some reason professes the meaninglessness of music to Kei on the way to the show. While at a loss for how to interpret that, Kei sees his first live rock show with Kacho-Fugetsu, and he is instantaneously swept up in the music.", "summary": "Musicus! is a story-rich visual novel that tells a story of the struggle to fit society's mold while living for ourselves.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/musicus", "videos": [{"id": 46446, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "tQzpDz14itY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQzpDz14itY", "title": "OVERDRIVE \u6700\u7d42\u4f5c\u300cMUSICUS!\u300dCM\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQzpDz14itY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
