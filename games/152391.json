He was eventually defeated by humans and sealed underground at what is known today as Dalby Church.\n\nHundreds of years later, a war between rivals, fought over territory, raged within the human race, razing the church to the ground. The new rulers of this land knew nothing of Karr the Great and the legend of his legion of zombies. They thought that the story of the King of the Zombies was just a fanciful myth of the past. They ignored the taboos laid down by their elders and built new buildings on the land where the church was demolished. More and more buildings were built in the land, and gradually, mankind began to forget the existence of the legend.\n\nUntil 1986, a group of construction workers from a company called Forte discovered a sealed deep black sarcophagus at the deepest foundation of a new construction site. They struck off the uppermost slab studded with magic stones and opened the dark stone casket, expecting to find ancient treasure. They didn't realize they were reviving an ancient king of the dead, whose time had come, ready to rise and rule the world again...", "summary": "Swarm the City is a casual strategy game where players use zombies to attack and infect humans.\n\nIn the game, you are Karr the Great, a dark lord of zombies.
