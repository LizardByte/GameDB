It was used as a promotional game, distributed at Christmas 1993. The game was on a single floppy disk in a golden wrap featuring a Jack-in-the-box illustration on top. Later CD versions of both Alone in the Dark and Alone in the Dark 2 came packaged with Jack in the Dark.\n\nIt is Halloween, and Grace Saunders is out for tricks or treats, when she enters a small toy store and gets locked in. The Jack-in-the-Box laughs, the toys play and walk by themselves and hold a dark secret. Grace must discover what secret is that and figure out a way to leave this somewhat eccentric toy store, governed by a somewhat psychopathic Jack-in-the-Box.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jack-in-the-dark", "videos": [{"id": 101007, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xZVFF55w9ac"}]}
