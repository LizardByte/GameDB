This creates a series of challenges around this idea. Also, the player only needs to focus on jumping and reacting to its environment as he runs automatically. The game is all about overcoming one-screen puzzles with skill and ingenuity. Emma aims to be a simple and enjoyable game that works around the concept of fading away, both mechanically and thematically through delicate storytelling. Emma tackles themes like loss (focused on memory loss) and the acceptance of who you are.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 29428, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6P2YJ-sG0jU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P2YJ-sG0jU", "title": "EMMA : Lost In Memories - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6P2YJ-sG0jU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
