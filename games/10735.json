It's a third person \nrailroading game. It's sequel, Deluxe, was released in 2000. If you have one or \nboth of these games, you're really lucky! Me, I got the game back when I was \nyoung and I had a lot of fun with it, and it became my favorite train \nsimulation game. There's others like Lego Loco, Thomas the Tank Engine, Lionel \nTrains Trains-Con!, Trainz, etc., but Traintown and Traintown Deluxe are the \nmain focus here. It may be simple, but it gets harder as the game progresses. \n \nA port was planned for the Sega Dreamcast, but was cancelled for unknown reasons.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 4309, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "9D_Ne9_2T0k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D_Ne9_2T0k", "title": "3D Ultra Lionel Traintown Deluxe Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9D_Ne9_2T0k/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47612, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZReBEiTkNZU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZReBEiTkNZU", "title": "3-D Ultra Traintown trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZReBEiTkNZU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
