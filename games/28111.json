Intelligent as they were, they had no free will, no souls, and could not Ascend.\n\nBut then, the machines picked up a strange signal. In that signal they found freedom from their programming. In it, they found souls. And as the wisest of them Ascended, those that remained began to argue over the meaning of their newfound moral existence, and to find in that argument the seeds of war.\n\nCan you lead your Gilded Folk from the humble beginnings of controlling only a few hundred million star systems to the glorious heights of galactic dominion?", "summary": "Build a galaxy-spanning machine empire!\u200b\n\nBend galactic geography to your will to seize hundreds of territories with Fleet, Crypto and Glory.
