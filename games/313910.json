While cleaning zombies in different quarantine zones, he illegally turned these actions into a local TV show. He found some sponsors and teammates to support him. The show became so popular that it still breaks viewing records on VHS tapes.", "summary": "Experience a TV show featuring Max Cobra and his teammates as they clean up zombies in quarantine zones.
