{"id": "mAUJP7oCEaw", "snippet": {"title": "Puyo Pop Fever (GBA) - Longplay", "description": "A longplay of Puyo Pop Fever.\n\nPuyo Pop Fever (\u3077\u3088\u3077\u3088\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc Puyopuyo F\u012bb\u0101), is a puzzle video game developed by Sonic Team. It is the fifth main installment in the Puyo Puyo puzzle game series and the second Puyo Puyo game to be programmed by Sonic Team after Puyo Pop (which was released just after the series' original developer, Compile, went bankrupt). This was the start of the \"reboot\" series of the Puyo Pop franchise, with a new plot discussing how Accord lost the flying cane. Sega, which acquired the series' rights from Compile in 1998, published all the Japanese versions of the game. The game was scarcely released internationally, and certain versions were released by other publishers in those areas. Only the Nintendo GameCube and DS versions were released in North America. Europe received both versions plus the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable versions. The NAOMI port to Dreamcast, released only in Japan, was the last Dreamcast game developed by Sonic Team, as well as being the only console version to use sprites in place of 3D models.\n\nMs. Accord, a teacher at the Primp Magic School, has lost her Flying Cane, the equivalent of a magic wand, and claims to have a reward for the student who can find it. The player plays the role of either Amitie or Raffine, students at the school, as they venture across the Puyo Pop Fever world to find the cane, while meeting many wacky characters along the way and battling them. Raffine's course contains more difficult gameplay and alters the characters the player meets, as well as which character actually finds the wand. When playing as Raffine near to the end of the game, it is revealed that Accord never actually lost her flying cane. Raffine then plans on revealing her and Popoi's secret, but fails in her ending, as she is knocked unconscious by Ms. Accord, losing all memories of the flying cane incident. She regains consciousness near her school where Amitie and her friends congratulate her.\n\nJoin me on Discord server: https://discord.gg/SYzMkEA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mAUJP7oCEaw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mAUJP7oCEaw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mAUJP7oCEaw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mAUJP7oCEaw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mAUJP7oCEaw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Puyo Pop Fever (GBA) - Longplay", "description": "A longplay of Puyo Pop Fever.\n\nPuyo Pop Fever (\u3077\u3088\u3077\u3088\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc Puyopuyo F\u012bb\u0101), is a puzzle video game developed by Sonic Team.
