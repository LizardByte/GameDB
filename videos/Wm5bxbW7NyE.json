This game features six different lawnmower bodies for use, one of each of the six primary and secondary colors. Character customizations and upgrades for your lawnmower racer can be bought using in game credits, earned as prize money for placing first in a race.\n\nGameplay is difficult compared to other racing games of this era. Super modified category or higher lawnmowers will often drift into spins, avoided best by adopting a repeated button tapping steering method rather than holding the steering control. Maintaining momentum through turns is difficult.\n\n Providing upgrades for your mower and character customizations can also be difficult as placing first on each circuit will only result in prize money once, forcing players to choose between necessary upgrades and character customizations with limited funds.\n\nThe game's title song \"Ravenswood Getaway\" is performed by the Chicago rock/bluegrass group The Outlaw Family Band. At LRM 2007's website, a video featuring clips from the game laid over Outlaw Family Band's song \"Trailer Trash Hero\" could also have been viewed.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wm5bxbW7NyE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wm5bxbW7NyE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wm5bxbW7NyE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wm5bxbW7NyE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wm5bxbW7NyE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lawnmower Racing Mania 2007 Gameplay PC HD", "description": "Lawnmower Racing Mania 2007 is a video game developed for the Xbox and PC, based on the sport of riding lawn mower racing as sanctioned by the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association.
