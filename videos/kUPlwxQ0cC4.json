Warsow is set in a futuristic cartoonish world where rocketlauncher-wielding pigs and lasergun-carrying cyberpunks roam the streets. Speed and movement is what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge, and walljump your way through the game. Grab power-ups before your enemy does, plant a bomb before anyone sees you, and steal the enemy's flag before they know what is going on!\n\nTrailer by decap and KILLME courtesy of Torn Productions @ http://tornproductions.org/ and Cho-Media @ http://cho-media.org/ respectively.\nSoundtrack by Ulrich Gollick @ http://soundcloud.com/voxsola", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUPlwxQ0cC4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUPlwxQ0cC4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUPlwxQ0cC4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUPlwxQ0cC4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUPlwxQ0cC4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Warsow 1.0 Official Trailer", "description": "http://www.warsow.net/ Warsow is a completely free fast-paced first-person shooter (FPS) available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
