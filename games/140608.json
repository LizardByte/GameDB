They need your help. \n \nThe gumdrop machine spits out gumdrops onto the top conveyor. You must gather three at a time and place them on the pile to make three or more of the same color in a row, vertically or horizontally. Pay particular attention to the color of the candy jars on the bottom right. You must fill both jars up to complete the level. If you don't gather a gumdrop from the top conveyor before it gets to the end, it will fall to the bottom conveyor. If the bottom conveyor fills, a new row of gumdrops will be created. If the gumdrop pile gets to high, the game is over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gum-droppers"}
