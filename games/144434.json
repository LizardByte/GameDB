Players will go through a hub of randomly selected maps, blasting enemies, solving simple puzzles, and otherwise having fun. Chibi Rebellion falls somewhere between Lego Star Wars and Yoda Stories, so if you didn't like either one of those, you probably won't enjoy this. There is no gore in Chibi Rebellion, enemies typically leave behind a bouncing helmet to signify their passing.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-chibi-rebellion"}
