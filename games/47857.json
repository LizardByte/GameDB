You can set your DS down next to you and let the vocal instructions tell you exactly what to do, or just read the subtitles. If you're confused by how to do something, you can always rotate the image on the screen 360 degrees to see all angles of the pose. The vocal instructions will even tell you when to inhale or exhale or you can look at the flower symbols on the screen."}
