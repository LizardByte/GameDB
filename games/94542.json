There are jars which may contain both treasures and danger, and which block the way. You have an inventory, but it can only contain one item at any time. Take care in what you pick up and leave behind. Juggling the inventory becomes a basic skill since items will block the narrow passages of the dungeon. Basic items are keys, for opening the door to the next dungeon, as well as cheese, which is good for the adventuring mouse's stamina. The dungeon must be completed within a set time or it's game over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/advenchuta", "videos": [{"id": 108249, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "szJ3lNYlAX4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szJ3lNYlAX4", "title": "Adven-Chuta [MSX, rom, 1983 MIA]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/szJ3lNYlAX4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 108250, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cZzsUVGWK2w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZzsUVGWK2w", "title": "Adven'chuta // MSX // 2 loops (6 levels)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cZzsUVGWK2w/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
