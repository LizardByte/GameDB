What started as a fun event has grown into an annual contest for cash and glory. Only six are given a chance to prove their worth.\n\nUS Racer contains 11 tracks in different locations across the USA. Players can race in cities such as Los Angeles, New York or Washington DC or can take part in a race through the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. Next to Time Trial and Single Race, the Tournament is the main event. It has been split up in three sections: Park Trial, City Trial and US Race. After completing a section, the next one is opened up.\n\nThe tracks contain obstacles and jumps. Enemies will try to push other cars off the road, and the police also make an appearance. Scattered around the tracks are power-ups that repair the car, provide boost or cash. The money can be used to upgrade the car, repair it or buy boost prior to the race. After completing an entire tournament with a certain car, an alternate vehicle becomes available for that character.\n\nIn the Windows version two-player duels are available over LAN or TCP/IP. Players can either go head-to-head or play a game of Cop vs. Racer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/usa-racer", "collections": [{"id": 4570, "name": "Racer (Davilex)"}]}
