The best way to repeat words is to use them somehow and in our opinion, a game is a really good tool for that. Many of us learned English from video games. This small game is for those who likes the hidden object genre that offers a relaxing activity with a really useful feature: helping you to study Spanish. \n \nThe dedicated music of the game was made by Andr\u00e1s Ill\u00e9s who is a multi-instrumental musician and composer.", "videos": [{"id": 12977, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uXxVRtmNGlU"}]}
