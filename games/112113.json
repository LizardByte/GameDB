Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk.\nIn short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood.\n\nCourageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.", "summary": "Swamp Defense 2 is a classic tower defense game with unique weapons and monsters as enemies for any beginner or defensive specialists.\n\nFight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/swamp-defense-2", "videos": [{"id": 49257, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "PB89hDNdySE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB89hDNdySE", "title": "Swamp Defense 2 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PB89hDNdySE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
