The game was developed by Full Fat Games and was planned to be published by SWING Entertainment. In the game, Pinky and The Brain set up hidden speakers that induct mind control through eerie sounds to people and make them believe they are always shooting movies, so Brain can turn the Warner Bros. Water Tower into a rocket that would launch a satellite into space that plays loud barking noises to disrupt people of the planet. Yakko, Wakko and Dot, the only three immune to the eerie sounds set off to destroy the hidden speakers.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/animaniacs-hollywood-hypnotics"}
