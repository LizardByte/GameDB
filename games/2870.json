Not that there was much choice: a full-scale attack from space would ensure the death of the prisoners.\n\nThe trouble had started when a renegade High Tollah, fearing the traditional Tollah punishment for deposed leaders (being demandibled), sought sanctuary in the Stellar Union. In a snit of frustration, the remaining High Tollah ordered a clawful of the nearest men and women\u2014 who happened to be from the Orion colony of Ultima Thule\u2014 taken prisoner. Inside a secret base on a moonlet circling Rigel, on the fringe of human-occupied space, Tollah scientists used their unwilling subjects to find a means of reducing the human race to the status ot Common Tollah\u2014 which is to say, sheep. In the Tollah scheme of things, there was room in the cosmos for only one set of decision-makers: the High Tollah.", "summary": "You are Sudden Smith and are on a mission to rescue ten prisoners who are kept by the evil alien race of the Tollah in a mine in an asteroid orbiting the planet Rigel.
