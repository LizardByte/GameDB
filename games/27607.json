It is a multiplayer game with a western theme with the game modes duel, deathmatch, team deathmatch, round teamplay, and bank robbery where one team consists of outlaws trying to steal gold and another as lawmen preventing them from entering the bank. \n \nThe game comes with many maps set in deserted towns, a mine, a steamboat and an express train. The arsenal consists of single or dual pistols, shotguns, machine guns, shotguns and other items such as a scope, dynamite and boiler plates. Weapons can be found by picking them off dead players or through the in-game buy menu. Cash for the weapons is earned by killing players or by collecting it in the level where it respawns regularly. Through the same menu, ammunition can be bought. \n \nThe levels often offer a stealth approach, hiding behind crates or shooting through windows that can break. Weapons can only contain a small amount of bullets (unless an additional ammo belt is bought) and need to be reloaded regularly. Different body parts can be targeted for different damage and when hit players notice a small slowdown in movement. \n \nSingleplayer is also available with all the team modes, but with the same maps and game modes to be played against bots with customizable skill levels. It is also possible to play a game with a handicap to even the odds. All levels come with a proper soundtrack that fits the theme.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smokin-guns"}
