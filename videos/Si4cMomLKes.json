Anguna is loosely based on the original version of Anguna written for the Gameboy Advance in 2008. Development for the Atari 2600 version began in mid-2014.\n\nWhen you begin the game, you find yourself in a dungeon equipped with nothing but a sword. You must battle enemies, explore to escape your prison, and eventually find the evil Goblin King. As the game progresses, you'll find useful items (bow and arrow, lantern, winged boots, dynamite, etc.) as well as attack and defense powerups. As you defeat enemies, you will gain experience. After gaining enough experience, you level will advance, and your maximum health will increase.\n\nAs you explore the world, you will uncover many secrets. Defeating all the enemies in a room may uncover a hidden item or open hidden doors. Some walls are fake \u2013 occasionally you can walk through what appears to be a solid wall. Use your map for clues and try to explore every room! Some rooms are dark: you won't be able to see very far until you find the lantern. There are six keys scattered throughout the world. Each can be used to open doors corresponding to the color of the key.\n\nTo view your inventory, status, and world map, switch the Color/BW switch to BW. The status screen will be shown. On this screen, you can view your current health, attack and defense power, experience points, inventory, and current password.\n\nAnguna uses a password system and optionally an AtariVox/SaveKey to save your progress.\n\nLearn more about Anguna at AtariAge.com:\nhttps://atariage.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1097", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Si4cMomLKes/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Si4cMomLKes/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Si4cMomLKes/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Si4cMomLKes/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Si4cMomLKes/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Anguna - Atari 2600 Homebrew", "description": "Anguna is a new action-adventure homebrew game for the Atari 2600, available at AtariAge.com: https://atariage.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1097\n\nAnguna is a top-down Zelda-like fantasy action-adventure game for the Atari 2600, written by Nathan Tolbert.
