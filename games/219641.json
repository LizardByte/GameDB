It seems simple to take the steps, but beware appearances are deceptive. This simplistic game is designed to instill rage in the hearts of players, some things that may look like a bug are not bugs but are there to increase stress. The goal of the game is simple, the player must reach the end of the Salt Game course by passing the various obstacles and traps which at first glance seem simple but in the end not so much. Good luck players!", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/salt-game"}
