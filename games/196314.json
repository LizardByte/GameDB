In a wacky spectacle of increasing chaos, strive to keep up with the escalating comedy of errors as you operate various assembly lines in a myriad of mini-games. Entrenched in a physics-based, no consequences playground, experience three main types of mini-game stations, all with the goal to help the factory build robots on a massive scale.\n\nWorking in assembly stations, sorting stations and quality assurance protocol (QAP), where you\u2019ll control unfathomably large robots, you\u2019ll hone your skills in a factory that feels reactive and alive, allowing for a fully immersive experience. Designed with approachability in mind, ridiculous failure is inevitable as you work your way to the top in this vibrant, witty and comedic stress-inducing Fail Factory!."}
