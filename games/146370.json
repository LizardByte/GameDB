The player is allowed to select one of various national teams (plus a robot team with a space station as home turf), some of them with an unique armor design reflecting some kind of perceived national tradition (a samurai armor for Japan and a sort of sci-fi football outfit or USA, for example) and some other being just palette swaps. Each team has a distinctive special shot, which has to be loaded up with a power gauge and each team member, in addition to tackling and roughing up opponents with no penalty whatsoever, can even perform a ranged attack in order to gain ball control.\n\nAt its core, it's the typical \u201cwin or go home\u201d coin-op sports game, with increasing difficulty and opponent skill each match.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heavy-smash"}
