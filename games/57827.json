Once placed on the board, stones cannot be moved. If they are surrounded by the opponent's stones, they are captured and removed from the board. The object of the game is to surround a larger portion of the board than the opponent. When a game concludes, the controlled points are counted along with captured stones or your own stones (depending on the rule-set) and a predetermined compensation (\"komi\") to determine who has more points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simple-1500-series-vol-3-the-gomoku-narabe"}
