{"id": "epIqXMNirSk", "snippet": {"title": "Umbral, Astral Dreamers - 1 - Tutorial Puzzle", "description": "So, this game isn't something I normally put out since its more puzzle than actual rpg. But there will be a boss showcase of this fight since there is a boss later down the line. Also, original tilesets, original artwork and a game that has a consistent feel and look to it? Right. Sign me in. (Why do all the good games have Umbral named on it. First Umbral Soul and now this...)\n\nAlso, I'm making this puzzle much easier in video but honestly I did struggle first time figuring it out. I know the balls hurt unless you stop time. Which is kinda... eh... I had struggled with that aspect first time around. But otherwise, not a complete gamebreaker to me.\n\nThe friction part is where I'm starting to actually get on my feet with my hands. So, the point of that part is to make sure you generate enough friction to throw the ball to the target. And you need to do it a couple of times and within the span of 10 seconds, move the ball after you flip the switch in order to make the ball fly over.\n\nBasically, stop time, move the ball to the block side and press it about... say... 8 times? About the number of tilesets needed to get the ball to the target. Yes. You're calculating distance. We're doing math here.\n\nThen, within that time, you press the switch and move the ball up once. Then wait for the magic to happen when the timer runs out.\n\nI'll admit, it took a bit of time figuring it out. But otherwise, its not generally bad. You do need to be quick on your feet about it though.\n\nLink to game: https://kato-san.itch.io/umbral\n\nLink to my scoresheet of every IGMC game I've played so far (This will be updated till 24th of December, which is likely the amount of time I will likely care for IGMC): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16rCs6s4j6rITWB3qzukco-fgNSH2qbXMtdhzgwkIyeQ/edit?usp=sharing", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/epIqXMNirSk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/epIqXMNirSk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/epIqXMNirSk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/epIqXMNirSk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/epIqXMNirSk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Umbral, Astral Dreamers - 1 - Tutorial Puzzle", "description": "So, this game isn't something I normally put out since its more puzzle than actual rpg.
