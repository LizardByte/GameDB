It was created by speedrunner Yonatan Donner and his friend Haggay Niv. This megawad was designed with full skill level support to allow unskilled players to complete it, and yet also provide \"extreme challenge\" for the best players.[1][2] The latter is the best-known feature of Hell Revealed, with the result that it has had the most speedruns recorded of any PWAD. Thus, it is one of a few PWADs that are legal for competition in the Compet-n. A sequel, Hell Revealed II, was released in late 2003, created by a new team with Yonatan Donner's approval.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hell-revealed"}
