However, it was a mysterious bath which had been closed to men since the olden times and he was immediately turned into a teddy bear by some strange power. He still hadn\u2019t yet realized what had happened when his classmate Arisu entered the bath.\n\nHe was in a panic, thinking that he had been found out, but he looked just like a teddy bear. Arisu took interest in him and took him home with her. Thus began his life together with her, but being a teddy bear wasn\u2019t his only problem. If he got an erection from sexual excitement, he would temporarily return to his human form (and naked at that)!", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
