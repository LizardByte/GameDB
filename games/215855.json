But nobody wanted to eat her cookies, not even the raccoons in the back of the local T&T store. So she practiced for a while, and after she baked a hundred cookies, the recipe was solid enough that she convinced her family to try them. This gave her the confidence to enlist some of the older ladies in the village to help her bake cookies.\n\nMilca's business grew so large that she needed to buy most of the farmland around the village to raise wheat for flour and dairy cows for butter. Some of this land didn't yield as much as expected, but no worries: she chose that as the location for her new factory. Other land ended up rich in minerals for making fertilizer, leading her to start a mining operation on the side.\n\nAnd thus Milca's cookie empire grew.", "summary": "This project aims to port Cookie Clicker, a web game by Orteil, to the Nintendo Entertainment System.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cookie-clicker--1"}
