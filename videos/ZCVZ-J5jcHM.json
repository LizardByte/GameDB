Me neither. So as a game developer, I turned our beloved bootleg ZDog's game called Z Dog Hero into a Hotel Mario game. It's the kusoge game you've always wanted, but never thought you needed in your life. The only thing that's missing is being able to put this Hummer Team fanwork into an NES. Now that's so retro. Wait, the console was inside a dog plush. Okay, where are we getting fumos made of Z-Dog where she's essentially a console?\n\nPlay the game: https://chairgtables.itch.io/zdog-hotel\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/chairgtables\nTrailer Song: https://ko0x.bandcamp.com/track/galaxy-guppy\n\nI like dog headpats. Do you have a dog? I personally want to headpat every dog I come across on the street. I can't keep dogs though. But I really like dogs. They're super cool.
