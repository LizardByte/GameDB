To make it more stable, it has since been relocated to a US ROM with a few additional upgrades. It is now in full English, the levels are slightly altered, and it is now possible to have a black block.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arkanoid-chinese-edition"}
