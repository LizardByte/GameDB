Contact can cause the car to spin, slow down or even flip; in each case you will lose time.\n\nThere are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades. As the title implies, you now have a turbo booster installed, which speeds up the car, although over-use can cause the engine to overheat, and it is not recharged until each shop section. You have 5 continues, and failure to complete the course within the time limit costs you one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/turbo-outrun", "videos": [{"id": 114228, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "azdofC423Oo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azdofC423Oo", "title": "Arcade Longplay [250] Turbo Out Run", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/azdofC423Oo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
