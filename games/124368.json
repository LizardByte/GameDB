The first series aired in March 2004 on CBBC and was presented by Jake Humphrey. It has very occasionally featured specials with Sophie McDonnell. The toolkit allowed children to construct digital mobile creatures known as \"Zooks\", which compete in a variety of computer-generated games. The games took place on a table using augmented reality technology. Each series was composed in a tournament format which determined a series champion. The original series lasted until 2006.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bamzooki"}
