The couple had no children, until one day, they were entrusted with the care of an infant boy and girl, as prophesied in a dream. The years went by, and when the two children were 8 years old, there was a terrible occurrence in the western capital. An evil dragon suddenly appeared in the city, turning humans into oni, ogres that suck away the souls of other humans. The oni advanced as far as Nagakushi village, stealing away the souls of the elderly couple. Fortunately the two children were left unharmed, and they set out on a quest to save their adopted parents, not realizing that this adventure would reveal the secret of their true origins...", "summary": "Famicom Mini: Famicom Mukashibanashi - Shin Onigashima is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2004 by Nintendo. It is a remake of the Famicom game Shin Onigashima, and little to no alterations were made on the game to stay faithful to the original title. The game was not released in America or Europe, and thus was exclusive to Japan. It was part of the Famicom Mini Series that re-released a variety of classic Famicom games for the Game Boy Advance.\n\nThis version contains both parts of the game (Zenpen and Kouhen), so the player wouldn't need to change disks like the original Famicom Disk System release.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/famicom-mini-famicom-mukashibanashi-shin-onigashima"}
