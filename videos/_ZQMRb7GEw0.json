{"id": "_ZQMRb7GEw0", "snippet": {"title": "Luigi's Mansion Arcade - Full Game Playthrough", "description": "A longplay for Luigi's Mansion Arcade, released in 2015 by Nintendo and Capcom.\n\nThe game is based off Luigi's Mansion 2: Dark Moon, which makes sense considering that came out 2 years prior. It features the same ghosts and locations and even some ScareScraper exclusive ghosts later in the game, which I think is really cool.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. Luigi moves automatically whereas the player controls the Poltergust 5000, which can be used to obtain treasures and defeat ghosts.\n\nThe game is notably pretty difficult, giving the player only 2 hearts. This makes sense considering it's an Arcade game though.\n\nThe game even features unique boss fights, although it uses the same bosses from LM2.\n\n\nThere are 3 levels in this game:\nGloomy Manor: The starting mansion. It's the only mansion that let's you pick a path. The boss is \"The Brain\" ghost in the Piano Room.\n\nOld Clockworks: The 2nd level in the game. The bosses are \"the three sisters\", who oddly enough appear in Haunted Towers in the 3DS game.\n\nTreacherous Mansion: The final level and King Boo's home. Here you'll fight some unique ghosts...and that's basically it. No puzzles really. At the end you fight King Boo who is pretty fun tbh.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ZQMRb7GEw0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ZQMRb7GEw0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ZQMRb7GEw0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ZQMRb7GEw0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ZQMRb7GEw0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Luigi's Mansion Arcade - Full Game Playthrough", "description": "A longplay for Luigi's Mansion Arcade, released in 2015 by Nintendo and Capcom.\n\nThe game is based off Luigi's Mansion 2: Dark Moon, which makes sense considering that came out 2 years prior.
