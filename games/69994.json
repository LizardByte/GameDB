These marbles are picked up and dropped by the players into funnels leading to a series of rails, switches, traps and other devices which grow more complex as the game progresses. The aim is to ensure that each marble arrives in the bin of the same color as the marble. Players must determine how the marble will travel through the puzzle, and how its journey will change the puzzle for the next marble. When a marble runs over certain sections of the puzzle, the paths may be rerouted or cut off, either temporarily or permanently. For example, if the marble runs over a button, it might hop, skip and jump a diversion that sends the next marble down a different road.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marble-drop", "videos": [{"id": 16660, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "I-3EMl8sDdk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-3EMl8sDdk", "title": "Marble Drop Trailer 1997", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I-3EMl8sDdk/sddefault.jpg"}]}
