It was designed to teach young children the basics of the English language. It is not to be confused with Rayman Junior, which is an entirely different game. English with Rayman blends the Glade of Dreams with the real world in a way which makes little sense in the context of the series, making numerous references to real-world locations such as Ireland and Scotland. English with Rayman was adapted to teach various other languages under such names as French with Rayman.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
