They are rewarded with a score system and coins. If players fail to keep up with deliveries, the other penguins will not be happy, as will be shown by the anger metre above the delivery station. Gunpowder, cannonballs, rope and barrels are all things that can be picked up by the player. These items will be shown as icons by the delivery station for the player to know what to do next. Picking up cannonballs will slow down the penguin\u2019s movement.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pebbles-wenches"}
