But no one has ever done that so no one knows if that is real. I guess that is just a very old rumour, old enough to be forgotten by the God himself maybe. Oops, did I mention that today it's my family's turn to provide offerings? I'd better go now...", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/akemi-tan"}
