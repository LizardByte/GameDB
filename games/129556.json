You can freely travel between different locations, read theories about Submachine and observe how things work inside this network. There are locations that you might recognize from previous games, there's a lot of new yet undiscovered content, there are even locations that you think you know, but they're somehow different. Surely worth a look. The best part - it's an open project, which means I can add more locations later on and it will all work together smoothly. So, tinfoil hats on and start exploring if you dare, because there are some dark places inside.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/submachine-universe"}
