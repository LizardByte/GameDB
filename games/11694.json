A botched summoning brings the daughter of Overlord Zenon, Rozalin, and binds her to you. Her servant, Tink, was turned into a frog and wants revenge. Your brother and sister, Taro and Hanako, join you in your travels. A ninja you find in the Colosseum, Yukimaru, decides to accompany you to destroy Overlord Zenon. Finally, a Demon Lord that you mistakenly set back to level 1, Etna, demands to travel with you until she regains her levels.", "summary": "Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories is a tactical role-playing game and the sequel to Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. It was re-released for the PlayStation Portable as Disgaea 2 Portable in Japan and as Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days in North America and Europe. Fifteen years ago, a powerful Overlord by the name of Zenon appeared in Veldime and cursed its human population. Since then, all its inhabitants have become demons and are to remain that way if the curse was not broken. However, a young man named Adell was the only human unaffected by the curse. Wanting to save his family and return them back to their true form, Adell decides to seek out Overlord Zenon and defeat him. The gameplay in Disgaea 2 builds directly upon that of Disgaea: Hour of Darkness; players control a party of characters to do battle on a 3D isometric grid map.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disgaea-2-cursed-memories", "videos": [{"id": 37692, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Axtb4hBtYnc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axtb4hBtYnc", "title": "Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories [Part 1] - Summoning Ritual Gone Awry, Rozalin Appears | StoneMonkWisdom", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Axtb4hBtYnc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
