Bringing a horde of new systems, including the powerful 'Squash Ball' and 'Wall Shake'. Two players can go head-to-head. Steal your opponent's ball and carve out your name with it! New levels bring life into this famous old arcade classic.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- First person perspective.\n- 2D graphics\n- Cartoon graphics\n- SCI-FI & Futuristic themes.", "summary": "Block Buster (or Block Kuzushi or Simple 1500 Series vol.014 - The Block Kuzushi in Japan) is a good breakout game that can be played by 2 players in cooperative or VS mode.\n\nThe game offers some interesting special moves like the one in which you can hit the ball with effect pressing a buttom. There are 3 different game modes: Attack mode, Endless mode & VS mode.\n\nWith roots in the classic Breakout game from a few decades ago, Block Kuzushi continues where Arkanoid left off and updates the theme with colorful jewels to hit in addition to the standard rows of bricks.\n\nDuring the course of play, weapon upgrades may be picked up such as multiple balls, shooting power and other brick bashing powerups. Roaming objects on-screen may deflect your ball so watch out for surprise changes in trajectory when these nuisances are afoot.\n\n60 levels of cleverly designed boards (and some not so clever ones) should hold your attention for a few hours.", "videos": [{"id": 43077, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2S7k-m-Ik4U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S7k-m-Ik4U", "title": "PlayStation - Simple 1500 Series Vol 014 - The Block Kuzushi (1999)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2S7k-m-Ik4U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
