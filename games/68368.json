Run through levels, collect coins, diamonds and other power ups. Jump on top of enemies to defeat them. Dive into the water to find hidden areas! \n \nThis is a complete remake of the PC version originally released in 1996 for MS-DOS. The game is nearly identical, but some small changes have been made. This version does not use separate buttons to walk slower or faster, some levels were modified a bit to make everything work well with the constant walking speed. Also, there have been some small changes to make the game a little easier and less frustrating. And now there is also background music.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/charlie-the-duck"}
