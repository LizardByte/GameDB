Your weapons include a machine gun and an unlimited supply of torpedoes. The black AtakLaunch ships and E-Gull helicopters are the enemy and you must eliminate them. \n \nIf your plane is hit by enemy fire, your pilot will parachute to safety, but he needs your help to reach one of your Red Hawk aircraft carriers. If he lands in the ocean or on an enemy ship, he's dead. For now only one enemy helicopter will appear on screen at a time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sea-hawk"}
