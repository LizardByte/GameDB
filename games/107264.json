But first you must step up and become the leader of the castaways to prevent chaos and ensure everyone's well-being. Build a fish farm to catch eels, a quail farm to cultivate poultry and a crab farm to trap shellfish.\nBut it's not just about keeping safe, dry and well-fed. To escape the island and return home, you must decipher bizarre markings on the ground, collect ancient statues, kill a crab monster and unravel this mysterious island's dark secrets! Good luck!"}
