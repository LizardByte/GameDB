It is based on the film Cutthroat Island. When the game was first released, it featured a promotion by which players could find hidden treasure chests in the game and enter a contest to win real world prizes.\nBased on the feature film of the same title, the game casts players in the role of renegade treasure hunters. The player is able to choose between two characters: Morgan Adams, a female character who wields a rapier; or William Shaw, a buccaneer who is armed with a sword. The game features single-player and two-player action modes and features two different gameplay styles to choose from: Swordplay and Brawling. \nplayer's character must battle through 10 levels, encountering various foes such as pirates, redcoats and harbour masters. In addition to all the swordplay, level two requires players to flee from prison guards in a quarry cart, and level five puts player atop a runaway horse-drawn carriage. As the player progresses through the game several items such as knives, bombs, bottles, torches, hammers, pistols, and other weapons are collectable.\nIn 1619, a pirate cutter, the Sea Devil, captured a Spanish cargo ship called Santa Susanna. Before reaching its destination the Sea Devil was caught in a storm and wrecked on the uncharted Cutthroat Island. Only one member of the crew managed to get off of the island alive, Fingers Adams. Before dying he made a map and tore it into three pieces which he gave to his legitimate heirs.\nIn year 1688, as the pirate Morgan Adams who currently has one piece of the map, the player has begun a quest for the other pieces of the map in hopes of eventually finding the treasure. Already a wanted woman, Morgan will need to fight the law as well as those who hold the pieces of the map.\nSharpen your long swords for the ultimate high seas battle! In plundering two-player action, team up as Morgan and Shaw to uncover a treasure trove of priceless gems and gold bullion! Battle bloodthirsty pirates with knives, pistols and flaming torches!\nThat story is the most generic pirate tale in history \u2013 there are four pieces to a legendary treasure map, and you have one. You play as either the infamous female pirate Morgan Adams, or her temporary partner William Shaw, and are out to wrest the other three pieces from their owners. In the later portions of the game, you\u2019ll have assembled the map, made it to mythical Cutthroat Island, and must navigate through inhospitable jungle to claim the booty.  \nAt its core, the game is a standard brawler. Morgan and Shaw move through simple 2D levels while various pirate types saunter onto screen and throw down. You theoretically have two choices of fighting style at the Options screen \u2013 swordplay and brawler. The difference between the two can be defined simply as if you want to win fights, or not. Swordplay benefits from the greater range and damage of the sword both characters carry. If you choose \u201cbrawling\u201d instead, you still carry the sword, but your attacks are modified to bash with the hilt instead of using the blade. The idea is that you can string attacks together faster with brawling, but in practice, it just takes too much longer to defeat anyone \u2013 especially bosses.\nThe X button slices or bashes, and the Y button controls your off hand. You can cycle between a punch and a pommel smack fairly quickly in brawling mode, but as said, this isn\u2019t as effective as you might expect.
