Although they managed to subdue Elsha and defeat the angel, the situation was completely thrown into chaos.\n\nWith their victory in the first battle, the Demon Queen gave Victor orders for the next battle.\n\n\"Sophie, Ulrika, Elsha\u2014teach these three powerful girls how to properly use their strength through 'discipline,' and defeat all the angels that come our way!\"\n\nThese girls were problem children who caused all sorts of \"failures\" due to their overwhelming power.
