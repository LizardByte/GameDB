All the aspects of the Championship have been faithfully reproduced in each aspect of the game: the menu graphics and the TV cameras, the pit, the paddock show, the starting grid and the fascinating \"umbrella girls\" will contribute to make the gaming experience as involving as possible.\n\nThanks to a series of options it's possible to make the game more faithful to the real thing or easier and more accessible, based on one's preferences. After selecting the preferred riding style between Basic, Arcade, Advanced, Simulation and Extreme, it's possible to adapt the game to each own needs: braking assistance, power braking, front and rear braking at once or separate control, traction control, advanced physics, off track stability control, rider's health, bike damages, tire wear, starting help, automatic transmission, rider position control, official rules, warm up lap, false start penalty, ideal trajectory, riding help.\n\nWhen selecting the Simulation riding model there are many things that need to be taken into consideration: tires wear down, brakes can wear down, the bike can be damaged and the rider can be injured when an accident occurs. It's therefore important to find the best setup for the bike changing suspension setup, handling geometry, braking, chainring length, gear ratio and tire type.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sbk-09-superbike-world-championship--1"}
