It is the first game to feature Blupi as the main character, going back to 1988. Blupi has 26 actions related to which letter key is pressed. There are two different versions of Blupi at Home: the Smaky/DOS version, and the Windows 95 version. The game can be played in English, French, and German. Both versions of the game can now be downloaded for free from the official Blupi website.
