Hidden in a random spot. Some of the clowns are evil and they want to kill you. You don\u2019t know which. You have a pistol in your hand, use it to defend yourself. If you kill an innocent clown, you lose the game.\n\nKey\u2019s location and the innocence of clowns change each time you start a new game.\n\nThe game offers a small room and three clowns by far.
