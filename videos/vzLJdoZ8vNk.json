Power Stone was initially released on the Sega NAOMI hardware and later ported to the Dreamcast. In February 2006, Capcom ported the entire series to the PlayStation Portable with a few enhancements: most notably, the PSP version of the original Power Stone included the four new characters introduced in Power Stone 2. An anime TV series based on the game ran in 1999 from April 3 to September 25.\n\nGameplay involves selecting a character and then proceeding to battle the other characters, one at a time, in various locales. The three-dimensional fighting includes the ability to use special attacks as well as to pick up and fight with such objects as tables, chairs, rocks and bombs. During battle, \"Power Stones\", resembling gems of different colors, appear in the arena. If a character collects three Power Stones, he/she transforms into a more powerful version of himself/herself. He/she will then be able to use one of two super special attacks: generally a massive long-range power attack and a grab or close-range move. The powered-up mode only lasts until the power bar is fully drained, during which the special attack can be executed (which completely depletes the power bar) or other, lesser special moves can be executed (which only use a small portion of power). Each match continues until the life bar of one of the two characters fighting is depleted.\n\nSet in the 19th century, strong believers of legends, myths and superstition search for fame, fortune and glory. One legend above all is sought after by many, a treasure which can make any dream come true. Believers from all over the world set out to search for this treasure, and are forced to fight against one another in pursuit of the legendary Power Stone.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzLJdoZ8vNk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzLJdoZ8vNk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzLJdoZ8vNk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzLJdoZ8vNk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Power Stone Collection | Trailer | Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP)", "description": "Brought to you by: http://masternessp.com\nSee More: http://www.youtube.com/user/MNPGameVideos/videos\n\nPower Stone is a fully 3D arena fighting game series made by Capcom.
