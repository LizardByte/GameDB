The game's goal is to reinforce the mental answers by having them be drilled into the player by playing with motion controls. Games are usually short exercises that last only for a few minutes. Some of the games include a math game which requires the player to make hand motions in either a \"greater than\" or \"less than\" sign and a game which makes the user kick a ball into the goal with the right answer for a math question.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/body-and-brain-connection", "videos": [{"id": 10585, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fCUOjRYiYiQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUOjRYiYiQ", "title": "Body and Brain Connection Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fCUOjRYiYiQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
