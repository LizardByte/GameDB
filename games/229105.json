It is one of the oldest games of this family, originating in 1981 on DEC mainframes.\n\nThe story is quite conservative: As in the other Wizard's Castle games, your task is to descend into a dungeon to find the all-powerful Globe of some mighty Warlock on the deepest level.\n\nThe gameplay is a hybrid of boardgame-like exploration and roguelike dungeon crawl, the whole presented as in \"windowed\" interactive fiction game, while the setting is a mix of fantasy, horror and sci-fi elements, playing in a haunted mansion filled with dust, bones, undead skeletons, RAM chips needed for auto-mapping, Uzis and Laser guns, etc. The only graphics is the BGI title screen; the rest of the game plays in text mode and reminds late DOS applications with windows.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bones-the-game-of-the-haunted-mansion"}
