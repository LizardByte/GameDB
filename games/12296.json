As Jumpman, your goal is to disarm all of the bombs on the level before time runs out. Each level consists of a variety of platforms, ladders, and ropes you will need to jump and climb to reach the bombs. To make the game more challenging, a bullet will fire on the screen from time to time which will cause Jumpman to lose a life if hit. Each level has a different theme to it, and a few also have additional dangers as well. You will encounter deadly fires, the bouncing hellstones, moving ladders, disappearing platforms, and more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jumpman-junior", "videos": [{"id": 109770, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "vh-fT9Nn9d4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh-fT9Nn9d4", "title": "Jumpman Junior (C64 Longplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vh-fT9Nn9d4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
