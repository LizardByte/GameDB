Originally made as a homage to SilverMiner's Plutonia 3: Going to Surface, the WAD themes are inspired by Plutonia and its unofficial sequel. As with many joke WADs, Plutonia 4 includes farcical elements such as ridiculous enemy placement, intentionally unpleasant map design, and humorous custom graphics.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/plutonia-4-back-to-your-hole"}
