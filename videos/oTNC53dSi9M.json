This is quite similar to the Sherlock Holmes fmv games where you have to be in various locations at specific times to show specific videos/clues.\n\nNot a particuarly fun game, but the challenge is getting the locations in the correct order within the time limit.  You pick up  fair ammount of objects along the way, but even fewer actualy get used.\n\nThat brings me to me next point, which is the bits I didnt like.  You can easily mess up your run through the story simply by not going to a location at the right time to get an object or clue.  That is go to early, you can get a bad video (although might not seem like it) which then wont allow you to go back when you should be their.  Now the problem is the game continues as normal still letting you find more clues and its only when you cant do anything more you realise the games gone to hell.  So hopefully you remembered to save occassionaly.\n\nThe fmv is fairly good quality for a SegaCD game and the interface is always responsive and doesnt make you wait for loading.\n\nI could have cut some time in the game by going to less places and still winning.  But as its a longplay, I kept it in although Im sure there are more locations I could have shown.  Im just glad its over now as although it appears quite short in this video, I was playing it for nearly 8 hours ;) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTNC53dSi9M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTNC53dSi9M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTNC53dSi9M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oTNC53dSi9M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega-CD Longplay [069] Dracula Unleashed", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed By:- /Y\\ad/Y\\atty\n\nAnother FMV game for our favorate console.
