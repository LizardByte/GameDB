Quern refreshes the genre with flexible gameplay and reuseable puzzle mechanics. The visuals and the music combine traditional and modern elements providing a unique mood for the game.\n\nOne of the specialities of Quern is that the tasks to be solved are not managed as separate, individual and sequential units, but as a complex entity, amongst which the players may wander and experiment freely. Often a bad or seemingly irrational result may bring the player closer to the final solution, if those are reconsidered and thought over again later, in the possession of the knowledge gained during the game.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quern-undying-thoughts", "videos": [{"id": 11169, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NgzV5jrLQeI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgzV5jrLQeI", "title": "Quern - Undying Thoughts - Official Release Date Trailer 2016 | PC | MAC | LINUX", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgzV5jrLQeI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
