Long before human civilization arose, a massive fragment of a lost planet, the Island, hurtled through space. This paradise was home to the towering giant Kabuto, created by the matriarchal Sea Reapers as a defense against intruders. But Kabuto became self-aware, and his loneliness and pain drove him to rampage.\n\nMeanwhile, space travelers known as the Meccs, searching for their missing friends, find themselves stranded on the Island. Forced to navigate the ongoing conflict between the Sea Reapers and the now-berserk Kabuto, the Meccs must use a mix of combat, stealth, and cunning to survive. With its engaging storyline, diverse characters, and blend of gameplay styles, Giants: Citizen Kabuto offers a one-of-a-kind experience where three factions vie for control of a truly unique and captivating world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/giants-citizen-kabuto", "videos": [{"id": 97, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SAzraJ_Doc4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAzraJ_Doc4", "title": "Giants Citizen Kabuto Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SAzraJ_Doc4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 30123, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "tpi5P7MyTtA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpi5P7MyTtA", "title": "Giants - Citizen Kabuto (2000) PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tpi5P7MyTtA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
