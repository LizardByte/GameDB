It had to fight different kinds of enemies, but the most dangerous of all of them came to be humans themselves. So, the wars for land, well-being and power ravaged the planet for ages. Wars changed their faces and humans fought for different kinds of reasons. Recently, for a brief moment, it seemed like peace and harmony had taken over the planetary routine. Politics at this point looked to have evolved to the level where humans do not have to resort to the extremes of killing each other.\n\nBut, the economical side of homo sapiens ' existence became the kind of war that no one had foreseen. Since journalism and the media are owned by corporations, all the information about disasters and wrong-doings instigated by them all over the planet is carefully managed and provided for the masses to consume as intended.\n\nSome of the real news broke out from time to time through the effort of different groups of activists. Truth is leaked via dangerous endeavours of computer hackers. For unveiling atrocious lies that corporations are feeding the consumers, they are treated with utter disrespect, portrayed as the enemies of humankind and brought down using corrupt law enforcement institutions who allegedly have an obligation to protect the citizens, but did become a part of an enormous human control machine that no one has seen to this day.\n\nSo, the mortal story continues without interruption, and the suffering of the people is a never-ending tale of human civilization.\n\nYet fighting is not even close to the end. War needs a reason to exist, and humans are very good at providing it with justifications to continue.\n\nPlanet \u201cEarth\u201d is becoming extremely overpopulated and those finite resources our fragile universe marble has in store for us are becoming more and more scarce. This is where today's war found its reason to start and prevail indefinitely.", "summary": "Ertha is an economic, social MMORPG, designed to replicate a real-life environment, simulating the actions that people have to perform to earn a living.
