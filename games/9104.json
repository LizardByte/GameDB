Athletic World was developed by Bandai in 1986, and released for the Nintendo System using the Family Fun Fitness pad. It was marketed as a fun way to engage in exercise and physical fitness. The game was originally released in a box that featured the Family Fun Fitness logo. When Nintendo later purchased the rights to the FFF pad, the game was re-released with a different label-featuring the Athletic World name. This has made the original release a collector's item, and fairly rare.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/athletic-world", "videos": [{"id": 3577, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "BFAqNG1CMpQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFAqNG1CMpQ", "title": "Athletic World (Nintendo, 1987) - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BFAqNG1CMpQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3762, "name": "Family Trainer"}]}
