Poly Universe is a survival city-building game in a galaxy where planets are only slightly larger than the colonists who inhabit them. Think of this as kingdoms and castles in space. In this first episode we crash land on our first island and begin building a civilization on our homeland in preparation to explore the cosmos! I hope you enjoyed this episode of Poly Universe, thanks for watching and liking. \n\nPoly Universe Gameplay:\n\nPoly Universe on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/801040/Poly_Universe/\n\nAbout Poly Universe:\n\nA tiny band of settlers land on a remote planet. With you as their leader they will either build a new civilization, or be consumed by the foul creatures which inhabit the furthest reaches of space.\n\nIn Poly Universe worlds are tiny but numerous. Be strategic in laying out your cities to maximize the limited space available on each world. Balance industry and residential buildings to keep your citizens happy. But don't neglect the defenses necessary to keep them safe! Here in the outer edge of the known universe, danger can arrive at any moment, and when it does it arrives in full force.\n\nEstablishing trade routes between worlds will allow your planets to specialize and share resources, pushing the boundaries of your civilization even further outwards. But always keep an eye on the health, happiness, and education of your citizens -- with nowhere to receive reinforcements from, your citizens are ultimately your most valuable resource.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/draegast\n\nTwitter: https://goo.gl/n6j81c\n\nMy Webpage: https://www.draegast.com/\n\nIntro/Outtro Music By Oddchap: https://goo.gl/5QSsAU", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okYa3cuHpOY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okYa3cuHpOY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okYa3cuHpOY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okYa3cuHpOY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okYa3cuHpOY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Poly Universe - Galactic Colony Management Sim - ALIENS INCOMING! - Poly Universe Gameplay Part 1", "description": "Today we're having a look at Poly Universe.
