Instead of repetitive kill/take/buy gameplay of other MMOGs, the very essence of Myst Online is to explore vast, fantastic worlds; savoring and uncovering new areas and new information at every turn. Exploring in Myst Online is an extraordinary experience, where immersing yourself in the environment gives you insight into how to move forward, and what went on before. You can explore alone, or share the journey with a select group friends or family from anywhere in the world. Create an online avatar and chat via text and voice, share images and clues, and explore the Ages of Myst Online together. You\u2019ll rediscover, restore and rebuild the ancient city of D\u2019ni and learn about the history of its fallen civilization.\n\nMyst Online: Uru Live (or MO:UL for short) is the latest incarnation of Uru, a series of amazing adventures starting with Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and spanning Uru: To D\u2019ni and Uru: The Path Of The Shell. It\u2019s a continuation of the critically acclaimed games Myst and Riven; and the Myst novels. For further details on Myst and Uru, we recommend MYSTlore, a great fan-run encyclopedia of all things Myst.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/myst-online-uru-live"}
