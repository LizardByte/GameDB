Ghosts from the past that nearly once destroyed Popful Mail's world. Now, the Black Seal is about to be broken so they can return to wreak havoc on the world once again. Three ragtag adventurers become the only hope of stopping the second coming of Evil. Play as Mail, tomboy bounty-hunter wannabe who's handy with a blade, Tatt, the ultra-polite apprentice magician with a deadly staff, or Gaw, a winged blue blob with breath of fire, as you search for the manicial Muttonhead, who holds all the answers. During your quest, change characters at any time! You'll need to, because Nuts Cracker and the minions of Evil will stop at nothing to end your party before it starts! And, thanks to the storage power of CD, Popful Mail comes alive with over 2.5 hours of spoken dialogue and 20 minutes of heart-pounding animation. Face it, your butt's gonna be glued to the couch till the credits roll!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popful-mail-magical-fantasy-adventure"}
