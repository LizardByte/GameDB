In 1984 the ASCII Corporation published a version produced by Khaled Bentebal. It was the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soko-ban", "videos": [{"id": 5219, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "_iZLe05aJuU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iZLe05aJuU", "title": "Sokoban gameplay (PC Game, 1984)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_iZLe05aJuU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
