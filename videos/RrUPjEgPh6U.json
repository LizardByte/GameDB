The box screenshots looked quite nice; it certainly LOOKED a lot better than the appalling graphics of the C64 version so I thought, \"What the hell - let's try it\".\n\nWell, the game certainly didn't disappoint. Not only is it terrible, it's probably even WORSE than the C64 version. The second you hear the dreadful music that sounds like an out-of-tune musical box, you know you're in for a treat.\n\nThe sprite glitches from the C64 version are here in all their glory; shoot at an enemy on the right and an enemy on the left of the screen falls over. The goons armed with tommy guns just stand there and fire a constant stream of bullets that you can't avoid, and, my personal favourite, check out the enemies that hide behind doors in the scenery (check out 3:52).\n\nWow, what a game!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrUPjEgPh6U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrUPjEgPh6U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrUPjEgPh6U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrUPjEgPh6U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RrUPjEgPh6U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dick Tracy Longplay (Amiga) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed and published by Titus in 1990.\n\nThe 8bit C64 version of Dick Tracy is well-known as a steaming pile of excrement, but I'd never seen the 16bit Amiga version for real.
