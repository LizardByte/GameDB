Five characters from different backgrounds decide to enter the tournament for their own reasons. The winner of the tournament will not only have their legend solidified for the rest of history, but they will also get anything they desire from Hestia. The combatants are Rainey, Jeese, Robbit, Anja & Merkle, and Hekkun.", "summary": "Melpool Land is essentially an overhead fighting game between two characters in a small area. Each of the five characters is armed with two objects that they can use to hit their opponent or block attacks as if they were boxing gloves. The first player to reach three wins is the victor and it's possible to win by either emptying the opponent's life meter or by knocking them out of the stage. It is also possible to destroy the opponent's means of attack since they have their own health meters, leaving the opponent unable to do anything except try to ram their opponent off the stage. Arenas have holes and traps to look out for, such as bumpers and tiles that damage you, but there are no items or other abilities available. The story of the game is framed around a tournament hosted by a goddess that offers the winner anything they desire. Each character gets their own ending if you can complete the single player mode with them. A local multiplayer option is also available for two players.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/melpool-land", "videos": [{"id": 73237, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2A9WtFm3AnE"}]}
