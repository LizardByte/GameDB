Players take the role of Tetsu Akatsuki, a member of a special police force serving in a 12-story prison. Having found his superior hanged in his room, Tetsu decides to investigate the circumstances of his death and uncover the mysteries hidden in the prison walls.\n\nPlayers will spend a lot of time reading through text with occasional choices being given at certain points and going to various places. Apart from looking for items and using them, players will also need to solve a number of puzzles during the game. As a bonus, players can locate hidden cards which will give them more backstory about each character in the game. Also, players will have to interrogate other characters and can use items, as well as tap on another character's portrait to make people tell the truth or cooperate with them. The game features multiple endings based on the choices and actions of the player, which impact the relationships between the characters. During the interrogation, choosing the wrong options, items or characters will decrease the life bar and may lead to bad endings.", "videos": [{"id": 41491, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KTXRf81pweI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTXRf81pweI", "title": "Mystery novel and Escape Game [The Prison Boys]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KTXRf81pweI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
