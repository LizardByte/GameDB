The Evil Queen has created a poison apple and wants to give it to Snow White! We, the seven dwarfs, have to find Prince Charming so he can save her! You play as one of the seven dwarfs. First you move through your diamond mine, collecting diamonds. You can collect up to twelve diamonds but you must collect one ruby to leave the mine. In HARD setting, avoid obstacles and falling rocks. After you grab the ruby, you must cross a river on a log. In the HARD setting, beware of the bat that will try to drop rocks upon you, You can press your button to use a diamond's magic to scare away the bat for a short time. After the river, you must make your way through the forest without getting grabbed by the evil trees. In the HARD setting, you must also be careful of the bat dropping rocks. You can, again, use diamonds to drive it off. You must hit the flashing white line to exit the forest. After this, you return to the screen with all the dwarfs lined up, dancing, while the Evil Queen is driven away from Snow White.", "summary": "This is an unreleased prototype.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs"}
