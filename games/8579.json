Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (Robot Gyro in Japan). While Gyromite is a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore comes with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up comes in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. The game's retail box comes with many small, plastic parts, which may contribute to difficulty in maintaining a complete set. Stack-Up is considered by collectors to be one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stack-up", "videos": [{"id": 3367, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Z0z79jq3sZ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0z79jq3sZ0", "title": "Stack Up (Nintendo, 1985) - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0z79jq3sZ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 7405, "name": "Robot Series"}]}
