This massive update includes new systems such as Space Station crafting, establishes the narrative with an opening cinematic, and rebalances virtually all of the economy and gameplay. We\u2019re also constantly improving the combat, traversal, and vehicles, while polishing up the UI and fixing every bug we can. All this, and we haven\u2019t even mentioned the new Biomes!\n\nSpace Station Crafting\n\nFully craft your own Space Station in low orbit. All station modules can interconnect in any combination, allowing for total flexibility in design and layout.\n\nEach module has its own purpose and features, including crafting, power systems, and storage.\n\nSpace Stations are free from the erosion and dangers of the existing planetside in an atmosphere, creating an interesting strategic option to store valuable resources.\n\nNew Biomes\n\nProteus 2 takes advantage of the new technology we\u2019ve been developing that adds various zones and areas into a world. We\u2019ve doubled the amount of world textures, rendered millions of blades of grass, and populated countless new alien foliages - each yielding various resources.\n\nDiscovery System\n\nEverything you observe on your adventures can now be discovered. Far more than a simple achievement, the Discovery System actually unlocks all the various resources any found resource will yield. Essentially, each weapon or tool used on a resource may yield a different item, allowing for far more scientific exploration of the solar system and all of its life forms.\n\nSalvaging System\n\nThis powerful system allows you to find, salvage, repair and commandeer lost structures, vehicles, and droids in the world. This is a great way to acquire a high level object much earlier on, giving you a higher chance of survival and another path towards sustainability.\n\nMineral Hardness Matters\n\nA small but significant change, mineral harness is now, very much, \u201ca thing\u201d. A key part of gameplay progression, you\u2019ll need to have the right tool for the job as lesser tools simply will not mine a mineral of higher hardness.\n\nGPS Resource Filtering\n\nMinerals can now be filtered on your updated GPS. This very handy tool, which is now always available in your HUD and no longer attached to your Locator, reads from your surrounding satellites and your own internal suit radar to create detection radii.\n\nThis system will show you all the surrounding minerals, their hardness and density, so you can find what you\u2019re looking for in your crafting missions.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7efxw49suHg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7efxw49suHg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7efxw49suHg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7efxw49suHg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7efxw49suHg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Osiris: New Dawn - Discovery Update", "description": "Taking Near Future Space Survival to a Whole New Level\n\nhttps://www.osirisnewdawn.com/updates-list/discovery-update\n\nWe are proud to announce the largest update we\u2019ve done to date: the Discovery Update!
