The Mir aliens have come to Earth along with the Groog. Do they come in peace?\nMastering this game seems easy but to score a perfect game is puzzling unless you are the clever one.\nThis game carries a message of peace and the only violence in this game is bopping the aliens on the head. No one dies and no gore.\nSounds best with earbuds and is a great game for zoning out and also has a lesson for kids. Game has multiple end game messages based on your performance.
