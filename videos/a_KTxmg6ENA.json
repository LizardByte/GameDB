{"id": "a_KTxmg6ENA", "snippet": {"title": "Wolfenstein 3D Total Conversion for ZDoom (PC)", "description": "This is a complete overhaul of the original Wolfenstein 3D for PC. It appears to be a hybrid mixture of original PC graphics, some Doom graphics, and mostly Atari Jaguar version graphics. Overall it's pretty sweet since it still has the original sounds and character models that we all know and love with the environments having higher res textures and the guns not looking like blocky messes. \n\nSorry for the poor performance, but I never do as well when I record for some reason. I guess it's performance anxiety. Anyway this video was not made to show any kind of skill, but instead to let you the viewer know that this is out there and where you can get it.\n\nGo to  http://www.afadoomer.com/wolf3d/downloads.html and download the \"Consolidated Wolfenstein 3DTC\". If you don't already have ZDoom, download it here: http://zdoom.org/Download\n\nSimply place the Wolfenstein 3D TC folder in the same folder that contains ZDoom. Open the Wolfenstein 3D TC folder and run the \"Consolidated TC\" bat file and off you go. The consolidated bat is both the first and Spear of Destiny all in one game. The game is already configured for ZDoom with head bobbing and momentum turned off. In this capture I turned momentum back on because I can't stand when my guy stops on a dime when I take my finger off of the movement keys. However having momentum set to off is the authentic Wolf 3D experience so I can see why it was turned off. \n\nLastly, I could not get this game to execute when using GZDoom for some reason so I cannot help you with any errors if you're trying to use GZDoom. Truthfully there is no reason to use GZDoom since no CPU made within the last 20 years would even break a sweat running this game at very high frame rates.\n\nThanks for watching :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_KTxmg6ENA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_KTxmg6ENA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_KTxmg6ENA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_KTxmg6ENA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_KTxmg6ENA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wolfenstein 3D Total Conversion for ZDoom (PC)", "description": "This is a complete overhaul of the original Wolfenstein 3D for PC.
