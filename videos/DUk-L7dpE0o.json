{"id": "DUk-L7dpE0o", "snippet": {"title": "Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper Arcade", "description": "This version features all 6 characters from the console ports(Dee Jay, Evil Ryu, Fei Long, Guile, Shin Akuma, T. Hawk) and some balance changes, most notably removal of \"crouch canceling\" glitch which allowed V-ISM infinite combos.\n\nStreet Fighter Zero 3 discards the Manual and Auto modes from the previous Zero games by offering the player three different playing styles known as \"isms.\" The standard playing style, Z-ism is based on the previous Zero games, in which the player has a three-level Super Combo gauge with access to several Super Combo moves. X-ism is a simple style based on Super Street Fighter II Turbo, in which the player has a single-level Super Combo gauge and access to a single, but powerful, Super Combo move. \nThe third style, V-ism (or variable style), a unique style that allows the player to perform Custom Combos similar to the ones in Street Fighter Zero 2. \n\nIn X-ism, players cannot air-block nor use Zero Counters. Zero 3 also introduces a Guard Power gauge which depletes each time the player blocks - every time the gauge is completely depleted, the player suffers a \"guard crush\" (in which the gauge itself decreases in size, thus causing the player to gradually lose ability to block attacks as the guard gauge keeps decreasing) which leaves him/her temporarily vulnerable for an attack.\n\nAdditionally, each of the three fighting styles profoundly affects the speed, strength, and damage-resistance of a player in different ways: X-Ism provides the highest overall strength of the three styles, dealing the most damage per blow of any kind, but it's negated by having the slowest speed and the worst defense (i.e., takes the most damage per hit); V-Ism has the highest speed and defense, but attacks deliver the least damage; and Z-Ism ostensibly features the middle ground on all three factors (medium strength, speed, and defense). Choosing to fight in Classic Mode bases a player's fighting abilities on X-Ism, minus the Super Gauge. Certain characters also have specific unique and special attacks that are available only in specific modes, aside from having all of their Super Combos available only in A/Z-ism and so forth.\n\nThe controls for several actions have been modified from previous Zero games. For example, the level of a Super Combo move in Z-ism is now determined by the strength of the attack button pressed (i.e. Medium Punch or Kick for a Lv. 2 Super Combo), rather than the number of buttons pushed; and throwing is now done by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously.\n\nMore subtle mechanics in the gameplay have been introduced as well: Timing your blocking right will cause your character to briefly flash white and consume less Guard Power gauge. This is reminiscent of the Just Defense mechanics found in SNK's Garou: Mark of the Wolves. Additionally, some attacks, depending on certain circumstances, will possess a super armor attribute while flashing red; the character will also receive damage (sometimes not at all) but will continue their attack. Also, counterattacks are now visually prominent, causing knockdowns and/or a brief pause.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUk-L7dpE0o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUk-L7dpE0o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUk-L7dpE0o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUk-L7dpE0o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUk-L7dpE0o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper Arcade", "description": "This version features all 6 characters from the console ports(Dee Jay, Evil Ryu, Fei Long, Guile, Shin Akuma, T.
