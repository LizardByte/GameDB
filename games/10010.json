Multitudes of characters to interact with, a plethora of monsters and lots of side-quests litter the landscape of Aveyond. Even though the fighting is turn-based when actually in combat, the player has the ability to avoid prowling enemies before getting into a situation. Your character will level up and can even buy a house to live in, form parties to take on quests as a group. The game was created using RPG Maker XP. The original version of the game ships with Midi music; however, players can replace these with a downloadable high-quality live version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aveyond-1-rhens-quest"}
