Like its predecessor, it is an action adventure game but this time with an isometric perspective. In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, the ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive, Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes, fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out and house points can be deducted. Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets--2", "videos": [{"id": 54263, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "nGz2m-9_yA4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGz2m-9_yA4", "title": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets GBA 'Dungeon Sneak 2 and Greenhouse' Walkthrough (4K)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nGz2m-9_yA4/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1502, "name": "Harry Potter"}]}
