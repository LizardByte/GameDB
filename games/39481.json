The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.\n\nAlthough the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/football-champ"}
