Prior to Wizard of Wor's release I spent a lot of time (and quarters!) playing other classic arcade games such as Space Invaders and Asteroids, but Wizard of Wor took things to a different level.  It's one of the first games I remember which allowed two players to play cooperatively against the game's enemies while at the same time intending for players to attack one another. It's may very well be the first example of a hybrid of co-op and death match shooter gaming.\r\n\r\nFor more details about the game please see the following:\r\n\r\nWikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Wor\r\n\r\nKiller List of Video Games: http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10459\r\n\r\nStrategyWiki: http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Wor", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/srPdPw9VH2A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/srPdPw9VH2A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/srPdPw9VH2A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Wizard of Wor Arcade Gameplay", "description": "Released by Midway in 1980, Wizard of Wor was the first arcade game to really capture my time and attention.
