The game features single-player and multiplayer gameplay and contains an in-game level editor. The game engine is free and open-source software, under the zlib License, with commercial support available from the developer's own business counterpart, Dot3 Labs. The game media is released under various non-free licenses. The aim of the project is not to produce the most features and highest-quality graphics possible, but rather to allow map-editing to be done in real-time within the game, while keeping the engine source code small and elegant.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cube-2-sauerbraten", "videos": [{"id": 29316, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fX7o-1OH-WM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX7o-1OH-WM", "title": "Sauerbraten Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fX7o-1OH-WM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
