Success in the 1500 Meters event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria.\n\nRunning is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible. The game rapidly gained a reputation amongst players as a \"joystick killer\" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daley-thompsons-decathlon", "videos": [{"id": 120788, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "OPcdDovVHtk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPcdDovVHtk", "title": "Daley Thompson's Decathlon on the ZX Spectrum", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OPcdDovVHtk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
