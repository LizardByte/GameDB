The player deletes five types of \"Puyo\" (red, blue, green, yellow and purple) on a 6x8 square matrix puzzle screen by finger swiping. When four or more puyos of the same color are connected vertically or horizontally, they disappear and their actions are linked to make an ally card attack, corresponding to the color of each card. The board is constantly filling as the player deletes Puyos.", "summary": "Puyo Puyo!! Quest Arcade is an arcade game, featuring puzzle RPG elements and a character card system. The game is basically free to play, only requiring cash for certain actions like refilling stamina. The game requires SEGA's Aime card (or the now-equivalent BanaPassport card from Bandai Namco Games) to store and recall gameplay status.\n\nThe service of Puyo Puyo!! Quest Arcade was announced to terminate after March 31 2017, with the removal of cabinets at schedules varying by shop. It will become impossible to play the game after that date.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-quest-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 90530, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RvHcRb5rr88"}], "collections": [{"id": 3350, "name": "Puyo Puyo"}]}
