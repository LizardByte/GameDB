It was offered as paid downloadable content for the regular version of the game and in the special edition a voucher was provided to download it for free. Gameplay is similar to Heavy Rain, but with a focus on quick pacing and split-second decisions that influence the events. The largest part is centered around investigating the house and dealing with the return of the resident. After completing the part, the player is offered to play again from certain checkpoints to discover the other endings.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
