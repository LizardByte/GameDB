Along the line, we\u2019ll meet a cast of supporting characters that will each challenge Zack and Braden in their own way as they try to put all the pieces of themselves together and come to terms with who they really are.\n\nIn contrast to many NSFW games, Straight!? is a realistic \"slow burn\" where the primary focus is on dialogue and character development. While there is NSFW content, it is used to enhance the story and the character interactions and to openly deal with issues related to sexuality without censorship. Players commonly report beginning the game with intent to speed through to NSFW scenes, but then find themselves completely invested in the characters and the world around them.\n\nThis story has everything. It\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster with flawed and relatable characters full of sarcasm, humor, wit, triumph, and tragedy. It will ask very hard questions of the characters and the readers alike.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/straight"}
