A flip and burn can be used for evasive action, reorienting a ship's weapon systems, and quickly changing directions. Or all of the above. A flip-and-burn does use a good portion of fuel, but this maneuver can change the outcome of numerous, potentially deadly, scenarios for mercenaries in the void of space.\n\nIn The Black is an intense team-based online space combat simulator with a laser focus on combat. Everything in the game is researched and designed in consultation with aerospace engineers and space scientists in order to put you in the cockpit of the most lethal machines ever devised.\n\nJoin the mailing list for important information:\nImpeller Studios: https://impellerstudios.com\nIn the Black: https://intheblack.gg\n\nFollow In the Black's progress along with fans and the developers on:\nDiscord- https://discord.gg/7ts8RYR8\nFacebook- https://www.facebook.com/ImpellerStudios\nTwitter- https://twitter.com/impellerstudios\n\n#ImpellerStudios #Tutorial #InTheBlack #hardcore", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diCyhGuvrpc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diCyhGuvrpc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diCyhGuvrpc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diCyhGuvrpc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diCyhGuvrpc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "In the Black Tutorial |Flip and Burn Tactical Maneuver| Closed Beta Gameplay", "description": "A flip and burn is a tight maneuver that quickly decelerates a ship's speed by performing a 180-degree turn and using the main thrusters to stop the momentum of the vessel.
