During the course of the game, events will loop when time runs out and the player is able to cooperate with a past version of himself, as all the previous actions of the cursor can still be seen and influence the current session.\nAs such, eventually up to ten cursors will cooperate to reach the sixteenth floor, clicking boxes to open them, mounting stairs and pressing buttons simultaneously. There is no sound and the graphics are drawn as outlines in black and white, shown from an isometric perspective.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cursor-star-10"}
