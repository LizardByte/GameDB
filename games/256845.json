Unimaginable pillars reach above and below to unseen structures of Hell.\nThe Gates of Tartarus tower amidst the haunted vapor -- a Stygian fortress guarding the passage to realms beyond.\nAbandon hope, all ye who enter here.", "summary": "A 3-key Collector style map. Pretty standard fare, with a heavy emphasis on traps and arenas, and a lite-slaughter finale. This map is intended to be challenging. All monsters/weapons are vanilla.\n\nThere are only 2 modes, (UV) and (HMP and lower). UV is the intended experience, but the HMP-lower version is there if you're looking for an easier run.\n\nThis map had several sources of inspiration, but the biggest one were the Nether Fortresses in Minecraft (both visually and mechanically). I always wanted to make a Doom map that had the sensation of finding one of these in the Nether, especially with the idea where the environment is as dangerous as the denizens lurking within. That said, there are no teleports if you fall off any of the ledges into the chasm. Basically: You fall, you die.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tartarus--1"}
