A great story mode campaign, unique Commanders with totally different playstyles, awesome Battle Powers, and a wide variety of terrain and units.\n\nChoose your Commander, assemble your forces, and battle your way to victory.\n\nWarside is a love letter to the turn-based tactics games of the last three decades.\n\nWe grew up playing the games that spawned the genre. Games like Nectaris and the Advance Wars series. We have continued to enjoy modern iterations such as Battalion, Into The Breach, Wargroove, and UniWar. Yet we yearn for more. We feel something is missing... something we think we can bring back.\n\nIf a modern version was released today, what would that look like? How would it play? How do we update the formula whilst retaining the charm of the classics?\n\nWe combine the game mechanics you already love with awesome new features to push the genre foward. We keep a retro pixel art feel but with higher-fidelity and higher-resolution graphics than any of the genre's predecessors.\n\nWarside is the game we have waited for. The game that no one else made.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warside--1"}
