Instead the story dictates which character is controllable. This time around the focus is on Gromit. Only for short section near the end the player will solve puzzles with Wallace. And although the game is a classic point and click adventure, it uses optimized controls to work for both PC and consoles. While the interaction with items on screen still work through a context-sensitive cursor, the player now moves the characters around directly instead of giving them move to-orders. Besides this change, the player still goes around the various locations, talks and interacts with people and collects everything that isn't nailed to the wall in order to solve the different riddles and advance the storyline.", "summary": "Wallace & Gromit in Muzzled! is the third and second-to-last episode of Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures.\n\nThe local dog shelter got hit by a storm and was destroyed. Now stray dogs terrorize the town and even damaged Wallace's new invention: the Inviniflavour. It's a ice-cream maker that can scan any item and use it's flavor to create a completely new kind of ice-cream. The reason he build such a vehicle is the upcoming Fundraise-A-Fair hosted by Monty Muzzle who wants to help the town raise enough money to rebuild the dog shelter. A noble cause Wallace of course wants to support. But does Mr. Muzzle really just want to help the town or are there more sinister motives behind his actions?", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures-episode-3-muzzled", "videos": [{"id": 32236, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5kgMwW5rDwc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kgMwW5rDwc", "title": "Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kgMwW5rDwc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
