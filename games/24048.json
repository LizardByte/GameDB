Enemies are weak and resources sparse near the coast, where players arrive as settlers. As they move toward the realms of darkness, players face a constant stream of enemies and high-quality resources are abundant. Players must fight to slow or even stop enemies, figuring out ways to defend their lands.\n\nInstead of leveling, combat prowess is defined by the players' experience, as well as timing and handling of their special skills. The power-curve between items is flat, so a group of skilled players can always defeat even the best equipped solo player. Progress in Blossom & Decay is based on learning and social interaction rather than grinding and time-invest.\n\nWe made Blossom & Decay a fully-fledged sandbox simulation where players fight to defend their cities, develop secured territories and replenish resources.", "summary": "Blossom & Decay is a browser-based, sandbox MMO ARPG that is set at the edge of a dying realm.
