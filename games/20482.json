NPCs in the game, including the main character's child and wife, also grow older as time passes,\n\nHowever, numerous years are skipped as the game is progressed.", "summary": "Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life will span a lifetime on the farm and follow the drama that goes with it. Not only must you build and successfully run a farm, but you must also build a successful life with family and friends! This new Harvest Moon experience will take the best qualities of the series and add more...more animals, more vegetables and more drama! What sort of life will you live?\n\nA special edition version titled \"A Wonderful Life Special Edition\" was released on the PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2004 and North America in 2005. It was later re-released on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 with improvements upon lag issues rooting from the PlayStation 2 port.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harvest-moon-a-wonderful-life-special-edition", "videos": [{"id": 37309, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iMHsm_vZqwk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMHsm_vZqwk", "title": "Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Special Edition \u2665 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iMHsm_vZqwk/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6191, "name": "Harvest Moon (old)"}]}
