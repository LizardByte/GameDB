I'm here to present you Koppotate's Rescue Mission! KRM is a hack for Pikmin 3 Deluxe that simply replaces all 10 levels from the Olimar's Comeback side story with brand new maps! Have fun by exploring these new levels designed by me! \n\nThe story of this mod is:\nKoppai suffers from another food crisis and Alph and Brittany return to PNF-404 to get more supplies. However, they didn't come back. So it's up to Koppotate, Alph's uncle, and his wife, Ruby, to go rescue the two explorers, along with a brand new ship, S.S. Macro! \n\nAnyways, I'll let the rest for you to find out! The hack is totally compatible with the Nintendo Switch emulators (Yuzu and Ryujinx)! \nInstructions on how to install are in a txt file inside the ZIP. \nGood news! The DLC has already been released! You can enjoy KRM with DLC in 3 different languages now! English, French and Italian! Huge thanks to @LazyBoii2  and @Blushfulcorn  for making all of this possible! Have fun!\n\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jC2nmBdtH8jBJXKncmOtVdETGzWMZUsj/view?usp=share_link", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ventweNcnE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ventweNcnE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ventweNcnE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ventweNcnE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ventweNcnE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Koppotate's Rescue Mission (UPDATE 2.0 AND DLC) - Launch Trailer", "description": "Hello, Koppotate to PNF-404!
