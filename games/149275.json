This is not a port from the console version, but a different version developed by The Fizz Factor and published by Activision.\n\nAs Spider-Man you must battle out through 8 chapters of mischief and mayhem to succeed. Along the way you will encounter and have to battle old foes like Rhino, Mysterio, Puma, Doc Ock and more. The game interface consists of a simple point and click system coupled with keyboard movement. Unlike it's console counterpart there is no free swinging movement but one designed with kids in mind.\n\nFighting consists of basic punching, kicking, jumpkicks and a power meter that let's you do a supercharged attack. 'Spidey' can also zip to walls and objects and use his web to do basic attacks on enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spider-man-2-the-game", "videos": [{"id": 49745, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "8_nr9qhpx1k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_nr9qhpx1k", "title": "Spider Man 2 The Game Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8_nr9qhpx1k/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49746, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Fh7u5H2dj8E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh7u5H2dj8E", "title": "Spider-Man 2 The Game (PC)\u3010FULL GAME\u3011| Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fh7u5H2dj8E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
