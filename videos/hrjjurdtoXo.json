{"id": "hrjjurdtoXo", "snippet": {"title": "Fire Ant Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Victory Software and published by Mogul Communications in 1983.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nDeveloped in the early years of the C64, Fire Ant is an innovative, if slightly bizarre title.\n\nThe queen of your nest has been captured by scorpions and it is your job to rescue her. The game is divided into a number of chambers, each of which is a self-contained unit that contains a number of puzzles that must be solved to gain access to the next chamber.\n\nEach puzzle involves collecting items, or triggering events in the correct order. The order is never clear and it is up to the player to discover the solution whilst avoiding the numerous scorpions that patrol the tunnels of each chamber. The scorpions will occasionally drop eggs that can be collected for bonus points, although there is no requirement to collect them.\n\nPerhaps the game's greatest weakness is the fact that the puzzles are rather obscure in their solution, partly down to the fact that the limited graphics, which were expected for the time, don't always accurately convey what each of the items are meant to be. A child of four or five, such as I was, wouldn't necessarily recognise the blue square with a pixel on top to be a grenade, nor how it should be used; the solution would only become clear after aimless wandering.\n\nThe scorpion AI is also annoying and has a habit of wandering into tunnels and blocking the the direction in which you need to go, which can lead to a fair amount of thumb-twiddling while you wait form them to leave.\n\nUpon saving the queen, she is immediately captured by another scorpion and the game starts over, but there is little reason to play it through again.\n\nThis isn't to say that Fire Ant is a bad game; it isn't. Collectible items aside, the graphics are nicely drawn (for the time) and there are some basic sound effects to liven things up. Instead of being a mindless Pac-Man, Space Invaders or other arcade-inspired clone, some real thought had gone into the puzzles and there is a genuine sense of reward once the solution to a particular screen has been worked out.\n\nPersonally, I owned the Commodore C16 version, which was a pack-in came with the Plus/4 my parents bought for me. Unsurprisingly, I managed to fumble my way through the first couple of screens, but I never came close to finishing it.\n\nUltimately, Fire Ant is a novel and innovative game, especially when considering the year of it's release. There's definitely no need to cover this with Nippon or pour a boiling kettle of water on it...\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hrjjurdtoXo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hrjjurdtoXo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hrjjurdtoXo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hrjjurdtoXo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hrjjurdtoXo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fire Ant Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Victory Software and published by Mogul Communications in 1983.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nDeveloped in the early years of the C64, Fire Ant is an innovative, if slightly bizarre title.\n\nThe queen of your nest has been captured by scorpions and it is your job to rescue her.
