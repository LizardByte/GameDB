Its development began in May of 2018 as a small test for supporting Unreal Engine 1 model files in GZDoom, growing into a full port of Unreal Tournament's arsenal once this was deemed a success. The first 1.0 release came out in October of 2019, and its latest released version is 1.1.3 (May 31st, 2021). Since November of 2021, the mod is no longer updated. [1]\n\nDoom Tournament attempts to port the entire set of weapons from the classic Unreal Tournament, along with several of its items. Through the use of ZScript, much of the mod's functionality is almost identical to the original game, in many cases even code-wise, due to similarities between scripting languages.", "videos": [{"id": 68659, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lHxPdBbrWcU"}]}
