You play as an ever growing snake and are placed in an arena against another snake. You each try to survive as long as possible without running into your own tail, the opponent, or the wall.\n\nThe biggest part of the game is the rating system. Everyone begins at 1500 rating, and as players get win or lose, they go up or down in rating. The strongest players will eventually end up in the 2500+ range, while the weaker players will sink to the hundreds. There is a live leaderboard which shows the best player at all times.\n\nThe game is updated weekly based on gamer feedback and suggestions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/carnage--1"}
