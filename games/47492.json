The force responsible for the Collapse is known as The Darkness, and indirectly acts as the primary antagonist. Battles against the forces of The Darkness are fought at various locations throughout the Solar System.\n\nPlot\nThe game begins with the player's Ghost resurrecting them as a Guardian, after having been dead for an unknown length of time. The Guardian is quickly forced to fight Fallen who have inhabited the ruins of the nearby Cosmodrome in Old Russia. The Guardian, with the aid of their Ghost, is able to secure a jumpship and escape to The Tower that houses the Guardians on The City border.\n\nAfter being outfitted and introduced to the Vanguard, and Gunsmith, the duo learn from Amanda Holliday that their Arcadia Class Jumpship is missing its Warp Drive, a component necessary for interplanetary travel. Due to the scarcity of the part and flyable jumpships in general, the Guardian is forced to return to where they found the ship in an attempt to find the part.", "summary": "This version includes:\n\n- Limited Edition SteelBook Case and Game Disc.\n- Ghost Replica.\n- Letter of Introduction.\n- Golden Age Relics.\n- Guardian Folio.\n- Postcards from the Golden Age.\n- Antique Star Chart.\n- Collector\u2019s Edition Digital Content", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/destiny-ghost-edition", "videos": [{"id": 49358, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZSWN-VP0lD8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSWN-VP0lD8", "title": "Destiny - Become Legend Official Trailer | PS4, PS3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZSWN-VP0lD8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49359, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tRBZlkXfkXE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRBZlkXfkXE", "title": "Destiny - Limited Edition and Ghost Edition Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tRBZlkXfkXE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
