Princess Zelda tells Link that Ganondorf, the leader of the Gerudo tribe, seeks to obtain the Triforce, a holy relic that grants immense power to the one who possesses it. Link must do everything in his power to obtain the Triforce before Ganondorf does, and save Hyrule.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the fifth main installment of The Legend of Zelda series and the first to be released for the Nintendo 64. It was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age, and is listed among the greatest video games ever created by numerous websites and magazines. The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time", "videos": [{"id": 8797, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "l8shojtqzw0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8shojtqzw0", "title": "[Videojuegos] Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time - Trailer Oficial (1998)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l8shojtqzw0/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62852, "name": "TV commercial compilation", "video_id": "uUKZrH6R8oc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUKZrH6R8oc", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Commercials collection", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uUKZrH6R8oc/sddefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 2772, "name": "Character Voice"}]}
