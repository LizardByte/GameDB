I'm selling the game four quarters ($0.99) on Steam!\nRelease date is December 8, 2017: http://store.steampowered.com/app/703630/The_Quarter_Game/\n\nSince the release date is the day before my birthday, I'll be a cool dude and give free Steam keys of my first Steam game to the first 100 people who fill out this form:\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/xpEW2LAQD4fPCex92\n\nBut what even is this indie game about and why does it have so many waveshines and wavedashes from Super Smash Bros. Melee? Oh, you expected it! It's time for the regular \"ChairGTables writes an entire essay on the description as a discrete way to get SEO keywords in\". Yup! Here we go! But first of all, I want you to know that this was a 24 hour project I did with 8 other people for Extra Life 2017 so we can raise money and save children in hospitals! Shoutouts to my gamedev crew, Lame Dimension, and the other game development crew that helped us out, Flying Pudding Studios. I think this is a decent indie game with a bunch of original assets and a cool original soundtrack. If you were expecting an RPG Maker horror game, sorry but this isn't one! So basically, this game is where you play as an anime grill named Mashiro, or Mayu Shiro if you prefer the longer version. Whoops! Check that out! That's like 10 keywords already! Alright! So what happens here is that her CEO got kidnapped and it's up to her to save the CEO. Why? How should I know!? What? Because I'm the developer? Well, I gotta not spill the beans! Well, I guess I will be because of course I'm going to speedrun my own game as always. So, yeah! Beat up the bad guys and you become the new CEO! You'll learn so much about how low paying jobs can turn a handsome man into a black market lunatic and how milk can make your bones stronger! But does the main girl give me a boner? No. I actually don't like her lol. She's not fappable. I have a tier list of every original character I made based on who I'd nut to and she's probably on the D rank. Mashiro ain't my type, but you know, not everyone has the same taste so I gotta go beyond just my tastes so it can appeal to other people! Man! Only if Steam allowed me to sell this game for one quarter but friggin, they said the lowest I can sell it is a dollar. And I can't name it Four Quarters because a company already has that name and urghhghghgh legal issues lol. Okay! I hope I got enough keywords in! Let's hope that people will find my silly game in made in 24 hours.\n\nIf you're interested in checking out the other people involved in this game, here they are:\nhttps://twitter.com/sylvysprit\nhttps://twitter.com/Sonii_TV\nhttps://soundcloud.com/david4jsus\nhttps://twitter.com/FlyingPuddingSD\nThe rest don't have social media lol\n\nTrailer made by Tuff Crowd: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO72sMmxtAxyW8Toj-JbH_w\n\nAlso, the OST is already out.
