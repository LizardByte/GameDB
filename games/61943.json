These four individualistic new idols were grouped for this purpose. Named \"MARGINAL #4\", they aim to debut as in idol group.\n\nWild and self-assured, the confident Kirihara Atom has talent but is hard to handle. Even though he looks feminine and gentle, Aiba Rui leaves a somewhat a cold impression. Twins that are splitting images of each other, but exude differing auras. Nomura L is showy, very confident, and is the younger twin. In contrast, Nomura R acts like he's hiding behind his younger brother's shadow.\n\nThen there's MARGINAL #4's seniors, \"LAGRANGE POINT\". Though stoic with goals to reach the top, Mikishima Shy is a little proud. On one hand, Himuro Kira is cheerful and good at taking care of others, but on the other, he has a crude side to him.\n\nThose two as well, were grouped together with the same goal of \"showering stars\" and aim for the big stage.\n\nThe one who holds the key to allow them to truly shine is their manager and protagonist, Kataoka Yue. How will she guide the scattered individuals of the group?", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}]}
