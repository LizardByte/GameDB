The goal of the series is, stereotypically, to rescue a princess - in this case, Princess Maria. The odd-numbered stages in the game (1, 3, 5, etc.) utilize mostly platform-style gameplay. For the even-numbered stages (2, 4, 6, etc.) the character is prompted to jump into a vehicle (a different one each time) and take part in an auto-scrolling Parodius-like level ending with a boss fight, once again set against a solid black background. The boss fights in even and odd-numbered stages are similar; the only difference is that in the even-numbered stages Apollo is in his vehicle instead of standing on a floating platform.\n\nKnown on Famicom as: Kame no Ongaeshi - Urashima Densetsu \u306e\u6069\u8fd4\u3057\u30a6\u30e9\u30b7\u30de\u4f1d\u8aac\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est Jan 2007.
