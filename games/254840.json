Alongside this are enhancements to the Zamak truck which has gained (optional) anti-aircraft guns and ViVT-capable models. The Offroad pickup and the PO-30 Orca helicopter have also been outfitted with up-armour packages designed to increase their survivability.\n\nAdditionally, five new factions - some based on existing factions from the Armaverse, along with a slew of handheld firearms, a static gun turret, and new drones in the form of armed UAVs that can either be outfitted with improvised explosives or handheld small arms, are included in the DLC. Lastly, this is all accompanied by a wide selection of (both new and retextured) personal gear and vehicular assets that are camouflaged to suit the arid environment of Sefrou-Ramal.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arma-3-creator-dlc-western-sahara", "videos": [{"id": 92702, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bVdGJ5P4Peg"}]}
