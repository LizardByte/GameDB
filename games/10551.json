Familiar elements taking from the Onimusha games include the medieval Japanese settings, the characters, items, and the ability to absorb souls in order to perform a magical attack. Fourteen characters are available initially, but a total of twenty-four can be unlocked over the course of play, including long-time Capcom superstars Mega Man and Zero. With the addition of items and weapons strewn around the battle field which characters can pick up to aid in battle, gameplay is aptly compared to one of Capcom's other fighting franchises, Power Stone.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/onimusha-blade-warriors", "collections": [{"id": 846, "name": "Onimusha"}]}
