We wanted to create a strong connection between you, the player, and the characters whose stories are told in the game. Different sections of a\u2022part\u2022ment have different mechanics that put you in the lives of the characters you play. In some sections you actively build the story, in others the story is in the environment and unfolds as you progress through it.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/apartment-a-separated-place"}
