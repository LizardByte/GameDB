The sound of stone grating on stone can be heard until the door finally slams shut with a loud THUD. Afterwards there is dead silence. You take this opportunity to look around the great temple hall reaching out in front of you. A cavernous room with huge pillars that reached into the darkness above, detailed carvings etched on all sides. You stand at the top of a set of stairs leading down the labyrinth that makes up the lower levels of the hall. A beam of light catches your eye far on the other side. You reach for your binoculars to take a closer look and as you focus on the light you catch your breath. There it is. What I\u2019ve been searching for. The Tigress Emerald. It won\u2019t be easy to get to. You have the maze to contend with plus if the legends are true there will be chambers filled with puzzles, each one trickier than the last. But it will all be worth it \u2026 for her. Mabel\u2019s medical bills were piling up. When that mysterious Baron offered to pay the cost of her surgery it was impossible to say no. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted me to come. She would have begged me to stay with her. But if I have a chance to save her\u2026\n\nA sound from he maze below brings you back to reality. You raise your binoculars once more to see if you can identify where the sound came from. You see shadows. Moving shadows. Someone or something else is in that maze.\n\nIt\u2019s too late to turn back now. \u201c", "summary": "The Temple of Adventure is a first person exploration game set in an ancient mysterious Temple.
