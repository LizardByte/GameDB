During the attempt, the player utilizes Ether against the [Profound Darkness], prompting it to capture the player and transport them to an alternate dimension. After rescuing a young girl, the player returns to Oracle and is approached by Alma, the human host for the first Klariskrays, who informs them of a strange black hole containing an alternate dimension known as \"Omega\". Alma uses her ability to stop time to send the player back to Omega. \n \nIn Omega, the player reunites with the girl, who introduces herself as Harriet. Omega has become overrun with a substance called Ephemera, which is discovered to be a form of the [Profound Darkness]'s corruption. The player, assumed to be the chosen one from an ancient prophecy, agrees to help Harriet free Omega from the power of Ephemera. \n \nThe player and Harriet travel across Omega, putting a stop to Ephemera-based schemes. In each of Omega's four countries, the heroes encounter a host of a Dark Falz and defeat them, with the player absorbing the host's consciousness and some of their powers. They are also repeatedly accosted by Elmir, who appears to be forcing the hosts to become Dark Falz. After all four Falzes are defeated, Elmir is revealed to be the successor of [Persona] and tricked the heroes into defeating the Falzes so their essences could be absorbed by Omega, revealed to be an incarnation of the [Profound Darkness]. Elmir kidnaps Harriet and intends to use her to destroy the outside dimensions, sealing her in a giant flower. Advancing to the flower's interior, the player confronts and defeat Elmir once and for all. Harriet is saved and is deemed the new goddess of Omega. \n \nAfter the black hole closes, the heroes are intercepted by Shiva, a Photoner imbued with the power of the [Profound Darkness] who used the black hole's power to return to life. Shiva defeats the player and other powerful ARKS members in battle, but is interrupted by Harriet, who has been reincarnated in the form of a weapon. Shiva vows to return and escapes.", "summary": "The stage of new adventure is \"Medieval fantasy\" world! Beyond the black hole is a different world of medieval fantasy with swirling warfare!
