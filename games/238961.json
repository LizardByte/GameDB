After Fritz Glade was murdered, Simon went to Fritz's House to find more about himself, taking Strings with him. Simon and Strings would go to the Attic when they were attacked by the Dreamcatcher Animatronics.\n\nThe enemies were going to be Dreamcatcher Popgoes, Blake, Sara, Saffron and Stone. They were going to be created by a gigantic machine called \"Help\" which Jeremy haunts throughout the game.\n\nHelp is underground, Simon is on the main floor, and Strings is in the attic. The two floors of the house were an arena where you needed to cut their paths short so they don't reach the attic.\n\nThere were also planned smaller characters. Little inventions that Fritz made in his spare time.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popgoes-2"}
