I wanted to use as few men as possible on the different islands to have as many as possible at the end, but it would take too many tries so I just started out pretty low and then went with a standard 20 or so instead. Could have used less but took too much time.\n\nI knew the basics of how the game worked, only tried it a little bit on my Amiga when I was a kid. So, I start out pretty much a noob (not pro at the end either, hehe).\n\nThere's so much speech in this game! I love it! Too bad you never got to hear the female (as I played her). It has sound effects too, but as usual (in a lot of Amiga games), having sound effects ON = music OFF. At least with music ON they also talked.\n\nI later noticed I could move my men by simply clicking from and to on the minimap, whereas I've always first right clicked on the big right screen and THEN on the minimap. Also that I didn't need to enter the different things all the time to change the numbers, could do it from the outside.\n\nI spent WAY too much time on like 3 islands. Had too much fun gathering all minerals and build as many units as I could before attacking. Those islands could have been finished in like 5 mins or so, but I went on for 20 mins or more. Sorry :P (extra boring to watch, I mean)\n\nAt the island before the last one, the game automatically selected ALL men. Then when I finished the island I got a message saying:\n\n\"....................................WHAT IS THIS...................................\nYOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES\n...BUT WITH NO MEN STORED IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION....\n...............YOU HAVE NO ARMY TO FIGHT FOR YOU...............\n...............YOU HAVE FALLEN AT THE FINAL BATTLE...............\"\n\nI had no idea what they were talking about so I guessed I needed to win while having my base intact (got nuked, but I defeated the enemy with flying units), so I tried it again and still got this message. Read the manual, saw they mentioned something about shutting down people on earlier islands to have them fight at the end. I still didn't know what to do, so I checked YouTube videos. No video had the ending, everyone got the same message I did, so no help there. I Googled and found the answer. To \"freeze\" men so they can fight in the final battle - I have to reach maximum tech level of at least 2001 AD, and I need to have enough men inside and outside, then a new icon will appear among the shields, I select this icon and then click on my main base (can't select the other 3 houses I get from teching up). So, I replayed the island again, didn't bother saving many as the last island was no challenge at all.\n\nI've never heard any other version of the tune after the game is beaten than a broken one (http://youtu.be/0ks3W3w_1A0?t=2h36m47s), and even though I ran this game (emulated) on a stock Amiga 500 (as I didn't wanna risk glitches with faster settings, which the game needed as it ran quite slow sometimes), I still got the broken version, and I used IPF disks (also tried some other versions), they were all sounding the same. So, either this tune is broken in all versions or it's an emulation issue (couldn't get anyone to try it on a real Amiga). I did have this tune in a torrent I got long ago (even named \"Mega lo Mania\", but still can't be 100% sure ofc, also compared the broken and the new one in protracker and they seemed similar) and it should be the right one, so I replaced the broken one with this (hopefully it IS the right one). If it is, then this will be the first video EVER that has this tune playing correctly (AFAIK).\n\nI always try to go for the right title when naming my longplays, but this time it's always \"MEGA lo MANIA\" everywhere in the game AND manual, even in the middle of a sentence, so I think that's maybe how they want it spelled. But, kept it like everyone else do it: \"Mega lo Mania\".", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tmUQgEQv9_I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tmUQgEQv9_I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tmUQgEQv9_I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tmUQgEQv9_I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tmUQgEQv9_I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay [085] Mega lo Mania", "description": "Subscribe: http://tinyurl.com/iamironclawsub\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IronclawFTW\nMy website: http://www.iamironclaw.com\n\nI spent days on this longplay (a few hours each day).
