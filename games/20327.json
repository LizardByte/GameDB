Do better and the Fallen Hero will activate \u2013 if collected, it will improve your shield and weapons to aid your survival.\nMonuments: Nothing pushes you like beating your friends! In Survival we place Monuments representing your friends (or global) scores around you. Beat the score to destroy the monument as you move up the leaderboards to glory.\nIn Demolition you take the fight armed only with a wrecking ball powered by proximity bombs. No other weapons, boost or overdrive here. Be careful though, as the wrecking ball will fly off around the stage destroying everything it hits\u2026 including you!", "summary": "Survival Mode is Resogun turned up to 11 - you only have a single life to last as long as you can.
