In Pac-Man the player has to eat all the dots from the board in order to pass to the next level. In this game the dots are replaced by fruits (apple, strawberry and cherry) that the player has to eat in order to get a score and to go to the next level. The enemies are four mean laser machines in the sides of the levels and they attack the player by shooting lasers. When the character is hit, a life is lost. Unlike Pac-Man there are no special pills in the game. The board also contains skulls and they also make the character lose a life upon contact. After every level a password is provided to continue playing from that level immediately.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dodger"}
