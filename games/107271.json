Sparticles contains 100 levels, more or less difficult. Gameplay mechanics are added gradually, so as not to tire the player. \n \nKey Features \n \n100 platforming levels to test your skills \nDefeat challenging Bosses! \nIf there are enemies, you must destroy them to unlock the exit portal \nScoreboard to see the best time of all users and friends on each level \nRepeat as many times a level, death is very fast!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sparticles", "videos": [{"id": 21896, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pFc1X2MKKhI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFc1X2MKKhI", "title": "Sparticles Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pFc1X2MKKhI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
