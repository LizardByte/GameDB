It supports up to four human players who can compete with each other in top-down arenas. Alternatively, one or two players can take on the story mode in its single-player or two-player cooperative modes.\n\nThe game has a comedic edge, true to its name, and concerns a quartet of kunoichi as they locate a stolen scroll. Each maze involves finding a way to the enemies, destroying them with shuriken bombs and then progressing to the next. The player(s) can also find power-up icons, which increase the strength and number of their shuriken bombs, or perform other useful feats like freezing all the enemies on-screen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/otoboke-ninja-colosseum"}
