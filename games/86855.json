Facial cleanser is avocado with honey, exfoliator is pineapple, and lotion is coconut oil! You\u2019ll put guava slices on her eyes instead of cucumber, and tangerines under her eyes instead of regular eye strips. These are spa beauty secrets known only by the people living on her paradise island. And now you\u2019ve learned their secret!\n\nIf you think her spa sounds cool, just wait until you see her cosmetics! There are elegant face paints to try, in addition to the ordinary makeup items. Yet her makeup is anything but ordinary. Why, they\u2019re all made with natural plant ingredients, grown right on her warm, sunny island. And even her jewelry has a special tropical touch, from fresh flowers to delicate pearls and beads. All her earrings and necklaces are so colorful and fun, just as you\u2019d imagine they should be for a Tropical Princess.\n\nThen you can dress her up in hand-made princess fashions! From hula skirts to beaded skirts, floral dresses and various strappy sandals, you\u2019ll have plenty of options to beautify this royal girl. Oh, and one more thing! The Tropical Princess loves animals, so you\u2019ll get to choose which one will accompany her!
