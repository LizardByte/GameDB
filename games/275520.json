The deadline to repay the enormous debt she's been saddled with is all too close, and Enishia must find a way to repay it.\n\nWhat will she do to earn the money? Why did the Zimmet Company have the deed to the land? And why is Megista suddenly facing so many concurrent problems?\n\nIt's up to you and Enishia to find out!", "summary": "Having sworn to protect the town's church, the gentle nun, Enishia, buys the deed to the land from a greedy merchant company.
