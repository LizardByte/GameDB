No more tiny 2D graphics this time - Starfury features a first-person perspective from a lone ship and a all-new real-time 3D rendering engine. As captain of your battle cruiser, you'll travel through solar systems via warp points, explore the galaxy, engage in furious space combat, and join in large fleet operations. Starfury allows you to completely customize your starship and has a complex ship combat model. Multiple campaigns with a vast array of missions will challenge you to hold back the forces that threaten your race, and to make a little money on the side!\n\nAs always, the game is completely open: you can alter the game's structure and create custom mods and skins.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-empires-starfury", "collections": [{"id": 1976, "name": "Space Empires"}]}
