While the sultan is fighting a war in a foreign land, his vizier Jaffar, a wizard, seizes power. His only obstacle to the throne is the Sultan's daughter. Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her to become his wife, or she would die within 60 minutes (extended to 120 minutes in the Super NES version, which has longer and harder levels). The game's unnamed protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. In order to free her, he must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out.", "summary": "The award winning computer software adventure that has people everywhere rattling their sabers is here for Super NES. And now the animation is more detailed, and the controls more responsive. There's even a five part training mode for sharpening your running, jumping, climbing and sword fighting skills.\nBut the sands of time are against you. For you must survive 20 perilous stages, rescure the princess from the evil Grand Vizier Jaffar, and claim the royal residency all before the hourglass is empty.\nBeware the unpredictable floors and ceilings, gut splitting guillotines, hidden spikes, walls of flames and more. Jaffar's spells spell doom if you're not crafty and nimble. And a legion of savage servants, amazing amazons and immortal skeletons will do his barbaric bidding. Even your own alter ego is the enemy.\nPass through invisible doors and walk through space portals. Find vessels of magic potions, but partake of them wisely. They may increase your life or just as easily poison you. So take each step with caution, young would-be prince, or the entire kingdom will suffer the darkest Arabian night ever.\n\nPrince of Persia was ported to many systems, but the version for the SNES was extended. Not only were the graphics improved significantly, the the amount of levels and their size was increased as well. Instead of one hour for twelve levels, the player now has two hours to beat 20 levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/prince-of-persia--3"}
