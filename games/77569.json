Players will play as the last survivors of a nation that has an ancient tradition of cosmic worship, and belief that by launching space burials, those who've deceased will be able to return and rest among the stars. Throughout the game players will travel the snow covered landscape, scavenging for rocket parts and remnants of the past, so they may help the last surviving witch - religious figures who conduct the rituals of space burials - to launch one final burial. The game explores themes of purpose, pursuit and loneliness.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/opus-rocket-of-whispers", "videos": [{"id": 17381, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5QxvKXaJ7SA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QxvKXaJ7SA", "title": "OPUS: Rocket of Whispers - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5QxvKXaJ7SA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
