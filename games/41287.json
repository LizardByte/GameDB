It was developed by the same team that created Ikinari Musician for the Famicom earlier in the same year. Like Ikinari Musician, it is not really a game, but rather a music simulator. Unlike Ikinari Musician, Family Composer gives players more control over the music played, and even allows them to compose new songs, and record the compositions to disk.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/family-composer"}
