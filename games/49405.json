Players are allowed full roam of the mansion, once they collect enough Shriveled Souls inside their Beacon of Souls, a special lantern designed to collect the various lesser ghosts throughout the rooms. Though Zeke handles his quest alone, he is aided by the help of Madame Leota, and six friendly ghosts who will provide hints and items throughout the journey. As Zeke solves puzzles, completes various tasks, and helps rid the house of its evil spirits, these spiritual companions will provide Soul Gems, which amplify the power of the Soul Beacon. Once fully charged, Zeke will have the ability to face the main spirit, Atticus Thorn, for the final showdown.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-the-haunted-mansion"}
