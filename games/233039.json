Flip, Spin or Fiddle the Beads in manner that suits you. Use a two finger motion to set the bead size. This sole use or \"pass around on a single device\" game will show at least one virtual bead that the user can fiddle with single finger actions. There will be more beads on devices with larger screens. There is no demand to move fast or slow, so the APP could be used to burn off excess energy or stress. As a game, multiple users can pass the device around and try to mimic the bead arrangement on the other tab. The APP could also be used as a dexterity test, where someone would make requested changes to all the beads within a certain time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/worry-bead"}
