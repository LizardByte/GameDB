Players can command an elite force of Colonial Marines, stalk their prey as a member of the Predator clan, or scurry along in packs as the acid-spitting Aliens. Gameplay involves advancing through a series of missions ranging in locale from jungles and caverns to futuristic battlefields and space colonies. Each faction offers ten types of combat units that can be upgraded over time with new attributes or equipment specific to the species. Predators, for instance, increase their number of vision modes, Aliens impregnate their victims with facehuggers, while Colonial Marines receive new weapon enhancements. As in titles like StarCraft, units range in scope from standard grunts and infantry to specialized forces and massive troop transports.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 10361, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "19xNzEbKHiM"}]}
