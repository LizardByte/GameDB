This northern US state is untamed, wild and natural. Montana is a gateway to Glacier and Yellowstone\u2014two crown jewels of the national park system\u2014and is home to glistening glacial lakes, snow-capped mountain peaks, blue-ribbon trout streams, and mighty Missouri, Yellowstone, and Flathead Rivers. This is just the beginning; the stunning mountain scenery of Montana only accentuates the rustic charm of the small towns beneath it. And backcountry trails lead to wild, secluded spaces where it is still possible to be utterly alone.\n\nVast, unspoiled, and wild, \u201cBig Sky State\u201d represents the very best of the American West. Rugged cowboys still saddle up to ride at ranches and wow crowds at rodeos. Ghost towns, state parks, and a one-of-a-kind Dinosaur Trail preserve a dazzling array of historical treasures."}
