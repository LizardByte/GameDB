The greater your strength, the higher your level. Exercises that work the legs for example are associated with water, and will have corresponding effects in the game. At any moment, your opponent can fight back more effectively if he or she uses the opposing element. The level of your weakest muscle group determines your overall rank, pushing you to maintain a well-rounded functional fitness. Black Box VR\u2019s machine learning algorithms incentivise your the optimal workout so you can focus less on tracking and more on pushing yourself to the limit.", "summary": "An experience that redefines fitness at a fundamental level. Heroes field warrior units and perform movements with real resistance to deploy direct damage, break through opposing gates and destroy the enemy crystal. Stronger lifts correspond to more powerful attacks. A session is comprised of as many rounds as possible in 30 minutes. The more crystals you destroy in each round, the more points you will earn! Win battles to earn trophies that allow you to move up to higher stadiums and rankings.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 42339, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bDf15sO5F2M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDf15sO5F2M", "title": "Black Box VR - A Virtual Reality Gym Combining Gaming & Serious Fitness for Heroic Results", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDf15sO5F2M/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 42340, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "jtePUb2Sesc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtePUb2Sesc", "title": "Black Box VR Gameplay with Mixed Reality", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jtePUb2Sesc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
