The game includes colorful cartoony graphics, plus changing backgrounds and custom soundtrack music.\nYour progress is saved and sent to the Game Center high scores list.\nTake on a friend or go up against the cold logic of the CPU on one of three levels of difficulty.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-slugs"}
