Behold! The First First-person shooter game in thumby ... Thoom.\n\nThis is a demake version Doom written in MicoPython, with raycasting pseudo-3D and sprite scaling (for upscale only, it looks unrecognizable when downscale).As a proof of concept, there is only one level, filled with Demons and Imps, and locked doors requiring key card to open, and last but not least a small bossfight.\n\nHope you enjoy this short game. And hope you use this project to create something more fun. (sorry for ugly codes)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thoom"}
