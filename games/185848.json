Three days after the closure of Jollibee's because of health code violations, the animatronics are sent out for further investigation. It is your job to guard the animatronics before they are shipped out to another location.", "summary": "The player plays/works as an employee of the shipping company, LBM Shipments, Inc. (LBM Shipments Inc Warehouse). Their job is to transport boxes each night shift. To do this, they must use the workstation panel on the left side of the office that controls the conveyor belts and security systems. On the first night, 50 boxes must be transported to their respective conveyer belts. The boxes and tracks are labelled by a letter (A, B, C, D, and E). To transport them, the player needs to click and drag the node to the other corresponding side. The number of boxes increases by 25 boxes each new night, reaching its maximum of 100 boxes on Night 3. It is recommended to keep track of the box/track labels, otherwise errors will be added to the counter on the bottom left corner of the area on the screen. Errors are counted when a box is ignored or misplaced. If the player gets 1 error, 50$ will be removed from the paycheck at the end of the night. The maximum amount of errors the player can get is 15. If any more are added, the result will be a GAME OVER screen.\n\nThe workstation panel also contains four tabs: Motion Detect, Cameras, Audio, and Hack. These systems decrease their stability the more you use them. The less the stability is, the higher the chance it can go offline. However, there is a maintenance panel at the right side of the office to reboot them. It takes about 3-5 seconds to reboot any system.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
