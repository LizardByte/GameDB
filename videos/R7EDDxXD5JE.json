Your objective will be to enter the depths of a cursed abbey to banish the heretical gods.\n\nThe control system of Heretic Gods is intuitive and is very well adapted to tactile devices. With the virtual crossbar on the left of the screen you can move your character, while with the buttons on the right you can attack and use skills. With just pressing the attack buttons, your hero will automatically target the nearest enemy.\n\nThe dungeons of Heretic Gods are generated randomly, so you will never play twice in the same scenario. That said, many levels are very similar to each other, with different variations in architecture and especially in the variation of enemies. The more levels you raise, the deeper you dive into new dungeons with stronger enemies to fight.\n\nA very important aspect of Heretic Gods is the loot. You can find and equip hundreds and hundreds of different objects, including axes, helmets, gloves, boots, armor, shields, bows, swords, rings, and so on. In the village, in addition, we can trade with its inhabitants or even craft your own items.\n\nHeretic Gods manages to successfully adapt the formula of popular roleplaying games to tactile devices. For this, it not only offers an accessible control system, but also some levels with a relatively short duration, which we can finish in a few minutes perfectly styled for mobile gaming.\n\n\u2022 random generated dungeons\n\u2022 shape up different characterbuilds out of 75+ skills\n\u2022 adjustable graphic settings for best performance even on old hardware\n\u2022 innovative auto targeting system\n\u2022 optional auto fight system\n\u2022 infinite random generated magic items\n\u2022 hundreds of unique items and set items\n\u2022 fully playable for free\n\u2022 3 difficulties\n\u2022 ongoing updates for even more game-content\n\nHereticGods grants full playability now and will be upgraded through updates.\nfuture updates will include more:\n\u2022 unique items\n\u2022 set items\n\u2022 enemies\n\u2022 boss enemies\n\u2022 quests\n\u2022 skills\n\u2022 game environments\n\nGet the game now on Google Playstore \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.curacha.hereticgods\n\nVISIT US:\n\nWEB: https://curacha.at\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/Heretic-Gods-177527899645448/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/HereticGods", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R7EDDxXD5JE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R7EDDxXD5JE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R7EDDxXD5JE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R7EDDxXD5JE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R7EDDxXD5JE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "HERETIC GODS | TOP ANDROID ARPG", "description": "Heretic Gods is an ARPG in which players can enter a dark world, full of dungeons and monsters, set in the land of the Viking Myths.
