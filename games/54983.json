During a Live, rhythm icons move towards a cursor and must be tapped, held, or swiped. During the performance, Support opportunities allow Idols to appeal and boost the score. Kizuna (or Bonds) are special Appeals that allow two Idols to Appeal together. When Kizuna between two Idols is maxed out, a special description for the two Idols is displayed on screen.\n\nCompared to the original Mobage, LIVE ON ST@GE introduces new SSR cards. Both SR and SSR cards feature full illustrations. Leveling up an Idol is separated into Lesson and Special Lessons. Lessons use P Points to increase level while Special Lessons use P Memos to Change! cards into their new outfits. Duplicate copies of cards now increase the power and level cap of the original card."}
