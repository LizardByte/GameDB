The animation features Banjo, Kazooie and Mumbo Jumbo being chased by enemies from Banjo-Tooie, all using their models from the game.\n\nIn 2002, Rare was brought by Microsoft, which caused various games developed for Nintendo systems at the time to move platforms, which would've included Banjo-Threeie.\n\nDecades later, in 2020, the developer Gregg Mayles confirmed it to be simply a joke that fans took at face value, and the SpaceWorld demo was confirmed to simply be a showcase of how many N64 models the GameCube could render at once.\n\nAccording to Mayles, a game in the same style as the first two wasn't in the plans, and they went through three different concepts, until setting on what became Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/banjo-threeie"}
