In an instant the world lost access to electricity, and suddenly so many things that we had taken for granted were gone; the Internet, global communications, electronic devices\u2026 all gone.\nWar emerged as governments fell and society collapsed in upon itself. Guns, medicine and food became the new currencies while survival and protection became the sole necessities. Conflicts continued for years as ordinary people battled against famine, disease, the elements, and other humans.\nA new world rose from the ashes of the old one. Each survivor enclave had a different idea on how to shape their new society: bands of raiders, religious cults, biker gangs, idealistic democratic communes and organisations built around charismatic leaders. Cities were once again battlegrounds, but it was no longer for survival, it was now for domination.", "summary": "Neverdark is a pausable RTS game which throws you into a post-apocalyptic world.
