Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler no Kuroi Inbou (\"U.F.O. Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler's Black Conspiracy\") is a brawler featuring U.F.O. Kamen Yakisoban, a character designed to market Nissin's Yakisoba U.F.O. brand of instant yakisoba circa 1993-1995. It understandably features a variety of foodstuffs.\n\nIn the game, Yakisoban's bride-to-be Mayumi has been kidnapped by the villainous Kettler who wishes to marry her himself (and of course to destroy the concept of delicious Nissin Brand instant Yakisoba!). Yakisoban is obviously a bit dense, as he's standing at the altar and doesn't even realize Mayumi is not there until part-way through the ceremony.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ufo-kamen-yakisoban-kettler-no-kuroi-inbou"}
