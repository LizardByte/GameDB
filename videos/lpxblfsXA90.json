Discover an action-packed open-world sandbox game inspired by classic GTA and action movies from the 80-90s. The game offers a new 3D top-down single-player experience where you can STEAL, DRIVE and FIGHT.\n\nSet in 1980s middle-America within a sleepy rural town, American Fugitive invites you to play as Will Riley. By no means a killer, but no angel either, you face life in prison for a crime you didn\u2019t commit. Fuelled by grief over the cold-blooded murder of your father, and armed with a burning desire for vengeance you\u2019ll need to break out of jail to find the real culprit. Simply put: It's payback time. \n\nJUSTICE AIN'T ALWAYS LEGAL.\n\n---\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CurveDigital\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CurveDigital\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/curvedigital", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lpxblfsXA90/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lpxblfsXA90/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lpxblfsXA90/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lpxblfsXA90/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lpxblfsXA90/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "American Fugitive - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "OUT NOW on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/934780/American_Fugitive/\nOUT NOW on Nintendo Switch: https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/American-Fugitive-1557415.html\nOUT NOW on Xbox One: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/american-fugitive/c48ljqlv397r?activetab=pivot:overviewtab\nOUT NOW on PlayStation 4: https://store.playstation.com/#!/cid=EP4395-CUSA13958_00-0000000000000000\n\nSubscribe now for more news and updates: https://bit.ly/2AMyqSx\n\n---\n\nAmerican Fugitive is out now on PC and consoles!
