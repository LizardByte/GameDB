Changing any factor produces a new quest line and outcome, which will change the player's strategy, even when entering the same map at a different time of the day. \n \nPlayers will also find that Core Blaze relies heavily on teamwork. Each instance is designed for teams of up to four players, who will need to instantly react to each other\u2019s combat style in order to achieve the most effective results. However, party modes will allow more than four people to a team.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/core-blaze", "videos": [{"id": 13187, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "QZUBEhFiNJY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZUBEhFiNJY", "title": "Core Blaze Gameplay Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QZUBEhFiNJY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
