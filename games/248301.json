Decision had been made to establish a planetary government that would rule over all nations of Terra. Some countries joined willingly, some were forced to join under a threat of a complete exclusion from international trade, travel and financial system. \u201cCommon degrowth plan\u201d with very harsh measures was adopted. It was supposed to reduce the whole economy and transform it from a growth driven to sustainable, circular, and much more local.\n\nLong story short... Some agreed with the idea, some did not. Some wars happened, governments came and went, and so on. What matters is that Ether Islands were given to the outlaws of the new system. People with greed, ambition and high status that refused to leave their old lives and move on, were given their \u201cnew land\u201d as a home soil for their world\u2019s ideas.", "summary": "Citizen Conflict is a free- to-play, team-based shooter game set in the dystopian world of Ether Islands, where every match is fight for survival and valuable loot!
