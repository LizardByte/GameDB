It was released in 1982, and is based on the arcade game, Pengo.\n\nVery little is known about the LCD version of Pengo, though it is possible that it was not released outside of Japan. It can be assumed it bears some relationship with the arcade game, but as the system is quite rare, nothing has yet been documented."}
