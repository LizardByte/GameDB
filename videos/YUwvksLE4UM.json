When your crew discovers another ship abandoned and trapped in the ice, things take a suspenseful turn. But hey, that doesn't mean there isn't time to get to know a few members of the crew! While earning valuable work experience, of course.\n\nDownload the game here:\nhttps://everydayfoxlife.itch.io/brittle-blue\n\nListen to the original soundtrack here:\nhttps://matthewisniewski.bandcamp.com/album/brittle-blue-ost", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUwvksLE4UM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUwvksLE4UM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUwvksLE4UM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUwvksLE4UM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUwvksLE4UM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Brittle Blue - Release Trailer", "description": "Brittle Blue was made for #ILUJAM 2017, a game jam for games and comics with dating sim elements.\n\nYou're an intern aboard a high-tech icebreaking ship, specially designed to traverse the treacherous and remote waters of the arctic.
