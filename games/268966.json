Each map takes about 5 minutes to play through. The gameplay is pretty standard in some maps, but in others it can get quite gimmicky, so there's a bit of variety in terms of that. The wad is split into 2 episodes. One centers around the colors gray and black, the other around green.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scattered-ashes"}
