As a result, having threatened for one year and one month to some extent, I realized what I had planned. It was difficult for me alone to do everything, and so I called for help TheSkyBug, who made weapons, some monsters, and a bunch of different trifles, and also ZZYZX, who made a new lighting system. Big thanks to them. Also thanks to ChaingunnerX, DOOMGABR, Dagamon, VladGuardian and other people for help of various kinds - without you this wad would come out much later.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/void-and-rainbow"}
