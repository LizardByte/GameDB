Both EX and WY come in four versions: the Legal Version makes useful Hidden Abilities easily available, and adds many egg and tutor moves to almost every Pok\u00e9mon's level up moves, all of which are legal in the official games (hence the name). The Rebalanced Version includes all of these changes, as well as many base stat, type and movepool changes intended to make weaker Pok\u00e9mon more fun to use. The third version available is Insanity Mode; this is essentially the Rebalanced Version with more challenging Trainer battles. Finally, the Online Version of the hack sacrifices a few features to make every Pokemon you catch legal, and can be used to play online.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-wilting-y"}
