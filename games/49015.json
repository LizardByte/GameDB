A sequel was later released, known as Oddworld Adventures II, mostly based off Abe's Exoddus, and with many improved elements over the original.\n\nThe game contains GameSpeak actions, though they are used only in a single puzzle in the game, and there are only four, as the Game Boy has far less buttons than the PSX controller. The four GameSpeak actions are farting, a high whistle, a low whistle and chanting. Instead of having a save option, the game has a five letter password feature.\n\nIn this game, chanting is activated by pressing and holding the Select-button. If there is nothing to possess on the screen, Abe will make a grunt, indicating that there is currently no use in trying to chant in that area. Abe still has the ability to sneak by pressing up on the D-pad while moving left or right.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 23365, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "u8mae8ELGGY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8mae8ELGGY", "title": "Oddworld: Adventures [Walkthrough/Guida] (1/3)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u8mae8ELGGY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
