The game, endorsed by Kevin Keegan, lets you take over the manager's reins of a soccer club in any of the English Leagues, be it the Premier League or the low lights of the Third Division. But this is no ordinary football game. Unlike others on the N64, PM is a management simulation, and you never actually take control of a match by controlling individual players. Instead, you pick the lineup, your own formation and the tactics of how the team should play. Then you let your players go off and do the work on their own. This makes the whole game harder since you never have direct control over the actions of the players -- instead, you have to hope that you picked the right combination of players and the right tactics to do the job. Released only in Europe.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/premier-manager-64"}
