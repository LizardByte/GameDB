It is based on the Shannara series of books by Terry Brooks.\nThe game has some elements taken from RPGs, such as top-down world-map traveling and occasional turn-based battles. However, there is no real role-playing system in the game (statistics, experience points, levels, etc.). The battles serve to emphasize the danger of traveling the wilderness, or appear as story-related events; sometimes, they are treated like puzzles, with specific actions leading to victory.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shannara"}
