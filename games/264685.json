This method might be trivial, but effective. At least for the first decade. Then, first mutations of sea dwellers were recorded and first human infections only shortly afterwards. The infections induced a catastrophic overburdening of the hospitals, which resulted in the highest global mass mortality rate ever recorded.\n\nIn PERSEVERA you take on the role of the main protagonist Edward, who has lost his memory and is now trying to find answers. The main story is driven by two main goals. First, opening the briefcase and secondly, finding out why you woke up wearing a torn medical scrub while being chained to the suitcase in the first place. While you are trying to figure out a way to open the briefcase, you simultaneously explore puzzling circumstances and find out more about the dangers.", "summary": "Intoxicated by the philosophy of absurdity of Albert Camus, you wake up malnourished in a torn medical scrub with a suitcase handcuffed to your left arm and thousand open questions.
