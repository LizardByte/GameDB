In Highborn, you\u2019re treated to a strategy game that offers an intelligent, tactical experience without the frenetic play of a traditional RTS. Move your forces around an overhead map to secure spells and combat support, then dive into combat to deploy those advantages against an unsuspecting enemy. All the fun and fighting is set against an irreverent tale, filled with wacky heroes, witty dialogue and wild assumptions.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/highborn", "videos": [{"id": 13403, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2-Bs_-48coo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Bs_-48coo", "title": "Highborn - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2-Bs_-48coo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
