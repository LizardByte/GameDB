The game was announced at Konami's E3 2009 conference, where it was revealed that the game would be a reworked, networked, coin-op iteration of Metal Gear Online. It has a special interface that utilizes 3D goggles and tickets to unlock jewelry and other weapons. It was released in Japan on December 20, 2010. It was removed from many arcades due to a lack of popularity, although the arcade service itself did not end until December 1, 2016.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 49019, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "aLTDahK0CRs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLTDahK0CRs", "title": "METAL GEAR ARCADE - Gameplay - Arcade", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aLTDahK0CRs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49020, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aYV-vHdXHgc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYV-vHdXHgc", "title": "METAL GEAR ARCADE \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aYV-vHdXHgc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
