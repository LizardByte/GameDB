Made by MSPaintR0cks, this is a unique shooter in which the player is a hedgehog fighting an army of cats. It is spread across three episodes, each having six levels. The mapping style is more akin to Wolfenstein 3D than classic Doom.\n\nThe playful art style, creative gameplay mechanics, and humorous plot were well-received, including a runner-up at the Cacowards 2016. A sequel, Rise of the Wool Ball, was released by MSPaintR0cks the following year.", "videos": [{"id": 66108, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rVKHzywiczk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVKHzywiczk", "title": "Shadow Of The Wool Ball - Doom Mod Madness", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rVKHzywiczk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
