To make it a bit harder, you are followed by several red mice which bring you certain death when you crash into one of them. As the red mice outnumber you, you should take into account that you might get encircled by several mice. A further peril are the black cats, which lure behind some of the corners. Into those also the red mice can run, but they are only delayed by the cat and not killed. With a \"Star Screen\" - a trace of stars that can be left behind by the blue mouse - you can temporarily disable followers which are too close.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/radar-rat-race"}
