However, he finds an unknown force causing the worlds of each show to be destroyed, with villains jumping between worlds and many heroes becoming corrupted. The Announcer watches the events unfold, beginning with Ben Tennyson traveling to Chowder's world in pursuit of Vilgax. Ben defeats a corrupted Chowder, freeing him from possession, but Vilgax escapes, and Chowder's world is engulfed in static. Chowder and Ben are pulled back to Bellwood, where they are attacked by a corrupted Buttercup. She too is freed, and after a battle with Ultimate Kevin Levin, Ben's world too begins to fade. However, Dexter arrives and rescues them with a dimension capsule before the world is destroyed. The allied heroes then use the capsule to travel between the worlds of many different shows, defeating the displaced villains while freeing the corrupted heroes and recruiting them to their cause before each world can be destroyed.", "summary": "Did you ever wonder what would happen if Humungousaur and Samurai Jack met up in a dark alley?
