As aliens occupied the abandoned earth, The \u201cCouncil of the Confederation of Human Kind\u201d decided to send a ship to Earth to conquer the home planet again. \n \nOf course, the player takes control of that Battle Probe and fights his way through 65 levels to expel the aliens by simply killing all of them in this vertical scrolling shoot 'em up game. \n \nThe player is attacked by shooting and moving aliens, but also must avoid any ground obstacle dropping a shadow carefully, because those will instantly kill the player. During the level the player's ship is consuming fuel, which has to be refilled by flying over \u201cFuel\u201d fields. On the ground there are also often colored eyes found: a blue eye rewards some extra points, a yellow eye rewards an extra life and a green eye releases a random effect. On collecting extras, the game is playing a voice sample telling you which item you collected.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-probe"}
