With a whole team of modders, designers, and artists, we bring you: PvZ 2: Reflourished!\n\nIn PvZ 2: Reflourished, we are adding 2 new worlds to the game: Dr. Zomboss' master plot of Holiday Mashup, containing 42 levels of holiday insanity, and Steam Ages, taking place during the midst of the Industrial Revolution in England. Steam Ages releases with 1 part only: we intend to add the second part in our mod updates. Each world has a brand new gimmick and new zombies to encounter as well. Both worlds come fully equipped with brand new soundtracks, including UBs and DMGs.\n\nWe have also redone all of PopCap's expansion levels for the worlds that received them, and added new expansions for all of the worlds that did not get an expansion. Now directly tied into our new story content, expansions are no longer there to convince you to level up your plants, they are now there as tests of skill for veteran players!\n\nThere's so much more that we are excited to reveal. Stay tuned, as dev diaries from our artists and designers will be coming soon, as well as big showcases! For now, take a look at our list of team members who have worked on the project here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393580794708230146/810428446869159957/2-14-2021_reflourished_credits.txt", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svDXKcUt3eQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svDXKcUt3eQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svDXKcUt3eQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svDXKcUt3eQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svDXKcUt3eQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Plants vs. Zombies 2: Reflourished - Official Teaser Trailer", "description": "Introducing PvZ 2: Reflourished, a PvZ 2 mod that aims to bring back the classic pre-2017 feel to PvZ 2, while adding a bunch of new content as well!\n\nFrom humble beginnings, this mod started as a remake of the classic Holiday Mashup experience, but kept growing, and growing, until we had a whole new game on our hands!
