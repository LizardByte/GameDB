The levels are full of details and monsters. It is also one of the few PWADs that are allowed to be used in Compet-N speed runs.\n\nThere have been two separate releases of Alien Vendetta. The second release, made when it was selected for usage on Compet-N, made various changes to almost all of the levels; the biggest change is the replacement of MAP25: Valley of Echoes with another map, MAP24: Clandestine Complex, as well as the relocation of the former MAP24: Demonic Hordes to MAP25."}
