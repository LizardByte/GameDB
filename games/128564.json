The need for flexible labor has grown exponentially since the beginning of the century. Today, the protections and bureaucracy of traditional staffing solutions aren't sustainable anymore: a single worker may be needed by different companies over the course of the same day. That's why Tuboflex inc., the world's leading Human Resources Services company, created a complex system of tubes that allow us to allocate employees in real time according to the market's demand. Playing the role of a Tuboflex employee, you have to survive this ultra-dynamic labour market, getting quickly used to the most disparate tasks. Welcome to the Tube Age."}
