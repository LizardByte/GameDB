White Night is both a survival horror and an homage to the first survival horror while developing its own identity. Set in America's early thirties, the game offers to live the nightmare of a man, hurt and trapped in an old family manor where darkness is a constant threat.\n\nStranded and injured in the dead of night after an unfortunate automobile accident, players must investigate a nearby dilapidated mansion and interact with their surroundings in search of aid and answers. White Night challenges players to confront the nightmares of the past on an adventure in which darkness is the enemy\u2026 and darkness is everywhere.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/white-night", "videos": [{"id": 3484, "name": "Announce Trailer", "video_id": "hqUMmzAQuVg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqUMmzAQuVg", "title": "White Night - Announce Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hqUMmzAQuVg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 3629, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "QMF0ftX1yOA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMF0ftX1yOA", "title": "White Night - Launch Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QMF0ftX1yOA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
