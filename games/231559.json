It is meant to function as a demo for the Nintendo DS title of the same name, specifically its Puzzle mode.\n\nThe game is themed after Super Mario Bros. 3, using graphics of clouds, hills and colored blocks from that game to compose the background. Two Green Yoshis using sprites from Yoshi's Cookie hold a big sign showing the level currently being played, and another one peeks from behind the game board.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tetris-ds-puzzle-mode"}
