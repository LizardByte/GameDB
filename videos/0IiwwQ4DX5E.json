When I first put pencil to paper to the music of OSC 3 years ago, I never would have believed that this was happening.\n\nAnother Sonic 2 Remake is a hand crafted re-imagining of 8 Bit Sonic 2! Inspired by the amazing music, fan games and YouTube content created by the Sonic community and the \"digitised\" games of the 90's.\n\nLook out for AS2R's demo at SAGE 2022! #SAGExpo\n\nThank you very much to @Game Gambler for making this trailer, your video editing skills and appreciation for graphic design and animation inspires me to do my best\n\nAnd thank you to @OSC, whose music was some of the first I discovered. Your music is too good for my project, but the trailer should do nicely\n\nSAGE 2022 WEBSITE:\nhttps://sagexpo.org/\nLet us know if there is anything we can improve with this game, any feedback is greatly appreciated!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0IiwwQ4DX5E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0IiwwQ4DX5E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0IiwwQ4DX5E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0IiwwQ4DX5E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0IiwwQ4DX5E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Another Sonic 2 Remake - SAGE 22 TRAILER", "description": "Download here!\nhttps://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/as2r-another-sonic-2-remake-sage-22-demo.1389/\n\nAre you up 2 it?\n\nWe are incredibly proud to showcase a very special trailer for Another Sonic 2 Remake.
