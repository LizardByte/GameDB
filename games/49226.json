Despite having the same title, each is actually a different game. The NES title is arguably the best known and contains five levels culminating in a final showdown with the Joker in the bell tower of Gotham Cathedral. It was received well despite changes from the movie upon which it was based.\n\nSunsoft later released Batman: Return of the Joker as a follow-up which is not related to any movie.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
