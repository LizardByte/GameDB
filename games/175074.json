The object of the game is to strike the ball into the goal. Move your teammates in the white jerseys around to help set up the perfect shot or you may have to simply move some of them out of the way. Aim the arrow in the direction you want to kick the ball to score a goal while avoiding obstructing opponents & yellow cards. However, sometimes you might be able to use an opponent to your advantage. The match is lost when you strike a wrong goal, get two yellow cards, or strike the ball more than 9 times(tournament mode only).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/strike-the-goal-score-goals"}
