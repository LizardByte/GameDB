Lara's quest is to find Excalibur, King Arthur's famous sword which has been shattered into three pieces. The first shard is believed to be in the possession of a Japanese relic collector named Takamoto so Lara goes to Tokyo in an attempt to get the shard. The problem however is that Takamoto is a boss of the Yakuza who likely won't give it away freely.", "summary": "The J2ME version of Tomb Raider: Legend takes place in Tokyo, which was the third location of the original game. The game is a side-scrolling platformer with polygonal 3D graphics. Most of the gameplay involves running left and right, jumping between platforms and shooting the various Yakuza members that stand in Lara's way. Obstacles such as electric cables and laser defense systems have to be avoided either by jumping over or rolling under. Sometimes Lara has to swing around poles or use her grappling hook to reach far off platforms. The grappling hook can also be used to swing into and knock out enemies. The gunfights are quite simple and only Lara's regular handgun can be used. Bullets can be dodged by crouching but the enemies can do the same.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-legend-tokyo", "videos": [{"id": 53556, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "OrNxuO467Ik", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrNxuO467Ik", "title": "Lara Croft - Tomb  Raider Legend Tokyo GSM Java Mobile Phone Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OrNxuO467Ik/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
