Racing another aspirant was the only way for their own wish to come true. The fastest one at descending the Tower would be the winner. Super Tower Rush intends to bring old values back, such as shared gaming experience face to face, even from the same keyboard, although it includes a system to play online with the community and a single player mode to train and unlock game modes too."}
