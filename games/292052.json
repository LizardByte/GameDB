Take back the castle that was stolen in the brain battle! An action puzzle game with the princess of the devil castle \"Mefi\" as the main character.\n\nThe stage of the story is after the ending of a role-playing game...\n\nMefi, the last boss, was defeated by a hero party with an average level of 50 and was kicked out of the devil's castle. Mefi, who has lost her magical power, summons her wisdom, traps humans, and aims for revenge with the hero!\n\nWill Mefi be able to regain the demon castle stolen by the brave!?\n\nLet's use the tricks in the stage well! The inside of the magic castle starts from the castle gate and is divided into sections such as the armory and the magic laboratory. Mefi, who can't use magic, aims to clear it by carrying a wooden box to make a scaffold, and using gimmicks placed in the stage such as Tsurugiyama and punching gloves.\n\nPay attention to the event scene full of stories! The event scene inserted before the middle boss war is full of gags and stories based on the promise of the role-playing game!\n\nIf you like games, please enjoy the unique dialogue between Mefi and the heroes, which will make you grin involuntarily.\n\nLet's complete the \"Portrait of the Demon Tribe\"! If you get orbs or treasure chests that appear on a specific stage, you can regain the demon friends captured by the hero and the stolen treasure, and the title screen will change more and more.\n\nAt first, it's a lonely portrait of only Mefi, but let's proceed with the game and make it more and more lively!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/majoukko-princess-mefis-great-strategy-for-recapturing-the-castle"}
