After exploring the rooms, he discovers that the house belongs to a scientist named Frankenstein and that Janet was dismembered and used as the latest experiment. Her body parts are still alive but scattered through various locations in the manor grounds. Brad must reassemble his bride and seek revenge against the mad scientist.", "summary": "Frankenstein: The Dismembered Bride is a hidden object game loosely based on the 1818 novel by Mary Shelley and other derivative works. Most of the time, the player has to explore the mansion of Frankenstein, where every room is represented by a static screen. The main objective of each location is to find all the objects listed at the bottom of the screen, and afterward collect one of Janet's body parts. In later stages, the player has to pick up machine parts instead of the bride's pieces. Janet and the machine are gradually assembled on two separate tabs at the left side of the screen showing the game progress. The hint button highlights the position of one of the required items and is unlimited, but takes some time to recharge after use.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frankenstein-the-dismembered-bride"}
