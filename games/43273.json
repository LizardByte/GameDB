Players can build the coaster of their dreams, and then ride it from a first-person perspective. From that same perspective, you can explore eight environments across four different themes (Lost World, Halloween World, SpaceZone, and Wonder Land), and uncover several hidden mini-games to accompany Theme Park's new physics system and realistic weather effects. As an added bonus, visitors to your creation have brand new features as well: including original skeletal animations and facial expressions that convey their moods. There's even a redesigned interface that was specifically developed for the Dual Shock 2 controller, and an interactive help system to get you well on your way towards building the park you always wanted.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/theme-park-roller-coaster", "videos": [{"id": 100874, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ElwgeCh3fE0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElwgeCh3fE0", "title": "Theme Park World | Theme Park Roller Coaster - PlayStation 2 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ElwgeCh3fE0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
