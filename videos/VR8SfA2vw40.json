Retro Gaming.\n\nThis is not a review, walkthrough, playthrough, or demonstration of my playing ability. \nIt's more a case of me speaking my thoughts while playing the games, many for the first time, and most for the first time in a very long time... so it's all a little spontaneous and random.\nPredictably, as I never practice before recording, I usually play very badly.\n\nGiven that I am playing many of these games for the first time, and everything I say is completely off the cuff, you probably shouldn't take what I say overly seriously. The opinions that I express are my feelings at the time, but it's entirely possible that they would be different if I were to take the time to get to grips with the game.\nHowever, given that these videos are intended to show that \"first time experience\", I believe they have some validity or merit.\nIf you'd like to know more about why I make my videos the way that I do, it's all explained in this video \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pgMj-rXxXQ\n\nCheck out my YouTube Retro Gaming Community Directory to find hundreds of other retro gaming channels at \nhttp://www.retrogamingcollector.com/Retro-Gaming-Collectors/Collectors.html\n\nIf you're interested in seeing my non-gaming related videos, you may like to check out my other channel, BenwaysWorld\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/BenwaysWorld\n\nMy politically incorrect, satirical comedy channel is at\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/IsambardMontague\n\nI am now on twitter\nhttp://twitter.com/SteveBenway\n\non facebook at\nhttp://www.facebook.com/RetroGamingCollector\n\nand on google+ at\nhttps://plus.google.com/116785596533571543436/posts", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VR8SfA2vw40/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VR8SfA2vw40/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VR8SfA2vw40/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VR8SfA2vw40/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VR8SfA2vw40/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Tank / Plane Battle on Radofin 1392.
