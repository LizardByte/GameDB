Meltdown levels and a more recent release Metropolitan Mayhem yet with a twist of my own style and challenging fights of my own map \"Slaughterfest\".\nBasically it's a huge battle from the very beginning till the very end if played on the intended difficulty setting. What makes it a bit different from the rest is the fact that every single map of this episode was made less then in 20 hours each.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/death-drive--1"}
