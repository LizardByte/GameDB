This is achieved by aligning three or more of the same colour, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. \n \nOnce a sphere has completed its drop into the playfield - and providing it's not blocked in by another sphere - it can be highlighted and dragged to another position. \n \nAs with several other Playmark games, Big Twin is of an adult nature and as the player removes the spheres, a picture of a naked woman is gradually revealed. The game ends if the stacked spheres reach the top of the playfield.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
