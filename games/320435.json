At first glance, \"Circle\" may seem straightforward, but the challenge quickly escalates, drawing you into a thrilling loop of action, suspense, and quick decision-making. The primary objective is clear: collect as many points as possible to achieve the highest score, all while dodging the ever-present and multiplying threats of black dots that are relentlessly poised to end your run.\n\nIn \"Circle,\" you take control of a small, vividly colored sphere that glides smoothly around the perimeter of a circle, responding instantly to your commands. The arena's clean, minimalist design emphasizes fluidity and sharp focus, immersing you fully in the task at hand. Points, represented by glowing orbs, appear randomly within the circular arena, waiting to be collected by your agile sphere. Each successful collection adds to your score, pushing you further into the game\u2019s escalating difficulty. What starts as a leisurely pursuit of points soon transforms into a frantic dash as the black dots, your primary antagonists, begin to multiply.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/circle--3"}
