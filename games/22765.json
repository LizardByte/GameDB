At the top of the screen is a bird which is throwing eggs at you! You need to catch them in your hat before they hit the bottom of the screen. If you miss any eggs, they will break and yolk starts collecting at the bottom of the screen. Miss too many, and the game will be over. At the end of each round you will be given an opportunity to earn bonus points; you now get to throw all of the eggs you caught back at the bird! As the levels progress, the games speed will increase. There are two difficulty levels available, in the easier variation you get a larger hat to catch the eggs with.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eggomania"}
