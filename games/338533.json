One embraces the precision of technology; the other channels the raw power of magic. Both seek dominance over a world that can no longer sustain their endless war.\n\nLead your faction's elite forces in tactical combat across diverse realms. Each territory offers unique strategic advantages and challenges, from the open Plains of Sun to future biomes with their own distinct environments.\n\nBut beware\u2014you are not alone in these contested lands. Ancient guardians like Rezna the Dragon and the Primal Beasts protect their domains with terrible power, caring nothing for your faction's grand ideologies.\n\nIn Ascending Realms, victory is not measured in a single battle but in a war of ideologies that has spanned generations. Will you bring glory to the wolf or the eagle? Will you forge the future with steel or bend reality with spells?\n\nThe realms await your command.", "summary": "A medieval fantasy real-time strategy game with fast-paced autobattler combat where you command forces across contested realms in the war between the technological Ironclad Pack and magical Arcane Talon.
