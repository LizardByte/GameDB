{"id": "1nG8_uZoK7g", "snippet": {"title": "Griefhelm - Official Trailer", "description": "Griefhelm is a Nidhogg inspired dueling game with a combat system similar to Mount & Blade's, which allows you to attack and parry from three different directions.\n\nPlayable in single player against AI or with up to 4 players in multiplayer, Griefhelm takes Nidhogg\u2019s tug-of-war duelling and adds a more realistic melee-focused combat system. You can perform three different types of attack by holding a direction on the right control stick and pressing the attack button. Holding up while attacking will cause you to do an overhead slash, holding forward will do a mid slash and holding down will do a thrusting attack. Likewise, you can defend against these attacks by holding your sword in the corresponding position using the right analogue stick.\n\nThe main game mode in is Tug-of-War, which plays similarly to Nidhogg, but in one large rolling level rather than being split up into stages. You face off against each other and each time you slay your opponent you\u2019re able to travel towards their side of the level, with you winning by reaching the far side of the level. There\u2019s also a Skirmish mode which sees you fighting to the death, with each player able to take three hits before losing.\n\nGriefhelm is still very early in development and is far from feature complete, but the visual design is excellent and the core gameplay is already great fun. The combat feels nice and weighty, with each encounter being a tactical fight to the death where timing is everything \u2013 if you miss an attack you may not live to regret it!\n\n- KJ Robertson\u200b, Alpha Beta Gamer\u200b", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1nG8_uZoK7g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1nG8_uZoK7g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1nG8_uZoK7g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1nG8_uZoK7g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1nG8_uZoK7g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Griefhelm - Official Trailer", "description": "Griefhelm is a Nidhogg inspired dueling game with a combat system similar to Mount & Blade's, which allows you to attack and parry from three different directions.\n\nPlayable in single player against AI or with up to 4 players in multiplayer, Griefhelm takes Nidhogg\u2019s tug-of-war duelling and adds a more realistic melee-focused combat system.
