Keen has been snatched by an Abduct-o-Beam of the organization known as McZargalds, MZ for short, which is led by the Mad Butcher, serves tenderized children and has lax hygiene standards. Not only that, the food on Grund-Bief is so putrid that it has gained sentience.\n\nThe protagonist is initially unarmed, but soon finds a weapon called Ultra-Spicy Arcturian Megameatballs that allows him to reduce enemies to piles of ashes. However, to defeat the Mad Butcher, he has to obtain an even more powerful weapon, namely thousand-year old Bloog Eggs. Keen must explore Grund-Bief to find the necessary Bloog Eggs so that he can confront the Mad Butcher and rewire the Abduct-O-Beam to save the Earth once again.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/commander-keen-keen-meets-the-meats"}
