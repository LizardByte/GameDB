When the player walks over a question mark, a baby turtle crawls onto the main turtle's back, a house will appear at a random location on the map, and the player will have to bring the baby turtle to its house while avoiding beetles. Other times, however, beetles will come out of the boxes, which the player will have to quickly run away from.\n\nThe player's only offensive move is the ability to drop bombs (which behave more like mines) to temporarily stun the beetles. Additional bombs can be picked up in the middle of the maze. Each maze represents a floor of the building. After eight floors, there's a cutscene showing the baby turtles following their rescuer out of the building, and gameplay begins again on the ground floor.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/turtles", "videos": [{"id": 77032, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "oAqux065vAU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAqux065vAU", "title": "Tartarugas! para Odyssey da Philips  -  Turtles! for Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 / Philips Videopac G7000", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oAqux065vAU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 104481, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HEvyYhCn6g0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEvyYhCn6g0", "title": "Arcade Longplay - Turtles [1981} Konami", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HEvyYhCn6g0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
