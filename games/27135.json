I am considering adding choices in any future chapters/stand-alone novels.)   \n   \nAfter waking up in a forest, meet Charlotte, the smack-talking, amnesic dragon girl who travels with her friends on a quest to regain her memories... Who is she and where did she really come from? The journey won't be easy, as she will have to conquer many obstacles and find out the hidden truths about the world she travels through, the friends she makes, the reigning monarchs, and the deities that are worshiped...   \n   \nThis is the first of many humorous and drama-filled chapters to come.   \n   \nPress the \"A\" key to Auto play the text.   \n   \nThis game is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, in window mode and full screen mode.   \n   \nSorry, Windows only. Unless you can find a way to play .exe files on something else.   \n   \nAlso, be careful, as the game can crash when you close it, as Visual Novelty, the program I used to create this game, is still in its Beta stages. Be sure to save often, just in case. This is the main reason I place this game under \"Unstable\"   \n   \nCredits   \n   \nOriginal Story and Character Art by me, Kassidie Butler (Viridea) 2015   \n   \nMusic by Audionautix and AngelHeights   \n   \nSFX by Freesound.org   \n   \nBackgrounds from Pixabay   \n   \nBackgrounds edited with FotoSketcher   \n   \nand Adobe Photoshop CC 2015   \n   \nThank you very much, and I hope you enjoy the game!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/viridescent-dragon-chapter-1", "videos": [{"id": 12075, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "R1m9yKgeuVI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1m9yKgeuVI", "title": "Viridescent Dragon: Chapter 1 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R1m9yKgeuVI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
