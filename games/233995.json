The players take orders from the waiters and ingredients from the supply. They put them all together on the dish. When all the ingredients are used up, the players discover which burgers were maked properly, and which were not. The players take back their orders for their improperly maked burgers so they can try again in the next round. After three rounds, the player who has delivered the most burgers is the best burger maker and the winner!"}
