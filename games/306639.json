The player can also perform sabotage on the other players.", "summary": "In 2001, two years after its German release (and three years after the series' inception), Airline Tycoon First Class was the first installment to be released in English by Monte Cristo. As it was the first game in the series to be released in the United States and the United Kingdom, the publisher decided to remove First Class subtitle from the game box and manuals, though it remained in-game. Features added in First Class include ten brand new missions, multiplayer mode with up to 4 players, new MIDI music, cargo transportation and more.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/airplane-tycoon-first-class", "collections": [{"id": 5008, "name": "Airport Tycoon"}]}
