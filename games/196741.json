Humans and Yason are similar in appearance, but Yason have lighter skin and differently shaped ears. The protagonist of the game, Calintz, is a high-ranking leader of the Tears of Blood, a mercenary squad hired out by the Human Alliance to deal with problems they cannot, or will not, touch. Since the group is not part of the official army, the mercs are disliked by the Alliance soldiers. The core group also consists of Azel, a youthful sword wielder who looks up to Calintz, Eonis, a powerful mage, and Haren, a martial artist. Save for Azel, all group members have a heavy grudge against the Yason for the deaths of friends and family. The Blast Worms, highly skilled Yason soldiers, are led by the Four Warriors, an elite group who wields great power and magic.", "summary": "This is a handheld port of the Playstation 2 game named Magna Carta: Tears of Blood. However unlike it's PS2 main version, this PSP port was only released in Japan.\n\nMagna Carta: Tears of Blood is a Korean-made RPG in Japanese style, and a sequel to Phantom of Avalanche; it is set in the same world and has the same protagonist. The game's combat system is turn-based at core, but requires the player to press buttons in a rapid succession and with precise timing to execute attacks. The characters can store up energy to unleash a stronger attack later. Using the technique named Carta, they can also perform various special moves which are based on elemental affinities.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magna-carta-portable", "videos": [{"id": 66466, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "W9DtW5S1HUQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9DtW5S1HUQ", "title": "Magna Carta Portable Sony PSP Trailer - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W9DtW5S1HUQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
