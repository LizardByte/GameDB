Its goal is to transform Skyrim into the ultimate fantasy life simulator by combining the excellent mods of the Skyrim modding community with proprietary features found only in Ultimate Skyrim. \n \nUltSky is intended for players who enjoy dynamic fantasy worlds with deep mechanics and systems. Every part of the game has been rebuilt, including combat, progression, AI, factions, the economy, the visuals, and more. The result is a deeply simulated roleplaying experience unlike any other."}
