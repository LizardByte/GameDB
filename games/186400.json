This version has the player control Leon by positioning him in the direction he needs to go and by having him move forward whilst engaging zombies. Leon can only be moved over three horizontal planes as in a 2D game with a side view, but with a pseudo 3D effect. Each non-scrolling location holds different zombies and once they are dead Leon moves to a new screen. He has access to an inventory to cycle between weapons. There is support for options such as touchscreen inventory menus, in addition to the game keeping track of the time the player has spent with the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-2--2"}
