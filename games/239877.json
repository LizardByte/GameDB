You feel like you spend every day running from something. Whether its your past, your responsibility, or even yourself... but you can never quite escape.\n\nThat's why, when you catch an adventurer wandering the upper layers of your home, you decide to accompany her descent. She needs safe passage, and you'll never learn the truth of the world around you by moping alone.\n\nThe journey doesn't scare you. You don't fear the depths. You're only scared of what they might bring up from within you.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-prince-is-dead"}
