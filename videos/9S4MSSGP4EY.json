{"id": "9S4MSSGP4EY", "snippet": {"title": "Valis: The Fantasm Soldier (PC-8801) longplay", "description": "\"Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\" is a horizontal scroll action game released in Japan in 1986. The origin was produced as a Japanese PC game, and the compatible models were PC-8801, MSX, X1. It is later ported to various game consoles. Outside Japan, the GENESIS version has been released in North America, and the popularity of the GENESIS version may be high, but the game characteristics differ greatly depending on the model, and I want people to know the PC-8801 version as the origin , Created this video for such purpose.\n\nSome people in Europe and South America have played this game on MSX, but the MSX version is a simplified version of the PC-8801 version, with all visual scenes cut and half the number of stages. The graphic drawing has also been simplified. I would like you not to count the MSX version as one of the origin.\n\nI think that it is the PC engine SUPER CD-ROM\u00b2 version that is the highest rating in the later ported version. It has not been released outside Japan, but it may be well known among Valis fans overseas. This edition is highly complete and very playable.\n\nA FAMICOM (NES) version is also available, but it is said that this is a shit video game (we call it a kusoge).\n\nThe PC-8801 version played with this video is one of the most difficult action games. However, it is not a highly complete action that you can get through with advanced techniques, but it's a messy game where you can push down with power. It is likely that the anger will explode due to stress buildup without being able to operate the character (Yuko) according to one's own desire by the onslaught of the raining and falling enemies. In that sense, it is a cruel content that can not be ignored even if it is also evaluated as a kusoge.\n\nIt's not a fun game, but it's exquisitely addictive, and many players prefer to play silently without thinking. It may be said that it is a game that has a mysterious attraction that can be understood by players who have actually played it.\n\nYou can still play the PC-8801 version sold on the site called Project EGG. If you are a Valis fan, please try it once.\n\n\u5922\u5e7b\u6226\u58eb\u30f4\u30a1\u30ea\u30b9 for PC-8801 (Project EGG)\nhttps://www.amusement-center.com/project/egg/cgi/ecatalog-detail.cgi?contcode=7&product_id=1249\n\nThe Fantasm Soldier Valis (MSX) play-through\nhttps://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm34988455", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9S4MSSGP4EY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9S4MSSGP4EY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9S4MSSGP4EY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9S4MSSGP4EY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9S4MSSGP4EY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Valis: The Fantasm Soldier (PC-8801) longplay", "description": "\"Valis: The Fantasm Soldier\" is a horizontal scroll action game released in Japan in 1986.
