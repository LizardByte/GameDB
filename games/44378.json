The four characters can be controlled by one player as a party, or by up to four players, each choosing an action during battles. \n \nThere are four different character classes available: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Hero. The latter can be selected only if he is the only character in the party. Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. Various treasure is scattered around the dungeon; the player also has the option of buying certain equipment.
