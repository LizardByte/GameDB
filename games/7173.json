The gameplay of Samurai Warriors 2 builds on the first Samurai Warriors by adding new characters and new features, such as the removal of the traditional range attacks in favor of the addition of two unique special abilities that differ from character to character. A returning element from the original Samurai Warriors is the Survival Mode. In this mode, the player chooses a character and fights through an endless castle. The game also contains a Sugoroku mini-game as an additional feature. Up to four players can participate in this mode, and each player has to choose a character. The game's goal is to collect the requested amount of gold (depending on the player's settings).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 34002, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "e4Sni7Az0i8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Sni7Az0i8", "title": "\uff3b\uff30\uff33\uff12\uff3d\u6226\u56fd\u7121\u53cc\uff12\uff3b\uff2f\uff30\uff3d", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e4Sni7Az0i8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
