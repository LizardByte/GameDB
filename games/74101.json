Players can choose to be Mickey or Minnie Mouse and many Disney characters make an appearance, such as Goofy, Donald and Daisy Duck, Pluto and Ludwig von Drake. The game is entirely mouse-controlled and the cursor changes when an object can be interacted with. It can either be used or picked up to be stored in an inventory, shown as Mickey's hat at the bottom of the screen. Puzzles are solved by talking to other characters or through items. All visited locations are added to map to move around town.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disneys-mickey-saves-the-day-3d-adventure"}
