Gunship Elite - Sega Dreamcast - Opening Intro and mission 1 & 2 gameplay [HD 1080p 60fps]", "description": "Another exclusive US release on the Dreamcast, Bang! Gunship Elite is a port of the PC version of the game. Bang! Gunship Elite is a space flight simulator that plays a lot more like an arcade game than other titles in the genre. It's fast pace and action packed and right from the beginning you are thrown into combat, while enjoyable it's not as good, as the Dreamcast port of Starlancer.  Bang! Gunship Elite also suffers from being badly optimised for the Dreamcast with pretty grim loading times due to the game data not being set up correctly on the disc. As a result it stresses out the Dreamcast quite badly when loading, causing it to make a lot of noise in the progress. So much so that a true video of Bang! Gunship Elite needs to include all the added DC loading sound effects, maybe will mic it up one day. To ensure this video remains true to the Dreamcast port Randomised Gaming has left all the loading intact for this video. The opening intro is rather long and slow as a result. Due to the long loading times of the Bang! Gunship Elite mission gameplay doesn't start till 09:45.\n\n\u30d0\u30f3\uff01\u30ac\u30f3\u30b7\u30c3\u30d7\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u305f\n\nRelease: 2000\nDeveloper: Rayland Interactive\nPublisher: Red Storm Entertainment (Distributed by Ubisoft)\nFormat: Sega Dreamcast (DC) / \u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\n\n Bang!
