You navigate your hero by choosing a location from a menu. Once in dungeons, you have a separate menu whenever you encounter enemies. You fight them in turn-based combat, attacking physically or casting magic. The game is more close to Western RPG style than to Japanese one, and utilizes AD&D terminology for character stats.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arcus", "videos": [{"id": 133189, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "m5jKSt8Dxos"}], "collections": [{"id": 4674, "name": "Arcus"}]}
