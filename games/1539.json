Like in previous installments players control highspeed hovercrafts, pick up weapons to damage the opponents' vehicles and try to finish the race in the first position. In many aspects, the gameplay is pretty similar to its predecessor, such as selection of hovercrafts, visuals or the handling system. Beside new racing tracks the main differences include a Split-Screen Multiplayer Mode (up to four players), Weapon & Super Combo Challenges as well as various Special Weapons for each Team!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wipeout-64", "collections": [{"id": 241, "name": "Wipeout"}]}
