They have strange creatures called \"Flubbies\" on them. Play the cards to create a Flubby.\n\nLikewise, the Flubby starts with nothing - it can't swim very well, has no mouth, no shell, no Flubby-Friends. With more cards you can change that! Grow your Flubbies to their full potential and create your Flubby Farm!\n\nBeware though, as you are not alone with your Flubbies... A rivaling swarm of aggressive Gronkas is already on their way! How long can you maintain your Flubby Farm against the ever-growing Gronka group?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flubby-farm", "videos": [{"id": 95652, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "adwb6bBTiLU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adwb6bBTiLU", "title": "Ludum Dare 45 | FLUBBY FARM", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/adwb6bBTiLU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
