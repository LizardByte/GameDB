In the race, be sure to choose the best tyre and pit stop strategy, to win some places in the grid. \n \nThe game has several playable seasons: the 1976 F1 season, with Lauda and Hunt competing; the 1991 F1 Season, with Ayrton, Piquet, Mansell and Prost in the grid; and the 2000 F1 Season, with Michael Schumacher being the one to beat. \n \nThe game has an in-built Hall of Fame, to which the drivers may be inducted into, if they win titles and races enough. \n \nThere are also 10 Achievements to be unlocked, throughout the seasons. Some of them are really hard to unlock (like winning the Drivers Championship with Rubens Barrichello), which makes this game really challenging.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cockpit-manager-14"}
