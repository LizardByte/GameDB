It features faithful 3D recreations of two pachinko machines made by Sanyo Bussan: CR Super Umi Monogatari M55W and CR Super Umi Monogatari M55X. There are two modes available: Ts\u016bj\u014d (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pachipara-13-super-umi-to-pachipro-fuuunroku"}
