With a complete visual overhaul, on top of adding back in unused content, new secrets, new features, attention to detail changes and more, all designed to be canon-compliant, there's plenty to revisit and do. Being based on the Nintendo Switch version, this mod also adds in the exclusive content from there, such as Mad Mew Mew, borders, and all that! Experience a new take on the beloved 6 year old game with one of the most ambitious Undertale\u2122 mods out there, and we hope you stay tuned for more updates!\n\nOur Socials:\nGameJolt - https://gamejolt.com/games/UndertaleBnP/574044\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BlaizeMayes\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/33MFaRduCb\nSoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/undertale-bnp\nReddit - https://www.reddit.com/user/BlaizedotMayes/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSg55Ibtm6M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSg55Ibtm6M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSg55Ibtm6M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSg55Ibtm6M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSg55Ibtm6M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "UNDERTALE: Bits and Pieces Mod - UnderEvent 2021 Trailer", "description": "Here's our video segment from \"UnderEvent,\" , a Nintendo Direct styled presentation featuring UNDERTALE fan games and other projects, meant to celebrate the creative talents of this community!
