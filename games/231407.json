Two extra stages and an ending sequence were also added for the US version as the original Japanese one started over after the eighth one, along with several new powerups (including Slimer, although he is only referred to as \"Green Ghost\") and ghosts that appear after the unnamed enemies are killed (which can be beamed up, and put into \"Ghost Storage\" at the end of a stage); beaming up 100 ghosts is worth an extra life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/meikyuu-hunter-g"}
