Additionally, due to Phil Snyder's retirement, Joe Ochman had to replace him as the voice of Jiminy Cricket, which included providing new dialogue for some of the new cutscenes, and redubbing all of Snyder's previous recordings.\n\nKingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance\n- This titles is experiences as a collection of cutscenes accessed through credits menus.", "summary": "Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix is an HD remastered compilation of KKingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix.
