Attacks will only hit their targets if they are positioned at roughly the same 3D depth.. meaning if you see a bad guy in the distant background, you won't be able to hit him (or vice versa) unless you move up close!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/superguy-and-megaboy", "videos": [{"id": 126055, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xnqIS8MRjpM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnqIS8MRjpM", "title": "Superguy and Megaboy | Demo Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xnqIS8MRjpM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
