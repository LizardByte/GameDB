Expect lots of environments to explore, enemies to defeat, weapons and items and magic to wield, and puzzles to solve!\n\nEtad is an arcade adventure/exploration game crafted around the limitations of the Playdate. You won't get bothered with stats, inventory tetris or party management; instead expect pick-up-and-play hack'n'slash dungeon crawling with light puzzles and combat.\n\nEvery dungeon in Legend of Etad is unique and hand-crafted, with distinct art and game mechanics, and are linked together by outdoor \"hub\" areas. Each new area you discover will feel different from the last.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legend-of-etad"}
