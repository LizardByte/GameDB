During the search, Oracle confides in Robin that she\u2019s worried about Bruce, who hasn\u2019t been the same since the Arkham City incident and refuses to talk about Talia or Joker. Eventually Robin discovers Batman's Utility Belt, discarded. The story rewinds to two days earlier, where Batman learns from Gordon that Harley has taken several officers hostage. Before Batman leaves, Gordon warns him that Harley still blames him for Joker\u2019s death, and that it could be a trap. Batman rescues one cop from the Steel Mill, who tells him that the others were dragged elsewhere. After attaining location and access codes to Harley\u2019s secret base, Batman infiltrates the shipping yard and attempts to rescue another cop, but is rendered unconscious when Harley attempts to shoot the officer, which Batman intercepts. One of Harley\u2019s thugs removes Batman\u2019s belt, only to drop it when the belt\u2019s countermeasures electrocute him, leaving it for Robin to find.", "summary": "Batman is lured back into Arkham City by its last remaining super-criminal; Harley Quinn.
