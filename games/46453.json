Besides the usual round courses the game also features off-road races in open terrain where the player has to orientate himself and challenges where every irregularity, e.g. knocking down the course boundaries or breaking for too long, results in a loss of points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/4x4-hummer"}
