INFINITE charts have a rainbow hue. \nPERFECT ULTIMATE CHAIN (getting 100% CRITICALs) has been renamed \"PERFECT\". \nSimilar to its beatmania IIDX counterpart, the \"green number\" (BPM x HI-SPEED value) feature has been added. \nFailing songs with charts that have a difficulty rating of 7 or lower will not end your game session prematurely. \nCharts rated Level 16 have been introduced. \nSongs are divided into eight categories: \nALL (unsorted). \nBEMANI (all remixed and original BEMANI songs). \nEXIT TUNES (EXIT TUNES licenses). \n\u30dc\u30fc\u30ab\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9\u2122 (all VOCALOID songs). \nFLOOR (original FLOOR contest songs). \nSDVX\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb (original SOUND VOLTEX songs). \n\u6771\u65b9\u30a2\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8 (Touhou Project licenses and remixes). \nBLASTER (related to INFINITE BLASTER).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sound-voltex-ii-infinite-infection"}
