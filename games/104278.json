The game tells the story of a caravan of outcasts led by the player, involved in a dangerous travel across the country: from Rome to Venice, passing through Florence. Gamblers, prostitutes, murderers, thieves: though moral choices and crimes set the tone for this story-driven gem. A creepy atmosphere envelops the journey: will you protect your people or will you pursue your own fortune? Experience the nomadic life of a caravan leader, rejected by everybody without a reason, chased by justice and hunted by unknown enemies!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/midnight-caravan"}
