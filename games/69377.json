After Seth's escape, the S.I.N. corporation began another fighting tournament in order to draw out the most powerful fighters on Earth to complete the BLECE project. Each character has their own reasons for entering this tournament, but S.I.N.'s real desire is to lure Ryu to them in order to analyze the Satsui no Hado, believed to be the last piece of data needed to complete BLECE.\n\nThe tournament is publicly organized by S.I.N., apparently using preliminary matches and a point system to determine who is allowed to enter (as shown by the conversation between Seth and his lackey about how Dan Hibiki was able to \"squeak by with just enough points to qualify\"). It can be assumed that the only participants in the tournament are the playable characters in SFIV not including Seth.", "summary": "On October 12, 2011, Enterrise released a pachislot version of the game in Japan. This version features all of the characters from the console release. The player plays as Ryu in the game's story, although other characters such as Ken or Chun-Li can only be played at certain points in the game. New to this version are 3D overworld segments where Ryu travels through some of the game's stages and destinations. The battle segments also return in this version, but unlike the arcade and console versions, the pachislot version's battle segments are now turn-based (similar to Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, its sequel and Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution). The Reg Bonus in this game features a new door-opening bonus stage that didn't make it into the arcade and console versions of Street Fighter IV and its updated versions. A sequel based on SSFIV: Arcade Edition was released on March 22, 2016.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-street-fighter-iv-pachislot-edition", "videos": [{"id": 39889, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hpuyDk27Vyw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpuyDk27Vyw", "title": "SUPER STREET FIGHTER 4 PACHI SLOT EDITION application play.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hpuyDk27Vyw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
