Little Fighter 2 was created by Marti Wong and Starsky Wong in 1999, and released in a long series of updates.\nThe game supports up to 4 human players on one computer and a total of 8 characters using online play or computer-controlled opponents. Characters are controlled using the keyboard or a gamepad. All keys can be set via a configuration menu.\nThe game has a commercially released sequel, Little Fighter Online. In 2009, in celebration of Little Fighter 2's tenth anniversary, version 2.0 was released. The update fixed minor bugs and added a gameplay recording feature, a new stage called 'Survival', a browser toolbar that is not mentioned in the installation process and obstructive ads being displayed while the game is being loaded. Version 2.0a was released in late 2009, with only a bug fix.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/little-fighter-2", "collections": [{"id": 1172, "name": "Little Fighter"}]}
