Stylistically, the game is influenced by Super Sprint. \n \nThere are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on temporary handling and power upgrades, plus armour plating and front/rear shooting missiles that can knock out other racers. The player must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game. \n \nThe car can be upgraded throughout the game via the shop section. The player is given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman - with the right combination, the price will drop.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-cars"}
