Its leader, King Rowan, seeks a way to bring an end to the war and claim victory for the Empire.\n\nIn the remote village of Ashvale, a young fox boy named Leigh finds his home in flames - attacked by a man bearing the sigil of the Empire he lives under. On the run, he meets and befriends Pierce (a stoic wanderer from the Republic) and Miah (a cheerful yet mysterious magician), and learns about his destiny as the last remaining Celestial - those who are descended from both the mortal Gaians and the ancient Divines.\n\nThe ragtag group set off on a quest to help Leigh gather his powers as a Celestial and confront the King who relentlessly pursues him. Along the way they will learn to overcome each of their inner struggles, uncover the truth behind the King's plans, and will reveal secrets that could change their lives forever.", "summary": "A young boy is forced to embark on a quest to master the powers of the Divines,", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/foxblade-fable"}
