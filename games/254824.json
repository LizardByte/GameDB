In each one, your goal is the same: to create a path to the goal for all of the Mokis using only the bombs you're given. Given their round shape Mokis can roll quite well, but for everything else you'll need to choose the right tool to help them. Place the bombs wherever you like and set their timers to try to create just the right chain reaction to solve the puzzle. Head into the Create mode and build your own elaborate designs for others to challenge. It's a blast!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iblast-moki-2", "videos": [{"id": 92696, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "Jsqbl-RNq00"}]}
