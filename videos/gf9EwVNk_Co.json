Just not as good as the first game ported to the Game Boy. Enemies are more difficult in this one. The storyline is not related to the Arcade or NES versions of Double Dragon II. As a result, this one does not feel like a Double Dragon game at all. Feels more like Kunio-kun beat em up series where it plays more like Renegade arcade game, which was released before the first Double Dragon game came out. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gf9EwVNk_Co/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gf9EwVNk_Co/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gf9EwVNk_Co/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [075] Double Dragon II", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: georgc3\n\nOf all the 3 Double Dragon games ported to the Game Boy, this one is okay.
