It's a one on one game where the player controls a tank and has to defeat an AI controlled tank. Movement is possible in four directions and the tank will move forward until direction is changed. On the screen are trees, mines and a lake that act as obstacles in different ways. Trees stop the tank and can not be fired through while lakes only stops the tank but can still be fired over. Mines will blow up the tank if moved over. The player has five tanks and when they have all been destroyed the game ends.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tank-wars--1"}
