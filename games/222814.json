Developed in conjunction with Robert Redford's Sundance Institute, Imagynasium lets kids flex their creative muscles. In The Curio Shop, they'll learn the secrets of storytelling. In Downtown, they'll discover the art of collage and create their own artistic designs. In Jingle Jungle, they'll learn to create beautiful music. Zany characters like Monda, Frida and Riff will guide them through the three unique worlds. And of course if your child gets stuck, there's always Spike, the tech guy, ready to lend a hand. Cool tools help kids create projects, store their creative ideas, and keep track of their progress. Plus, each area has a hidden surprise that puts their new skills to the test.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/imagynasium"}
