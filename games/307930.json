These creatures are those whose very nature is violence, conflict, destruction, and they inherently reject lasting peace.\n\nKarzer's largest continent is Kigan, and its humans and other-race have fought each other for territories for eons until they united against the greatest threat of all, the Demon-Eternal. After its defeat, the Triangulum, the age of the three kingdoms, dawned, but the disaster never fully ended - for a prophecy foretold that the Demoncaster would rise again.\nToday, in the Age of Triangulum, the two kingdoms - the Kingdom of Selakim, and the Kingdom of Quila - are in tension with each other, but on the whole rule Kigan in prosperity and wealth. However, on the borders, orcs are making increasingly bold attacks on caravans and villages, and other monsters are rearing their heads. The attacks are organized and purposeful, as if someone or something is controlling the beasts. Perhaps the Demon Reaper has returned? Or is someone else trying to get at Kigan again? Join one of the two realms, join the army against the Orcs and be the one to shed light on the sinister mysteries.", "summary": "A Fantasy MMORPG Game (earlier version is NW2Online).
