With that as your only instructions, you are thrown into a room filled with pterodactyl eggs. The controls are similar to many versions of Robotron, in that you shoot in whichever direction you are walking. The task of destroying the eggs seems easy until they begin to hatch. The new-born pterodactyls are not only lethal, but they lay more eggs, prolonging your misery. The game runs in black and white high resolution mode and uses small characters, only a character tall.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pterodactyl"}
