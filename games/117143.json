Shara does not gain XP nor levels like Mirai does. Instead, you can spend JP to level up your core stats. By doing so, your XP level increases gradually.\nYou can learn new abilities in two ways: first, by opening Pandora\u2019s Boxes. These give you an option of three random skills from the entire pool of regular job abilities, and you can pick one. Second, by resting at Campfires, you will have an option of several random Shara-only abilities, of which you can pick one each time. You'll have to plan and adapt on the fly based on what items and abilities you find.\n\nOverall, Shara\u2019s story provides a fresh new way to play Tangledeep and experience a new story at the same time!", "summary": "Legend of Shara allows you to play as Shara in a new prequel that takes place before the story of Mirai \u2013 Tangledeep's original protagonist.
