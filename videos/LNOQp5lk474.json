Check out this \"Deep Dive\" video featuring the game's creator, Eric Callahan!\n\nWalrus Run is a 2D Action Platformer with a twist...\n\nProgress through 18 levels of platforming action, eating anything that gets in your way! This game is score-based, meaning you get points by moving fast, eating fish, eating enemies, eating... okay, lots of eating.\n\nYou lose points if you take too much time, or take damage. There are no health points, meaning you can make as many mistakes as you want and still complete the level, with a shiny new D Rank. Master the levels to get achieve the even shinier S Rank!\n\nThis game is compatible with conveniently-shaped bongo controllers! When the game starts, you can choose between \"Modern Controls\" and \"Bongo Controls.\" Press and hold a bongo pad button for 3 seconds, and BINGO! You can play the entire game with your bongo controller.\n\nBut of course, if you don't own such a controller released 20 years ago, you can use modern controllers or keyboard + mouse. You can just pretend you're playing on bongos by mashing the buttons to move. (Yes, you can change this in the settings!)\n\nWalrus Run is the first game released by the brand new indie game studio, The Jam. This game was solo-developed by the company's owner, Eric Callahan.
