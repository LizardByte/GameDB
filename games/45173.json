Rather than help, Rowina forbids the sisters from singing and dancing and squelches their individuality. The princesses discover a magical enchanted world and escape the tyranny of Rowena. But when Genevieve learns that their father's life is in danger, the sisters must unite to save the king and their kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-in-the-12-dancing-princesses", "videos": [{"id": 95678, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "a57Yg6sEO-s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a57Yg6sEO-s", "title": "Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses (GBA) full playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a57Yg6sEO-s/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
