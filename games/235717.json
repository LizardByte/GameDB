It can be played locally (hot-seat) or as a play-by-email type setting utilizing save files which can be transferred between remote players.\n\nThe game's files include a word document called 1941Rule.pdf, which contains an exact scan of the rules booklet of the original board game, and this document should be used for all details on rules and features of the actual game. The actual gameplay assumes a certain familiarity with the original game, or at least the rules in the rules document, so this is recommended reading.", "summary": "PC conversion of a turn-based hex-strategy board war game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/1941-operation-barbarossa"}
