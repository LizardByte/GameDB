From Chaos came the \u201cFirst Consciousness\u201d. As chaos and order collided, so too did light and dark. From this, all creation was born.\n\nAs Loki opened the Devil\u2019s gate, the world fell to darkness, igniting a war between the Demons and Aesir. Thus began Ragnarok.\n\nThe war between God and the Devil lasted for ages.\nAs the Demons began losing the war with victory in sight for the Aesir, Freya Goddess of the Valkyries invoked her power and devoured God and the Devil.\n\nVanquished, but not defeated, Loki placed the Curse of Destruction upon the land.\n\u201cI lost, but my descendants will be reborn from the Dimensions of the Abyss and destroy Midgard\u201d.\nOnce Odin discovered Loki\u2019s curse, he delivered the Oracle to protect his beloved land.\nAfter losing the war, the Devil awaits in the depth of the Abyss, longing for revenge, recovering in Niflheim\u2026", "summary": "The legendary MMORPG with signature classes and skills.
