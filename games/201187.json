The TC runs with the outstanding \u201cQuake 2 Stuff\u201d mod that brings all the weapons and enemies straight from the game into GZDoom with total accuracy.\n\nThe music comes from the Quake 2 port of Nintendo 64, composed by Aubrey Hodges.\n\nMy aim is to create a near perfect recreation of a ID Tech 2/Quake 2 level or expansion pack but with the Doom engine, enhanced and made possible only with GZDoom. Despite a few structural features and effects that are only possible on the Quake 2 engine, the results are near identical and that proves again how an ancient engine like Doom is capable to reach a similar level of technical capabilities with ease.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quake-2-tc", "videos": [{"id": 68123, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "N2_WPYLHnUk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2_WPYLHnUk", "title": "Quake 2 TC [Doom Mod]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N2_WPYLHnUk/sddefault.jpg"}]}
