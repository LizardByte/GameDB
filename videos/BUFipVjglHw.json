{"id": "BUFipVjglHw", "snippet": {"title": "The Masters Fighter (PS1) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Cinema Supply's' 1997 2D versus-fighting game for the Sony PlayStation, The Masters Fighter (\u30b6\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc).\n\nPlayed through the story mode with Mr. Death on the default difficulty level. The game has a language select option, so this video is in English despite the game being a Japan-only release. \n\nThe title is not a typo. I don't know what it's supposed to mean either. \n\nThe Masters Fighter is a port (or \"remake,\" so it claims) of an obscure 1995 arcade game named \"Masters Fury\" by the Korean company Unico. It was their second fighting game after the 1994 arcade title \"Dragon Master.\"\n\nThe Masters Fighter is also a prime example of the type of game that the Japanese refer to as \"kusoge\". If you aren't familiar with the term, kusoge is a portmanteau of \"kuso\", meaning 'shit', and \"geemu\", a transliteration of the English word  'game'. \n\nIt's terrible, I assure you, but it is just how terrible this game is that makes it worth checking out. It's difficult to believe that The Masters Fighter was ever a legitimate commercial release. The majority of the character sprites were clearly ripped off from successful SNK and Capcom games - for example, the character I'm playing here - Mr. Death - is a blatant copy of Ryo from Art of Fighting in both looks and moves. You also can play as Not-Guile, Not-Benimaru, Not-Jubei... yeah, you get the idea.\n\nIt looks positively awful, so much that it's actually quite funny. The animation is very rough, and the sprites are extremely pixelated - not just from the lack of detail, but it seems something went terribly wrong in the process of scaling them - uneven pixel sizes and huge blotches make what is an already ugly game one that's truly offensive to look at. The sound isn't much either - some of the music isn't bad, but it doesn't restart at the appropriate time when switching rounds. For whatever reason the jarring transition happens about a second after the match begins, and samples often get cut off or distorted. Somehow, even the most amateurish Mugen games come across as more competent.\n\nThat all might fly if the game play bore even a slight resemblance to the games it rips off, but it doesn't. The collision detection is a mess, the special moves are infuriatingly difficult to pull off, and the CPU AI is cheaper than you'd likely find even in an SNK arcade title. It's broken on all counts. \n\nHowever, The Masters Fighter is so far beyond redemption that it becomes a sheer novelty. It's not fun to play - at all - but it's something that everyone should see. You'll tell yourself it can't possibly be this bad - officially licensed games uphold some baseline level of quality,  don't they? Well, I have to say, the only fighter I've ever played that managed to be worse than The Masters Fighter is the long-forgotten Expect No Mercy, a Mortal Kombat lookalike for Windows 3.1. Seriously. Shaq Fu may as well be Virtua Fighter 4 by comparison. \n\nIt's as hilarious as it is disgustingly poor, and I probably would've snapped liked a postal worker if I had paid full price this swill back in 1997. Total turd sandwich.\n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/es/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BUFipVjglHw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BUFipVjglHw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BUFipVjglHw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BUFipVjglHw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BUFipVjglHw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Masters Fighter (PS1) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Cinema Supply's' 1997 2D versus-fighting game for the Sony PlayStation, The Masters Fighter (\u30b6\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc).\n\nPlayed through the story mode with Mr. Death on the default difficulty level.
