In the meantime the player must avoid enemies who try to capture them. Starting the game, the player has 5 lives and 3 freezes which enable the player to freeze the computer controlled characters for around 10 seconds.\n\nLevels alternate between playing as a monkey against tribesmen and playing as a paint-roller against teddy bears. Completing a level enables the player to play a bonus game which involves guiding a teddy bear to a banana to gain an extra 1000 points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/potty-painter", "videos": [{"id": 113946, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "P4RKN1zsgQQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4RKN1zsgQQ", "title": "Potty Painter ZX Spectrum", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P4RKN1zsgQQ/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 113947, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kqvjR32D-nw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqvjR32D-nw", "title": "Potty Painter / Potty Painter in the Jungle (ZX Spectrum)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kqvjR32D-nw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
