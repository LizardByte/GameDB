The player controls a fighter spacecraft which can also transform into a mecha that has more powerful weapons but is generally slower. The standard fighter has an upgradeable spread shot and the secondary weapon is a homing laser. In mecha form there's a very powerful but short range sword while the secondary weapon is a big laser. Secondary weapons use an energy meter that drains as the weapon is fired. It charges as more things are destroyed or damaged. Also, as long as the player has collected at least one main weapon power-up, the first enemy hit will not destroy the player's craft, but instead reduce power-up level to zero. There are five stages in total. Two player mode is also available.", "summary": "Alltynex was a game exclusively only for the Fujitsu FM Towns computer line. The game was never even featured on arcade cabinet.\n\n\"Alltynex is a vertically-scrolling shoot' em up. It's a doujin game developed by Satoshi Yoshida in 1996.
