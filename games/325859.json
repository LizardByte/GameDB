That comes with wealth, power and other usual perks, but the contract does stipulate a teeny, tiny favor: could you maybe clear this slightly monster-infested dungeon first? The demon is kind of sealed inside and it would really appreciate you punching a hole in its supposedly-eternal jail. That's definitely a safe thing to do with no far-reaching consequences whatsoever.", "summary": "Use your solitaire skills to assemble powerful combos and defeat the dungeon's monsters. Grab treasure and spend it to build a set of powerful, synergistic abilities to help you. Manage both your own resources and the demon's patience to hopefully survive the ordeal.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/solitomb--1"}
