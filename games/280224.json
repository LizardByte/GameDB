Sonic gazed at the giant battleship aimed toward the mountain , and had already bolted towards it in a blink of an eye. Even though Sonic rushed to save Greenflower Mountain as quickly as possible, it had already been destroyed in by the time he arrived. Now, after a quick reunion with the evil doctor, Sonic and friends journey off onto another quest to save the world from Dr. Eggman.", "summary": "SRB1 Christmas (also known as Sonic Xmas Blast) was released in December 1998, during the period between the end of SRB2 TGF's development and the release of SRB2 Halloween a year later, as it was clear by then SRB2 would no longer be using this engine. It is largely a repackaging of SRB2 TGF's existing levels with Christmas-themed names and a winter theme applied. The ability to save the game was not present however, and the game itself would start immediately on load.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-robo-christmas-blast", "videos": [{"id": 107149, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Jq8UvzYu7x8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq8UvzYu7x8", "title": "Super Sonic in SRB2 TGF/Sonic Robo Christmas Blast", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jq8UvzYu7x8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
