Ben's been double-crossed before. But this time they messed with his gang, they trashed his bike, and they're about to come back for more.\n\nCHAIN SAWS. TYRE IRONS. SEMI TRUCKS. Everything's coming after Ben at once. Trouble's riding his back so tight it makes the leather squeak. He's got to out-fight it, out-smart it, and out-run it if he wants to survive.\n\nSUITS. COPS. MINIVANS. The society that him out long ago wants him back--Dead or Alive. A faceless legal system wants Ben for murder. A greedy executive wants him for money. A mysterious woman wants him for revenge.\n\nWHAT THEY'RE ALL GONNA GET IS UP TO YOU.", "summary": "Full Throttle is a computer adventure game developed and published by LucasArts.
