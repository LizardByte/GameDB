The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year. The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date. You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harvest-moon-save-the-homeland", "videos": [{"id": 36025, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "K2dbN_8eHTQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2dbN_8eHTQ", "title": "Harvest Moon Save The Homeland - Demo - PS2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K2dbN_8eHTQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
