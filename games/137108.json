He had received a letter from Father Arakawa, who had raised him up as a child, telling him that the Oboshiro church will be closing and merged with a larger church in a neighbouring town, and inviting him back for one last summer together. He reunited with his childhood friends Yomi, Daiya and Ruka, and also met a little girl named Hina who reminded him of himself when he was a child. This is the beginning of a cheerful and refreshing, yet sometimes painful, summer tale.\n\nAn updated release titled Himawari no Kyoukai to Nagai Natsuyasumi -extra vacation- was released 7 months after the initial PC release. It includes new event CGs as well as a new route for Tsukiko.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/himawari-no-kyoukai-to-nagai-natsuyasumi", "videos": [{"id": 39852, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ms1D8ZPK_Ig", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms1D8ZPK_Ig", "title": "\u3010\u516c\u5f0f\u3011\u5411\u65e5\u8475\u306e\u6559\u4f1a\u3068\u9577\u3044\u590f\u4f11\u307f OP\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u3010\u6795\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ms1D8ZPK_Ig/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
