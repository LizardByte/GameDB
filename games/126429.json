The unique flight system allows unlimited airtime, but requires forward momentum and skillful maneuvering to maintain lift.\n\nLike the physics of real flight, as long as Gable is moving forward, she can gain lift.\nShe can stay in the air as long as she has the room to maneuver around obstacles and maintain forward airspeed.\n\nSpecters of the Deep Wilds abound, and obstacles, both puzzly and precisiony await!\n\nAll in-game graphics are composed of 4 colors, and there are many 4-color palettes to choose from.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/down-ward"}
