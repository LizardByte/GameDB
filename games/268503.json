The aim is to create a block containing the number 2048. When you move the controls in a direction, the blocks will move in that direction until they hit another block or the edge of the grid.\n\nWhen a moving block meets a stationary block of the same value, they combine to create a block with double the value, which clears space on the grid.\n\nEvery time you make a move a new block is randomly placed on the grid, usually this will be a 2 but sometimes can be a 4. Should the grid fill up and there are no adjacent blocks of the same value to combine, the game is over and you will need to press the reset button.\n\nGame Modes:\n2048 - the game finishes when you achieve a block with a value of 2048. Try and achieve this in the quickest time possible!\nLong - the game continues until you create the largest block possible of 131,072 or there are no more moves available.\nTime - you have three minutes to achieve the highest score you can.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/2048-f8"}
