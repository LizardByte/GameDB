The worst of which was the kidnapping of Brunilde. She was torn from Rufus\u2019 hands and put in a prison at the Evil One\u2019s castle. Transformed into a blondie duck-faced doll girl, she now spends all her time staring at herself in a small handheld mirror.\n\nDetermined to win her back, Rufus made a helmet out of a bucket and picked a broom as a weapon. Everybody now calls him the CLUNKY HERO, but he might be the only hope to defeat the evil one that no one wants to call by name. Rufus is now on his journey to save his wife and the whole village!", "summary": "A story-driven platformer metroidvania with a touch of RPG and tons of humor!
