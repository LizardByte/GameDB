It is an invaluable aid to learning, revision and reinforcement of many of the facts needed for National Curriculum Key Stages. As children play the games, their progress is automatically monitored and recorded in 36 specific challenges with no input from parents or teacher. Each challenge has four graded practice levels - each of which is also monitored. With many user-customisable features, this is the package that grows with your child. You can watch the children learn, join in the fun or leave them and return later to check progress. You're in control!", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/10-out-of-10-junior-essentials"}
