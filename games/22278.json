Characters are skill rated and armed with guns, swords, and spells. Although the teammates and opponents are bots, each of the 18 levels is an objective based mission typical of multiplayer FPS games (rescue hostages, deliver packages, etc...). The player and bots re-spawn an unlimited number of times until the level objective is completed or failed. The forces of evil usually have a numerical advantage including a team of character type bots (comparable to the player's team) and an additional horde of mindless minions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
