You play through the stages with the cat holding a magic paddle at the bottom of the screen bouncing a ball across the screen to break all the pieces set up on the stage.\nThere are 6 worlds (forest, sea, cloud etc.); each of which have 9 levels plus a boss level. You may play the worlds in any order you like except for the last world (the castle world) which is available when all the others are complete. You select which world to play from a game map.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/action-puzzle-prism-land"}
