It is time to prove your brick breaker skills.\n\nYou have an opportunity to journey through an ancient temple, collecting as many treasures as you can. You can explore the temple's chambers through 240 beautifully handcrafted levels and discover 192 challenging level in tombs or venture below into the mine where the deeper you get the more precious treasures you will find!\n\nAre you ready for the this challenge?\n\n*** Game Modes ***\n\nExploration: you can discover 6 different labyrinths containing 240 unique chambers and 192 mysterious tombs. You must break all bricks in a chamber to complete the level. Use the paddle to collect the falling treasurers and power-ups. Be careful, though, as not all power-ups are handy!\n\nMine: lots of gold, crystals and ancient treasure are buried deep under the temple. You can use a huge mining machine to break even the strongest bricks but some special powerful balls can also be very useful for this work. How far can you get?\n\n*** Main Features ***\n\n\u2013 240 handcrafted chamber and 192 tombs levels in Exploration Mode\n\u2013 endless destruction in Mining Mode\n\u2013 7 unlockable ball types\n\u2013 4 unlockable paddle types with powerful abilities\n\u2013 more than 30 unlockable upgrades\n\u2013 powerup inventory\n\u2013 real-time physics\n\u2013 lots of power-ups, power-downs and collectable items\n\u2013 daily, weekly missions and ad hoc challenges\n\u2013 single touch and tilt controls\n\u2013 fast-paced addictive gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqhXZHHSe98/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqhXZHHSe98/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqhXZHHSe98/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqhXZHHSe98/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqhXZHHSe98/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ancient Bricks Gameplay Walkthrough #1 (Android, IOS)", "description": "DOWNLOAD GAME Ancient Bricks\n\nAndroid, IOS: https://krugames.net/?p=14365\n\nWalkthrough:\n\nNew Games: https://bit.ly/34Emkrt\n\nBest Games: https://bit.ly/3jGC15E\n\nSubscribe For Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGmmFPAaUA8hKRjV9GQNetQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/KruGames\n\nFacebook: https://goo.gl/14ZWyM\nTwitter: https://goo.gl/BVahdF\nWebsite: https://krugames.net\nDiscord: krugames#2660\n\nThanks for watching.
