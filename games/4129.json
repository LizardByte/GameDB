It was developed by Yuke's Future Media Creators and published by Titus Software in 1999. The player can choose from ten characters to fight in several game modes including story mode, arcade mode, versus mode, practice and survival mode.\n\nThe story mode is a unique aspect to the game and sets it apart from other fighting games. Each character has a unique story mode which progresses like an ongoing television program, complete with episode names and previews with voice acting. As the mode progresses, you learn more about the character's backstory and why they are fighting, an incentive to play through the game with each character. Evil Zone is also one of the few games to feature a fully fleshed out story mode for its boss character.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 53167, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "t5ZDPHx9xJQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ZDPHx9xJQ", "title": "FUUJIN RYOUIKI: ERETZVAJU (PS1) - Intro / Opening (Evil Zone Japanese Version)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t5ZDPHx9xJQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 53764, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "olgRWl-2sKQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olgRWl-2sKQ", "title": "EVIL ZONE (PS1) - DANZAIVER STORY MODE  (Playthrough/Longplay) Hard", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/olgRWl-2sKQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
