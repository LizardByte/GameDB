Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time. There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is Hedge Hopper (10 barns), game 2 is Crop Duster (15 barns), game 3 is Stunt Pilot (15 barns), and game 4 is Flying Ace (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barnstorming", "videos": [{"id": 104783, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tzekJZZ9QW0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzekJZZ9QW0", "title": "Atari 2600 Longplay [056] Barnstorming", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzekJZZ9QW0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
