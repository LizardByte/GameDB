The goal is to fill all the empty trail, as indicated by the black spots on the screen, with dominoes. Once the dominoes are all lined up, the stage is complete. However, there are many obstacles that can topple all of your dominoes. Some of these enemies include shoppers, caddies in golf carts, and a large bully. In addition, there is a giant bee that constantly follows you around, but can't knock over the dominoes. Touching any of the aforementioned enemies results in the loss of a life of the player. However, some of these enemies can be dispatched by pushing them out of the way, or dispatched by other means.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/domino-man"}
