Join the Malledhrim as they lay siege to the tower of Dol Guldur and confront the Lieutenant upon his own threshold.", "summary": "Siege of Mirkwood will expand the online world of Middle-earth where players will join forces to press further eastward into the dark, foreboding and treacherous forest of Mirkwood and take part in the epic conclusion to Volume II of The Lord of the Rings Online.
