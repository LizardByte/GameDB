This is not a game, but a real driver training program which, until now, was only offered on larger simulator systems. Driving Essentials offers a complete training program for novice and newly licensed drivers. A virtual driving instructor will take a new driver through a complete curriculum, starting with basic driving skills through more advanced and dangerous situations such as distracted driving.\n\nDriving Essentials provides a wide variety of roads and traffic scenarios, many of which would be too difficult or dangerous to train in a real car. The driver will experience city, highway, commercial, residential, and rural environments.\n\nIn later lessons the driver will face the challenges of rain, snow and fog, as well as day and night scenarios. This is a fully interactive driving experience, not just classroom knowledge. You will be behind the wheel from the very first lesson.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/driving-essentials"}
