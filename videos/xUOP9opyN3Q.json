It's a lot cleaner than the older version I had previously uploaded (the one heavily cross promoted by WWE).\n\nWarriors of Might and Magic is a game in the fictional Might and Magic universe.\n\nThe game centers on the capture of a soldier named Alleron, who is accused of being a necromancer. From there he is thrown into the Pit of the Accused with nothing but a bone club and a crawler shield. If he survives, he is deemed innocent. The game leads on to quite an adventure as you get past the pit you go on to the orc mines. As well as the village of Draklor, a battle with a dragon named Talonthraxus and the final fight with Daglathor. You get weapons such as the claymore and the battle ax, armors such as Jerkald's vest and scale mail and shields, such as the flame shield and the metal shield, various items are used for healing and boosting stats and eventually a lot more.\n\nIt was released on three different consoles generating three totally different games. Although they all follow a similar storyline each game was unique, for instance they all had their own unique levels and monsters. As well as this there were other differences such as, on the PlayStation 2 version items could be bought and sold at merchants, however on the PlayStation version a choice of only three weapons were available (a sword, an axe and a mace) which upgraded each time you found that particular weapon (for instance you have a sword, you find another sword upgrading your sword to level 2 etc.). On the Game Boy Color version (which was a 2D game) the fighting system was limited and static etc. On the whole there are many differences between the three games.\n\nYou can find the other version of this trailer (which has slightly different effects and narration) here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwozhB36RKY", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xUOP9opyN3Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xUOP9opyN3Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xUOP9opyN3Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xUOP9opyN3Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xUOP9opyN3Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Warriors of Might and Magic TV Ad Official Trailer Final Cut (2000, 3DO/NWC)", "description": "The version of the trailer provided on the Warriors of Might and Magic PS2 disc.
