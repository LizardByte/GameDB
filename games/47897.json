This is also the first Digimon game to include the Dracomon line of Digimon, featuring Petitmon, Babydmon, Dracomon, Coredramon (Air), Coredramon (Ground), Wingdramon, Groundramon, Slayerdramon, and Breakdramon. The starting Digimon is Botamon.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/digimon-world-championship"}
