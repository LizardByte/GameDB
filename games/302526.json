The track consists of elements that are easily customizable by simply grabbing them. From funnels and loops to spirals, splitters, and both vertical and horizontal turns, these track elements can automatically align themselves for a smooth marble run, making construction fast and easy. Group track elements together so you can grab the entire group. You have the ability to duplicate and delete individual track elements or entire groups, and save favorite groups to the Track Box for reuse at any time. Infinite undo/redo functionality is always available, and you can save your favorite runs for sharing, restoring, and simulating later.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marble-mechanics", "videos": [{"id": 114240, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "MsQ6548qzSw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsQ6548qzSw", "title": "Marble Mechanics Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsQ6548qzSw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
