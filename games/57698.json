After stealing a spacecraft, players battle through security forces using various collectible weapons including side shots, shields, controllable drones, and seeking missiles. The game features both genuine and deceptive power-ups that can hinder progress by reversing controls or reducing speed. Players face tanks, ships, flying vessels, and spacecraft across multiple levels, each culminating in an optional boss battle that rewards extra points upon defeat. Death or level progression strips all acquired weapons, requiring constant adaptation to survive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/foundations-waste--1"}
