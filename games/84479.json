At the centre of Alfheim lies Isa, home to mankind and, at its centre, the Elder Tree. When a devastating attack wipes out the protectors of the tree, the Chieftain uses his dying breath to protect his legacy from harm. Beneath the bows of the Elder Tree he was slain, leaving behind his daughter Estra and a mysterious gemstone of unknown power.\n\nThe saying goes that there is more than one way to skin a cat and, though we feel there must be a far less gruesome metaphor somewhere, we find this to be true. Combat in Atone asks that your fingers be quick and your eye keen, but not all interactions need end in violence. Show mercy, talk your way out or butter them up - the choice is yours! But play wisely, for not every leopard is so willing to change its spots.", "summary": "This 2D narrative adventure weaves a tale of fantasy and Norse mythology with stunning visuals and compelling story. Spread over four different seasonal chapters, follow Estra\u2019s story as she forges a path through this wild world on a journey to uncover the truth about her father\u2019s death.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree", "videos": [{"id": 30140, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "w5CIE5F8g8U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5CIE5F8g8U", "title": "ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree | Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w5CIE5F8g8U/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 30138, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ctOWNAXXcVg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctOWNAXXcVg", "title": "ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree - Trailer | An Indie Game from New Zealand", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ctOWNAXXcVg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 30139, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sSEULKNwcyY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSEULKNwcyY", "title": "ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree | Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sSEULKNwcyY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 30137, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "pqwwdGneIG4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqwwdGneIG4", "title": "\"Die By A Tree\" | ATONE", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pqwwdGneIG4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
