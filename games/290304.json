As with most people, the JFK case has always lurked at the back of your mind since childhood, but you\u2019ve never taken a real interest in resolving it until now. But when an innocent trip to a space museum takes a dangerous turn and spirals into a nightmarish adventure of time travel and lawbreaking, you are forced to journey back to the fateful day of John Kennedy\u2019s murder, and find yourself defending the most notorious assassin (or fall guy!) in history, Lee Harvey Oswald. As you hunt around the now world-famous crime scene, desperately looking for some clue or scrap of evidence that everyone else might have overlooked, you slowly become more and more unnerved at the steady trickle of evidence that\u2026\u2026.just doesn\u2019t make sense. Your client is clearly not telling you everything he knows, but is he the only one with a skeleton in his closet? Just how many of your own preconceived notions on this case will you have to take another look at? Will you be able to uncover the truth in time, and save your client from his historical date with destiny? Or will you be forced to watch powerlessly, as the inevitable sequence of known events unfolds before your eyes?", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-presidential-turnabout", "videos": [{"id": 109044, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LIkVHmJTd1A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIkVHmJTd1A", "title": "The Presidential Turnabout (Gameplay segment)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LIkVHmJTd1A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
