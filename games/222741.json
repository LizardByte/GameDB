Named simply The Crystals, these structures give a few humans that possess the ability to harness their mysterious energy-enhanced abilities and powers, to a point where they are considered to be even demi-gods on their own. These powerful humans are called the Icons.\n\nSince this discovery and the subsequent realization that whoever controls the Crystals controls the fate of the world, dramatic political changes have undergone on Aurora, with new empires and nations being formed, and others vanishing, becoming a mere footmark in history. The result was three main Alliance being formed across the continent, each of them centered on their own views and plans for the Crystals...and the Icons.\n\nThe game will start here, with the Alliances setting plans, each vying to dominate, exploit, study, or preserve the Crystals - while keeping them far from their enemies\u2019 reach. A clash between these newly created superpowers seems imminent, and with the Icons holding such extraordinary power, a small spark is maybe all that is needed to engulf the continent in a war of total destruction\u2026", "summary": "Icons of Theia is a Tactical RPG for Android and ioS.
