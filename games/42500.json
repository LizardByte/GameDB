Preschool Fun is an educational developed for children under six years of age. The game is set around a group of islands, where each island teaches a different subject to the players. Part of the Mario's Early Years educational series, Preschool Fun is different from the others because it doesn't specialize in a specific subject. Instead, it teaches about the body, shapes, animal noises, counting, opposites, and colors. However, several of the activities share the common theme of following instructions. This was the last of three educational games to be released.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marios-early-years-preschool-fun", "videos": [{"id": 35521, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "uh7S2iz4hkM"}]}
