It was convincing with its wit, complexity, 2D scene mode and text mode. Good sales figures and good ratings (e.g. GameStar 83%) confirm this.\n\nThe menu navigation of the game changed completely. Now there was a bar in the lower part of the screen, which led the player through the individual screens.\n\nAnstoss 2 specialized again completely in the job of the club manager. The developers took some of the weaknesses from Anstoss 1 and improved them. The opportunity to train in the 2nd Bundesliga and the then regional league (north, north-east, south, south-west) and in other countries (England, France, Italy, Spain) was particularly well received. In addition, the game was now playable indefinitely, which was very popular with the players. There was also a new game mode: \"real managerial career\". While in the soccer managers the player always had to choose his team himself before, when choosing this game mode, some rather weaker teams were thrown out with which the player could negotiate a coaching position. This game mode was seen as quite realistic and can be found in every competitive manager game these days."}
