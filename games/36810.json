As Activision's UK subsidiary Electric Dreams Software had independently released their own version of the game with the same title, the game was renamed for European release. Initially planned to be released as Aliens: The Second Part, it was finally published under the title Aliens: US Version with ports for the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum produced by Mr Micro.\n\nAliens is a series of six minigames strung together via graphical interactive sequences, akin to an adventure game, though the only interaction possible is advancing the dialog, displayed in speech balloons. The minigames are mostly action sequences that involve piloting a ship from Sulaco to the planet's surface, recognizing equipment, and fighting aliens.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aliens-the-computer-game--1"}
