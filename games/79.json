Stubbs, a zombie who'll tug at your heartstrings and tickle your funnybone even as he's tearing the living guts right out of your body. This former traveling salesman trades in his briefcase for your braincase as the leading man in Wideload's first game, Stubbs the Zombie in \"Rebel Without a Pulse\".\n\nIn this game, players take on the role of the rebel himself Stubbs, a wisecracking Zombie who takes on an ultra-modern city of the future using nothing but his own carcass and the weapons of his possessed enemies. The game's tongue-in-cheek humor, innovative combat and strong storyline keep Stubbs the Zombie's gameplay as bizarre and unpredictable as its namesake.\n\nOn his quest, Stubbs lurches his way through numerous large and visually captivating indoor/outdoor environments in and around the gleaming city of Punchbowl, PA, a city built during the Eisenhower administration to show off the ultra-futuristic technology of the 21st century. Stubbs' brain-eating adventure brings him through bustling shopping districts and verdant farmlands to battle mad scientists, rural militiamen and the world's deadliest barbershop quartet. His enemies have shotguns, tanks, and all manner of futuristic weaponry. All Stubbs has is his own rotting corpse, a distinct lack of pain or conscience, and the ability to turn foes into zombie allies.\n\nWhat begins as one zombie's search for revenge quickly escalates into an all-out war between the living and the dead - but this time it's the zombie fighting for truth, justice and the redemption of true love. Yes, it's a love story too.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 218, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tea0215CR9Q"}, {"id": 6163, "name": "Boyfriend Trailer", "video_id": "6gb8_N2iZaA"}]}
