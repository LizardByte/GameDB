Move into the perfect apartment: a spacious loft, a cozy place for a young couple, or a multi-bedroom flat-share with friends. This gaming pack allows players to create unrelated families who share the same complex and interact with each other. With The Sims 2: Apartment Life, players have the option of controlling multiple households, and up to four families can live in a single apartment building. Sims rent apartments from non-playable characters who come around on a weekly basis to collect the rent and perform necessary maintenance. Sims can lower their housing costs by living with roommates in an apartment.\n\nMingle with Sims from all-new social groups: stylish socialites, artsy bohemians, sports jocks, gadget-collecting techies, or edgy gearheads. Every lot is now categorized as lower class, middle class, or upper class. Factors that determine class include the size of the lot, the cost of its furniture, and the population density around it.\n\nSims can now use spells - your witch and warlock characters keep their magical reagents in their personal inventories. Players can never predict whether the spells their Sims cast will have a positive, negative, or neutral effect. Magic Sims even have their own neighborhood you can explore with your favorite witch or warlock.\n\nTake advantage of apartment life: form social networks to make new friends, advance their careers, or look for love.\nBuild your Sim's new reputation meter: with a good reputation, your Sim can find the right friends to help them achieve their goals!\n\nControl multiple households: will you make your Sims live in happy harmony or comical conflict?", "summary": "With The Sims 2: Apartment Life, the eighth and final expansion pack in the The Sims 2, your Sims are moving into a brand-new apartment and their lives will never be the same!
