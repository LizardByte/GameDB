Some of their names may already be familiar to you but don\u2019t forget to also check the hint at the beginning of each level. The hints will allow you to solve the puzzle and lead you to where the creature hides.\nTo solve puzzles, you should play with the words on your screen. Try to move, divide or squeeze them to create something new.\nCompleting Book of Myths takes around 30 minutes, a short, but magical experience."}
