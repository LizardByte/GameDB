Control them. Enemies? Crush 'em! And there will be enemies. You're not the only Mission Commander trying to colonize the planets. You'll have to push yourself to the limit to survive the ultimate showdown in strategic warfare. It's espionage, heavy artillery, offensives, counter offensives and intelligence - all with maximum consequences! Features: For ultimate customization control, play as one of eight factions, choose from over 50 land, sea, and air units, upgrade armor, speed, and range. Campaign and custom missions. Simultaneous or turn based game play plus adjustable turn length and game speed will challenge both real-time and turn-based strategy gamers.
