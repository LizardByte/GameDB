While The Division was answering the distress call in Washington, D.C., Aaron Keener, a former Division Agent turned Rogue, has taken control of Lower Manhattan and is manipulating the factions of New York with the help of dangerous Rogue Agents. As society rebuilds on the ashes of the Black Friday outbreak, in Keener\u2019s eyes, so do the binds of authority that burden it. Armed with a new strain of the virus that crippled the world, Keener intends to unshackle society from the establishment. Despite numerous remaining threats, The Division\u2019s priorities have changed. Keener needs to be stopped. The hunt is on.\n\nThis expansion to Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2 broadens the online open world and action RPG experience of the franchise, introducing a gripping new story in post-pandemic New York, a revamped progression system and an extended endgame. Enjoyable entirely in single player or in co-op, Warlords of New York opens up a new chapter of The Division franchise, for veterans and newcomers alike.\n\nThe expansion requires Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2 base game to be accessed, which is included in the Warlords of New York Edition and Ultimate Edition for new players to Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2. Owning Warlords of New York includes the option to create a level 30 character, allowing players to jump right into NYC and start the hunt for Keener. Warlords of New York has been thought of as an encapsulated narrative experience from the start.\n\nNEW YORK MANHUNT\n\nThe only way to stop a city-wide bio attack is to hunt Aaron Keener down. But to get to him, Agents first must get through his close guard of Rogue Agents standing in the way. Once trained by The Division, each strayed for individual beliefs, only to regroup under a common banner held by Keener.\n\nNEW YORK HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED\n\nWarlords of New York is set during late summer in the Open World of Lower Manhattan, a brand-new area in The Division franchise, composed of 4 new playable areas: Two Bridges, Civic Center, Battery Park and Financial District. \n\nTHE BEST TOM CLANCY'S THE DIVISION 2 EXPERIENCE TO DATE\n\nWarlords of New York revitalises Tom Clancy's The Division 2 core experience through overhauls of the RPG, Dark Zone and Endgame mechanics.\nAbout Ubisoft   \nUbisoft is a leading creator, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment and services, with a rich portfolio of world-renowned brands, including Assassin\u2019s Creed, Far Cry, For Honor, Just Dance, Watch Dogs, Tom Clancy\u2019s video game series including Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six and The Division.
