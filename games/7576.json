After many years, the conflict came to an end, as the Order of the Flame was created, bonding men and dragons together as the protectors of peace and virtue. Under the direction of the Order, the world of Drakan has prospered in peace, attaining new heights of learning of magic. \n \nAll this came to an end when Navros, the war mage, betrayed the Order of the Flame, and led the Dark Union against the Order in the Dark Wars. He released evils on the world such as the Wartocks, to serve as his army. The Order was demolished, and only by the sacrifice of the great dragon Arokh the Drak Union was stopped. Arokh and the rest of the surviving dragons went away to sleep, and the Order and the Union were thought to be finished at that time, centuries ago. They were wrong. \n \nWaking up from a Wartock raid of her village, Rynn, a young warrior, discover the village in ruins and her brother kidnapped. As she sets out to find him, she becomes, perhaps by destiny, bound to the legendary dragon Arokh. The two then set out to find out what is happening... \n \nDrakan features a unique engine that seamlessly blends outdoor scenes and indoor scenes. Playing the game, you will ride Arokh, using his fiery breath as a weapon, or walk around as Rynn, using swords and bows as your weapons. You will have \"dog\"-fights with dragons, or a hand to hand combat with giant spiders, scavengers and Wartocks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/drakan-order-of-the-flame", "videos": [{"id": 26043, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "If65aseiuIY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If65aseiuIY", "title": "Drakan: Order of the Flame (1999) - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/If65aseiuIY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
