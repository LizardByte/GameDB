I don't think either portion is particularly great though. The game is painfully slow in its pace and the driving portion is in a lot of ways worse than the other Wangan games. The sim portion is moderately thought out, right down to making your own schedules and daily routines, but the game as a whole could have used a little more fine tuning.\n\nI suppose the game is pretty good once you spend millions of yen on a fancy car and the ladies, but that's assuming you can put up with hours of tedious micro-management and difficult tasks to make money, not to mention karts and cars that control terribly. The game also has mini-games. Watch for yourself and decide whether or not it's something you're into. Enjoy.\n\nNote: This is a yellow-label Saturn game recorded off of the original hardware. Yellow label games usually contain suggestive themes. The thumbs for this video suck this time around too... I wish regular users could choose their own thumbs.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xco8yIhp-oY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xco8yIhp-oY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xco8yIhp-oY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Wangan Trial Love [\u6e7e\u5cb8\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30eb\uff2c\uff2f\uff36\uff25\u2665] Game Sample - Sega Saturn", "description": "Original Air Date: January 10th, 2009\n\nThis video is for Wangan Trial Love, which is like the Wangan driving games with a load of dating-sim elements thrown in.
