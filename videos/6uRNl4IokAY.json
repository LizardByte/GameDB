Collecting special pickups to increases the plane's firepower. The tagline on this title reads \"Nobody ever said it would be easy\", serving as an appropriate disclaimer to the frustrations which reside within.  As the levels progress, the enemy's hail of bullets intensifies. Enemies are not shy of spawning behind you to take a cheap shot while you're trying to dodge other hazards.\n\nKnown on Famicom as: Hi Sho Zame \u98db\u7fd4\u9bab\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est Jan 2007.
