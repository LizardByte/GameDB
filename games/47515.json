Gameplay is divided into 2 parts. The first part has players place poles with the opposite color in the looping field. The status bar will deplete and show players how many poles they can place. The second part starts as soon as all the poles are placed. In this part, players need to topple poles of their color while avoiding their opponents poles which they've placed in the first part of the game. In this part, the status bar will increase after the players topple the poles of their color and if the player's aircraft is slow, the poles will bounce their aircraft back.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dires-giger-loop"}
