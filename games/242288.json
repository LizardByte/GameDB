Really, just use your thumbs on the screen to move back and forth and enjoy the awesome ride.\nSimple gestures give you total control to bounce the fish around: Choose the way you want to go and take advantage of precise landings to gain impulse and progress into this psychedelic journey.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dream-swim"}
