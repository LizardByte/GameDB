There are seven playable characters, including an unlockable X! Each character has their own special move that can be performed when its meter is filled. For example, Mega Man unleashes a powerful charge shot\u2026 while Shadow Man clones the ball (isn\u2019t that cheating?). There are also four cups with varying court types. With multiple skill upgrades from Auto\u2019s shop, this game has more depth than some may imagine!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rockman-tennis", "videos": [{"id": 107861, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "nZCzao8JeIo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZCzao8JeIo", "title": "Rockman Tennis Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nZCzao8JeIo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
