I only work on the mod once a week and you can watch my progress live each Wednesday on Twitch channel. \n\nThis trailer showcases the levels worked on in the last year. A good amount of progress! :) Other places to check out:\n\nBKR Discord: https://discord.gg/pAfbjB2\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/SuperZambezi\n\nMusic in this trailer was created by Badub, make sure to check out his other custom BK music here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZdpOhL2oFU\n\n-----\n\nSome frequently asked questions:\n\nQ: When will this be released?\nA: I work on this at my own pace. At the rate I'm going, I wouldn't expect it to be done for at least another year or two.\n\nQ: Can you release a demo?\nA: I did! You can play through a small portion of the hub and the main area of World 1. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T61vu6l5mI\n\nQ: How many worlds will there be?\nA: The goal is to replace all nine of the original worlds. No more, no less.\n\nQ: Can you create new enemies and bosses? New moves?\nA: The simple answer is no, I have to stick with what is already available in vanilla Banjo-Kazooie. That kind of functionality doesn't exist yet in the BK modding scene.\n\nQ: Why aren't you modding Banjo Tooie? Can you include collectibles and moves from BT?\nA: Sadly, no as well. We don't have tools to make that happen and it certainly isn't as simple as moving something from one game to the next. Banjo-Kazooie is used as the base game because it is the most moddable, plus I personally prefer its simplicity in collectibles and puzzle depth when compared to Banjo Tooie.\n\nQ: Can I help with music?\nA: I work on this project alone, but I will need someone to help with music in the future. BUT, I'd like to look for help in the music department when I'm comfortable with the amount of work I have done. Please don't contact me just yet, I'm not ready to start looking!\n\nQ: Will this run on the original Nintendo 64?\nA: Hopefully! But this is not my goal so I will not be optimizing the game to run on the original hardware.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0LXeoCE2wKY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0LXeoCE2wKY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0LXeoCE2wKY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0LXeoCE2wKY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0LXeoCE2wKY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Banjo-Kazooie Returns - (Full Custom Mod) Trailer #9", "description": "Follow on Twitch for livestreams every Wednesday: https://www.twitch.tv/superzambezi\n\nThe latest trailer for Banjo-Kazooie Returns, a fan-made BK project I've been working on for the last seven years.
