It is not just-another-ordinary-match-3-game. It is Merge-3 Maaania - the most intriguing and innovative combination of merge-3 and building construction, providing you with an irresistible puzzle solving experience.\nM3M is an easy-to-pick-up but hard-to-master puzzle solver where you need to combine three or more pieces of the same element to create a more advanced element: from grasses to shrubs then trees, or cottages to tents then yurts. Instead of eliminating game-pieces, you create an ever-advancing township of prosperity and happiness.\nPlan and strategise every step to build advanced elements like the Palace, Pyramid, and the Tower of Light; or even reach the ultimate Wonder of the ancients. See how far can you go before you run out of space.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/merge-3-mania"}
