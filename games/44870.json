Wanted Levels were represented by a trouble bar in the Game Boy Color.\n\nThe game also features a radically different soundtrack from the PC and PS1 versions, replacing all the songs that play on the radio and menus in those versions with 8-bit instrumental tracks composed by Anthony Paton.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grand-theft-auto--1", "collections": [{"id": 847, "name": "Grand Theft Auto"}]}
