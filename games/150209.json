However he quickly realizes that there may be more to the house than previously thought. Lying on a bed of broken dreams and ruined futures, the house has let itself go. Or rather, it's come alive.\nThe teacher finds himself trapped almost immediately and at the whim of three strange children. But does he want to leave?
