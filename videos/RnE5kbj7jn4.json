I've decided to launch a test game server for those who want to play CyberWar. \nCyberWar is a multiplayer online game, playable on PC.

The player has control over the hover's movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players via the text chat. The goal is to survive and save the human race from extinction by breaching into the heart of the enemy's defense, while contending with traps, drones, robots.
