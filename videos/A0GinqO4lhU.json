Still leaves 2014's cancellation for Rare Replay as a mystery though, but looking at other events around the time before IOI's new game was announced, we can think of MGM/EON as the reason. 007 Legends made Eurocom shut down in 2012, Activision lost the license and put the franchise in sleep for 8 years until 2020. Safe to assume MGM/EON wouldn't want to try to release this already 6 years old remaster.\n\nFast forward to 2022 and we have all the achievements viewable on the official Xbox page. The official remaster is finally coming.\n\nDownload my 100% save file for Xenia emulator - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l_isohcDiRWS70PeTMq5SWlf8NPDrKdN\n\nExtract in \\Documents\\Xenia\\content\nDon't ask me for a download link of the game, check the archives.\nDownload Xenia (Please note that latest Xenia versions have issues with GoldenEye XBLA, it is recommended to use a Xenia build from January to April / May 2021): https://xenia.jp/\n------------  \n\u25baSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGInMxYIVrl23nLjDAIMknw?sub_confirmation=1\n\u25baDiscord: https://discordapp.com/invite/tksttVC\n\u25baTwitter: https://twitter.com/Graslu00\n\u25baFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Graslu00\n\u25baReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/graslu00\n------------\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n1:31 - Dam\n8:30 - Facility\n14:40 - Runway\n17:05 - Surface I\n22:08 - Bunker I\n25:42 - Silo\n30:09 - Frigate\n33:22 - Surface II\n38:39 - Bunker II\n43:16 - Statue\n50:22 - Archives\n55:33 - Streets\n59:46 - Depot\n1:02:54 - Train\n1:07:15 - Jungle\n1:11:35 - Control\n1:20:00 - Caverns\n1:27:20 - Cradle\n1:29:59 - Credits\n1:33:14 - Aztec\n1:38:40 - Egyptian\n1:42:19 - Dam Multiplayer\n1:48:07 - Frigate Multiplayer\n1:52:36 - Complex Multiplayer LTK\n2:02:47 - Facility Multiplayer\n2:08:21 - Depot Multiplayer\n\n#BringGoldenEyeBack #BringGEBack #GoldenEye #XBLA #JamesBond #GE007", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0GinqO4lhU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0GinqO4lhU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0GinqO4lhU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0GinqO4lhU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0GinqO4lhU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "GoldenEye 007 XBLA - Longplay (4K 60FPS)", "description": "For Your Eyes Only.\nFootage of the cancelled GoldenEye XBLA remake/remaster/port from 2007, full game on 00 Agent, 4k 60FPS and thirty minutes of multiplayer games.
