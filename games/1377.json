Previously, Dubai was a wealthy area with many high profile citizens until catastrophic sandstorms left a majority of the city buried. This caused many to evacuate, leaving only a few behind. One of the people left behind was U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad (a reference to the author of Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad), a founding member of Delta Force, who refused to evacuate from a training facility in the city and instead remained behind with the men under his command to help protect the citizens that could not evacuate.\n\nAfter several weeks of no contact, the Army fears that Col. Konrad and his men are lost to the destruction of the city until a weak distress signal is picked up. This gives the Army reason to deploy the player and their squad, who must infiltrate the city, neutralize outlaws and survive sandstorms as they attempt to determine what happened to Konrad and his men. Through the narrative in the trailer and sound clips from the game's website it is hinted that Konrad may not have entirely genuine motivations for remaining in Dubai against orders.", "summary": "A third-person shooter in which three American soldiers led by Capt. Walker are sent to Dubai in order to recover whoever remains of an infantry unit, the 33rd Battalion, until they decide to take action against the militants situated in the city. As they progress, however, the logistical and ethical complexity of their objective deepens, and their perception of themselves, and their enemy, is put into question.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 1051, "name": "Narrative Trailer", "video_id": "Tp7waCZPkzA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp7waCZPkzA", "title": "Spec Ops: The Line - Narrative Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tp7waCZPkzA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 1052, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "ENm4UYgQ2nE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENm4UYgQ2nE", "title": "Spec Ops: The Line - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ENm4UYgQ2nE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 1053, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "1bAqPyMaXWA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bAqPyMaXWA", "title": "Spec Ops: The Line - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bAqPyMaXWA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 42610, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "W3FNsjb6Cts", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3FNsjb6Cts", "title": "Spec Ops: The Line (PS3) - Playthrough / Gameplay / Longplay (No Commentary)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W3FNsjb6Cts/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 2126, "name": "Multiplayer Announcer"}, {"id": 3598, "name": "Commando"}, {"id": 5676, "name": "Capt.
