Special is a follow-up to Super Mario Bros, originally released in Japan in 1986 for the home computer market. The game features 32 all new levels, 5 new enemies and 5 new power-ups. Due to limitations of the PC hardware, the game engine was quite poor in comparison to the Famicom/NES original. Most notable was the lack of scrolling; the PC version would instead show each screen one at a time.\n\nThis port brings the levels, new enemies and power-ups back to the Famicom/NES engine. Also included are most of the unique background changes and other features not possible with the original SMB engine. The end result is a much more playable game that feels like a legitimate sequel.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-bros-special-35th-anniversary-edition", "videos": [{"id": 66476, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WtcMCccN0zQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtcMCccN0zQ", "title": "Super Mario Bros.
