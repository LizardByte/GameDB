It was tough, but as time passed these youkai were able to blend in with the human world and live peacefully amongst them. \n \nHowever, blood is thicker than water. The offspring of these youkai displayed the powerful abilities of their ancestors in times of great anxiety, often manifesting in horrible and dangerous ways, and were labeled by society as monsters. \nOfficially their condition was named \"Acquired Systemic Special Heredity variety Syndrome\", or \"ASSHS\" for short and treated as a non-contagious illness, but the common people began to refer to them as Jinyous (half-youkai) nevertheless. \n \nOf these Jinyous, most were sent to Kamizawa City: an isolated urban area walled off from the rest of Japan to keep all the Jinyous together and away from the human population. However, the ones that were deemed especially dangerous were sent to a medical facility on an uncharted island near the shores of Japan where they would be under constant surveillance. \n \nTakabe Ryouichi was one of those who were sent to said island at the age of five. This is a story about him along with the girl called Suzu, his only friend on the island, escaping to Kamizawa City to live a normal life. What they didn\u2019t expect was that Suzu carried a secret that attracted much unwanted attention\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
