A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?\n\nSomeone who was supposed to be there... isn't.\nSomeone who wasn't supposed to be there... is.\n\nSomeone who was alive last night is now dead, and someone who is here right now isn't alive.\n\nThere is no way to avert this tragedy. There is no choice but to give up trying.\n\nBut even so... please don't give up.", "summary": "Higurashi When They Cry is a sound novel. The music, backgrounds and characters work together to create a world that is the stage of a novel for the user to read. They laugh and cry and get angry.
