Due to Videopac's hardware limitations, the Chess Module has extra CPU and memory to make the console have enough power to run the game. The module is connected to the console by a dummy cartridge.\n\nThe game displays the board on screen and asks the player the color which he or she wants to play with. Depending on the choice, the board will have the numbers 1 to 8 shown at the left side in crescent or decrescent order. The game has 6 levels of difficulty, each corresponding to how many moves ahead the computer can predict (1 move to 6 moves). The game is played using the keyboard to input the coordinates for the movements, using the coordinate notation, i.e., the player enters the letter and number corresponding to the square of origin and to the square of destination", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/c7010-video-chess-module"}
