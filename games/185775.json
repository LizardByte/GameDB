If you\u2019re alone in this task, there are useful power-ups: a Teleporter that lets you move around quickly, and Maracas to distract the kids when they are fighting.\n\nMake sure to complete the babies\u2019 desires on time to avoid making them cry which will reset your score combo! A quick tip: these kids might act tough, but they just need a bit of love and hugs. Just steer clear of the ones who bite!\n\nYour journey will bring you to many different environments with vibrant art and music \u2013 visit places all around the world and even time travel! Make your way through clever and original levels, earn loads of points, unlock new stages and features, and encounter special babies with mysterious powers...\n\nShould you succeed in your mission, you\u2019ll become the best babysitter in the universe!", "summary": "Baby Storm is a cooperative party game.
