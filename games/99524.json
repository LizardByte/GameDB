Back to that flat expanse, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she has to get home. In the 20 miles between her grandparents' crumbling barn and her parents' house, she receives a phone call from her mother.\n\nAssume the role of Kelly during her drive through the storm in Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition. While driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska, players navigate an extended conversation between Kelly and her parents and younger brother. Through dialogue choice and simple driving mechanics, this critically-acclaimed visual short story explores a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another.\n\nThe Extended Edition of Three Fourths Home includes an epilogue that expands on the story of the main game. Set at a bus stop in snowy Minnesota, this epilogue examines Kelly's past as well as the effects that the events of the main story have had on her.\n\nParanautical Activity\nParanautical Activity combines the classic FPS action of games like Doom and Quake, with the randomness and difficulty of modern roguelikes like Binding of Isaac and Spelunky", "summary": "In this bundle you get two thrilling games!\n- Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition\n- Paranautical Activity", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/three-fourths-home-slash-paranautical-activity-bundle"}
