You must tackle the changing needs of your people, as well as opposing governments and factions, and thus lay the foundations for your own dynasty. As you move through your years in office you can promote members of your extended family on the island to positions of power: such as ambassador, commanding general or even Supreme Ruler, to ensure your legacy thrives through the eras. As your influence and wealth grows, so do the threats to your burgeoning island superpower. Can you survive both World Wars, prosper through the Great Depression, rule as an iron-fisted dictator through the Cold War and advance your country to modern times and beyond? From the 19th to the 21st century, each era carries its own challenges and opportunities.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tropico-5-complete-collection", "videos": [{"id": 80374, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "UW8NXQwcZwI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW8NXQwcZwI", "title": "Tropico 5 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UW8NXQwcZwI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
