For years they have fought each other for dominance. Caught in the struggle between the two is the nearly forgotten Osborn race, discriminated and enslaved. Mei, a young Osborn man, leaves his home village in order to free his people, and to discover the forbidden secrets of Beljuna which remain a taboo in this land.\n\nThis side-scrolling action role-playing adventure is set in a vast seamless world that consists of interconnected yet varied urban, wilderness, and dungeon-like locations. Players can explore all of Riglas from the outset, a world populated by many different types of friendly and hostile characters. Killing hostiles increases the player's score and eventually makes the main character stronger. Killing friendlies, on the other hand, may lower the score. Combat is simple: approach a character and press the attack button to swing Mei's sword.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/riglas", "videos": [{"id": 103914, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "ONgCLA50qfU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONgCLA50qfU", "title": "\u30ea\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9\u3000\uff0d\u9b42\u306e\u56de\u5e30\uff0dfor PC-8801 (1985)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ONgCLA50qfU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
