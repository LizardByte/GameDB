Kyukyoku Tiger has a swathe of differences to it's overseas counterpart, most notably reverting the player to a previous checkpoint on death rather than respawning them, and being one-player only. There are also more minor changes in factors such as the amount of shots the player can have on screen at once.\n\nThe game was a success for Toaplan in arcades, reportedly reaching 10 Million worldwide players, and a number of console ports were made in the 90s. A sequel, Kyukyoku Tiger II/Twin Cobra II, followed in 1995, though this was developed by Takumi Corporation following TOAPLAN's bankruptcy in 1994.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kyuukyoku-tiger--1", "collections": [{"id": 4490, "name": "Tiger-Heli"}]}
