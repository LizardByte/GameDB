It wasn't my best run, but I just had to record and make a video of this awesome homebrew game! Could have racked up a lot more points, for instance, by remaining in the center and blasting that one thingymabobber before it could form, but with the possibility of backfire, I decided to avoid the intense heat and just get barraged with mucus instead. If you haven't played this game or didn't know of its existence until now, I highly recommend it and encourage you to try it out for yourself! Make a video of your personal experience(s) with this game and post it as a video response!\n\nDownload Blade Buster from the following site/link!\nhttp://hlc6502.web.fc2.com/Bbuster.htm", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ct7T1L0cdYo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ct7T1L0cdYo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ct7T1L0cdYo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Blade Buster (NES/Famicom Homebrew Shoot 'Em Up)", "description": "Game Title: Blade Buster\nPlatform/Console: Nintendo Entertainment System/NES\nEmulator: Nestopia\nCategory: Homebrew\n\nAfter discovering this instant classic over this past weekend, I played it nonstop and seriously can't get enough of it!
