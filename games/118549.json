It is a shoot-out game based on playing cards. In each match, three through eight players (five on some mobile platforms) play against each other. Each player takes one of these roles: Sheriff, Deputy Sheriff, Outlaw or Renegade. The Outlaws must kill the Sheriff. The Sheriff and the Deputies team up to kill all Outlaws and Renegades.\n\nEach Renegade wants to be the last character in play, i.e. kill all others with the Sheriff being the last one. The Sheriff is the only public role, while all others must be discovered as part of the gameplay. Each player also has a unique \"character\" with a special ability that \"bends\" the game rules. The basic gameplay is to play \"BANG!\" on other players who can respond with \"MISSED!\". However the amount of cards with different features, the concepts of range and distance and the many character abilities offer various forms of strategy and tactics. The digital version of Bang! features re-designed character illustrations, HD graphics where HD resolutions are available, single-player and pass-play multiplayer.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bang-the-official-video-game"}
