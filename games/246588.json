Originally the brainchild of Gi Nattak, the project has evolved over the years thanks to a dedicated team and other skilled members of the FF6 romhacking community.\n\nThis mod promises to showcase some of the challenging aspects of FF6 romhacking, as well as plenty of fun and exciting new content; from an all new cast of playable characters with customized movesets, a radically changed story with many new and edited events, new overworld maps, a new musical soundtrack, difficulty selection, new battle scripts for monsters & bosses, and an absolute ton of custom monster/esper and NPC sprites.\n\nIt is a highly personalized modification of the original game and therefore naturally won\u2019t appeal to everyone. It\u2019s not a sequel, or a prequel, or a remake to FF6, it is quite simply a massive amalgamation mod and customization of FF6 which does contain a whole bunch of references and can be rather nonsensical or even immersion-breaking at times\u2026 but if you go into it prepared for this, you should have a much more enjoyable experience. That being said, a whole lot of time and energy has gone into this project and we are quite pleased with the result.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-vi-return-of-the-dark-sorcerer", "videos": [{"id": 88119, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "h449lbVtB_o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h449lbVtB_o", "title": "Return of the Dark Sorcerer Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h449lbVtB_o/sddefault.jpg"}]}
