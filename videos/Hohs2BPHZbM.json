{"id": "Hohs2BPHZbM", "snippet": {"title": "SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis - Longplay Full Game Walkthrough (No Commentary) (Ps2, Wii)", "description": "SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis is a short game that offers some amounts of fun and thinking through different levels. Levels can consistent of on rail shooting, to driving a tank, to getting through puzzeish areas. Probably the best parts are the museum level, the bus dancing and Mr krabs flying towards money. But overall they keep it short and 14 levels is fine. This game was based on a 45 min spongebob special so not to bad I guess. Anyways hope you enjoy this longplay.\n\nGameplay recorded by Loopy\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc7b              \ud83d\udc7b               \ud83d\udc7b                \ud83d\udc7b                 \ud83d\udc7b\n\n\ud83d\udc7b              \ud83d\udc7b               \ud83d\udc7b                \ud83d\udc7b                 \ud83d\udc7b\n\n\nIf you feel like donating, 100% of the donations will be for buying more games to do longplays of.
