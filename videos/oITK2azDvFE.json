Although it's a japanese game, I actually really enjoyed the game. It was suspenseful, and it always had me rushing around looking for things, because I'd think that if I wasn't fast I would get hurt. After a few playthrough's I realized I could take my time, which was nice. Anyways. I hope you guys enjoy this walkthrough. There is a sequel, but it's way more complicated. I am working on solving it for my first time, and I am nowhere near done.  So give me some time guys!
