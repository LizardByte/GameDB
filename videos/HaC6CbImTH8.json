Sometimes it's considered the best in the series gameplay wise, but I guess that the graphics and music couldn't meet the expectations even if they are quite good, and the game didn't sell too well. It's structured in 5 classes where you have to all the courses to pass to the next one, after that you have to do all the way again with the reverse circuits, and finally you'll arrive the last class where special cars and madness are waiting for you. Each time you win a race (1-3 positions) you will get some money to buy or upgrade the car, so that's the way of advancing in this game. \r\n\r\nI'll have to apologize for how bad recorded the 6th class' Over Pass City and Lakeside gate are, but the insane difficulty prevented me from repeating the miracle for correcting the recording error in one (I hope you guys can get used to the choppyness after the first lap or so) and in the other one I just couldn't arrive first even with savestates, so I left it like that. And notice also how edited this longplay is. The CGs for example come after beating a class, not after each race. \r\n\r\nI tried to keep some of the game's rpg/evolution elements in the first 5 classes, but seeing it now, I could probably have done better job at that. What I usually did was to upgrade the original car for the second class and in the third buy the cars with best grip (Age) and speed (Assoluto) upgrade them until the end.
