The basic gameplay is fairly simple, as you don't have any special moves. But, you can pick up different weapons, and levels require a bit of strategy to beat. You also need to free all hostages in order to progress past the first boss. Overall it is good, but gets very hard.\r\nDownload it here: http://ikiki.la.coocan.jp/himoji/game.htm (look for date \"2003/03/05\", filename \"teppoman.zip\")\r\n\r\n-Controls:\r\nArrow keys: Move\r\nShift: Jump / Start game\r\nCtrl: Punch / Shoot\r\nDown: Pick up items / Open chests / Free hostages\r\nHold Down: Lock aiming direction\r\nX: Drop weapon\r\nJ: Suicide\r\nF2: Restart\r\n\r\n\r\n-Software used:\r\nRecording: CamStudio\r\nEditing: VirtualDub", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6VFJbU4Lv8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6VFJbU4Lv8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6VFJbU4Lv8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6VFJbU4Lv8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6VFJbU4Lv8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ikiki Games Gallery - Part 21: Teppoman (\u3066\u3063\u307d\u30de\u30f3)", "description": "In this video series I will chronologically explore all games released by the independent japanese developer known as \"Ikiki\".
