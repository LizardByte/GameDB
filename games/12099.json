This was the perfect place to hide.\n\nAlready worshipped by the indigenous Human population, he could remain here undisturbed.He needed to rest from some time, it had been a long journey, over 12 light year across the coldness of space. Here he\ncould absorb energy from the heat of the midday sun,and it was very hot here.He began to make plans for his takeover of this small planet, all he needed now was time to replenish his energy. He laughed out loud as he recalled the moment of his escape from his prison of two thousand years It had actually been very easy, he thought. The guards had become slow and lethargic, they had made mistakes. He knew they would, after all, he had time to wait, nothing but time.\n\nGlemm had picked up the trail at last. It had take a while,but he knew that somewhere there would be evidence of the vast expense of magical energy required to transport his old enemy away from this place. How could they have let him escape, he wondered `He called upon the elemental forces to begin the chase. He would have to be careful, Suten was dangerous. He would have no qualms about starting a full-scale\nelemental battle wherever he was, and at any cost to his surroundings.\n\nGlemm remembered how an entire solar system had been destroyed prior to Suten`s capture. That was why he had been incarcerated for the remainder of his existence.\nThe trail led to a small blue-green planet, the third of nine orbiting a yellow star. Suten was bound to be somewhere in the hotter regions. Fire had always been his favourite elemental force. It was more destructive than the others. This was not going to be easy. Direct confrontation would be disastrous for all the life-forms on the planet. No, there had to another way. Glemm needed an agent, someone he could help to defeat Suten without arounsinf too much suspicion. Who would be the best choice certainly not a Human, they were far to stupid and clumsy. They couldn't here their way out of a paper bag. The sort if hero required needed to be smart, cunning, fast, and willing to travel!\n\nGlemm began his search near the northern polar ice cap.There weren't many suitable candidates here at all. He could feel Sutens evil magic even here, he didn't have long. Many of the less intelligent creatures were already behaving aggressively towards each other, on a path of certain self-destruction. Where was the hero he needed? Walruses? Too slow! Peskimons? Too stupid! He focussed on a small igloo, and heard the distant sound of music. He had chanced upon tge gine if ibe Ciik Coyote. He could`t risk direct contact .His materialisation would almost certainly be detected by the rejuvenated Suten. He would have to help the hero in more subtle ways....", "summary": "The background story of Fire & Ice is quick to tell: a coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels, you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed. The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-and-ice-the-daring-adventures-of-cool-coyote", "videos": [{"id": 114290, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kwj1NF-MATc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwj1NF-MATc", "title": "Fire and Ice [Amiga Longplay] (1992) Graftgold", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kwj1NF-MATc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
