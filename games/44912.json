A1 Games' history of released sports related games includes tennis, boxing, bowling, kickboxing, snowboarding, racing and more.\n\nAs in indoor racquetball courts, Street Racquetball's \"outdoor\" courts contain two sidewalls, a front wall, serving zones, and a receiving line -- but no ceiling. Players can opt for exhibition mode (against the computer), challenge mode (unlock new characters and courts by winning three consecutive matches), training mode (continuous rally solo play), or two-player VS mode. Three difficulty settings offer \"easy,\" \"normal.\" or \"hard\" gameplay, ball bounce levels can be adjusted to \"low,\" \"middle,\" or \"high,\" and the eight computer-controlled opponents are rated in performance level, type of game, power, speed, and skill. Shots include slams, lobs, and drop shots.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/street-racquetball"}
