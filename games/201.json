The player controls a fictional \"Valkyrie\" space fighter (converted for search and rescue duty) from a first-person view, attempting to land and pick up downed Ethercorps pilots. Some of these mountains hold anti-aircraft guns, which have to be avoided or destroyed. Due to the varied terrain, the direction finder has to be used to locate the pilots, whose visual beacons are often masked by mountain ridges.\n\nAt higher levels, the enemy Jaggis begin flying kamikaze saucers. The mission area also moves into day/night boundaries. Night missions are particularly difficult, requiring diligent use of the altimeter to avoid crashing.\n\nFlying consumes fuel. The way to replenish this supply is to rescue downed pilots who bring their remaining fuel supplies on board.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 440, "name": "Gameplay", "video_id": "FbZ-chrOgGg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbZ-chrOgGg", "title": "Atari XL/XE - Rescue on Fractalus [Lucasfilm Games] 1985", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FbZ-chrOgGg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
