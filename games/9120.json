Using a unique control system, Rau can take on multiple enemies at once, even when surrounded, and can also take out enemies with a bow, sneak up and kill with silent stealth moves, and use his magical bird Kuzo to scout the land.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-mark-of-kri", "videos": [{"id": 3591, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2kVv8AT61bw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kVv8AT61bw", "title": "The Mark of Kri trailer (PS2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2kVv8AT61bw/sddefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 7120, "name": "The Dark One"}, {"id": 7123, "name": "Tati"}, {"id": 7119, "name": "Baumusu"}, {"id": 7121, "name": "Simka"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Rau"}, {"id": 7122, "name": "Dongo"}, {"id": 7124, "name": "Mauruku"}, {"id": 5599, "name": "The Oracle"}, {"id": 56, "name": "Narrator"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
