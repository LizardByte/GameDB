You're at the bottom of the totem pole based on classic RPG lore, but will that stop you from escaping the infamous \"Hero\"?\n\nThe game has been in development (with Unity) for about a month at the time of posting this video and all of the core gameplay mechanics are in place. All that's left is level design, some music composition and a bit of sound effect magic. Oh and of course some play testing and bug fixing.\n\nI handle all of the coding and music composition for the game. I dabble in pixel art where I need assets, but I purchased both pixel art assets and sound effects from talented creators in order to make this vision a reality.\n\nI'm targeting April 2021 for the first release and I'll keep updating the game with new content and bug fixes over time!\n\nHopefully you enjoy this video as much as I've enjoyed making the game so far. I'll be following up soon with another video on how to pre-order the game.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRB73338I-o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRB73338I-o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRB73338I-o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRB73338I-o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRB73338I-o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Gob for PC/Console - Gameplay Trailer #1 (Coming 4/2021!)", "description": "Note: This is all early dev footage, obviously everything seen here is subject to change.\n\nGob is a platformer for PC/console where you play as a classic RPG slime,  jumping and sliding to avoid certain death while being chased by a sword wielding maniac.
