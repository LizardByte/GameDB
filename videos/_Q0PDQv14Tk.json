Perhaps you will find it in Tersa.\n\nCynthia, a curious young girl, finder herself in the strange and eerie world of Tersa, a place both whimsical and creepy, with bizarre creatures and unusual inhabitants. In her search for a way home, Cynthia discovers that something mystical prevents her from leaving.\n\nThis storybook tale takes place in an era of the past, before computers and smartphones, when children solved problems through exploration and creativity. It is a point-and-click narrative adventure presented in a hand-drawn style that blends childlike innocence with something darker.\n\nThe Puppet of Tersa is a five episode series. Through each episode, Cynthia delves deeper into the world of Tersa, searching for answers, making new friends, and solving puzzles and problems that will ultimately allow her to confront the mysterious force that keeps her from going home. Cynthia's story begins with the first episode, The Puppet of Tersa: A Curious Place.\n\n\nThe Puppet of Tersa Steam Page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/668780/The_Puppet_of_Tersa/\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://www.twitter.com/puppetoftersa\n\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/puppetoftersa\n\nReddit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThePuppetofTersa/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Q0PDQv14Tk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Q0PDQv14Tk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Q0PDQv14Tk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Q0PDQv14Tk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Q0PDQv14Tk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Puppet of Tersa: A Curious Place (2019) Teaser", "description": "The team at Madorium is proud to present The Puppet of Tersa: A Curious Place.
