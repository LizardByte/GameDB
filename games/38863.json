There were several adaptations, amongst other Amstrad CPC, Amiga, IBM PC compatibles. The game was released in French, English and German. Its speech synthesis was a first at the time. \n \nYou are J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lange, a famous private investigator, involved in the strange events of the Mortville Manor. The game can be solved extremely quickly if you are given the solution. After a French computer magazine published a walkthrough, allowing its readers to solve the game without even having understood the plot, an altered version was published and replaced the original. This new version was completely identical except that at a specific point in the adventure, the player had to correctly answer a series of questions about the game's plot to be allowed to continue further. \n \nThe game was written by Bernard Grelaud and Bruno Gourier, with illustrations by Dominique Sablons with Maria-Dolores. Music and voices were provided by Beatrice Langlois and Jean-Luc Langlois. \"Le Manoir de Morteveille\" was subsequently translated into English (Mick Andon) and German. A version for PC was released in 1988, adapted by Clement Roques. \n \nMortville Manor was followed by its sequel Maupiti Island, taking place on a tropical island.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/morteville-manor"}
