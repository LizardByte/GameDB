While the heroes are distracted by this new threat, Shang Tsung is able to open a portal to Outworld and retreats with his evil allies as the fortress begins to crumble around them. Escaping, Liu Kang and Kung Lao find the Wu Shi Academy under attack from Baraka and his Tarkatans. Defeating them the duo decide to meet the threat head on, despite the odds, and battle through Outworld itself to face Shao Kahn in person.", "summary": "Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is a 3D platforming adventure beat-em-up that is based in the Mortal Kombat world. The combat is fast-paced, with numerous ways to dispose of enemies, including MK signature moves and Fatalities. This kombat goes beyond what you have seen in the fighting games, among the upgrades are: The series first Multi-Directional Kombat System, Multalities (kill multiple opponents with one move), Brutalities (see red as you unleash brutal force), ko-op only team-attacks, and even character progression (earn experience to spend on upgrades to moves). The backgrounds, all based on MK and MK II arenas, come to life with numerous hazards for the Monks that they can turn on their enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
