The ball that is launched at the beginning of the battle represents the original information, an idea, and each player tries to modify it to fit their worldview.\nFrom all corners of the universe many shapes balls are sent as original information, and many more are still traveling towards this battle.\nThe players represent Nature and Chaos, each trying to win the battle to impose their vision of the world. Each scored goal is like a victory for that force, an opportunity to demonstrate its superiority over the other. As the ball travels back and forth, there is a constant clash of ideas and values, each fighting to impose its will on the other.\nThe final result of each battle reflects the balance between these two opposing forces, and can have an impact on the overall balance of the universe.\nPongo17 has become an important symbol of the constant struggle between these two forces in the universe, a battle that never ends and is always at stake.", "summary": "In Pongo17, players embody the essence of Nature and Chaos, which are captured in precious crystals that they must defend from a bouncing ball representing the original information. As they move their paddles left and right, they not only defend their crystals but also modify the original information of the ball. Along the way, they can collect power-ups symbolizing the different forces at play in this eternal struggle. These power-ups have varying effects and can tip the balance in favor of one side or the other.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pongo17", "videos": [{"id": 90718, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zkXXJztqS_U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkXXJztqS_U", "title": "Pongo17 v2.5 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zkXXJztqS_U/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90719, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kzUnMToXxHs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzUnMToXxHs", "title": "Gameplay Pongo17 v2.5", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kzUnMToXxHs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
