The screen scrolls from left to right to simulate this event seen from a third-person perspective. The road is full of different obstacles, and it is the player's task to avoid them. The obstacles vary from traps, barriers, logs, pits, etc. to a truck scattering the debris or a wolf running in the opposite direction. Doggy may be controlled to jump and move on the road up and down. The dog's energy is gradually exhausting while it is running. Bones scattered on the road may be collected to refill the dog's energy. If the energy is vanished or with each obstacle struck, the dog loses a life. There are five dog lives at the start. The best scores are stored in a high score table.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doggy--2", "videos": [{"id": 114787, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "78QY_oZARKE"}]}
