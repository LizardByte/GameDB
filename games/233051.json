If you like word games then you will love this amazing indie game. It combines word search with board and tile spelling games and real world physics to create a unique and entertaining word game experience.\nYou select the letters that can spell a word and then you arrange them into the word that you want to spell. More tiles will fall with each word that you find so your words must be long enough to prevent the board from filling up. Earn coins by finding longer words with rarer letters to buy powerups that destroy tiles and help you find even longer words.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/worded"}
