Besides updated team rosters, the most important additions are two new moves (curved passes with the after-touch system and standing headers), updated representation of athlete statistics (stars instead of numbers, each athlete has up to three specialist skills such as heading-shooting-finishing), the ability to tag an athlete (then he has a small diamond above his head during the match) and reserve teams. Smaller optical changes include animated audience or some new animations after a goal is scored. Also the active player's name is shown on the screen.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensible-world-of-soccer-95-slash-96", "videos": [{"id": 54048, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eoRAF5T0-fs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoRAF5T0-fs", "title": "Sensible World of Soccer 95/96 gameplay (PC Game, 1996)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eoRAF5T0-fs/sddefault.jpg"}]}
