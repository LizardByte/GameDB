Weapons feel better, enemies are a lot tougher, and the player can no longer quick save to try and cheese their way through situations. Play this if you're looking for a mod that actually makes some changes to the game rather than just a pack of maps set in the Half Life universe, but be sure to expect a challenge!\n\nThe mod is basically 100% focused on combat and is in some ways more of a proof of concept than a full game. So in other words there isn't really a story to speak of and it ends a bit abruptly. That being said more content is in development and everything I'm developing in this will be put to use in future work so look forward to that.\n\nI'm currently very open to any assistance from experienced developers. I have very specific goals in mind so if you're looking for a project that isn't going to wander into the unrealistic territory that kills a lot of mods, this is it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/abandon-the-town"}
