These, and all the new maps in the Vita Nova update, will put your reclamation skills to the test in interesting and unusual ways.\n\nAs you play through the campaign, Vita Nova\u2019s improved world map\u2014which is now fully 3D and can be freely rotated\u2014will give you a more accurate and personalized overview of your efforts to bring life back to this dead world.\n\nAnd thanks to the overhauled wildlife system, these transformed landscapes will feel more alive than ever. Animals emerge more naturally as you play, and have a deeper set of needs to fulfill to keep them happy and abundant. This not only adds a new dimension of strategy to the game, but gives you more animals to admire\u2014including a brand new species, the jaguar\u2014as nature is steadily restored.\n\nTerra Nil is a chill, meditative twist on the city-builder genre where you use advanced eco-tech to transform a barren, desolate wasteland into a thriving, vibrant ecosystem.
