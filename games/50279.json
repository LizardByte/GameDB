It offers a short amount of levels inspired by the original game with a full 3D engine as the main difference. Every level is built up out of blocks and the player can chip away at them Minecraft-style to break through walls and create passages. Enemies such as soldiers and dogs have exaggerated physics, causing them to stumble around. The three available weapons are throwing knives, a pistol and a shovel. The first two have a limited amount of ammo, but thrown knives can be picked up again. The shovel can be used to knock weapons out of enemies' hands. There are also health packs and by breaking through certain walls secret areas can be discovered. Instead of the typical catchphrases enemies will for instance shout 'Oktoberfest'.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-wolfenstein-hd", "videos": [{"id": 34653, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5dOLPoVWVs4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dOLPoVWVs4", "title": "Super Wolfenstein HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dOLPoVWVs4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
