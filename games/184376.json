Unlike regular Tetris however, you are given multiple pieces at once, and you can swap between controlling one or another at any given time. You clear blocks by either making solid lines, or by filling square regions of at least 5 blocks by 5 blocks. The former increases the speed of the blocks' fall, the latter makes you move on to more and more complex pieces.\n\nTry Arcade mode to see how far you go and push for higher scores, or race in Time Trial to set record times! You can also play Arcade mode in local Co-op between a keyboard player and a controller player, or have a custom game of Arcade mode where you can change various settings, from what pieces you get to how many at once are falling or even the size of the board.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-juggle-trouble", "videos": [{"id": 108074, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Gy49LeQ0oTw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy49LeQ0oTw", "title": "[Puzzle Juggle Trouble] 2-Player Co-op gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gy49LeQ0oTw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
