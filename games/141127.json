Literally every minute someone in the town becomes sick and can no longer work. \nYou will have to examine and cure sick bunnies by making prescription medicines for them. \nSometimes it seems that there is no end to the patients and you will have to open new hospitals, or even better, take friends with you and look after the sick together. \n \nEven when it seems that the situation is hopeless and you cannot save your patient, this is not the end. You can always revive the bunny with the great power of the Artifact. But remember that you have to pay for everything. \n \nEach patient will bring you a reputation, depending on your actions, which will be needed to open new hospitals, as well as to buy medical outfit. \nIf your reputation falls below zero, then you will no longer be able to accept patients. But don't worry - there are no irreparable situations. Earn a reputation by working with the locals to mine crystals. All for the good of the hospital. \n \nAnd don't forget that good doctors wear masks, robes and wash their paws.", "summary": "Doctor Bunny is a doctor simulator.
