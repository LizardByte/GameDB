On the other end is a wall made of bricks or blocks. The ball travels down to the wall and knocks out a brick. It then returns to your end where you must use a squarish paddle to send the ball back to the wall. If the ball gets past the paddle, you lose a ball.\n\nIn the computer version, you must knock out all the bricks of the wall to advance. Each level has more bricks per wall. You begin with 5 balls. In the console version, you must knock out 57 of the 72 bricks to advance. Each level has 72 bricks but the number of balls will lower in later levels. Level 1 starts with 99 balls.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3-d-brickaway", "videos": [{"id": 54696, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1czfZh1xnKE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czfZh1xnKE", "title": "3-D Brickaway for the TRS-80 CoCo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1czfZh1xnKE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
