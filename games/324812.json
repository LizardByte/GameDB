Players explore and conquer quest mode (single player) with character cards to obtain treasure chests, train and customize their character cards, and explore deck construction that suits their strategy, such as focusing on preemptive action, attack, defense, or overall balance. Not only do trained character cards increase their HP and attack/defense stats, but they also learn special moves unique to each character, which, when conditions are right, can deal significant damage and battle effects to enemies.\n\nDeck construction is also a crucial factor when battling other players in Duel Mode (PvP), so build your deck carefully yet boldly.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/unlight-revive"}
