Typically, you start with a small ranch that can be extended by breeding herds and trading cattle. Indians, bandits and bounty hunters will be on the look-out, so you need to hire gunslingers in the saloons to protect your property. As the ranch grows into a small community, different buildings can be constructed: houses, cowboy quarters, sheds, storehouses... After a while, you can also build your own towns with banks, hotels, churches, railroads, saloons and a sheriff's office.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/far-west"}
