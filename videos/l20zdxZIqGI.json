{"id": "l20zdxZIqGI", "snippet": {"title": "Zombie Raid (Arcade) Longplay", "description": "Zombie Raid is a 2D rail shooter, similar to Beast Busters, where the main hero is Detective Edward Windsor. Players use guns to shoot the zombies and other monsters. Main weapon is handgun, but in game are other weapons like automatic handgun, shotgun and fire rifle. Players shouldn't shoot innocent people.\n\nIn 1918 England, a small village suffers a rash of kidnappings and grave-robbing incidents, and heavily armed zombies have begun to emerge. With the job too dangerous for the police to handle, private detective Edward Windsor begins to investigate. Following a shootout in the village cemetery, Edward rescues a man named Charles, and the two join forces to infiltrate a nearby castle where the zombies have originated. They become separated upon entering the castle, with Edward falling into a subterranean dungeon and having to fight his way out. Shortly after Edward and Charles reunite, Charles is fatally shot; however, an infection he has acquired mutates him into a hideous monster and Edward is forced to fight him in order to continue. Edward moves through the castle laboratory only to find Charles - mutated into a new form - waiting to battle him again at the exit.\n\nBecome a member of the channel to gain access to several benefits:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1TZpzSkPL27rUpVenRLaw/join\n\nTimestamps\n(Intro) 00:00\n(Stage 1) 01:18\n(First Boss) 10:09\n(Stage 2) 12:00\n(Stage 3) 15:33\n(Second Boss) 22:11\n(Stage 4) 22:31\n(Third Boss) 27:09\n(Stage 5) 29:40\n(Fourth Boss) 34:36\n(Final Boss) 36:55\n(Credits) 41:35", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l20zdxZIqGI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l20zdxZIqGI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l20zdxZIqGI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l20zdxZIqGI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l20zdxZIqGI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Zombie Raid (Arcade) Longplay", "description": "Zombie Raid is a 2D rail shooter, similar to Beast Busters, where the main hero is Detective Edward Windsor.
