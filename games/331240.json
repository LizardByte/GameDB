From the underworld rose an evil beyond comprehension. His legion swept across the land, twisting life into decay. Cities crumbled, forests withered, and the people of Kuru, once the heart of civilization, became prisoners in their own world.\n\nThe Masters fought, but even their might could not turn the tide. Desperation took hold as hope faded, until a child was found. Marked by an immense power within their Core, they became the last hope against the darkness.\n\nWhy are you here? What is the true nature of the Core? What happens if you fail?\n\nThe Trials have been set. Survive, grow stronger, and uncover the truth buried within Amargi\u2019s past.", "summary": "Core Trials is a motion-based, pixel-art bullet hell you play using just your webcam.
