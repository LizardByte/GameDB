You have only three lives, but you do have one advantage - your car can fly for a limited distance, allowing you to avoid obstacles if you're quick enough! All this and more makes Burnin' Rubber the car race of the century!", "summary": "Burnin' Rubber is an unlicensed Bump 'N' Jump clone. It is a futuristic top-down scrolling racing game where the track has no curves, but narrows and widens. There are potholes, breaks in the roads and islands that must be swerved around or jumped over. There are plenty of other cars abound, which try to run you off the road and can be bumped off the track also.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 55205, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bMUEyk2D_wA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMUEyk2D_wA", "title": "C64-Longplay - Burning Rubbers (720p)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bMUEyk2D_wA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
