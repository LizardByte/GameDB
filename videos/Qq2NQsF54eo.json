Conduct electronic symphonies with your lightning powers, wield magical tuneblades, and achieve a euphoric state of trance through skillful play.\n\nThe player's abilities to fight and defeat enemies are divided into three categories: Strikes, dashes and holds. Strikes are the most common and will let you fast-attack the enemy with flashy fireballs. The dash makes you dodge and counter enemy attacks. The hold makes you deal enough lightning damage to shame even the greatest gods of mythology.\n\nKlang 2s not only the ideal introduction to the Klang universe, but all things rhythm-action!\n\nKey features:\n\n- Techno-greek aesthetic is inspired by synthwave, musical symbolism and greek sculpture.\n\n- 30 levels of intense EDM-Action. Playable at both normal and fast speed for extra challenge.\n\n- Semi-procedural combat system ensuring the same track never plays exactly the same.\n\n- Several boss types gradually changing the rules of engagement.\n\n- Music by the legendary composer bLiNd, and other extremely talented artists such as James Landino, Arcien, Nhato, Steven Silo, City Girl etc.\n\n- Playable with numerous control inputs such as: Mouse, gamepad, drawing tablet and touch.\n\n- The story of a rhythm-warrior obsessed with taking revenge on Soundlord Sonus under the guidance of the artificial intelligence \u201cA-Eye\u201d.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2NQsF54eo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2NQsF54eo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2NQsF54eo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2NQsF54eo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2NQsF54eo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Klang 2 - Steam Launch Trailer", "description": "Klang 2 launches on Steam October 20th!\n\nWISHLIST ON STEAM!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1111600/Klang_2/\n\nCOMING SOON TO CONSOLES!\n----------------------\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tinimations\nJoin Klang's discord!: https://discord.gg/rYdg4Pe\n\nKlang 2 is a psychedelic rhythm-action game, blindly pursuing full immersion with dance music through high-speed combat.
