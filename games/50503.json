Double score and make him jealous! \n\u25cb Collect - buy new color themes that would make the gameplay brighter! \n\u25cb Got bored? - it doesn't matter if you became the GOD of normal game or just looking for some new experience. Try new modes, they are even more impressive >:) \n\u25cb Achieve - beat records, die, earn. Collect achivements. No pain no gain. \n\u25cb Find your love - Cause God loves everyone. \n \nIn the future updates we want to add some new high scores, play modes, player and world skins.
