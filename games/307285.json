The TERA is a lightweight adaptation of the Type 38 that was originally designed for Japanese Paratroopers, this rifle is incredibly fast to equip and aim down the sight. With low levels of recoil, it provides both accuracy and a rapid rate of fire in the right hands.\n\nDesigned to be a light, reliable and mass-produced weapon, the Grease Gun is an SMG with great mobility that is very easy to control, even under sustained firing, thanks to its low rate of fire and recoil. Despite its low muzzle velocity, the stability and control on offer make it a solid choice for slightly longer ranged combat encounters.\n\nFinally, the Liberator Skin celebrates the liberation of Paris. Karl can now sport a classic French Resistance appearance complete with signature armband.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sniper-elite-5-saboteur-weapon-and-skin-pack"}
