They were to be raised as mages and work as the town's guardians after their training completed. However, after the ten years, the girls suddenly rebelled against Ragishss and killed him. During the harsh magic battle, the entire town was entombed underground and a barrier spell was placed on it, preventing anyone from leaving, including the maidens who terrorized the town. The four maidens were soon to be known as Four Witches of Kathtom.\n\nRance sets out with Sill to defeat the four witches and save the city from their grasp, however, as the story progresses, they find out that the witches had their personalities altered and twisted by the power of the rings they wear. The rings greatly enhance a user's magical potential, but can only be used by maidens. Having said that, the only way to release them from the rings is to have their virginity taken, and who else but Rance is up for such a job?", "summary": "Rance II: Rebellious Maidens is the second game of the Rance Series, remade in 2009 and released in Alice 2010. The game is a turn-based dungeon crawler RPG with a top-down interface. Throughout the game, Rance may gain new party members, though further customization, such as organizing equipment, are unavailable for some.\n\nThe remake released in 2010 is nothing but a graphical update, retaining the exact same gameplay, storyline, script and engine to the ones used in the original Rance II from 1990, so any pages related directly to Rance II will use information and images from the remade version for better visuals.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rance-02-the-rebellious-maidens"}
