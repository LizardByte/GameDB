Formation Soccer uses a vertical-scrolling view of the pitch.\n\nThe game was designed and released to coincide with the 1990 World Cup event set in Italy. It features sixteen teams, though only eleven of those actually qualified for the World Cup. The player can choose between a single game Exhibition mode and a tournament \"Human Cup\" mode to choose between.\n\nTeams\nThe following sixteen teams could be selected for use in either mode:\n\nItaly (the hosts)\nBrazil\nThe Netherlands\nU.S.S.R.\nArgentina\nWest Germany\nDenmark (Denmark did not actually qualify for the 1990 World Cup)\nEngland\nSpain\nFrance (France did not actually qualify for the 1990 World Cup)\nUruguay\nPoland (Poland did not actually qualify for the 1990 World Cup)\nYugoslavia\nUSA\nMexico (Mexico was disqualified during the qualification process)\nJapan (Japan did not actually qualify for the 1990 World Cup)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/formation-soccer-human-cup-90", "collections": [{"id": 3214, "name": "Formation Soccer"}]}
