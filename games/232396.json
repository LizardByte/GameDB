An uncanny catastrophe maroons Lillie Flora Pine in distant Switch Rock Light Station.\nWhere you go, Lillie goes - across the room, up the spiral stairs, or into the drink. Explore an atmospheric world between rolling seas and endless skies. Your iPhone or iPad is your controller. Examine objects. Operate machinery. Read logbooks. And try to ignore \u201cMrs. Noonday.\u201d\nBecause Lillie is not an ordinary hero. Only 15, she suffers from intrusive thoughts. Now, they\u2019re her only companion.\nBecause Lillie is the keeper.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lillie-is-the-keeper"}
