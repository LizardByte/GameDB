SpongeBob opens the chest and finds a magic bottle, which, upon rubbing it, releases doubloons all over Bikini Bottom and releases The Flying Dutchman. The Flying Dutchman tells SpongeBob that he will take Gary to work on his ship for all eternity; after briefly leaving to check on his ship, he makes good on this promise.\n\nSpongeBob proceeds to travel across seven different worlds to recover letter tiles; there are nine in each world, which spell out his name, and each set leads to a treasure. These treasures, as explained by one of Squidward's books on \"How to Defeat Evil Spirits\", are personal possessions from when the Dutchman was alive, which can apparently weaken him; according to the book, collecting all seven will make SpongeBob immune to the Dutchman's hypnotizing spell, allowing him to put up a fight to save Bikini Bottom.", "summary": "A treasure turns into a terror in SpongeBob Squarepants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman. While cruising through Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob discovers several treasure chests. Ignoring the warning signs, SpongeBob opens the chests, only to discover he has released the Flying Dutchman--an angry ghost that now wants to make SpongeBob and his friends part of his crew. As you help SpongeBob stop the Dutchman from wreaking havoc in Bikini Bottom, you change costumes, collect gold coins, and interact with all your favorite characters from the TV show.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spongebob-squarepants-revenge-of-the-flying-dutchman", "videos": [{"id": 4524, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jU6VWzBbhaA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU6VWzBbhaA", "title": "Trailer [2002] - SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jU6VWzBbhaA/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3114, "name": "SpongeBob SquarePants"}]}
