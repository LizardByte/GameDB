Servants of evil turn on their evil brethren tearing them limb from limb and place their spoils on display, while others sacrifice their own flesh to bring suffering and destruction. Pregnant bellies ripe of demonseed threaten to overwhelm resistance, but the tide is turning, and it's time to rise again and reclaim the cities, forests and mountains.\n\nAfter the Fall is a limit-removing episode made by various members of Doomer Boards, featuring 7 maps of explosive Doom action and monsterless credit maps. This month's project is a sequel to Fall of Society, both led by Glenzinho.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/after-the-fall--1"}
