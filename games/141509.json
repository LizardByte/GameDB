The reworked gameplay elements take general influence from the self-proclaimed Persona series' turn-based combat and dungeon crawling format with the sprinkles of the Sonic series' charm into the mix as well. The game features various types of differentiating gamemodes to experience and waste your time while you are in the Dark Hour. Either if you climb your way to the top of the tower or explore the secrets down below, there's more than enough replayability after many playthroughs. Alternatively, if you ever get tired playing alone, grab some friends and form a party instead! With LAN and Online Play, you can have up to 16 players run through the floors with little to no added restrictions. Challenge yourself through deadly shadow creatures and make it out alive through the painful trials of this hellish journey.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-robo-blast-2-persona", "videos": [{"id": 107386, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XLiUvasd5sY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLiUvasd5sY", "title": "Sonic The Hedgehog But It's Actually Persona - Sonic Robo Blast 2: Persona", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLiUvasd5sY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
