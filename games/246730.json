It was created by Martin Braid in 1995. The initial release had a virus, so it was taken down temporarily. It was re-released in 1996 by Magnus Andersson.\n\nDue to the open-sourced nature of Klik and Play, Sonic Boom later re-appeared in saxman's Sonic Klik & Play Collection along with demos of Sonic PC and Tails and the Quest of 100 Rings. It was also re-released as Rotor Boom by Ian Klukan, the Archie character Rotor Walrus replacing Sonic.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-boom--2"}
