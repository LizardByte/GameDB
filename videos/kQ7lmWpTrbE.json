She was once a commoner, but due to her beauty, the king wanted her to become his foster daughter, but with a condition- as long as she agreed to be wedded in the future for political reasons. She accepted.\n\nHer peaceful life came to an end after the prime minister Reviens Tendre rebelled. His capabilities as a prime minister were so excellent that other countries were once trying to recruit him. However, he became overwhelmed by the protagonist Snow White\u2019s beauty, and escaped in women\u2019s clothing for reasons unknown. Reviens had killed every last member of the royal family but the protagonist, and became the country\u2019s ruler as its \u201cqueen\u201d. The protagonist had become the sole remaining member of the royal family. From then on, her life in confinement began.\n\nOne day, three years later, the protagonist had finally managed to escape and ventured into a deep forest. There, she met a group of individuals who hold a grudge against the \u201cqueen\u201d, known as \u201cThe Alliance of Seven\u201d. Even though he had treated the protagonist heartlessly thus far, in truth, the \u201cqueen\u201d apparently is in love with her. Since the protagonist escaped his clutches, he has become half-crazed. Will the protagonist, the last surviving member of the royal family, be able to take back her country? Like the poisoned apple, this story is sinister, yet enchanting. DONE!                                                   I don't know why I do this, but I will keep doing. I hope you guys enjoy :) but if you don't.... WHATEVER!
