In 2119, fearing extinction, Earth built gigantic seedships designed as \"arks\" to propel people and the sum of human knowledge across the stars. One of these seedships, the UNS Calypso, is sent to Beta Caeli star system which is the farthest colony attempted yet. In 2135, a second seedship, the UNS Tantalus, is dispatched to the same destination in order to better the chances of human survival. The Tantalus is equipped with a more advanced fusion engine and thus will reach Beta Caeli some 21 years ahead of the Calypso. The player takes the role of the Calypso's captain. There is no sign of the Tantalus. All you have are some 5000 colonists, past radio transmissions and a few key advisers to help you colonize this new unfamiliar solar system.\n\nYou command the ship UNS Calypso with the refugees of the interstellar war. Your new home is 55 light-years from Earth. You must succeed in preserving the human race starting with only what you brought with you. You must explore planets and look for vital resources and places suitable for new colonies in the extremely hostile environment.", "summary": "Alien Legacy is a sci-fi strategy game developed by Ybarra Productions and published by Sierra On-Line in 1994 for MS-DOS.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-legacy", "videos": [{"id": 10354, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "jqPbVnxiYUo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqPbVnxiYUo", "title": "Alien Legacy gameplay (PC Game, 1994)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jqPbVnxiYUo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 121955, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "UXhdeyEqRIA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXhdeyEqRIA", "title": "Sneak Peeks 2: Alien Legacy trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UXhdeyEqRIA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
