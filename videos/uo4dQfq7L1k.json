In SimSafari players are able to build and manage their own Safari park, with the goal of reaching five stars. The game has players managing their camp (for visitors), the village (for hiring staff), and the wildlife reserve. All three areas are interconnected. For example, if things are going poorly for the villagers, they may begin to poach your animals for money. Staff are hired by the village to help run the visitor's camp, which in turn is affected by what animals live on your reservation. Food webs are also an important part of the game, with the player needing to balance the park's ecosystem and keep the \"big five\" of elephants, lions, leopards, rhinos, and water buffalo up to satisfy the visitors. The game is pretty fun overall, but extremely shallow for how complex the game mechanics are. There is a  collection of scenarios if the player wants a goal to achieve, and a number of disasters the player can unleash, like fire or a heatwave, but overall the game is fairly straight to the point and open ended.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uo4dQfq7L1k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uo4dQfq7L1k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uo4dQfq7L1k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Lets Play - SimSafari [Windows]", "description": "*Note:* This is really a quick play, but given its length I decided to label it as a Lets Play instead.
