Now you can be a player in the game behind the game. Arrange trades and close deals, find that hot new talent in the farm leagues and draft him up to the majors. Keep one eye on the competition and the other on the bottom line as you work to turn your team into an unstoppable juggernaut on the road to the cup!\n\nBuild accurate emulations of any team from any year and play the fantasy games that you've only dreamed of. Imagine, the 1970 Bruins versus the 1987 Oilers face to face in the most incredible play off series of all time! Or, build an invincible All Star Team and take on all challengers!\n\nThe choice is yours- this time you're in charge!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hockey-league-simulator"}
