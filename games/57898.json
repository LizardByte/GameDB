These characters wander about automatically, defeating enemies they encounter and passing through levels to reach bosses. The levels are all optional (the player can simply drag a character to the next sign to skip levels), but to unlock the following stage the player has to kill the boss at the end of each stage.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stick-ranger"}
