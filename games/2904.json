After Scrooge rescues them, he finds Big Time Beagle in his office with a painting in his hands. With the help of Duckworth, Big Time is defeated and retreats. The painting reveals the locations of five treasures, and Scrooge wastes no time to set out for them. Scrooge and Launchpad visit the Amazon to find the Sceptre of the Incan King. Using eight golden coins, they uncover the hidden temple of Manco Capquack, but the sceptre is lost and the temple is destroyed by its guardian statue. The chief of the natives then approaches Scrooge and Launchpad and thanks them for returning their city to them, and gives Scrooge the recovered sceptre in return, which was just the king's back scratcher. Scrooge, the nephews and Webby visit the castle of Drake Von Vladstone, also known as Dracula Duck, who was the heir to the Coin of the Lost Realm. The boys fall into a trap door and are spread throughout the Transylvanian mansion, but Scrooge saves them from the Beagle Boys, disguised as ghosts. Each of the beagle boys were also carrying a torn sheet of paper which contained part of a riddle. They uncover a mirror where Scrooge solves the riddle, and Magica De Spell reveals herself, who is also after the coin. Scrooge and Magica then face off for it, and the sorceress is defeated and retreats empty-handed. Scrooge and the nephews travel to the African Mines to find the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth, but they find the workers are being scared off by voices and earthquakes, claiming the mine is haunted. Deep underground, Scrooge discovers that the Terra-Firmians and their games are the cause, and after interfering he is attacked by their king. Defeated, the king makes an agreement with Scrooge to stop the games in exchange for the mining operations to continue, as it will rid them of the diamonds they consider to be \"garbage rocks\". He gives Scrooge the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth to start with.", "summary": "DuckTales Remastered takes the classic Disney platforming adventure to a whole new level. All of the visuals from the 8-bit game have been beautifully re-created as hand-drawn and animated sprites, across a backdrop of luscious, re-envisioned level backgrounds. Furthermore, original Disney Character Voices talent, including some from the cartoon TV series, bring in-game characters to life with charm and wit, while the classic melodies of the original soundtrack are given a modern twist. The game also features an all new tutorial level where players can get familiar with the iconic pogo jump and cane swing, while Scrooge McDuck's Museum allows players to track all their stats and compare their progress with others via global leaderboards.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 47308, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "0sKAkm1dhFI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sKAkm1dhFI", "title": "DuckTales: Remastered Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0sKAkm1dhFI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47309, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uut4GAf1cyc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uut4GAf1cyc", "title": "DuckTales: Remastered - Mega Mix 2014 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uut4GAf1cyc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47310, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "arDt9KqYilY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arDt9KqYilY", "title": "DuckTales Remastered [Complete Game] - No Commentary", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/arDt9KqYilY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47311, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "7RisptiSnRI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RisptiSnRI", "title": "DuckTales Remastered: Behind the Scenes \"Duckumentary\" #1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7RisptiSnRI/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 6781, "name": "Scrooge McDuck"}, {"id": 2172, "name": "Huey"}, {"id": 4394, "name": "Bubba"}, {"id": 6778, "name": "Bigtime Beagle"}, {"id": 6769, "name": "Magica De Spell"}, {"id": 6766, "name": "Fenton Crackshell"}, {"id": 6771, "name": "Mrs. Beakley"}, {"id": 6768, "name": "Gyro Gearloose"}, {"id": 6780, "name": "Terra Firmie King"}, {"id": 6773, "name": "Bouncer Beagle"}, {"id": 6776, "name": "Louie"}, {"id": 6775, "name": "Launchpad McQuack"}, {"id": 6767, "name": "Gizmoduck"}, {"id": 6772, "name": "Duckworth"}, {"id": 6779, "name": "Baggy Beagle"}, {"id": 6777, "name": "Webby"}, {"id": 4523, "name": "Dewey"}, {"id": 2127, "name": "Worker"}, {"id": 2588, "name": "Computer Voice"}, {"id": 6770, "name": "Flintheart Glomgold"}, {"id": 6774, "name": "Burger Beagle"}]}
