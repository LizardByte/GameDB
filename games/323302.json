You bomb planes to earn treasure and get new high scores. You can use that treasure to purchase skins and use those in game. The main gimmick of your cannon is that you only have one bomb. Every time the bomb leaves the screen you get it back. The cannon is stationary, but you can rotate in place at a set speed. The game mechanics include 30-second waves of planes that change direction and location every wave, speed increases per each wave, an explosive grenade that spawns after you shoot 15 times, and intense situations coupled with high-speed gameplay. You can track your best scores with the scores tab in the menu, and compete with your friends to get the best score. Good luck!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cannoneer", "videos": [{"id": 133931, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lYq-3lDS6Eo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYq-3lDS6Eo", "title": "Cannoneer Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lYq-3lDS6Eo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
