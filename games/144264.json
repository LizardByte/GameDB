It is widely considered as the first WAD to use the ZDoom hub system inherited from Hexen, combined with ACS-scripted cutscenes, which was not a simple proof of concept. Due to this, it is listed as one of the Top 100 WADs of All Time by Doomworld. Released on May 21, 1999, it originally received mixed responses, with some community members complaining that extensive scripting interfered with Doom's gameplay. Nevertheless, Tei Tenga has been described as \"the wad that got ZDoom on its feet\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/assault-on-tei-tenga"}
