The game has three modes: exhibition, team management, and new player debut. Exhibition mode allows the player to select from a wide variety of wrestlers and compete in single, double, or tag-team (six wrestlers) fashions. New player debut puts the player in the role of popular wrestlers from the franchise, taking them through training sessions and a series of matches."}
