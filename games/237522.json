The player takes the returning role of the HECU marine Adrian Shephard from Half-Life: Opposing Force on a trip to the zombie-infested European town of Ravenholm. It was planned to take place after the events of Half-Life 2 but before the end of Half-Life 2: Episode Two. The concept of a Ravenholm-centered episode was inherited by Arkane after Junction Point Studios' own project was cancelled. Arkane's project was eventually cancelled by Valve as well much to the dismay of its developers, who were \"extremely emotionally invested\" in the project.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/return-to-ravenholm"}
