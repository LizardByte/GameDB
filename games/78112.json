One player need only one hand and half of gamepad to play the game. Players split into two teams. You can play as an defective robot, where your goal is to destroy as many robots as you can, or you can play as an overseer to seek and find defective robots. Gameplay is heavily inspired by Hidden in Plain Sight. With Overlook we want to push Hidden in Plain Sight to the next level. \n \nYou can support us on Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1389951827/overlook-local-multiplayer-game-up-to-16-players?ref=ahkvjy \n \n# Overview \n \nOverlook is a game of moves plays and observation skills. It\u2019s ideal for a small or big group of friends. Put your skills to the test and find out who can outplay the rest! You will often have to keep a cool head and try to mislead the opposite team in order to achieve victory. It\u2019s not an easy task \u2013 the clock is ticking and time isn\u2019t always in your favour. You will have to split into two teams choosing between infected robots and overseers. Thanks to game\u2019s flexibility and party gameplay features Overlook supports 2-16 players on a single PC or console (up to 8 gamepads required). \n \n# Two Teams \n## Defective Robots \nWhen game starts you see a map full of robots. Your first goal is\u2026 to locate yourself! Try not to move too quickly because overseers are watching! When you establish your current position it\u2019s time to infect as many robots as you can. Keep in mind that the game hides the position of infected robots until overseer puts his marker on top of them. This allows you to move freely and spread the infection, if you remain far away from your opponent\u2019s markers. Put your skill to test and try to mislead the opposite team for as long as you can. Don\u2019t get caught red-handed! \n \n## Overseers \nYour job is to find players from the other team and remove them from the game. Move your marker along the map and try to locate infected robots. You can examine the status of the robots only by pointing directly at them. Move quickly and try to find out who is spreading the infection! If you find any robot suspicious, mark your target and watch the tongs remove it from the game. Be careful \u2013 the number of your hits is limited!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 17167, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eVFFkfqHlec", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVFFkfqHlec", "title": "Overlook Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eVFFkfqHlec/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 19524, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jXR0dHV-sbw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXR0dHV-sbw", "title": "WOF App Store June 2017", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jXR0dHV-sbw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
