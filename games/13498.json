Each season lasts 20 weeks, with the choice of three races in a meeting every week if you choose to race a horse. You start the game with \u00a35000 and before a meeting you have various options for your horses and yourself, which cost you money. Give your horses a workout, treat their injuries, get a loan and retain a jockey. Once you are happy with your selections, you are then shown your horses and their fitness, class and race stats. You also have the option to sell a horse.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/classic-trainer"}
