The game runs on Namco NA-1 hardware, was the first game on this hardware to be released outside Japan (Bakuretsu Quiz Ma-Q Dai B\u014dken was the first overall) and is the only game from the company that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \"Winners Don't Use Drugs\" screen in its attract sequence with vertical orientation (the two titles that displayed it previously, Tank Force and Steel Gunner 2, both displayed it with horizontal orientation)."}
