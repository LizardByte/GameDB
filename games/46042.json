It's in the style of Boulderdash and Repton, and sees you as a \nsmall robot-type thingie scuttling around an underground land of manic \nmayhem. Your job is to collect all the on-screen diamonds, digging \nyour way through the soil and dodging the stones and stuff that get \ndislodged and drop on your head (or not as the case may be). There are \ntrillions of other features (see box-off) and with 32 fun-packed \nlevels you won't be finishing it too quickly, that's as damn sure as \nmustard!"}
