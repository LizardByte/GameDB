Unusually, the screen is split horizontally, with your action only ever using half of the screen. You can play a full season of races, or run at one of the 12 tracks as a stand-alone race (including Assen, Mugello, the old Hockenheim and Spa). A manual gearbox option and 3 skill levels ensure that you can't master the game immediately. Full information on your speed and revs, the race order and course layout are on screen at all times. \n \nSuperbike Challenge is an updated version of Grand Prix 500 cc, with a better menu and title screen and some different in-game graphics.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/superbike-challenge"}
