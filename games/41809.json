You choose the colour of the court. You choose the colour of the uniforms. You choose the players for your team just as you would in real life. Every player has strong and weak points and each of them improves as the game progresses. You can move them on and off the court just as you like. \nYou are the coach! \n \nYou device the strength of the opposing team. You decide how long the game will be. There are a wide range of formation tactics to choose from. The game is fast and exciting. \n \nThe rules are almost the same as in a real-life game, but you can make variations. \nThis is the first time ever that RPG (role-playing game) software has been available in a video sports game. \n \nAre you ready for DUNKSHOT?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dunkshot"}
