Well, you\u2019re in luck, because the Cymanti have come from the heart of the wetlands to infest the Square through the power of gigantic bugs and poisonous fungus!\n\nThe Cymanti are a breakout group of Polytopians who moved to the swampy forests long ago and learned to live in symbiosis with the incredible Ciru Bug, which attaches to their faces and merges with their brains! These bug-loving Polytopians cultivate fungus that they use to feed their population and defend themselves from invaders! Led by a mystical Shaman, the Cymanti train gigantic bugs, use their enemies to fertilize their fungi farms, and bathe their foes in crippling poisons to vanquish all who would threaten their marshy home!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-battle-of-polytopia-cymanti"}
