The game is set around a beautiful lakeside cabin in the heart of Finland during the midsummer solstice when the long evening gradually turns into dawn without ever visiting the night.\nEvery year you travel to this beautiful and remote part of the world to visit your oldest friend who lives an isolated life off the grid. Except this year for some reason and without warning, she\u2019s not at home.\nAs you search for the clues that might help you find your friend, things start taking a strange turn. Are you succumbing to cabin fever or could rumours of a mysterious lake creature actually explain her disappearance?\nAn avid social media user, you post regular photos and updates to your friends and followers. The tone you select for those interactions will go some way to determining whether you come through this experience unscathed.\n\n\nDeveloper\u2019s Commentary\n\nI wanted to create a game inspired by my love of nature and the folklore that surrounds it. Growing up in Finland meant I spent a lot of time swimming in lakes and hearing about the N\u00e4kki, a creature used to scare children away from dangerous waters. \nI also wanted my game to feel contemporary and more in line with how people behave and interact in 2020. For better or worse we use our phones for almost everything so I wanted that to be a key narrative device. \nI also made a deliberate decision to have only female characters, apart from the N\u00e4kki, because women are awesome.\nFinally, in terms of gameplay and general atmosphere I wanted to create an experience that was suspenseful, relaxing and slightly tongue in cheek. \n\nPress and review requests to contact(at)inkakamu.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9pf83NpaIdw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9pf83NpaIdw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9pf83NpaIdw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9pf83NpaIdw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9pf83NpaIdw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "I hope she's ok - Official Trailer", "description": "Official trailer for I hope she's ok, an indie game developed by inkakamu and available to buy from Steam from Friday 13th November 2020 https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384490/I_hope_shes_ok/  \n\n\nDescription\n\n\u201cI hope she\u2019s ok\u201d is an atmospheric mystery inspired by Nordic folklore.
