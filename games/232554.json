That relative is no more meaning that the player has inherited a cottage in the tiny hamlet of Little Hodcome. After a bit of not-too-productive research, 'Where is this place?', off you trot to meet the estate agent.\n\nNaturally, this being an adventure, all is not well in the English countryside and the object of the game is to uncover and vanquish whatever evil force lurks there.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-secret-of-little-hodcome"}
