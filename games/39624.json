At this moment, their great ships are arriving at major cities around the globe preparing to conquer and claim what is rightfully theirs... the human race.\n\nTo stop the invasion you must complete 4 separate missions by defeating the invading aliens that are abducting and mutating humans, snatching monuments and creating havoc in the world.
