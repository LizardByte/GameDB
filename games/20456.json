After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team's members. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. It soon becomes very clear that it isn't just any mansion, but a hellish place where the undead walk the corridors and other horrors are lurking in the darkness, waiting to eat some heads.", "summary": "Resident Evil: Deadly Silence is an enhanced version of the original Resident Evil for the Nintendo DS. It was made to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the series. The key difference with the original game is the use of the dual screen and touch sensitive formats, among many gameplay additions. A primary map is displayed on the second screen, providing extra help in finding the important areas of the mansion. The lower touch screen can be used to open locks or, in a special 1st person perspective addition, fight off various versions of the evil dead. The game also includes wireless LAN support for up to four players with two different multiplayer game modes.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-deadly-silence", "videos": [{"id": 8943, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "N8VIBw7l0Bg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8VIBw7l0Bg", "title": "Resident Evil Deadly Silence Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N8VIBw7l0Bg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
