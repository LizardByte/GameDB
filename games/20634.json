The objective of the game is to progress through each level, defeating enemies and huge bosses. Vehicle and player health slowly regenerate, while vehicles can be instantly repaired with a special pick-up item. Once your vehicle is destroyed, you run around on foot. You're limited to a weak machine gun, but get double points for destroyed enemies. Once you lose all your health, you lose a life. After about 10 seconds of being on foot, your vehicle respawns.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
