Yup, nothing weird or special. There\u2019s no game in it. Also, screensavers would be very useful on a device with a cathode-ray tube monitor. Or perhaps some OLED screen. That\u2019s not what Playdate is. However, you can still chill with the screensavers. And loading. Oh my, there\u2019s a lot of loading and you won\u2019t be standing idly by.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stars-of-the-screen--1"}
