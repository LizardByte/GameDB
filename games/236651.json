While immortal, these gods possessed every human weaknesses. Chief among them, jealousy.\nA new goddess awoke, born of pure light and goodness, who quickly gained power and influence. This threatened many of the other gods.\nThe gods waged war to defeat the new-born goddess and sealed her away for eternity in a cosmic void.\nOver time, the goddess transformed into a planet called Atus giving birth to a multitude of diverse creatures.\nOver the course of many ages, the seal which bound the goddess gradually loosened, and the magic power of the goddess began to escape and permeate inside and outside of the planet. Time and space could not withstand such power and cracks began to appear, forming a strange Broken Land.\n\nPlayers select a hero and choose a weapon and talents before entering the battle. The first team to kill the boss wins, but beware, either team can enter portals that appear in the arena and teleport to the opponent's field of battle to launch an ambush. What your strategy depends on the battle situation - do you race to the finish, or sabotage the enemy?", "summary": "Tearing Spaces is a competitive NFT game where players battle it out to earn tokens and rewards.
