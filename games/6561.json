Dr. Zero has survived the events of the last game thanks to the time-travel of his brother Dr. Zeke and now has the rank Legend0. To fight him, Cody needs to defeat the rank holders of Majiko. While many of them have hidden the XStones needed to battle them, Cody is able to secure them via time-travel. During this, Cody will fight against three Robopon user cyborgs created by Dr. Zero. Finally, Cody often encounters the comically underpowered Nick D who seeks to collect a XStone to sell to support his orphanage and duels with him over them.", "summary": "After becoming the Legend 1 of Porombo Island in the original game, Cody sets off to a new land, and a new tournament. Things take a turn for the worse when a violent storm destroys Cody's boat, and sends him adrift at sea. He awakens inside a shack in the land of Majiko but all is not well. He discovers that the nearby lands are being terrorized by the Maskman and his cronies. In order to put things right, Cody must travel back 20 years into the past and back again.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/robopon-2-cross-version", "videos": [{"id": 87282, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Ngkg2SxFdU0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngkg2SxFdU0", "title": "Robopon 2 Cross Version Speedrun - 4:48:35 (Emulator)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ngkg2SxFdU0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
