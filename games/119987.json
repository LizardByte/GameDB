Flip, ski, dive, fall down, rage, get up, parkour on!\n\nThe controls in 'That Flipping Mountain' are simple in concept, but require some practice to get a feel for the inertia of the flip. The launch and flip mechanic has been honed, tweaked, and iterated-on for over a year to make it smooth and satisfying.\nJust pull down and back sling-shot style anywhere on the screen and release to launch. Once in the air, mouse down to crouch or release to extend. Stick the landing and repeat.\n\nInspired by the world of Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, 'That Flipping Mountain' consists of a single large continuous mountain of stuff to struggle over. You will not be artificially teleported back to the start if you fail to stick a landing, you will simply get back up and parkour on. Of course, if you fail to stick the landing in the wrong place, gravity might have a say in where you end up.\n\nNow, parkour, ski, and dive over that mountain!", "summary": "A physics driven flipping and skiing game inspired by \"Getting Over It\".
