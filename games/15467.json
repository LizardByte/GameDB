Unable to determine its cause and powerless to stop its deadly encroachment, humanity sends an elite team of explorers into the heart of the phenomenon, just as Strange Journey's look and feel represent a return to the heart of Shin Megami Tensei, bringing to mind the all-time classic Nocturne. With over 300 demons to bribe, coerce, and negotiate with to gain assistance in battle, Strange Journey is every bit the deep, rewarding RPG experience fans have come to expect from the SMT franchise, yet delivered with a fresh new sci-fi story that taps into mature themes of morality and introspection.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 6513, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "24nMjEWuFho"}, {"id": 6514, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yaGTapB7ufc"}]}
