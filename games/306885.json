The ball's trajectory is solely determined by the physics engine.\n\n- COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer architecture allows for instantaneous ball-touch response. For example, players can finish powerful crosses at the same speed as in real soccer.\n\n- COMFORT: Players can move around using thumbsticks and play in either a seated or standing position. No intense hand movements are required.\n\n- NO PAY-TO-WIN in VRFS: Only skills matter. No one can buy 'stronger kicks' or 'faster boots.' Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement.\n\n- FREE FOR ALL: Players have full access to the game without needing to purchase anything. However, if you wish, you can buy cool equipment in the store to support the further development of this project.\n\nPlease keep in mind that VRFS is still in development, with upcoming upgrades to the physics and scenery. We'd appreciate your suggestions for any enhancements.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vrfs", "videos": [{"id": 132654, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "o7WF1gMb-Aw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7WF1gMb-Aw", "title": "VRFS - Virtual Reality Football (Soccer) Simulator", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o7WF1gMb-Aw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
