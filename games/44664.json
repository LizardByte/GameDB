The first victim of the Furies was the Hecatonchires, Aegaeon, who had broken a blood oath to Zeus himself. The Furies set about their task, and, believing death to be too kind for one who had broken an oath to a God, transformed Aegaeon's humongous body into a stone prison for all who would dare follow his example in the future.", "summary": "God of War: Ascension, the seventh instalment in the God of War series, acts as a prequel to the preceding games. The narrative revolves around Kratos, the protagonist from earlier instalments, who was once a loyal servant of the God of War, Ares. Tricked by Ares into unknowingly murdering his own family, Kratos breaks the blood oath binding him to Ares and abandons his former master. Subsequently, Kratos finds himself imprisoned and must navigate a path to freedom, severing the bond between him and Ares.\n\nThe Special Edition features:\n- Premium steelbook case\n- Official game soundtrack\n- Multiplayer double XP unlock\n- PlayStation 3 dynamic theme\n- PlayStation Network Avatar Pac", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-ascension-special-edition", "videos": [{"id": 38843, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VJMK8oFY1rA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJMK8oFY1rA", "title": "God of War: Ascension Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VJMK8oFY1rA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
