However, some of their levels were completely redone, a new physics engine was used, and some of the soundtracks were remixed.\n\nLike the arcade version, there is no inventory. The player can only access the shop after completing a level. Special items are used on a time limit, which is slightly longer than the arcade version. The game is often criticized for not allowing players to buy food at the shop.\n\nThis port includes many features from Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, including its 8 new character classes. The Poisoned Fields area is included as the first level in the Castle Stronghold. The Mausoleum is also accessible from a secret passage in the Castle Courtyard.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gauntlet-legends--3", "collections": [{"id": 607, "name": "Gauntlet"}]}
