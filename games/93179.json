Scared of his future, Leon decides to run away from the wedding and you are responsible for bringing this poor guy back.\n\nThe game is a classic point and click adventure in which you collect objects and find places to use them. You move from one location to another using special \"location icons\". Number of available locations to visit represents the game's progress. At first there are only eight of them and later on they increase to total number of 24. The game is full of Polish jokes and \"play on words\" technique to give player hints how riddles should be solved."}
