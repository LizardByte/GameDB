Released as a beta test on Quantum Link's online service, it allowed up to 500 players to simultaneously explore a vast, open-ended virtual world. Despite lacking traditional RPG elements like leveling or classes, Habitat broke new ground by offering a persistent, shared environment where players could interact through customizable avatars in a 2D, third-person perspective.\n\nThe game's emphasis on social interaction and player-driven content was revolutionary for its time. Players could engage in a wide range of activities, from simple communication and object manipulation to complex social endeavors like marriage, commerce, and even founding religions or guilds. The game world, comprised of thousands of diverse regions, encouraged exploration and discovery. Habitat's innovative features, including an in-game economy, player-run businesses, and global quests organized by the developers themselves, showcased the potential of virtual worlds as social platforms. This libertarian approach to gameplay, where players were limited only by the game's code, set a precedent for user-generated content and emergent gameplay in online worlds, influencing the development of future MMORPGs and virtual communities.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/habitat--4", "videos": [{"id": 65059, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VVpulhO3jyc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVpulhO3jyc", "title": "Lucasfilm's Habitat Promotional Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VVpulhO3jyc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
