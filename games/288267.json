Usually only appears in models with four directional buttons. In which the player tries to obtain the randomly placed \"fruit\" in the playfield without touching a wall or themselves. Rather then continually get longer like you would in Snake, however, the player stops growing after eating only 13 fruits, causing the snake to restart to beginning size, and creating another maze of obstacles. This in turn makes it more of a game of endurance rather then strategy.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snake--11"}
