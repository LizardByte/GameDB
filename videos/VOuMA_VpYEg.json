It has been a long journey and more than 8 months of dedicated single-player development has now passed while building a robust AI.\n\nThe AI has been designed so it paves the way for future AI improvements. The statistical and analytical capability of the AI provides a solid foundation that can be used not only to further level up the AI but it can also be used for potential player advisory features, player AI scripting, and single-player campaigns.\n\nAI development has been the most complex part of the Line War journey with periods of hope and periods of despair. But the goal has now been reached to create an AI that plays fairly well, and maybe more importantly, it is designed so that its analytical, strategical, and tactical capabilities can be improved with the existing building blocks.\n\nThe features that will be released on May 5 include:\nSingle-player Skirmish AI: Face off against the AI in thrilling solo matches.\nCo-op vs AI: Team up with up to 3 friends and take on the AI together.\nNew Handicap System: Even out the odds against skilled human players, play a 2v1 on equal terms, or just boost the AI to 4.0x in Co-op - it's all up to you!\nLocalization: Beginning the support for multiple languages, for a better user experience. Russian, German, Polish, and Chinese have come a long way already.\n\nBETA TESTING\nExisting owners of Line War can already play the single-player release through a Steam open Beta. Go to the Line War Discord Server and head to the beta-testing channels if you want to play right away. Make sure to read the information and instructions for the beta before you join.\n\nPATREON SUPPORT\nIf you enjoy Line War and if you want to contribute to its development, consider becoming a Patron at https://www.patreon.com/LineWar It has been challenging to develop an innovative RTS, and hard lessons were learned when releasing it without single-player support. The number of sales since the release does not justify the work that has been put into this date, nor would it justify continued development, but it is the belief in the game and the joy expressed by the dedicated group of players with over a thousand hours in the game that drives development forward. Support through Patreon is greatly appreciated to help development.\n\nSPREAD THE WORD\nThe most important thing of all that you can do to help Line War is to spread the word. It goes a very long way! Tell your friends about it and play Line War live on Twitch or YouTube, or make videos about it.\n\nFollowing the single-player release, Line War development will continue. If the single-player release goes well and the interest picks up, I will personally double down and commit more time and invest further to drive development forward.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOuMA_VpYEg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOuMA_VpYEg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOuMA_VpYEg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOuMA_VpYEg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VOuMA_VpYEg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Line War Single-Player Release Date Announcement", "description": "Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309610/Line_War/\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/ZReTqqk4FV\n\nWe are extremely excited to announce that on May 5, 2024, single-player and co-op skirmish modes are coming to Line War!\n\nThe single-player release celebrates the 2-year anniversary of the initial release of Line War.
