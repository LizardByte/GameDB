Your goal is, basically, to reach the end of the level. To achieve this goal, you won\u2019t need to collect numerous of items, won\u2019t craft anything absurd or won\u2019t try to persuade any chatty AI: In Fabric, you will change the shape of voxel-based levels and physics with your gun. This gun allows you to bend space, squeeze the world, separate tiles from each others and bring them together.", "videos": [{"id": 9432, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zhYnGff9zi4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhYnGff9zi4", "title": "Fabric - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zhYnGff9zi4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
