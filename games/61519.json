By yelling at the two aliens, she can knock the aliens down and retrieve the stolen car parts. Arale-chan frequently runs out of Robovita-A fuel, however, and must recharge with a teapot that appears periodically.\n\nOnce the aliens have successfully carried five car parts to the launching pad at the top of the screen, they will finish building their UFO and will attempt to fly away. If Arale-chan can hit them with her \"N'cha Cannon\" yell, they will crash, and the player will receive many bonus points.\n\nThe game features two modes. In Level 1, the characters move slowly, while Level 2 features a faster speed. The player has three lives and must try to score as many points as possible. If the UFO successfully flies away, the player loses a life.", "summary": "Dr. Slump: Arale-chan is a game based on the Dr. Slump manga for the Arcadia 2001.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dr-slump-arale-chan", "videos": [{"id": 109624, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2E2NaNphrWY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E2NaNphrWY", "title": "Dr. Slump (Emerson Arcadia 2001)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2E2NaNphrWY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
