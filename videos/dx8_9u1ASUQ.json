{"id": "dx8_9u1ASUQ", "snippet": {"title": "Amiga Longplay Surf Ninjas", "description": "Played by: Ironclaw\n\nhttp://www.recordedamigagames.org\n\nOnly thing I like about this game is the music on level 1.\n\nI started playing/recording the CD32 version and got to level 3, but an item on that level was bugged so I restarted the game to see if it didn't bug this time around, but it did. So level 3 which is the final level, I play the floppy version instead, so the score might have changed.\n\nThe differences between the CD32 and the floppy versions are:\n\n* The CD32 version has more screens, people, items and colors (on some items, even though both versions are AGA).\n\n* They both have different title screens where the floppy version just has a picture with a tune, while the CD32 version has some animations and another tune.\n\nI ran with fast settings so the loading times between each screen is almost instant aswell as picking items up. With original CD32 settings it takes like 3 seconds to pick up and put down items. The drawback of these faster settings is it's hard to pick up/put down items as the programmers didn't add a 'on release' function before picking/dropping an item again. So in like 1 sec of a button press I can pick up and drop an item like 5 times... or something. But on level 3 when I had to play the floppy version you will notice that there now are a bit of delay between each screen (as it doesn't load as fast as the cd version).\n\nI ran the game with the \"SFX\" option so I would get sound effects and later added the music so we have both sound and music.\n\nThe game is a bit badly coded in many ways. One of them is when killing a ninja. He blinks before disappearing, but if you kick him while he's blinking, he comes back to life. In my opinion they should just have removed the collision detection when they start blinking as they should be DEAD then. The game uses 2 buttons - one to attack and one to enter places... and I found that several places which could be like anywhere had it so if you clicked the 'enter place' button in the right spot, you got moved to another screen. The game also has finish moves. I made one on level 1 where I pull a ninja's heart out. It's the same thing with this move like when they are blinking before disappearing - I could remove the heart as many times as I wanted from the same ninja when he should just have died the first time I pulled it out. I also found a second finish move where the player pulls out a knife, looks at the camera (us), then at the ninja and stabs him bloody over and over again till he dies. I only managed to do this one once, but wasn't recording then.\n\nAs I skipped all the fighting I ended up with almost no score, which gave a special message at the end. I couldn't be arsed to fight my score up to see what would happen. Fighting the ninjas is pretty useless as they just respawn after dead. So they can't truly die.\n\nFor the intro I picked the floppy version. The CD32 version's intro is at the end of the movie. For some reason the intro kept restarting after the video sequence and at the same time the music did too. So it looks like to me something was wrong and the video sequence maybe would have lasted longer or something. I mean, the intro has a 1 min 40-ish sec long tune and you only get to hear like 10 secs of it looping over and over again as everything resets (hard to explain... play it yourself and see). But I edited it as such so it's only played once, then the part where the logo spins is looping so we can hear a bit of the tune.\n\n\nHmm, what else is there to tell...   right, there are items in the game I didn't know what to do with, but wasn't needed to complete the game....     that's it.... bye! -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dx8_9u1ASUQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dx8_9u1ASUQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dx8_9u1ASUQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay Surf Ninjas", "description": "Played by: Ironclaw\n\nhttp://www.recordedamigagames.org\n\nOnly thing I like about this game is the music on level 1.\n\nI started playing/recording the CD32 version and got to level 3, but an item on that level was bugged so I restarted the game to see if it didn't bug this time around, but it did.
