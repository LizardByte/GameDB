Soft (who also created the Photo Hunter games), as the game was intended for use with the peripheral (the peripheral also came with two discs specially designed for it; Crazy Hit 1, the other disc, is currently undumped); however, the game could also be played with a normal controller. Possibly due to the branding, Pok\u00e9mon Crazy Hit 2 were later independently released by bootleggers separately from the peripheral.\n\nDue to the homebrew nature of the game, the title is very small by PlayStation standards, weighing at just 5 MB.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-hit-2", "videos": [{"id": 100959, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HqhPvZlVZ4I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqhPvZlVZ4I", "title": "Pokemon Crazy 2 Hit Bootleg PS1 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HqhPvZlVZ4I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
