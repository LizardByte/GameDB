Memo pads have items and objects on them for you to play with \u2013 lines, balls, and stars.\nThe object of the game is to use your ball and get all the stars. Turn, move, rotate the memo pads and the ball will fall to catch the stars. Collect all the stars and to move through the levels.\nSounds easy, right? Well, Joy Desk is for only the smartest players.\nLines create restrictions, forcing players to think about where they will move the memo pads to collect the stars all at once.\nLevels get progressively more difficult, forcing players to be thoughtful.\nJoy Desk also comes with pass cards so if you\u2019re unsure of how to solve the puzzles, then use the pass cards to get past the more difficult puzzle levels.\nPass cards are super helpful in a clinch - use them when you feel stumped!\nYou get 5 free keys to open a walkthrough of each level.\nAfter you used up all the free keys, you can buy them through in-app purchasing.\nWhat if you used up all the free keys and you don't have enough money to buy one?\nThen the bonus game will solve you problem. If you win the game, you get one bonus key!!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/joy-desk"}
