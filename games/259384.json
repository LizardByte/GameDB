Her lieutenant Arkos had turned against the governor and thus against the empire. Caberhi Tram flew to the planet Hypsis, also known as the prison planet, in search of Arkos.\n\nArkos, after destroying Gremla's palace and weakening his government on the planet Sckunn, known to all as the Imperial Palace-Planet, returned to the planet Hypsis, the raw material production center of the empire and the site of ultra-modern defensive installations that Arkos knew perfectly well. Arkos had reprogrammed all the work robots and security terminators for his own protection and, in addition, he counted on the planet's indigenous creatures to defend him.\n\nOur hero had to get to the facility, find Arkos and finish him off, but first he had to get through the perimeter and that would not be easy.", "summary": "Caberhi Tram, elite commander of Emperor Shakar's military forces, is a legend in the Ururben galaxy.
