Your mission - to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst disabling their ability to attack your own. Start by launching your battleships, submarines, and bombers in order to decimate your opponent's defences. Scramble together your alliances, but remember only one can stand victorious. Prepare your pre-emptive strike before one of your supposed allies get the same idea. Choose the perfect moment for betrayal, obliterating your opponents with an apocalyptic thermonuclear barrage, but get it wrong and their devastating counter attack will bring you to your knees!", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 32327, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "whh6D9F0o2c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whh6D9F0o2c", "title": "DEFCON Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/whh6D9F0o2c/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
