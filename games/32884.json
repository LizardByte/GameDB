In it, we follow the life of a man on a search who travels through different memories and worlds to find something he has lost. This film is experienced on 5 different projection screens in a virtual gallery space, effectively immersing the viewers and allowing them to actively participate in their own experiences of searching through time.\nRicerca pushes boundaries in storytelling by using physical space- aligning sound design to specific parts of the room, inviting viewers to walk in, around and out the film, and defying linear format in a looped 12 minute experience."}
