Celeste, a young squire training to join the knighthood, is sent to the forest village of Ornwood to prove herself worthy by retrieving an ancient artifact that has corrupted the forest.  \n  \nWhen a mysterious young woman steals the artifact before Celeste can take it, she fails her initiation. Determined to prove herself, Celeste leaves home to find the thief, reclaim the artifact, and become a knight.  \n  \nBut the outside world is much different than the isolated society Celeste grew up in, and she joins forces with the mercenary Valana and the researcher mage Ruby. Their journey takes them across a continent filled with mysterious ruins, remnants of an ancient civilization that crumbled ages ago. No one knows who they were or why they fell, and the stolen artifact is one of the few remaining relics from their era.  \n  \nThe more Celeste sees of the world, the more she questions not only her mission, but also the role of the knighthood. Is it right for them to remain separate from the rest of the world? Do they protect people as much as they claim, or have they prioritized the artifacts they seek above the lives of the people they claim to protect?  \n  \nOne thing is certain: the woman who took the artifact is no ordinary thief, and the stolen artifact is only the tip of a dark plot. A mysterious destiny ties them together, and this journey will change Celeste\u2019s life forever.\"", "summary": "\"Inspired by classic action JRPGs, Destiny Chronicles is an action role-playing game about a squire named Celeste who begins a journey to prove herself worthy of becoming a true knight. Her quest takes her far from her home, across the continent in pursuit of a thief whose actions stem from a sinister plot.  \n  \nIts character-driven plot focuses on the interactions between Celeste and her companions as they hunt down the thief. Our goal is to make the game lighthearted and humorous, yet still tell a compelling story.  \n  \nDestiny Chronicles features an exciting and fast-paced action combat system like that of Kingdom Hearts and Celeste\u2019s fighting style can be customized to suit your playstyle with a talent tree and upgrade system.  \n  \nThe game is currently in the early development phase and we will be running a Kickstarter soon.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/destiny-chronicles"}
