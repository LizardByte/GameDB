Each new game in the series adds another page to the history giving it a depth and complexity almost unrivalled within the RPG genre. In Spectral Force Genesis, the player will be able to take command of a country and using a mix of strategy, diplomacy and force, attempt to bring the whole kingdom under unified rule. You will meet a lot of different characters along the way and as events gradually unfold the player will make decisions which will trigger a whole host of surprising events and scenarios."}
