{"id": "_oTy0nALliM", "snippet": {"title": "ViColumn - VIC-20 Homebrew Gameplay", "description": "ViColumn is, as one might guess, a re-implementation of SEGA's Columns for the VIC-20, released in 2005. Blocks of three vertically arranged colours, out of a pallette of four, come dropping down from above, and must be placed on the bottom or on top of another block. By pressing fire, you can rotate the colours inside the block so as to fit in with the colours of other blocks already placed on the screen. If three or more adjacent blocks have the same colour on a row or column, that colour block is eliminated, making room for more blocks. Carefully laying down the blocks can lead to chain reactions. Unlike the original Columns, though, this implementation does not recognise diagonal colour combinations.\n\nDeveloped by Cosine Systems / Cronosoft\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #commodorevic20 #vic20 #vic20games #vicolumn #vic20homebrew #homebrewgames #homebrew #columns #theforeseenarcade", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oTy0nALliM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oTy0nALliM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oTy0nALliM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oTy0nALliM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oTy0nALliM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ViColumn - VIC-20 Homebrew Gameplay", "description": "ViColumn is, as one might guess, a re-implementation of SEGA's Columns for the VIC-20, released in 2005.
