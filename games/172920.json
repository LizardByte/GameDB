Help the little girl Millie confront the horrors lurking in the darkness and find her missing family.

Don't let Millie's lamp go out; use it to illuminate your path, solve puzzles, and fend off otherworldly beings. But remember, the lamp's flame is not endless; spend too much, and you risk being forever engulfed in darkness!\n\nIn Beyond The Darkness, real monsters lie in wait for you, thirsting to destroy any glimmer of hope and drag Millie into the abyss of despair. Each of them is a reflection of childhood fears, ready to attack as soon as you turn away from them.\n\nEmbark on a perilous journey through fragments of memories. Find the key elements of each to reconstruct the chain of events and reach the truth, but remember that each of the worlds is more than it seems, and in their depths, true nightmares lurk.\n\nSometimes, memories are tangled and the answer is well-hidden. Help Millie with the puzzles and riddles she encounters. Finding the right solution can be very difficult, especially when you're just a scared child. And mistakes come at a high price... Just one fatal mistake is enough to make the light of hope disappear forever.
