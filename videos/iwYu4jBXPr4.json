We\u2019re back!\nAfter the positive reception of our initial concept trailer for Fading Skies, we wanted to make sure we get this thing right before showing off more. Did it take us longer than anticipated? Yes. Much longer? Sure. Much, much, MUCH longer? Well, the important part is, we finally got there! After rebuilding pretty much the whole game from the ground up, we\u2019re happy with how it looks, how it feels to play, and how the story plays out. \n\nWe're not ready for release just yet, but we have a clear road ahead of us, and a playable demo coming later this year.\n\nWe\u2019ve been pouring our hearts and souls into this project and hope some of that comes across.
