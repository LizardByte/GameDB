You play as Tyler, who is finding himself as he hits rock bottom. Discover what happened by journeying through Tyler's memories of his relationship with his wife Elena and her depression. Escape his reality, or face it and figure out how to move on as Tyler's subconscious twists the game in unexpected ways. Anamorphine is also coming to VR devices, and we'll be revealing more on that later.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anamorphine", "videos": [{"id": 21362, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cf5TTHbQMgg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf5TTHbQMgg", "title": "Anamorphine Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf5TTHbQMgg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12704, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vVTu_eoOIqA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVTu_eoOIqA", "title": "Anamorphine Story Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vVTu_eoOIqA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
