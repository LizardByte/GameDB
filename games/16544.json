Ranged weapons, melee weapons, armor, special attacks, ally / PC healing, and more have been reworked and carefully tested to create an engaging and challenging combat experience.  Even the core combat system has been tweaked so that AC is calculated before damage reduction; this change makes combat more consistent and more fair, and corrects the \u201cinvincible\u201d armor problem.\n\nSmarter AI: Medic, Guard, Grenadier, Sniper, and more - New AI behaviors and schemas exist for human enemies, making them more interesting and more challenging to fight!  Enemies will notice your presence more quickly, follow you around corners and through doors, and fully utilize all of their tactical options, thrown weapons, and special attacks.\n\nNew PC Infection option on New Game menu: Create a new game with PC Infection checked and your character will be as susceptible to infection as your allies are.  Carefully manage your antibiotics and change your combat strategies to ensure your own survival!\n\nHardcore Mode: Just in case living in the apocalypse wasn\u2019t hard enough for you.  In Hardcore mode combat becomes more dangerous, allies consume more resources and heal more slowly, and Morale is harder to keep up.  Turn on Hardcore, Iron Man, and PC Infection for the ultimate challenge.\n\nAlarms: That\u2019s right - we\u2019ve added alarms to buildings in several areas.  Red, blinking lights warn you that there\u2019s an active alarm on a building. Use your Science skill to deactivate an alarm and prevent a looting distraction from becoming a noisy attraction.\n\nNew areas and random encounters: Several new levels and random encounters have been added.  Make sure to keep an eye out for the Chemical Plant, an area with a unique twist\u2026\n\nNew combat sounds and animations: We\u2019ve added new special attack, reloading, and healing animations and sounds.  Special attacks feel smoother and more impactful now.\n\nStability improvements: We\u2019ve rooted out every crash and progress blocking bug to make sure you have the smoothest possible experience.  Several popularly requested usability improvements have been added, such as friendly fire conformation, looting piled up bodies, and an option to toggle Live Shelter movement on and off.\n\nPathfinding improvements: Both allies and the undead have received major pathfinding adjustments that will reduce lag some people have experienced as well as make movement more consistent and natural.About the GameAbout the Game\nDead State is a compelling, high-tension survival RPG set in central Texas at the collapse of civilization and the dawn of the undead apocalypse.\n\nAs society is beginning to fall apart, the player must organize a group of survivors together, fortify a shelter, scout for food and supplies, negotiate with or defend against other factions, and maintain order inside the shelter as humanity teeters on the brink of extinction.
