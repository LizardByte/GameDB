{"id": "XzOye97fWz0", "snippet": {"title": "SPRAWL 96 - OUT NOW", "description": "DISCLAIMER: YOU MUST HAVE A COPY OF QUAKE INSTALLED TO PLAY!\n\nJOIN OUR DISCORD TO DOWNLOAD: https://discord.gg/4kVen5XDfn\n\nSPRAWL 96 is a celebration of SPRAWL, it's our first birthday today, August 23rd 2024. It\u2019s also our way of giving thanks and giving back to the communities which made SPRAWL possible. \nSPRAWL would be nothing without the Quake Mapping community, SPRAWL was originally built on Darkplaces, and the resources provided by nearly 30 years of dedicated modders made it possible to get it started. \nHannah and myself, Carlos (REVEL), met on the Quake mapping discord, and well, the rest is as you say, history. Here we are 4 years later paying homage to our roots. \n\nSo what actually is it? Well it's a revival in a sense of that original Quake engine version of SPRAWL. It answers the question \u201cWhat if SPRAWL actually existed in 1996?\u201d. \nSo it includes every single SPRAWL weapon (sorta), a big portion of our enemy roster, and our movement mechanics all on a custom fork of the Ironwail Quake source port. \nIt\u2019s a near total conversion gameplay mod focused on vanilla entities setup, so all non-mod specific maps (non-copper, non-ad, non quoth etc) can be played. So long as you own Quake, you can play SPRAWL 96. \nFor the modding community as a whole, we are also allowing you to use any of the assets created for SPRAWL 96 directly in your own non commercial mods. \nCareful set up has been taken in particular to the enemies models to make them vanilla compatible. Same frame data as vanilla monsters! \nWe\u2019ve also included a texture wad full of textures directly taken from SPRAWL, as well a prefab.map file which includes set ups for most of these assets, again free to use in your own non commercial mods. \nThere are over 400 models, sounds, textures provided! Plenty of which is archival from the 2020 QuakeSprawl version of the game.\n\nI also want to take the time before we get into the actual setup, to thank VoidForce, who reached out to us and made this entire mod possible. This gargantuan effort is mostly his lovechild with myself playing support. \nAll the tweaks and changes to the base formula of SPRAWL were directed entirely by him, and I'm so thankful to have such a talented human being at the helm of this project. \nSpecial thanks to Ptoing as well, he put together all of our menu, and HUD art. One of the last true pixel artists left, an extremely next level genius, very thankful for his contribution to this project.\n\nThank you all for checking this out and for celebrating SPRAWL\u2019s first birthday with us!\n\n- Carlos (REVEL)\n\nTrailer by: https://simonas-macas.com/\nFollow development on Twitter: https://x.com/SPRAWLfps\n\nMusic: https://revel303.bandcamp.com/album/sprawl-original-soundtrack\n\nREVEL - SPIRAL From the SPRAWL Original Soundtrack.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzOye97fWz0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzOye97fWz0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzOye97fWz0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzOye97fWz0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzOye97fWz0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SPRAWL 96 - OUT NOW", "description": "DISCLAIMER: YOU MUST HAVE A COPY OF QUAKE INSTALLED TO PLAY!\n\nJOIN OUR DISCORD TO DOWNLOAD: https://discord.gg/4kVen5XDfn\n\nSPRAWL 96 is a celebration of SPRAWL, it's our first birthday today, August 23rd 2024.
