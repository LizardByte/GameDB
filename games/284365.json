You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than the screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man can now jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid-air collision!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-mania--3", "collections": [{"id": 2095, "name": "Pac-Man"}]}
