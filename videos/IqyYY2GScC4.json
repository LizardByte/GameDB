The best selling game in this genre isn't even a Metroid or Castlevania game! It's Ori and the Blind Forest! And I have always wondered what a \"Search Action\" game would play like if it was like Sonic the Hedgehog... One button controls and physics and momentum based platforming and exploration...\n\nSo I made it my mission to make my pitch for that very concept. I present to you, Project: Ashura the Glitch. A project inspired by Axiom Verge, one of my favourite titles in the genre.\n\nThis game has been incredibly fun to put together, and has forced me to learn some Surge Script that will make the rest of the development of my first game, Another Sonic 2 Remake, a heck of a lot easier.\n\nThis video is an overview of what you can expect from the demo that will be available when the Sonic Amateur Games Expo 2024 goes live on September 6th.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IqyYY2GScC4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IqyYY2GScC4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IqyYY2GScC4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IqyYY2GScC4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "[SAGE 2024] A Sonic the Hedgehog Metroidvania?
