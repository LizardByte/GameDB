Destroy other trains and try to not die by hitting yourself because that would be totally embarrassing for a train to do.\n\nWe have 10 unique arenas with traps, power-ups, medals, trophies and all kinds of different game modes: deathmatch, team towers, domination, capture the flag, endless mode!\n\nOh, and you can decorate your train with all kinds of different fancy smokes and ride in style!\n\nCHO-CHOO to GLORY!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/squake", "videos": [{"id": 11187, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "i7EzTThVyVE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7EzTThVyVE", "title": "SQUAKE gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i7EzTThVyVE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
