It is the first installment of the Battletoads series and was originally released on 1 June 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was subsequently ported to the Mega Drive and Game Gear in 1993, to the Amiga and Amiga CD32 in 1994 (despite the former having been developed in 1992), and released with some changes for the Game Boy in 1993 in the form of Battletoads in Ragnarok's World. In the game, three space humanoid toad warriors form a group known as the Battletoads. Two of the Battletoads, Rash and Zitz, embark on a mission to defeat the evil Dark Queen on her planet and rescue their kidnapped friends: Pimple, the third member of the Battletoads, and Princess Angelica.\n\nThe game was developed in response to the interest in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. It received mostly positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the graphics and variations of gameplay; however, many critics were divided over the difficulty. It won seven awards from the 1991 Nintendo Power Awards, and has since been renowned as one of the most difficult video games ever created. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.\n\nThe game is a platform scrolling beat 'em up, with varying elements of racing, climbing and vehicle-based obstacle courses. Players start with three lives each time the game is started, which get replenished every time the player continues after getting defeated. The game contains no saving system or password features. The player has a maximum of six hit points that can be replenished by eating flies. While the levels of Battletoads vary greatly in gameplay style, the game is generally presented as a \"beat'em up\", in which players progress by defeating enemies while avoiding the hazards in the environment.\n\n#nes #nintendo #playthrough #gaming #retro #walkthrough #longplay #gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR6OqZSrZA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR6OqZSrZA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR6OqZSrZA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR6OqZSrZA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ilR6OqZSrZA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Battletoads (1991) [NES] Complete Playthrough - Is this the hardest game ever made?", "description": "Playthrough of Battletoads for NES, developed by Rare.
