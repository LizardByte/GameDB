His classmates also kept their distance from the strikingly beautiful Tomomi, who would chide anyone who bothered her.\n\nOne day, Tomomi came up to Hiroto in the courtyard while he was enjoying lunch by himself. He thought she was going to confess to him, prompting a stern rebuke from her, as she was flabbergasted at his unexpected misunderstanding. Actually, she wanted him to come with her after school to the \u2018assistance committee\u2019, which is committee under the control of the student council for helping troubled students. However, he hadn\u2019t heard anyone say goods things about it; in fact, it was dreaded to the extent that it is nicknamed the \u2018meddling committee\u2019.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/amaekata-wa-kanojo-nari-ni"}
