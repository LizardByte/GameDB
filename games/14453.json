The object of the game is to control a minimum of five percent of the market share in all ten cities.\n\nIn order to succeed, you'll need to use demographic reports to determine the best location for your shop, contact banks to negotiate the lowest interest rates, decide which advertising to use (billboards, newspapers or TV commercials), and hire waiters, cooks or managers. Decide on your restaurant's decorations to attract new customers or develop new recipes to get a leg up on your competition. Not doing so well? Contact the underworld and start taking out other restaurants using sabotage!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}]}
