The epic tale of swords, sorcery, kings and kinship are renowned, and while that adventure is done it's not quite time to turn the page just yet... \n \nThe Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest takes place 15 years after the events of the original story, transporting you to the peaceful Shire of the Hobbits. Samwise Gamgee, loyal friend to the story's lead character Frodo Baggins, is now Mayor of the Shire. Taking a break from preparing for a visit from King Aragorn, Sam retells the eventful journey across Middle Earth to his children, focusing on how Aragorn became king. \n \nSam takes you through some of the adventure's most memorable scenes, putting you in control of Aragorn in his quest to stop Sauron. From Flight to the Ford (which has you protecting Frodo from the Black Riders and other agents of the Dark Lord) to the deadly mines of Moria (where the awe inspiring Balrog lurks), you embark on a grand expedition, as seen through the eyes of a humble Hobbit. \n \nThink you know the epic and immensely popular The Lord of the Rings saga? Turns out you only know some of the whole story. Why not grab a cup of your favourite hot drink, sit down with one of the brave souls who experienced it and live the adventure yourself...", "summary": "The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest takes its cues from the massive Peter Jackson movie trilogy, featuring varied and memorable settings and the actors' likenesses that have become synonymous with their respective characters. A cartoon style is used for the nicely animated visuals which gives the game a refreshingly distinct look while remaining faithful to the style of The Lord of the Rings. \n \nAn attractive pencil interpretation of the story draws you into the game and brings you up to speed on the events of the films, accompanied by some of the Academy Award winning score that helped make the movies so emotionally powerful. From there you're treated to a brilliant array of flashy graphics and atmospheric music which changes dramatically when you're set upon by Sauron's evil allies. \n \nThe superb sound effects also recreate the intense mood of the movies, with the chilling wail of the Dark Riders, howling wolves, battle cries of lumbering trolls and the metallic ring of clashing swords in battle making you feel like you're right in the middle of an epic and thrilling quest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-aragorn-s-quest", "videos": [{"id": 14871, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pexnRZG-oNk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pexnRZG-oNk", "title": "Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pexnRZG-oNk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
