Biophilia is an ode to the blackness of the night, to the forests of the ancients, to the forgotten gods and to a life of secrets among the darkness. Where once there was progress, now only the bones of a lost science remain. Tech-bases surrounded by forests, outposts in the middle of the night, caves that hide the eyes of the beast, secret bases lost among the trees, etc. This is Biophilia, the fear, the love... to live in eternal darkness.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/biophilia--1"}
