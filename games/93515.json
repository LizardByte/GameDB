You play as Moriya Fumihara, who lives in the onsen (hot springs) town of Mizumori.\n\nOne day during summer vacation, while taking part in practice with his school's archery club, Moriya stumbles across two girls playing in a lake. Like the manly man that he is, he quickly flees the area; but when he returns home, he finds himself greeted by those very same girls! It turns out that the two girls are the daughters of Moriya's father's friend, and they'll be staying at the Fumihara residence for the time being.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/suigetsu-2", "videos": [{"id": 57760, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "M-Mmy-zLWcM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-Mmy-zLWcM", "title": "PS3\u300c\u6c34\u6708 \u5f10\u300d\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M-Mmy-zLWcM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
