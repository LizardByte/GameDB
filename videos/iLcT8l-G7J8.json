He has trained extensively in the Elemental arts for the past decade of his young life, under the discerning eyes of the Mage Masters of Iginor. Confined to an existence of academics and magical mastery in their tower, the inquisitive Initiate often wonders what it would be like to set foot outside in the world he has been secluded from. \n\nD'arc's moment of reckoning arrives and he is summoned to the Hallowed Hall, where the four Mage Masters put him to the test. The young Initiate is tasked with completing three quests which will test his magical and mental strength to full capacity. He must return to the Mage's Tower bearing a symbol of proof that he has conquered each task: \n\nA lock of hair from a powerful Enchantress. \n\nThe unspoiled shell of Griffon's egg. \n\nThe horn of the fabled and legendary Tricorn. \n\nJoin D'arc on a perilous journey across the medieval-styled land of Iginor. Brave the perilous Bloodbark forest where the Redcap goblins stalk. Trek across a barren desert wasteland rife with lawless Bandits and savage Burrowers. Navigate over a vast body of water where evil masquerades as beauty. And ascend beyond the lofty mountain peaks where the mysterious and hostile race of Flyterians dwell, suspicious of all outsiders.
