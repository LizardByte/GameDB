This version appears most similar to the Mega Drive version. In an early build of the game found on Vast Fame's multicarts it is called L\u00f3ng X\u00edng Ti\u0101n Xi\u00e0 on the title screen. It would later on be published by Gowin as Gu\u0101 Gu\u0101 Hu\u01d2 L\u00f3ng. In situations where an English name is displayed it is referred to as Fire Dragon. This version features the same music as the Mega Drive version, but lacks a music test option.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-dragon--1"}
