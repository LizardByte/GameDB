ToonTime provides multimedia entertainment for children, as well as adults who are still young at heart. ToonTime... In the Classroom brings to your television a whole new method of interactivity never before available. Select randomly from six classic full color cartoons: Tweety, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Popeye, Elmer Fudd and Superman, and play the chosen cartoon immediately (no more rewinding a videotape). Have fun manipulating the digitized cartoons by shrinking, enlarging, twisting and distorting them inside a classroom. Have more fun playing the cartoons on different classroom objects. Reshape and distort the objects as they bounce around the classroom.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/toontime-dot-dot-dot-in-the-classroom"}
