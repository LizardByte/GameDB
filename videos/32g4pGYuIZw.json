Children control the actions, mood and speech of a delightful cast of castle inhabitants. The near endless variations mean hours of ever-changing creative play. Each room of the castle features a fun, skill-building activity. Develops creativity, problem-solving, critical-thinking skills, sequential planning \n\nActivities:\nThe Secret Passage and the Obstacle Course\nFour of the scenes contain a hidden scroll with instructions on how to find the secret passage. The scroll shows a character and a sequence of actions which the character must do in order to open the passage. \n\nThe Family Crest Activity\nChildren can write their name on the banner and design a family crest on the castle. This activity encourages creativity and the pre-reading skill of letter recognition. \n\nCatapult and Bull's Eye Activity\nThis activity is fun! You sit a friend in a chair and then use a catapult to hurl fruit at a bulls eye. A hit with the weight of fruit that matches the friends weight causes a dunking! \n\nThe Harp\nChildren can make their own tune just by clicking on the colored boxes at the end of the strings. \n\nThe Maze Activity\nThe red ant has to reach its friend the black ant. This activity encourages spatial awareness and problem solving. \n\nThe Memory Matching Activity\nThe icons, hidden behind a brick are action icons. When the child finds a matching pair, the characters will do this action. \n\nThe Painting Activity\nChildren can create a new painting to hang on the bedroom wall, even including frame selection.\n\n\nCredits:\nExecutive Producer: Michael A.
