Do let me know what you'd like to see more of in my videos :-)\n\nI'll have to make a video of something special to celebrate but in the meantime here are some more mobile games!\n\nI hope you are all healthy and safe wherever you are in the World right now and whatever challenges you are facing.\n\nTime for another mobile phone game. I know a lot of you have happy memories of the playing some of these old school games for many hours while waiting for busses or killing time.\n\nMany years ago I picked up a couple of old mobile phones for just \u00a31 each (could have fitted in my Sonic's Quid Game series that I really must revisit) that were allegedly faulty. The phones were fine.\n\nOne of those phones was the Nokia 1661 - a fairly basic phone - but it has a few pre-installed games. This is one of them - called Beach Rally (I have a video of Beach Rally 2 being played on a Nokia 6021 on my channel also). This came pre-installed on a number of the Nokia handsets of this time.\n\nIt's a classic sprite scaling racing game. Auto accelerate means steering left & right to avoid the rival racer cars. Complete 10 sections of track to \"win\". Pick ups on the track grant a temporary speed boost or add 5 seconds to the clock. Playing through the viewfinder means I miss a few pick ups plus lose some speed here and there ultimately leaving me out of time.\n\nIt's a nice game though and the controls are responsive. The bright, colourful graphics are smooth and give you plenty of time to see upcoming obstacles, corners & pick ups.\n\nFor that authentic experience I've left in the few moments at the start where I load the game from the Games section of the phone - hope it evokes a few memories.\n\nI love this era of phone games and there are so many to cover. This video is a quick match just to show the game off. Apologies for the wobbly camera footage. The screen on the 1661 is portrait style. I'm trying to hold the phone still as possible & play the game through the camera viewfinder. It is so close up that the slightest movement looks massive on here. Still - I think the ability to count the individual pixels lends it a certain amount of charm :-)\n\nAnyway I thought this might trigger some memories for a few of you.\n\nAlso - let me know what you think. Would you prefer the load times and screens to be edited out? I kinda like the \"full experience\" approach and to let the game or promo video or whatever to speak for itself but let me know feedback. I'm keen to experiment.\n\nI'm also sorting my loft and finding all sorts of obscurities, oddities and nice games from my collection so I'll be doing some random vids. Let me know if there is a console or game you'd like to see. Let me know if there are any games or consoles you'd like videos about. Let me know if you like the format (i.e. no voiceover and the addition of short facts). Want End Cards added to point out other similar videos? I'm just trying things really.\n\nAs always game is played on original hardware - no emulation etc This is played on a Nokia 1661 handset and filmed directly from the screen.\n\nAs always if you enjoy this video let me know. \n\nAs always this is uploaded under the Fair Use Policy - no money is being made from this video. \n\nStay strong, stay safe and stay healthy - Grey Fox", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aY-4PjxwRLk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aY-4PjxwRLk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aY-4PjxwRLk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aY-4PjxwRLk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aY-4PjxwRLk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Beach Rally - played on a Nokia 1661", "description": "Woohoo!
