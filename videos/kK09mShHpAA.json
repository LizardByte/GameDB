{"id": "kK09mShHpAA", "snippet": {"title": "Armored Fist - Gameplay", "description": "This game from Novalogic (1994) is the exact opposite of Commanche, it puts you in a tank instead of a chopper.\n\nI'm actually more familiar with Armored Fist 2, but that fucking game won't run. Anyway, what annoys me in this game are the goddamn things that make you stuck, and to get out of the blocking thing is a horror ...\n\n(letter to purchaser in game manual)\n\nDear Armored Fist Player:\n\nThank you for purchasing Armored Fist. This product marks a milestone in armored warfare simulations. The game delivers two of the most important elements previously missing in the other tank games: accurate terrain representation and smoke obscuration.\n\nTank warfare is all about armor, a tank placed behind a hill benefits from the massive armor that the hill provides. Tank commanders spend days positioning and digging-in tanks before a battle. It won't take you days, but you will be able to dig-in and position you ranks on the most accurate ground available on PCs thanks to our Voxel Space (pat. pending) technology.\n\nRealism has been one of the prime design criteria. You can use smoke grenades to obscure your position yet with the thermal night sights you can see through your smoke and still target the enemy. Armor is much stronger in the front of the vehicles than on the sides with very little protection at the back.\n\nThis game contains over 200,000 lines of computer assembly code complied by humans. It took over 8 man years to program Fist, with David Seeholzer putting in a superhuman effort in bringing it all together. John Butrovich and Kyle Freeman provided groundbreaking algorithms almost on demand. Joby Otero is responsible for the ultra-real animation.\n\nVoice music and truly interactive game play make this game one of the few real interactive multimedia products.\n\nWe are very proud of the product that we created for you, we hope you like it as much as we do.\n\nSincerely\n\nJohn A.
