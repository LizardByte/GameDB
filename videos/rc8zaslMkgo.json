Nations' petty disputes are now settled with the World's Game, Gunsport. It's the cyberpunk future of Neo Tokyo, Neo USSR, The Free Congo, Blue Cambodia. Neon lights and repurposed technology populate this world, filling it with a restless analog hum. \n\nGunsport a team-based competitive eSport where the aim is to shoot the ball into the opposing goals or ground territory. It's hard, it's fast, it's tough, it's different. It's Future Millennium Sporting Action.\n\nComing late 2015 to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, from Necrosoft Games and Iron Galaxy, complete with online play.
