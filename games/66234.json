There are five main characters in this game, which the game encourages the player to rename with the names of their friends: Black, Blue, Yellow, Pink and Red.\n\nBlack invites the group to the ravine, and his father owns the mansion in which they're staying at. Red is the hot-tempered leader of the group. He starts the whole mess with the statement \"Let's test our courage\". Blue is kind and has a strong sense of justice. Yellow has a pure heart - she is kind, well raised and nice to people. Pink states her opinions clearly and makes sure everyone hears them. Also, a mysterious young girl comes along the game and she seems to get along with Yellow. An extra character, \"You\", is playable in the epilogue of the story. The player controls each of the characters in turn as they explore the mansion.", "summary": "Ikenie no Yoru is a horror, adventure video game for the Nintendo Wii.
