You can guess where this is going.\n\nLiving Playground is a short puzzle-based adventure game with a dash of horror theming for flavor. The player controls Tony, the cheerful slide girl, as she attempts to reunite with her brothers and find an exit while avoiding multiple untimely ends. Conveniently, the children aren\u2019t human but are living toys themselves, playground equipment which can take human form. Along the way, they uncover interesting details about the factory they're trapped in. What happened to the rather cheery-sounding owner? How did things get this WEIRD? At least the monster parts make sense, because there are some strange playthings wandering the factory.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/living-playground"}
