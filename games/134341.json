On its surface it is also a romance, a tale of bonding between two lonely girls in an isolated environment with a dash of mystery for good merit. \n \nNot far beneath this entertaining level of the story, readers who prefer their text to play the role of teacher or moralist will readily discover a lesson here: Do not allow dogmatic rationalism to replace superstition and blind you to the truth! \n \nHowever, at its center Carmilla is an exploration of the human condition after the Enlightenment cemented the distinction between mind and matter, the so called mind-body-dualism, with its clear preference for mind over matter. Today, this duality is hardly ever questioned.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/carmilla"}
