You'll get all 5 lives restored and you will be needing them! \nWhile Army Guy has gathered all parts for his canon, it gets reassembled but ... this is a slow process. \nPart by part is restored into the canon. In the meantime Army Guy will be attacked by hordes of skelletons, trying to prevent completion of his canon!! Can you fend them off? \nAs soon as the canon is Build, you'll be able to Shoot 'm Down with ease and you save the world! \n \nThis game has great speedrunning potential, you are invited to try and complete it as fast as possible. Maybe you can even challenge the world record!", "summary": "Build 'm up, Shoot 'm down is a challenging game, even hard to complete.
