{"id": "Ls2vjXhe5Uo", "snippet": {"title": "The Flintstones (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ocean's 1995 platformer for the Super NES, The Flintstones.\n\nWhen I sat down to play this, I had all sorts of loathsome memories flood back from when I played it in the 90s. However, my memory seems to have not gotten it all completely right, thank God! While it's nothing too stand-out in the game play department, it does play well - better than most games from Ocean. It's not Cool World, that's for sure, but it's also not as good as the Taito Sierra Madrock game. \n\nIt's also based on the live-action movie that Universal released the year before. \n\nAlso in the typical Ocean fashion, it looks fantastic (even if you're not a fan of the style, or of playing as recognizable sprite of John Goodman) and the music is superb. It's a bit on the easy side, but it certainly makes sure that you work hard to finish the last couple levels. Oh man, the shift in difficulty that comes at the final set of stages is pretty ridiculous. That lava surfing stage,  anyone?\n\nAnd why is it that John Goodman/Fred looks in desperate need of a Life Alert pendant throughout most of this? And no, I don't mean for when the 20ton boulder falls on him. Everytime you stop, he either starts huffing like he's going to keel over at anytime,  or he'll start eating and spitting out bones.  Super healthy there, Fred. Maybe he'd have an easier time using a hover-round. Hell, maybe he should steal one of those motorized grocery store carts (the ones that are meant for disabled people,  but the only ones you see riding them are people too fat to walk to buy more food).
