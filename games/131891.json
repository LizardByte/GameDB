After choosing to remain in Ruka's world, Rin begins to doubt her decision, haunted by memories of her best friend Yuuzu and others she's left behind. Ruka, too, is troubled by Kanako, a classmate who seems to have it out for her. Unspoken thoughts, assumed feelings, and misunderstandings threaten to pry them apart as they face the challenges of communication involved in becoming more than just friends.\n\nIn the second chapter, we learn the tale of a distant past. Of a child and a young adult paired together by strange circumstances. This story of Rei and Ruka's past will explore how the two met, why Rei took on the mantle of guardianship, and their attempts to understand one another across an age gap.", "summary": "Distant Memora\u0135o is a sequel to \"The Expression Amrilato\"\n\nThis is the story, pure and sometimes frustrating, of two girls intertwined through their fumbling efforts to communicate.
