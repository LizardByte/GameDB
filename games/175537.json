Help him get to the surface by digging holes and advancing throughout the many caves. Each of the cave is made up of multiple levels, ladders, doors and of course, monsters. Use your mining skills to grab the gold coins, and treasure chests that are hidden throughout the caves.nImportant note: Monsters can be killed when trapped into holes but revive and each time they do they get smarter, so be careful!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bagman-for-ipad"}
