Anyway, we're gonna change that. Today's game is \"Star Sweep\", a somewhat underrated action/puzzle game by Namco, Axela, Success and Fupac. It was originally released in Arcades in early 1997 and later ported to Playstation and Game Boy before the end of the year. It would later get released Internationally in the early 2000s as a budget title (by \"A1 Games\" and \"Midas Interactive Entertainment\") and gained cult classic status as one of the best games in the budget category by them (along with titles like \"Battle Hunter\", Top Shop\", etc.). In 2015, it was eventually released as a downloadable title under the \"PSOne Classics\" label.\n\nI had quite a bit of fun with the Playstation game years ago and imported the Game Boy game a while back along with several other GBC or SGB-compatible games. It naturally doesn't have quite the same appeal as its more powerful older siblings, but it's a respectable translation of the Arc/PS1 game with the gameplay being mostly intact and a few cool Super Game Boy borders (the gameplay colors could've been optimized better though). For those unfamiliar with the game, the goal is to use \"Star Pigs\" who disperse blocks onto the playing field. As you can't really see your opponent's moves, you have to deplete their HP instead by pairing blocks together and making chains to reduce it to zero. In this regard, it's a little disappointing that while the game is SGB enhanced, it didn't add actual colors to your drops to make them more identifiable, but playing the game on a decent sized screen mostly mitigates this issue.\n\nThe game has several modes as well: A Single Player Mode, Vs. Mode, Story Mode, Puzzle Mode (with almost 100 puzzles), and Options Mode. There are also five different difficulty settings to choose from... due to the nature of this game (as you can't actually see what the computer is doing), it's somewhat harder than the other versions. The difficulty adjusts the frequency of junk being dropped on you, but it's fairly hard even on normal difficulty and the response is slightly slower than other versions. Even so, it's a pretty good puzzle game that's become fairly uncommon. Satoshi Fujishima, who did the Puzzle Designs, also worked on titles such as \"Ch\u014dshin Heiki Zeroigar\", \"Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou\" (released Internationally as \"Gourmet Warriors\") and \"Golvellius: Valley of Doom\".\n\nThis is a video of the game in action.
