There are three types of enemies including the Indian footman, Indian on horseback and Buzzard. Arrow and tomahawk projectiles can also be shot for points. Enemies on the same plane such as scorpions cannot be shot and limit where the player can move the cowboy. Obstacles such as cacti and rocks block the cowboy's line of fire.
