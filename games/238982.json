Lines is a super addictive, simple, yet challenging puzzle game. Remove Cannibal Cookout themed pieces from the board by lining up five pieces of the same colour in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction. Earn gold and skulls that can be transferred straight into Cannibal Cookout and spent at the General Store. Testing wits and reflexes, more pieces are added after every move, forcing you to think ahead to stop the board from filling up. Use special power-ups to help you along, and play through numerous levels as you try your hardest to master the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cannibal-cookout-lines"}
