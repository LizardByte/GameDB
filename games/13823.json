Doing so requires several dozens of shots. The camels retaliate by shooting fireballs from their mouth.\n\nEach camel required several shots to destroy; if a camel reached the base, the game was over. Once all camels on a level had been killed, the player had to survive a \"hyperspace\" sequence which required avoiding high-speed missiles. Upon successful completion, the next level presented a new wave of camels, with slightly harder gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
