If you die in the game, your savegame gets erased from the disk, like in the old wizardry games. Be sure to make a backup! :) \nAlso, be sure to downgrade your CPU speed to 2.0 Mhz otherwise the enemies will be too fast and you will die even more easily than in the normal game :)\nGargatar did a partial english translation patch for this game, a patch which you can easily get on the romhacking.net site. \nArt is by Shohei Harumoto.
