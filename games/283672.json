The world is quiet. Most singing birds have long since migrated to warmer places and animals have gone into hibernation, shielding themselves against the cold. But winter doesn't stop people and horses. Stables still need to be mucked out, horsed still need to be groomed and fed. Riders are getting ready for the Decker Horse Show -- the most prestigious jumping competition in the country. Only a few riders from the finest stables are selected to compete. Now all that is needed is a champion.
