Following the two cowboys are snakes and tumbleweeds; the snakes follow one cowboy, the tumbleweeds the other. If caught, a cowboy will be paralyzed for a few seconds. However, if he shoots whatever is chasing him, it is converted into whatever chases his opponent: snakes into tumbleweeds; tumbleweeds into snakes.\n\n\nWhat I think:\n\nNice game, but couldn't they have added ... oh, I don't know ...
