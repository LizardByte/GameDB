Like my Rutile Ruby & Star Sapphire hacks and my Nova Sun & Umbra Moon hacks, their main purpose is to provide a more challenging game experience while not artificially limiting the player. The premier feature of Supernova Sun and Penumbra Moon is the ground-up redesign of Pok\u00e9mon Trainers in the world to increase the game\u2019s challenge. Every trainer in the game has been edited, and the level curve expects use of the Experience Share, which means that the player levels up very quickly. Every Pok\u00e9mon in Trainers\u2019 teams has a a proper moveset and many are holding items. The Elite Four and Champion are Level 100, and the player doesn\u2019t need to grind to equal that!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-supernova-sun"}
