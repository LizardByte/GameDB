The plot of the game revolves around a group of gnomes repairing their magical forest after a chaotic rampage by an evil warlock frees all the forest spirits. The object of the game is for the player to contain these spirits by matching three or more spirits of the same type in order to make them disappear. \n \nPlayers shoot spirits from a cannon on a track that surrounds a swirling whirlpool (the \"potpourii\") where the spirits are suspended, with each quadrant of the play area corresponding to a different season and the different types of spirits players can shoot. The twist is that instead of simply matching the required number of spirits, the player must add to the cluster a different type of spirit that reacts to them and allows the cluster to disappear", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/potpourrii"}
