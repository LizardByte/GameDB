As an operative tasked with fixing corruption in the timestream, you have been sent to the North of England in May 2015, where six people died in a house fire. Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event.\n\nFrom the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely.\n\nYou must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates.\n\nHowever, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone?\n\nUltimately, everything is about choices and consequences.", "summary": "Eternal Threads is a single-player, first-person story-driven puzzle game of time manipulation, choice and consequence.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eternal-threads", "videos": [{"id": 45235, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rHJ9YrVAokg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHJ9YrVAokg", "title": "Eternal Threads: Cause and Effect", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rHJ9YrVAokg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 66663, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "EhEKr0OAVO4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhEKr0OAVO4", "title": "Eternal Threads Date Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhEKr0OAVO4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
