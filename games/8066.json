One of several games based on the license, the Sega versions features the same story, but has a unique design and set of levels in the different platforms.\n\nInspired by a tale his father told, Taz goes on a quest for the egg of a giant prehistoric seabird, which will lead him across the whole of Taz-Mania through 16 levels of platforming action. He must survive a desert, a jungle, a car factory, a mine and ancient ruins. Taz is able to run, jump, and spin fast to turn into his trademark whirlwind. While spinning, he can knock out most enemies he comes across. He can also pick up many different items and try to eat them or use them in another way. Most foods replenish his health, while eating hot peppers gives him a fire breath attack. Stars grant temporal invulnerability, while bombs should be thrown at enemies (and definitely not be eaten!).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/taz-mania", "videos": [{"id": 69121, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "qrTTAUwaRG4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrTTAUwaRG4", "title": "Mega Drive Longplay [520] Taz-Mania", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qrTTAUwaRG4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
