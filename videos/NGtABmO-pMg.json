Routing it was cool because most levels have secret paths, short skips and/or glitches.\n\nRunning it isn't very difficult though. This is probably the easiest game I've ran. There's no complex physics system for the anchor mechanics, and you can't get crazy momentum boosts or anything. It's a very simple system. The only issues are Yoshika and Futo who are random and can lose a lot of time. There's also a couple short time savers that I didn't go for, which are pretty difficult.\n\nThis run is alright, got everything I wanted to show. I might keep playing the game some more though, since I've found some minor improvements. In this video it looks like I saved a ridiculous amount of time on Futo's stage, but that's because that's the first time that I did a run with that balloon glitch AND had good luck on Futo's fight.\n\nI recorded at 30fps so whenever Murasa or a boss get hit, they either go invisible or flicker in a weird way. Sorry about that.\n\nHere's my notes for the game if you're interested: http://pastebin.com/q07xRscy", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NGtABmO-pMg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NGtABmO-pMg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NGtABmO-pMg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NGtABmO-pMg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Soul Anchor 2 Speedrun in 14:42", "description": "This is a speedrun of Soul Anchor 2.\n\nThis game is pretty fun.
