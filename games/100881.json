The words are linked as a crossword, so solving one reveals clues to another. For a special twist and increased difficulty, the letter pool is \"salted\" with extra letters that may or may not belong in the crossword.\nEach puzzle is designed to be played in 2-5 minute increments, perfect for short breaks.\nPuzzles can also be tailored to your skill level with one button tap.\nThe game progresses from very easy to very difficult, providing a unique blend of engaging entertainment and mental exercise.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mochi-word-puzzles"}
