I thought I would finally do the game behind my name - Xyphoe's Fantasy on the Amstrad CPC!\r\n\r\nThis is a French game (apparently there may be a UK and Spanish version but they haven't been found) so I'll have to translate a lot of this for you - but it's a truly spectacular game with stunning graphics and digitised music converted from the Amiga and Atari ST and 780k of data compacted! Plus 'overscan' pictures and in game action!!

Their forces have captured your \r\n\r\ngirlfriend in order to sacrifice her to their god. You set off in search of her on the back of your fleet-footed warhorse. \r\nIn the couse of your quest you must face many monsters and cruel warriors. You must also be shrewd enough to find the trophies which \r\n\r\nonce combined will lead to the destruction of the empire of the Skulls.\r\n\r\nXyphoes Fantasy consists of more than 650KB of compacted data and is the first game which has animations and displays in overscan, \r\n\r\ndigital music and sound effects from the AMIGA and the ATARI ST, and which makes full use of the 128KB on your CPC.\r\n====\r\n\r\nPLUS the full backstory I translated from the French instruction manual for you - http://gx4000.co.uk/misc/xyphoesfantasy_fullstory.txt\r\n\r\n(c) Silmarils 1991\r\n\r\nhttp://cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&num=1433\r\n\r\nLevels, Menu, soundtracker routines, conversion routines soundchip, compaction and protection: Fabien FESSARD alias Fefesse\r\nFighting in overscan, presentation, Hi-score, and mega format interlevels: Michel Fauquet\r\nScenario and Graphics: Stephane SAINT-MARTIN\r\nAtari ST soundchip routines, music and sound effects soundchip: Emmanuel LARY\r\nMusic Soundtrack presentation and end: Fabrice HAUTECLOQUE", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bon0Jut2qnk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bon0Jut2qnk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bon0Jut2qnk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bon0Jut2qnk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "[AMSTRAD CPC] Xyphoes Fantasy - Longplay & Review", "description": "My 199th video special!
