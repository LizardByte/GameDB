In a galaxy rife with plundering pirates, crazy cultists, sudden storms, and malicious monsters, starchasing is a dangerous career where the risks are great but the rewards are even greater.\n\nWhile Underspace provides the protagonist\u2019s prompt, players decide how his story unfolds \u2013 want to make a name as a renown monster hunter, slaying celestial behemoths one by one? Perhaps the mercenary life is more appealing, raking in the kills and becoming an ace pilot in no time? Should the exploration bug bite, a vast amount of ancient civilizations are ripe for rediscovery. Or, if a consistent routine calls, there\u2019s money to be made in space mining, trading, or couriering. Whatever the case may be, Underspace allows players to find their footing in Croft as they see fit.\n\nUnfortunately, Croft is not a safe, sane place \u2013 every nook and cranny holds the possibility of danger, even for those who yearn for a peaceful existence. Players will need to become versed in the art of spacefighting, their stormfighters gracefully zipping across the sky as they engage in the delicate dance of death. Of course, those skilled enough to survive this fast-paced, frenetic gameplay will be greatly rewarded \u2013 looting the mechanical corpses of the fallen yields cash and cargo to be used in customizing ships, purchasing upgrades, and as commodities to trade or sell at a profit.\n\nAs the saying goes, it\u2019s dangerous to go alone. So why should you? Questing in Underspace can be a solo experience if desired, but perhaps the real gameplay is in the friends we made along the way. Create your own squadron with recruitable NPCs from all walks of intergalactic life, complete with their own unique backstories and missions to undertake. And with online multiplayer support in the works, Underspace continues to prove that space need not be a lonely experience.", "summary": "Face thunderous monsters, join up with devious pirates, loot ancient star cities, and make your mark on a galaxy of storms and secrets in this open world lovecraftian spacefighter RPG! Explore a vast handmade universe full of quests, bosses, and loot. Includes online multiplayer and mod support.\n\nInspired by classic space games, Underspace is an open-world space arcade dogfighting game, where every star system is crafted by hand, and every star system has something to see or do. Jump into the bizarre galaxy of Croft, step into the role you want, and thrive alone or online with friends. But beware! The storms rule the stars.\n\nBe a miner picking through crystallized bones of ancient star beasts, a trader hauling artifacts to far-flung outposts, a pirate robbing spacetrains, an explorer combing through lost stellar cities, or a hunter chasing down unknowable monstrosities that spew forth from the storms. Brave violent weather, eldritch beasts, and the terrors of the unknown as you make your mark in the universe.\n\nThe galaxy is not a safe, sane place. Hyperspatial tempests sweep through space, distorting star systems and spewing forth strange hazards, even stranger monstrosities, and incredible treasures. Traverse 70 handcrafted star systems, any of which could fall victim to foul weather.\n\nStrike out into the starry unknown, and comb through ancient starcities, warped graveyards, or fields of lost wormholes. The galaxy is filled with unique adventures and puzzles waiting for a starchaser to discover and rob them.\n\nAway from the highways and deep in the most remote parts of space lie hidden challenges. you'll face off against world-eating serpents, possessed battleships, and living minefields. End the lives of over 20 unique bosses, either by yourself or online with friends.\n\nFly, paint, and customize over 60 different ships. Outfit yourself with over 150 pieces of equipment. Choose your race, build your character, and try not to get eaten by a ghost train.\n\nEven in the face of the great storms, life goes on. Befriend or befuddle over 40 different factions, all with their own alliances, goals, and preferences. Pursue random assignments, or discover hidden stories and questionable motives in over 30 unique sidequests.\n\nStrip asteroids of their precious resources, fabricate technology to sell and utilize. Ship over 50 different types of cargo to 150 stations, or pirate it off the imbeciles who stray into your territory. From dashing hero to dastardly hellpriest, solo to multiplayer, experience the galaxy the way you want.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/underspace", "videos": [{"id": 101077, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jaAcsAz87e4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaAcsAz87e4", "title": "Underspace Kickstarter Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jaAcsAz87e4/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 101079, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "576zMRbz-Z4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=576zMRbz-Z4", "title": "Underspace Early Access Launch Trailer | Wishlist on Steam!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/576zMRbz-Z4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 101080, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "u2rFjlr_We8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2rFjlr_We8", "title": "Underspace Trailer | Wishlist on Steam!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2rFjlr_We8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 110613, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "Df2fFx8ZROM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df2fFx8ZROM", "title": "Underspace Release Date Announcement Trailer | Wishlist on Steam!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Df2fFx8ZROM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
