There are punches, kicks, grapples and takedowns. There are also ways of making your opponent submit, or \"tapout\", to gain a victory.\n\nYou have the ability to perform combos, but these combos are realistic; you can perform a 1-2-3-4 punch combo, or a punch-punch-kick, or any variation of those.
