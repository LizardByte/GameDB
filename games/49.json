Players control a syndicate, expanding their influence across a world map divided into territories. Starting from a European base, players deploy agents to infiltrate and conquer adjacent regions through covert operations and violence. Once a territory is captured, players can impose taxes to increase revenue, but must balance this with the risk of inciting rebellions. The game involves managing resources, dispatching agents to eliminate threats both foreign and domestic, and defending against rival syndicates' incursions. Success requires careful strategic planning, efficient resource management, and the ability to outmaneuver opponents on a global scale. The ultimate goal is to achieve world domination by controlling all territories and overcoming all challenges.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/syndicate--2", "videos": [{"id": 501, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "qw2W_Ap7m2k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw2W_Ap7m2k", "title": "Syndicate Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qw2W_Ap7m2k/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 502, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "6oO-_3ib2gk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oO-_3ib2gk", "title": "Syndicate - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6oO-_3ib2gk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
