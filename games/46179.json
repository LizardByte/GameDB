These lights desired domination, and so tried to destroy each other, creating a new darkness and a white light in the process. The white light, desiring peace, locked the other lights and the new darkness in crystals, encased itself in a diamond, and created Alpherion. \n \nApprentice magician Saria is summoned by her teacher to consult a fortuneteller. The fortuneteller alerts Saria to dark wizard Gadou's incoming forces by capturing the great wizards of Alpherion. The fortuneteller gives Saria items so she can go and defeat Gadou.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
