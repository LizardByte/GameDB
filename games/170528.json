He doesn't feel like he's about to fall back asleep, so he gets up to have a drink. Something doesn't feel quite right, though. What he doesn't know is that he's in a loop, stuck forever in an endless loop of the same mundane events at the hands of a mysterious ghastly clown figure. But not everything is as it seems. There are clues, riddles scattered around the false world of this insane dream, and it's up to you to guide the protagonist into solving the puzzles laid out before him and escape from the loop!"}
