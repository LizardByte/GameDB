Every single cave and house is redesigned, and there are a bunch of graphic edits and palette changes. As with 18 Hours Past, there\u2019s kind of a story set in place but it\u2019s not the main focus of the game. There are some custom events though that relate to the story, so the creator at least tried to put more of a story in.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zelda-interconnected-strongholds"}
