Just as things were looking dire for Batman, Robin whistled, caught the assassins off-guard, and floored them with a few quick swipes of his Bo Staff. The lead assassin, who had a sword to Batman's throat, told him to get Robin to stand down, even though Robin said that he could take her. As the assassins vanished, Batman chastised Robin for getting involved, and insisted that he had it under control. Batman then asked why Alfred had sent him, to which Robin explained that he was worried about him. Robin was then given a vial of Batman's Titan-infected blood and was ordered to analyze it and to start searching the hospitals and emergency rooms in Gotham, as Joker's infected blood had been planted there. Robin stated his intention to do that and come back to Arkham City to help Batman. However, Batman insisted that he could handle Arkham City alone and reminded Robin that Gotham was his priority. Robin then expressed concern regarding Strange knowing his secret identity and may potentially expose him, but his mentor assured him that he would find a way should it come to that. Robin then handed Batman the Line Launcher before he reminded him that he'd be on call if he needed him.", "summary": "Download the fully playable Robin character.
