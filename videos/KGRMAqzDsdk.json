You may notice some small changes from our first trailer.\n\nAs you can see, Walrus Run is compatible with Bongo-shaped controllers. This is not required, however, as you can play the game with modern gamepads and keyboard and mouse.\n\nYou may notice some of my claps didn't register. That's because I set the clap sensitivity threshold too low. You can raise the minimum sensitivity required to trigger an attack in the Options Menu - this way you don't have any accidental claps. I am also working on a feature to disable the microphone entirely, so you can just play with Bongo buttons, if you desire.\n\n(And as you might have seen, there are techniques I used other than clapping to register a microphone input :D )\n\nLastly, I will be actively working on cutscenes this month, and I expect to launch a new trailer sometime this summer, featuring new cutscene footage!\n\nWhere to buy Walrus Run\nWalrus Run on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2687610/Walrus_Run\nWalrus Run on Itch.io: https://the-jam-games.itch.io/walrus-run\n\nThe Jam's Socials\nThe Jam Website: https://thejam.games/\nThe Jam Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheJam_Games\nThe Jam Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/thejam_games\nWalrus Run Discord: https://discord.gg/wUHfrAEbgn\n\nDonate to The Jam!\nThe Jam's Ko-Fi: https://ko-fi.com/thejam\nThe Jam's Patreon: https://patreon.com/TheJamGames\nDonate here: https://streamelements.com/thejam_games/tip\n\n\u2709\ufe0f Business Email: ericcallahan.thejam@gmail.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KGRMAqzDsdk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KGRMAqzDsdk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KGRMAqzDsdk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KGRMAqzDsdk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KGRMAqzDsdk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Walrus Run Gameplay - May 2024", "description": "Hey all, here's some new Walrus Run gameplay footage!
