Derived from your subconscious, the regions contain four heavily guarded Orb-Ids needed for level progression. Once obtained, you'll then take the orbs to a central location within that level. You must employ a different strategy for each orb you wish to obtain.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slamscape", "videos": [{"id": 115788, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VF8ryfC2kA4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF8ryfC2kA4", "title": "Slamscape ...
