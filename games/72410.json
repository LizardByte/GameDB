According to the developers, part of the motivation in making Requital was to create an authentic 6th century Russian world for the player to explore. As such, the game veers away from anachronisms and modern fantastical elements like magic and mythological creatures. Instead, it is more centered on historical realism mixed with superstitions that existed in that period of Russian history.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/requital"}
