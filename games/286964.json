Each house, distinguished by its color, requires a connection to a resource building of the same color. Your task is to draw connections \u2013 using pipes, power lines, or other conduits \u2013 to link these structures.\n\nThe real challenge lies in resource management. With limited connection parts, strategic thinking is key. Utilize special abilities like underground tunnels to extend your reach while conserving resources. Avoid crossing lines and manage the limited connection points on resource buildings to succeed.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tiny-connections", "videos": [{"id": 107197, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "91WpsdwGrNQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91WpsdwGrNQ", "title": "Tiny Connections - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/91WpsdwGrNQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
