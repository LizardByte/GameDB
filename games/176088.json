Choose your loot and transform the squishy humans into wizards, cultists, ninjas and dozens of other heroes, including the mythical stale pretzel throwers. With perks and class combos, there are thousands of ways to build your army. The man-eating cabbage will appreciate the variety in its diet!\nIf you can survive the labyrinth, you'll meet THE UNSTOPPABLE END-GAME BUILDS OF OTHER PLAYERS! You'll beat each other to death and only one will be spared by d'Spot. No offense, but in his own game he writes the rules!\nPrepare your warriors and let them fight it out on their own! Indirect combat allows you to focus heavily on tactical considerations rather than reflexes. Strengthen your front line with fridge-movers, aim your food-throwers and look after your Forbidden Summoners!\nThe dungeons are generated from scratch every time, and there is no chance puny humans will ever find the way out! And even if they strike lucky \u2014 don't worry, there are endless ways to die in Despot's Game!", "summary": "Despot\u2019s Game is rogue-like tactics with turbo-charged battles.
