The demo reel showed early versions of gameplay, user interactions, chat, and branded areas.\n\nNickelodeon launched Nicktropolis on January 30, 2007, a completely new kid-targeted multi-media experience that offered visitors the opportunity to engage in a virtual world filled with their favorite web-based activities. At Nicktropolis, kids for the first time had their own virtual community where they had the opportunity to play games, watch videos, explore Nickelodeon-branded and original environments, interact with other kids or Nickelodeon characters in real-time, and create their own personalized rooms.\n\nIt was a very unique gaming experience for fans of the many popular Nickelodeon characters and television shows. You could visit Jimmy Neutron or even hang out with your online Nicktropolis friends at Spongebob's Pineapple. It also had a super awesome carnival-like atmosphere by having midway games and carnival rides. \n\nSome big stats:\nActive registered users = 7,000,000\nIn world gameplays In the first six months = 108,000,000,000\nAverage time spent = 45 min\nFish created in the aquarium = 500,000\n\nGame technologies include Flash/Flex ActionScript 3, XML, JavaScript and Dynamo.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:16 Nickself creator\n00:28 Decorate your room\n00:39 Chat with your friends\n00:50 The map\n01:10 Visiting show rooms\n01:37 Play in world games\n02:14 Buy stuff", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPAJZbS3am4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPAJZbS3am4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPAJZbS3am4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPAJZbS3am4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPAJZbS3am4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nicktropolis Demo Reel - Nickelodeon Virtual Reality World", "description": "This was from a sizzle reel used by the ad sales group to help explain what Nicktropolis was all about to potential advertisers.
