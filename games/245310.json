Cyclops, Storm, and Wolverine meet up with Magneto, Mystique, and Sabretooth at a military prison outpost in Greenland to free Professor X.\n\nUpon freeing him, the teams relocate to the fictional mutant haven of Genosha. They find the island ravaged by Apocalypse's forces where they briefly encounter Mister Sinister who was experimenting on Genoshan mutants and fight Abyss, Lady Deathstrike, and Zealot. The X-Men work through the wreckage and find out what he was searching for. They learn that Quicksilver was kidnapped by Apocalypse, who also kidnaps Beast from the X-Mansion.\n\nBeast manages to point the team in the direction of the Savage Land, a secret prehistoric preserve in Antarctica. The teams work their way through the Savage Land, temporarily hindering Apocalypse's plans while also defeating Grizzly, Garokk, Mikhail Rasputin, and Sauron.\n\nApocalypse then travels to conquer New York. The teams work at helping Nick Fury regain control of the Sentinels from Bastion, sabotaging Apocalypse's army and resources, and defeating Holocaust and the Stepford Cuckoos, Stryfe, and a mind-controlled Deadpool, but Emma Frost and Angel are kidnapped as well. Angel is unwillingly transformed by Apocalypse and Mister Sinister into Archangel, a Horsemen of Apocalypse. He is assigned as a sentry to Apocalypse's tower. The teams defeat Archangel and infiltrate the tower where they find Beast, now under the control of Mister Sinister; he kidnaps Sabretooth and escapes with Apocalypse and Mister Sinister to Egypt.\n\nThey learn that Apocalypse's plan is to use Polaris, Quicksilver, Emma Frost, and Sabretooth\u2014four mutants with what he refers to as Harmonic DNA\u2014as part of a machine to fuel an experiment to grant him massive amounts of power. The teams then follow Apocalypse to Egypt where they defeat Mister Sinister while freeing Beast from Sinister's control. After besting the final guard Living Monolith, the teams battle Apocalypse and defeat him by stealing the powers from his machine.\n\nIn the final cutscene, Magneto and Professor X part once again as adversaries, noting that Apocalypse was defeated but not destroyed. Beast ponders why the machine did not work properly, wondering if sabotage was a factor. As the X-Jet flies away, Sinister is seen on top of the pyramid, laughing, hinting that he sabotaged the machine.", "summary": "X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game developed primarily by Raven Software and published by Activision. It is the follow up to 2004's X-Men Legends. It is set after the events of X-Men Legends and features the mutant supervillain Apocalypse as the primary antagonist.\n\nThe developers intended the game to have a greater sense of scale than its predecessor, with a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the X-Men to defeat a greater threat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-legends-ii-rise-of-apocalypse--3"}
