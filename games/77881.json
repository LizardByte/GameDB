Also it only supports a maximum of two players, as opposed to the arcade's three. There is an extra mode unlocked after beating the game once, where graphics are altered, statistics are changed and a new soundtrack comes into play.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-ages-2500-vol-9-gain-ground"}
