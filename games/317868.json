The squad battles the second Brainiac, who takes the form of Green Lantern, and defeats him. The squad then captures the Joker and takes him back to Earth-1, where he agrees to join them in the ongoing war against Brainiac's forces. As the battle continues on Earth-1, Brainiac adapts his forces by infusing them with Green Lantern's DNA, giving them his powers. The squad returns to Joker Earth once more to confront the third Brainiac, who takes the form of Superman, and emerges victorious.", "summary": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League \u2013 Season of the Joker launched on March 28, 2024, introducing Joker as a playable character, a Joker-themed Elseworld location, new missions, additional gear sets, and a Battle Pass with cosmetic items.
