By listening to the echoes of the ultrasound, they can catch objects in the dark and protect themselves from danger. Echolocaution is a score attack action game based on the ecology of these bats. \n \nEat as many bugs as you can before dawn. Score points by eating insects, and get a combo bonus if you eat them all at once during the echo! Use bats' echolocation to predict the movements of incoming owls and avoid them. Your remaining energy will be added to your score. The goal is to get the highest score possible!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 47189, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TD9Qd-9mtAM"}, {"id": 47190, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EMHFBdpA9yw"}]}
