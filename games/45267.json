Arle is sixteen now. When she encounters Schezo Wegey in the Game Gear version, she calls him a pervert, which became a running gag ever since. In the Game Gear version, Lynx lures Arle to Schezo, showing how they encountered.\n\nArle is warped to a dungeon and most of her powers are gone. She tricks demon guards with sex appeal and snatches the key escaping.(In the Gamegear version, there's a dead body in one of the prison rooms that frightens Arle. Implying that she would have the same fate if she stayed any longer in Schezo's Dungeon)\n\nIn the PC-9801 and Game Gear versions, she fights Dark Dragon before Schezo, who gets burnt to a crisp and shrinks, leaving his dead skin behind. She meets a small bird, Millu, who tells her about a mystical jewel deep within Lyla's Ruins.\n\nShe sees light of the exit but Schezo notices her escaping and fights her. In the PC-9801 version, Schezo is decapitated but the bloody head manages to attack still. After you defeat him, he passes on and you don't see him again (except in the Game Gear version where you meet him again a few times).\n\nIn the PC-9801 version, after you defeat Schezo, you fight a rotting test body which is connected to the walls of the exit. After Arle escapes, she sees the old ruins and decides to investigate it. Throughout the game she finds letters on the ground, apparently they were addressed to Satan from Rulue.\n\nBefore Arle can reach the final floor, she most collect three colored stones and place them inside the Carbuncle-shaped room. Afterwards, she meets Satan, who finds her beautiful and wants to marry her (Schezo appears for a short time in the cutscene of the Game Gear version, and Satan doesn't have his horns and wings.) She fights Satan and defeats the unholy one himself (Pigra also will appear and heal you if you pay him before the battle.)\n\nThe games ends with Arle meeting Carbuncle, who has the jewel Millu spoke of inside of his head. Rather than taking it out of his head, she befriends him, Carbuncle quickly trusts her and they leave Lyla's Ruins.", "summary": "Madou Monogatari II: Arle 16-Sai is a Sega Game Gear sequel to Madou Monogatari I: 3tsu no Madoukyuu.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/madou-monogatari-ii-arle-16-sai", "videos": [{"id": 91045, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FJpZ6Ly0sU4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJpZ6Ly0sU4", "title": "GG Madou Monogatari II: Arle 16-Sai (US Sorcery Saga II: Arle, Age 16)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FJpZ6Ly0sU4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
