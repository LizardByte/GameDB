You earn these simply by completing missions, alongside hefty bonuses paid out for completing Season Challenges.\n\nYour current Season Challenges can be tracked and managed in the Season Terminal. You can at most have three active Challenges at a time, and you will get a new Challenge each day. Most of the Challenges will be completed alongside your regular work in the mines, but one of them requires handing in the hard-to-get Data Rack, which can be obtained by completing the new mission, Industrial Sabotage.\n\nFurthermore, during missions, you may recover Data Cells for even further bonuses. Do so by chasing down a Rival Prospector Drone and destroying it - or find a rival Data Deposit, hack it, and recover the Data Cell inside.", "summary": "A competitor has made its way to Hoxxes!
