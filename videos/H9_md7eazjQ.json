{"id": "H9_md7eazjQ", "snippet": {"title": "Classic Game Gems: DarkStone 15 Minutes Game Play", "description": "Darkstone is an Action Role-Playing game, developed by Delphine Software International and published by Take-Two Interactive, which was released in 2001.\n\nNote: They is a PC version and that version is much better game than the PS1, but even with this, I like the PS1 version. I think it maybe because it's one of the few PS1 games that I can go back and play it over and over and having fun all the time. This is basically a Diablo clone which isn't bad here. Kinda impress how the developer manage to make the controller for this game easy to handle and control when playing it. Unfortunately, the game is old now which mean the graphics look very dated (I mean very dated). Would recommend it for people who want to play some hack and slack on the PS1.\n\nDarkStone\nCopyright \u00a9 2001, Delphine Software International / Take-Two Interactive\nAll Rights Reserved", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9_md7eazjQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9_md7eazjQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9_md7eazjQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9_md7eazjQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H9_md7eazjQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Classic Game Gems: DarkStone 15 Minutes Game Play", "description": "Darkstone is an Action Role-Playing game, developed by Delphine Software International and published by Take-Two Interactive, which was released in 2001.\n\nNote: They is a PC version and that version is much better game than the PS1, but even with this, I like the PS1 version.
