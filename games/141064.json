Released on July 27, 1996, it is the sequel to the 1995 megawad Memento Mori, with many of the same designers involved, including Denis and Thomas M\u00f6ller of the Innocent Crew. Like its predecessor, and in contrast to most megawads, it is designed especially for cooperative multiplayer gameplay, although it can be played in single-player as well. It is also one of the few PWADs that are allowed to be used in Compet-N speedruns.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
