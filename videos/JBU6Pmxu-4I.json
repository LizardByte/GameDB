You can download the zip from my own website right now like old times, and enjoy this higher-resolution, controller-supporting, multi-player version of the game. It is still possible to then side-load it into Steam via their \"Add to library\" function, and even enjoy it on Deck as intended so long as you head to the settings and \"force compatibility\" with Proton.

That way, I may even take a more relaxed attitude to this version (and this version alone) being modded and redistributed.
