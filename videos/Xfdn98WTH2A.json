I've got a soft spot for her really, her career has been pretty incredible.  She started out with country/pop and was really successful, then went full pop and turned into one of the most successful artists of all time.  She writes all of her own songs too, which earns massive respect from me.  I also really respect her for speaking out recently in support of Black Lives Matter and the removal of confederate statues.  And of course, she's put out countless bangers.  I can really vibe with Taylor.  I hate celebrity worship, and I hope I'm not sounding like that right now, but Taylor Swift really seems like a genuinely talented and decent person.\n\nFelt compelled to share my thoughts because so many have been anticipated this song in the comments of recent videos.\n\n1st place by 4 points btw.  Gotta love those extended sustains. 1st squeeze is pretty tough too.\n\nMy Scores:\nhttps://www.scorehero.com/scores.php?user=560643&group=14&game=0&platform=0&size=1&inst1=1&inst=1&diff=4&team=0", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xfdn98WTH2A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xfdn98WTH2A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xfdn98WTH2A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xfdn98WTH2A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xfdn98WTH2A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Band Hero - \"Love Story\" Expert Guitar 100% FC (234,594)", "description": "Love Story - Taylor Swift\n\nLadies and gentlemen, it's Taylor time.\n\nIt was pretty cool that Taylor Swift got in this game tbh.
