The leadership bicker amongst themselves in a deadlock of conflicting solutions, until finally, they decide to call on Asgard for aid. Gunnhildr, the the only member of the Warrior class to become an Ancient, is sent to beg before the Gods, but they reject her. Unable to accept refusal, Gunnhildr challenges the Gods themselves in an effort to win their respect. She is defeated. The Gods spurn Niflheim as a parasite on the Nine Worlds, and shatter the Bifrost, isolating Niflheim from the other worlds of Yigdrasil forever. The Three Primes declare Gunnhildr to be \"The Damnation of Niflheim,\" and sentence her to an eternity in Niflhel.
