The game involves fallos which are a race of little people you have to place on a 3D cubes. fallos have to be placed in pairs and the object of the game is to keep the cube balanced so the fallos don't fall off. Sounds simple and it is at first, but each round adds an extra cube and soon you have a strange 3D object made up of multiple cubes each requiring it has one fallos on, to clear the round. Put two fallos in the wrong place and you will watch them all slide off. To complex matters there are also the mischievous pale fallos who turn up on the later stages to cause trouble. Brilliant game from a brilliant mind.\n\nWith the Wii Shop Channel coming to an end in the near future and the ability to buy games ending next week we though it was time to cover some of the best games on the system. Buy them while you still can.\n\nAlso known as: \u304d\u307f\u3068\u307c\u304f\u3068\u7acb\u4f53 (Japanese)\n\nRelease: 2009\nDeveloper: From Yellow to Orange (fyto) / \u30d5\u30ed\u30e0\u30a4\u30a8\u30ed\u30fc\u30c8\u30a5\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8 and programming by T&E Soft\nPublisher: Nintendo / \u4efb\u5929\u5802\nFormat: Nintendo Wii / \u4efb\u5929\u5802 \u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\n\nYOU, ME, and the CUBES is not available on any other format.\n\nRandomised Gaming blog: http://randomisedgaming.tumblr.com  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/rdmdgaming\n\nAll footage in this video is captured directly from the Nintendo Wii console at 480p, via an Elgato Game Capture HD60 Pro using a component to HDMI upscaler.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7E_EilsjDp4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7E_EilsjDp4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7E_EilsjDp4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7E_EilsjDp4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7E_EilsjDp4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "YOU, ME, and the CUBES - Nintendo Wii - World 1 & 2 Gameplay, Best of WiiWare [HD 1080p60fps]", "description": "A short sample of gameplay from the wonderful WiiWare puzzle game YOU, ME, and the CUBES which was one of the last games the late Kenji Eno worked on.
