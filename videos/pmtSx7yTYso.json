{"id": "pmtSx7yTYso", "snippet": {"title": "Warhammer: Arcane Magic Gameplay (PC HD)", "description": "Warhammer: Arcane Magic pc gameplay Part 1 @ 60fps | No Commentary | Walkthrough | Let's Play. \nWarhammer: Arcane Magic is a turn-based digital boardgame set in the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles. Developed by old school indies, Turbo Tape Games. Prepare for an entertaining journey that will challenge even the most veteran strategy players.\n\nArcane Magic is set in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles world, and will see you journey through legendary Warhammer locations as you assemble wizards, spells and artefacts. You have a maximum of three wizards you can bring into play, and for each of these you decide which spells and scrolls to bring based on their school of magic. Each campaign consists of eight levels, and each campaign rewards you with a new wizard. Two campaigns are included with the base game. Measure your Power carefully as you select which spells to cast as you aim to optimize your round. Arcane Fulcrums are vital sources of magic found on every level that both restore and increase your Power. Consider how the winds of magic affect your spells and choose carefully what action to take as the enemy is relentless. Through your journeys you will come upon treasures of old, even the most sought after Golden Plunder Packs which contain ancient artefacts that allow you to bind scrolls of any school of magic into them, allowing you timeless control over their raw energies. Collect and manage your critical pool of Warpstones and Gold as you progress deeper into even more challenging realms. \n\nBuy Warhammer Arcane Magic pc game on steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/440330/\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/tr1ppa?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPC Gameplay Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLslfvIJAupsxYRIbkQaylzyzXUOo8LP46\nSteam Early Access Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLslfvIJAupszqky2AMoqXlmmWV4DAztzp\nPC Game Giveaway Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLslfvIJAupsxrVAhG94EWi6WDO7WEue0a\nSteam Group: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamingallthetime\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/tr1ppaYT\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tr1ppa_games\n\nTitle: Warhammer: Arcane Magic\nGenre: Turn Based Strategy, Tabletop\nDeveloper: Turbo Tape Games AS\nPublisher: Turbo Tape Games AS\nRelease Date: 3 Mar, 2016\n\nAppreciate all feedback, enjoy the game video! :)\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nMore Gameplay Videos!\n\"Samorost 3 PC Gameplay Walkthrough\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enwVb8VssEo\n\"Paws: A Shelter 2 Game PC Gameplay\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IxVU_sI-cA\n\"Polaris Sector PC Gameplay\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9ph83nJuAw\n\"Way of the Samurai 3 PC Gameplay\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH534ovuakg\n\"Vortex The Gateway PC Gameplay\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuyvI09u3O4\n\"Professional Farmer 2017 PC Gameplay\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwW9-uwDm38\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pmtSx7yTYso/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pmtSx7yTYso/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pmtSx7yTYso/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pmtSx7yTYso/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pmtSx7yTYso/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Warhammer: Arcane Magic Gameplay (PC HD)", "description": "Warhammer: Arcane Magic pc gameplay Part 1 @ 60fps | No Commentary | Walkthrough | Let's Play. \nWarhammer: Arcane Magic is a turn-based digital boardgame set in the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles.
