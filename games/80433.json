The players are shown right below a giant Pachinko game. Five cups are placed across the screen, with two rotors, one at each side, and the Magic Mountain in the middle. The object of the game is to bounce the balls inside the cups to earn points. Each player has an energizer, used to beat the ball. If the action button is pressed, the energizer will be risen and if the ball touches it, it will continue its horizontal direction. If the ball touches an energizer not completely raised, the ball direction will be reversed. If the ball hits a player, it will loose energy.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pachinko--1"}
