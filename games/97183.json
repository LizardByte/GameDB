It is the ninth game in the beatmania series and is part of the BEMANI franchise. \n \nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. \n \nThe game focuses on remixing the songs from the first two game, where every song features a normal and remixed version. it is the first game that lets you change the modifiers from the music select screen, which becomes standard later in the series, but only only when the game is in event mode. \n \nSince the game focuses on remixes no songs from clubMIX was brought over. Instead 17 songs from beatmania and beatmania 2ndMIX was included and remixed. An additional 7 brand new songs was also included for a total of 41 songs.", "videos": [{"id": 38316, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6-R4Uslfb4U"}]}
