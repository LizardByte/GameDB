A female high school student, a man with a good physique, a young man with long hair, and a boy who still had some childishness left in him. Having confirmed the attendance of the members, all of whom varied in age and gender, one of them speaks:\n\n\u201cHave you found the next devil king?\u201d\n\nWith those words, the four\u2019s appearance had completely changed.\nJet black wings, sharp horns, deep crimson eyes, and a sinister carved seal- their appearance could no longer be called human.\n\nYes\u2026 They are not human.\nThey\u2019re the Four Heavenly Kings, hailing from the netherworld in a different dimension. They have come under the guidance of a book detailing the selection of a devil king, in order to search for a successor. The last devil king had fallen in battle against their enemies called the \u201cLight Tribe\u201d.\n\nEven though its name is known in the netherworld, knowledge of this human world is nonexistent. Each of them concealed themselves in order to gather intelligence, however, results didn\u2019t come to them as easy as they had hoped. The protagonist and one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Aika, started to feel impatient with the lack of progress.\n\nOne day, the Four Heavenly Kings were each able to locate \u201ca human with the qualities to become the devil king\u201d.\n\nHowever, at present, there is no way to tell which of the four \u201ccandidates\u201d is the real devil king. Aika and the rest of the Four Heavenly Kings, obeying the writings of the devil king selection book, decide to explore the qualities of the devil king candidates.", "summary": "Re:Viced is a fantasy, romance Japanese visual novel.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/re-viced", "videos": [{"id": 42547, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "3StKUcxH9cE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3StKUcxH9cE", "title": "PS Vita\u300cRE:VICE[D]\u300d \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3StKUcxH9cE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 42548, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "liJWSXmzAlo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liJWSXmzAlo", "title": "PS Vita\u300cRE:VICE[D]\u300d \u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/liJWSXmzAlo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
