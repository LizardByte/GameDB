Annotations were buttons within the videos that took you to other videos, emulating decision-making and interaction with the environment. YouTube removed the annotations functionality a few years ago, leaving these games unplayable on their original platform.", "summary": "Recreation in Unity in offline version of the video games originally created by V\u00edctor Losa Rega\u00f1\u00f3n, alias pinofas on YouTube.\n\nThis recreation brings together the first 3 installments (Tube Adventures 1-3) and makes them playable offline with controls similar to Youtube, with an interactive timeline in each video. It also contains a system of Merits as Achievements; basically the endings, collectibles and secrets (eg access to Hall of Fame) that could be originally unlocked in each installment. Once each Merit has been obtained, it can be viewed again in its corresponding Merits section from the main menu."}
