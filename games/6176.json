Still Life 2 reveals the long-awaited ending of Still Life and spells a new investigation for Agent Victoria McPherson. \n \nIn Fall 2008, Victoria is sent to Maine where Ellen Dunnigan's body has just been found. The modus operandi and the video sent to the police and press leave no doubt as to the killer's identity: the East Coast Torturer has struck again! No clues are picked up during the autopsy, as the serial killer painstakingly washed the body. Once again, the killer has not committed any errors. \n \nStill Life 2 remains true to the spirit of its first installment and continues to allow you to play and manage two characters bound by the same fate. This time, the aim is to control two heroines, see the game from two different viewpoints, and essentially experience two different types gameplay. Depending on whether you are playing as Paloma Hernandez--the victim--or Victoria McPherson--the investigator--you alternate between survival and investigation.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
