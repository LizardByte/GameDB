Once he has his ensemble together, it's time for the big show: a musical extravaganza at the symphony hall. Perform perfectly and you will save the hall and keep music alive for generations to come. If you fail, the hall will be closed down. The game features 11 levels, including the epic performance at the symphony hall. Touch-sensitive controls allow you to feel the music.
