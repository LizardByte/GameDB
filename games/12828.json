The player starts each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which he/she has to protect from attacks by Japanese planes. The goal is to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, turrets and barracks on a series of islands and killing enemy soldiers either with bombs or by machine gun. The weapons to complete these objectives, besides machine guns, are a limited number of bombs, rockets and torpedoes. On some missions, the player must also sink Japanese vessels, such as destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. The player has a finite amount of fuel and munitions, which can be replenished by returning to the carrier. The player's aircraft can be destroyed by accumulated damage from enemy fire or by crashing into the terrain.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wings-of-fury"}
