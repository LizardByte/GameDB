The nearest to an end of Chuckie Egg is actually level 88 (or level 256 depending on how you look at it). The game loops continuously in 8-level cycles. The amount of nasties in the level remains constant after level 32. \n\nHowever the amount of time given to complete the level decreases during subsequent cycles until it reaches 400 at levels 80-88. After level 88 the game repeats a loop of levels 80-88 until level 256 when the game resets back to the original level 1 (no congrats message or anything!).\n\nThis recording stops at level 101 (although the level counter says it is Level 1), as everything has been seen, and it just repeats every 8 levels.\n\nNo POKEs were used for this. When the guy appears to pass through enemies, it's due to bugs in the program. The only cheat used was an emulator feature called \"rollback\", which allows you to try again if you make a mistake. You can verify this by doing the following:\n1. Go to http://www.rzxarchive.co.uk/c.php#chuckie and download the rzx file that this video is based on.\n2. Play back the rzx file in a suitable emulator, eg Spectaculator, SpecEmu, Spin. You'll notice the exact same gameplay as in this video.\n3. Stop playback of the rzx file in the emulator, so you have control of the game.\n4. Run into an enemy, and you'll lose a life.\n\nFrom the recording originally sent to http://www.rzxarchive.co.uk/ . Recorded using \"rollback\", a feature of the emulator which allows you to mark a point, which you can then roll back to later if you get in trouble, and try again.
