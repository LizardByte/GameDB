Released in anticipation of the Kickstarted Pathologic Remake currently in development, Pathologic Classic HD is the definitive rendition of Ice-Pick Lodge's seminal game.\n\nEmbark on a dark journey to explore a remote town built upon old tanneries and butcheries just as a mysterious and deadly disease breaks out. An educated doctor, The Bachelor, is sent to investigate, but he is not alone.  One of the volunteers, The Changeling, is a strange girl who believes she can heal with her hands, and the other, The Haruspex, is a talented amateur who\u2019s fond of experimental surgery.\n\nTaking on the role of one of these doctors you will explore the town, its weird traditions, and the complex relationships of its inhabitants.
