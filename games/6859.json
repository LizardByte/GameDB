Each character has different bonuses in gameplay; for example the cop will offer more hours for the player to scavenge for supplies at the beginning of the game but will earn less points if the player beats the game, while the lawyer will give the player the least time to scavenge for supplies but earn the most points.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/organ-trail-director-s-cut"}
