Chapter:\n\nEverything stars in 1991, after the game \u201cSonic the Hedgehog\u201d happened, Classic tails encouraged Classic Sonic to use his reputation to make a restaurant for his fans to see him.\n\nThe restaurant was called \u201cSonic Fast-Food Dinner\u201d but sonic could not be here as much as intended.\n\nSo, tails had the idea to make a clone of him, he creates Origin Sonic with a cloning machine, but it was not perfect, so that turned him into distinct colors and it did not act like Classic Sonic, tails did not know how to fix that, but they let the clone stay there and make his color an idea for his performance, so that is how he ended up with a hat, a bowtie, and a microphone.\n\nThe evil Dr Ivo Robotnik or Eggman (who is Sonic's enemy) to get more information takes the nightshift to spy on Sonic.\n\nBecause of the cloning machine issues, Origin Sonic thinks Dr. Ivo Robotnik is a robber, so Origin Sonic tries to murder him during the night, as says the guy on the phone (which is Tails) during his first night shift.\n\nWithin Dr Robotnik\u2019s nights, Shadow Sonic, a shadow, deformed, future version of Origin Sonic, uses time travel and goes to the versions of Origin Sonic that we see on the 4 previous games timeline to make them join his evil plan.\n\nShadow sonic arrives after night 4, he comes see the clone to team up with on night 5.\n\nOn night 6, Shadow Sonic brought the versions of Origin (which are the golden sonics), but during the day people saw them and thought they were figures, still Eggman finishes his shift (which is 12 pm to 8 am), but then Origin Sonic suddenly enters the office and so bites a part of his head off, causing \u201cThe Bite of \u201891\u201d, which the phone guy of FNaS 3 mentions.\n\nEmployers at the place kept his name secret because Eggman is evil, he goes into a coma where he must survive another time against the characters and survive (which is FNaS 5 Hard Mode), which happens like nightmares.\n\nThe Evil Doctor woke up, and after the accident, the restaurant was closed, and Origin Sonic was taken away from the building and abandoned until 2015.\n\nFive Nights at Sonic\u2019s 1:\n\nAn obscure company makes a new restaurant called \u201cSonic Hero Pizza Palace\u201d, they find Origin Sonic and brought him to the new building.\n\nIn his condition, more known as \u201cGolden Sonic\u201d, he has his cloning material melting on his face, and the blood on his teeth is from \u201cThe Bite of \u201891\u201d.\n\nClassic Sonic, who was with Modern Sonic, agreed to be cloned at another time promises the new cloning machines will work better.\n\nMario and Yoshi, who are friends with Modern Sonic, suggested joining Classic Sonic too, Classic Tails joined as well.\n\nWhen the day came, they went in their respective machines, with accessories on them to do like they did on Origin Sonic.\n\nThey wait for the process, but Eggman, who found it out and snuck in the place, decides to ruin Sonic\u2019s name and the business, so he messes with the machines which gave the clones evil aspects, and that is why they turn evil at night, this might even be the reason of the Clone Yoshi being a girl.\n\nLuigi was the first nightguard of the restaurant, working for 5 days and making phone calls for the next guards of the establishment.\n\nBut on his fifth night, the Sonic clone attacked him because the power ran out, and People thought he was dead.\n\nKnuckles, the one we play in FNaS 1 will be the next nightguard, he finishes his week, but he is fired due to his attitude, odor, and for not watching the \u201cMaster Emerald\u201d (A large emerald that can lead to chaos in bad hands), and after that he went off to hide, but not before working to get the place shut down.\n\nHe was mad because he did not get more money, and he did not really care about the clone's attitude. (In the remake of FNaS 1, Luigi is a mechanic instead of a nightguard, and in Knuckle\u2019s 4th night he must fix something from the kitchen, but then the evil sonic clone attacks him there, but in the ending of the remake, we see Luigi stuck on the refrigerator, which it quite explains that Luigi was in the establishment for a long time and was missing).\n\nOnce again, the place was shut down and the clones stayed in, rotting, taking care of themselves for 2 years.\n\nFive Nights at Sonic\u2019s 2:\n\nWe are in 2017, the same company behind the previous restaurants wanted to try again with a new restaurant under the same name, they put the clones on the Back Room, who for 2 years grew weak and injured because of being in small rooms (who are named now with a nickname before their name called Withered), like for Mario who lost his face thanks to Yoshi who was so mad at him that she slammed his face against a stove that was on, what we see inside of him it is his skull, being gray because of shadows.\n\nThe company wanted to make animatronics this time, which is how the Toys (Toy Sonic, Toy Mario, Toy Yoshi, and Toy Tails), Balloon Toad and Luiginette were made.\n\nLuiginette was a memorial for Luigi at the request of someone who is outside the company, whose name was not mentioned, but these robots were not programmed well.\n\nIn the night, as the phone guy explains, they look for people in the building because of the lack of sound, and they bug out and they think the nightguard is an empty endoskeleton (which is the skeleton of those animatronics).\n\nBut since this is against the rules, they stuff endoskeletons in the suits, it seems not to be bad, but inside the suits, there are a lot of wires and animatronic devices, which means who gets stuffed in there would die.\n\nAfter they had been built, the restaurant opened, Knuckles, seeing this chance, decided to go back and work there, because he wanted more money, and this time he made phone calls.\n\nBecause of kids messing with Toy Tails, she is now broken and that is how it was named Taingle.\n\nAfter Knuckles week, Amy Rose, who we play in the game, takes the role of the nightguard, who is happy to be here because of his love of sonic.\n\nAmy finishes her first week, on night 6, knuckles say people saw something like a golden figure, it was possible the restaurant was going to be closed because Golden Sonic who has his cloning material melting more was sneaking around when people were there. And they thought they were hallucinating.\n\nAmy finishes her 8th night, Golden believes she saw too much, and when she was about to leave, he quickly kills her, one of the secret images of FNaS 4 says it, and her body is never found due to Golden who hid her in an unknown location, only presumed to be missing on a newspaper, in which Luigi is also mentioned.\n\nAfter this event, the place was closed, and the clones and robots were moved somewhere else.\n\nFive Nights at Sonic\u2019s 3:\n\nTen years have passed, the robots and clones were brought to the storage unit, and not yet the establishment we are, The Toys (Toy Sonic, Toy Mario, and Toy Yoshi) for the years became broken, dirty, and unused, Toy Yoshi even lost half of her body.\n\nThese things happened before the actual restaurant where are in the game was created, Mario, Yoshi, and Tails are fixed, it is the same for sonic, but he has been locked by Eggman who snuck in the place, Sonic was in the room which belongs to the Toys with Golden Sonic too.\n\nEggman to take revenge kills the 3 other clones, one by one, who were looking for Sonic, though Eggman needed to kill clone sonic, because he knew that clone would be enough to keep the company alive long enough and he could finally ruin his name.\n\nSonic still locked in the room, woke up, and pressed a light switch, but Toy Sonic woke up and malfunctioned, badly, with strange memories of the past, which it is what it made him to attack clone sonic, and that is how he turned into Salvage Sonic.\n\nThen, he leaves the room, finds his friends dead, and comes across Eggman, the spirits of his friends go to the room they are, and the clone sonic remembers them, then the evil doctor commands clone sonic to attack his friends, but he did not listen, and he stabbed Eggman as revenge.\n\nEggman was not gone forever, when we see his spirit on the secret minigame, he goes inside Golden Sonic\u2019s body and he now controls it, which still has his cloning material melting more, he plans again to take revenge, we see that with some secret images.\n\nSo, then the company decided to try again another time to make a new restaurant and use the clones like they did on the first establishment, because they had more personality and they could do stuff correctly unlike the robots, though the only found sonic, the storage unit has turned into this new restaurant under the same name again.\n\nSonic is the mascot, during the day, his wounds are covered with medicine, but when he turns evil at night his wounds return, Golden Sonic is hiding, The Toys stay in the backroom to be used if needed, though I do not know exactly what happened to Taingle, Balloon Toad, Luiginette, seeing Taingle\u2019s head on the office, let me think that they were demolished (though on the remake of FNaS 3 (FNaS 3 Reburned) all the toys are there but broken, dirty and unused).\n\nSilver will guide the nightguard who is Modern Sonic, Modern took the job to investigate, he must survive against Salvage Sonic, the Withered Toys, the hallucinations of the dead clones, Taingle, Balloon Toad, and Luiginette who are hallucinations too and Golden Sonic.\n\nThen during the 6th night, due to the clones stepping on the wires, the building catches fire, at the same moment Salvage Sonic comes but fails because a part of the roof fell off and he got hit by it, Modern Sonic manages to escape and he did not want to look back, he was confused, and he assumed everyone in there perished.\n\nThe authorities looked in the rubble after the fire stopped but did not see Salvage Sonic and the toys.\n\nAfter Modern Sonic escaped, he got all his friends, including his Nintendo friends and got them all to a whole new place, a whole new world, so they would escape commotion, and Modern Sonic thought that was the end of that franchise, but he was wrong. The real heroes were soon enough long gone, apart from Knuckles, who decided to stay there.\n\nFive Nights at Sonic\u2019s 4:\n\nSalvage Sonic who was close to death managed to escape; he took the withered toys with him, with his condition he walked for months.\n\nWhich leads to 2028, when he finds the body of his old friends, he wants his friends back, so he goes to the first \u201cSonic Hero Pizza Palace\u201d from 2015, which was abandoned and with a bad condition, the cloning machines where there, he had a plan, using the bodies along with the machines, he manages to change their code with the help of tails, he creates new bodies, which is how the nightmare clones were born, he builds with parts of the toys \u201cThe Toymare\u201d which was made of Toy Sonic, Toy Mario, Toy Yoshi, and Taingle or Toy Tails.\n\nSonic with his nightmare friends and The Toymare head out away from the place, to hopefully find a new area to restart and make everything better from themselves, he found a paper from a phone book that said, Luigi, who was presumed dead, was still alive.\n\nSonic realizes that Luigi could easily get authorities after the clones, if he sees them again, Sonic wanting his friends to be safe did not want that, he does not know where he is, but Luigi is exactly hiding in first \u201cSonic Hero Pizza Palace\u201d, where Sonic just went, when he realizes, he tells his friends to go to the place as fast as possible with the Toymare too to kill him.\n\nAfter Salvage told his friends to go, he came across Golden Sonic or Eggman, half of his body has completely melted, called now Nightmare Golden Sonic in the game, he stabs him as revenge, this happens between 5 days before night 1,1st day he finds his friends, 2nd day he finds the first establishment and the cloning machines, 3rd day he find the parts of the Toymare and he is about to build him, 4th day he is outside with the paper looking for Luigi, 5th day he came across Nightmare Golden Sonic, who kills him.\n\nAfter making sure to finish him off, Golden takes his body to stuff it in his own creation (the Toymare).\n\nWhen he was at the restaurant, he stuffed it in front of nightmare clones, which they did what Salvage did to them, they use his spirit to create Nightmare Sonic who he gave a phone call to Luigi, before sending his friends after him.\n\n\u201cHello, we\u2019re back, after all these years, it\u2019s like a Deja-vu, well you thought you were clever to hid here, well we track you down with the help of our gold friend, you\u2019re not here trying to hide from us, you\u2019re not now doing the same job in the same exact place, you may think you will escape again, but I\u2019ll have you know, there things a little different things this time, try now to hide, we will find you, all you have is a flashlight like that will help, well it\u2019s our time for revenge, you may think you may win but as I always say \u201cGotta go fast\u201d, hahahahahah\u201d\n\nAll the nightmares, Golden Sonic and Toymare attacked Luigi through the nights.\n\nHe escapes after a week they attack, but his hat drops down, the nightmares mad take his hat and they think he will come back for it, but he did not, after this Luigi calls authorities and they moved the clones far from civilization, \u201cThe Toymare\u201d is destroyed, except for Golden, who hid and become after that Shadow Sonic because the clone material melted all his body.\n\nAfter Five Nights at Sonic\u2019s 4:\n\nAfter the nightmare clones were sent far from civilization, they were restored to their original forms they resided in a warehouse.\n\nShadow Sonic body was getting weaker because of the old cloning material, he took off his legs to have enough for the rest of his body, which made him stop melting and he fixed his own body with the machines, so, he became Dr Golden.\n\nIn 2030, Dr golden, still controlled by Eggman, decided to take over the world, he revealed the toy animatronics, which are the ToyMare, Toy Mario, Toy Yoshi, Toy Sonic, Toy Tails, Balloon Toad, and Luiginette, he made them to killing machines with destruction, he also created a great gem with minerals deep within the earth, with the power the Chaos Emeralds, Super Emeralds, and the Master Emerald, called the phantom ruby, capable of altering reality itself to an extent.\n\nHe burned and demolished Angel Island and he started to build his own empire with a Castle on the destroyed island.", "summary": "A collection of all 5 Five Nights at Sonic's games, with the addition of reviews from the developers and an accessible menu.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 63247, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "akO98piBgBc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akO98piBgBc", "title": "FNAS1-5 NIGHTS 1-5 (FNASC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/akO98piBgBc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
