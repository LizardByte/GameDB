However, the calamity known as Storm-9 tore the region apart.\n\nThe Aevium Region has lived a time of peace since then. Pok\u00e9mon and Trainers alike band together to create a region worth living in. However, the dark and sinister organization, Team Xen, rises from the shadows to destroy what little peace the region has left. Explore the Aevium Region while also defending the land from Team Xen. Discover the dark secrets this world has kept hidden under the cracks that separate Aevium and shakes it to its very core.\n\nThis world needs you.\n\nWill you lend us your strength?", "summary": "Pok\u00e9mon Rejuvenation is an episodically released Pok\u00e9mon fan game and spiritual successor to Pok\u00e9mon Reborn. Similarly to Reborn, Pok\u00e9mon Rejuvenation is not a ROM hack, but a standalone game made with RPG Maker.\n\nThe game takes place in the Aevium region, which was split into several islands after some catastrophic event in the past. The protagonist and their mother, Nancy, are headed there aboard the S.S. Oceana when it gets attacked by local villainous team Team Xen. With the ship destroyed and their mother captured, the protagonist is narrowly saved and escapes to East Gearen City \u2014 shaken, but ready to challenge the Pok\u00e9mon League, take the fight to Team Xen, and hopefully, rescue their mother in the process.\n\nLike its inspiration, Pok\u00e9mon Reborn, Pok\u00e9mon Rejuvenation has a more mature story than mainline Pok\u00e9mon games (albeit not as dark as Reborn's). It also features much more difficult encounters, with two difficulty levels available: Story and Classic. The game borrows Reborn's ideas of a field effect system, 18 Gym Leaders, and a level cap, but also replaces the traditional Elite 4 with an Elite 8 and grants new, unique moves to every gym leader. In addition, the game brings back Shadow Pok\u00e9mon from Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum and its sequel, now rebalanced, with Fairy-type Pok\u00e9mon resisting their attacks.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-rejuvenation", "videos": [{"id": 135278, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "b-6LXCi_aCg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-6LXCi_aCg", "title": "Rejuvenation v13.5 | Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b-6LXCi_aCg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 135279, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "e8pVBQAsl7U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8pVBQAsl7U", "title": "Vague Clarity | v13 Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8pVBQAsl7U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
