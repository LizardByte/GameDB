This very special April Fools scenario aims to correct that mistake. Jam packed with as much gyaru goodness as we could muster, with guest illustrations from Popcore, blackshirtboy, NotZachForWork, CupcakeCarly, ComicTF, Ayvie, and Cavitees, and guest audio by Raina the Mouse, there's a lot to enjoy.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oops-all-gyarus"}
