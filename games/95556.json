When 8 colors were enough, and the pixels were individually detectable to the human eye. This is Lowlander, a fantasy role-playing adventure from simpler times.\nEmbark on a glorious adventure to save the world from the clutches of the evil sorceress Azamon and her hordes of low-res low-lifes! You begin as a lost and wandering soul who can barely stay alive. Your circumstances will rise in the service of King Shebastian as you help to rid the world of evil. It IS as simple as black-and-white!\nLowlander harkens back to the early days of personal computers.
