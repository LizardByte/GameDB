They never made it back. Enter the manor and rescue their souls.\"\n\n\"Il Maniero Spettrale\" was originally made for the Halloween Level Design Contest (HLDC) 2014, in which it won first place. It's a single large level with a \"Metroidvania\" structure, inspired by the likes of Luigi's Mansion, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Banjo-Kazooie. The goal is to find the souls of the adventurers who visited the manor, and lead them to their eternal rest. For Halloween 2018, this was updated and released as a standalone hack, in order to make it more accessible to new players. There are several small improvements and fixes over the original and some rooms have been redesigned.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/il-maniero-spettrale"}
