The game is a life-simulation game and it comes as a pseudo-sequel to the earlier-broadcast (July 1996)/retail release Bokujou Monogatari, commonly known internationally as \"Harvest Moon\"; this has given the series the fan-nickname \"BS Harvest Moon\" as a result. Together with the game (typically immediately before and after), 10-minute broadcasts of a related nature were released entitled BS Bokujou Monogatari Torisetsu (a digital instruction manual) and Bokujou Monogatari no Kekka (a score/results program). It stars Yoshitake Tanaka as voice actor.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-bokujou-monogatari-dai-4-wa", "videos": [{"id": 58679, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8MgGW_Qymyo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgGW_Qymyo", "title": "BS\u7267\u5834\u7269\u8a9e\u3000\u7b2c\uff14\u8a71", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8MgGW_Qymyo/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6191, "name": "Harvest Moon (old)"}]}
