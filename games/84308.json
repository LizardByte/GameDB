However, the increasing information flow and infection by a virus (the main character) confused Eden, allowing her to begin questioning the meaning of its existence and the consequences of her actions. Trying to fathom the paradoxes that surrounded her and realizing the power she possessed, she shut herself down.\n\nThe player character and protagonist is a hacker virus unofficially named Swayzak, traversing the Project-K network on a mission to re-awaken Eden and to reveal the true being at her core by progressing deeper through the system, and destroying the other viruses, anti-viruses, security programs, defense systems, and firewalls within.", "summary": "Just over six years after Rez's release, Rez HD was released on Xbox Live Arcade, ported to the Xbox 360 by Q Entertaiment (Mizuguchi's company) and HexaDrive, using additional controllers to replace the original Trance Vibrator peripheral.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rez-hd", "videos": [{"id": 36573, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wff2ouHmazE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wff2ouHmazE", "title": "\u301060fps\u3011Rez HD\u30101080p\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wff2ouHmazE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
