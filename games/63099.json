The player uses one of the five cars to race on one of the five courses. The game is aimed at motor sport enthusiasts as there are no driving help features and it uses telemetry data also used by professionals - of course the player has a lot of options to customize his car's settings. Other features are the interactive cockpit and the physics which take real-world details into account, e.g. dirt on the tires. Single player is restricted to races against the clock, but the main aspect of the game are the online races against other players.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/netkar-pro"}
