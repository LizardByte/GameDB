Why not play as one of those undead for a change?\n\nKEL Reaper of Entropy gives you the chance to control (or at least try to) Kel the Skeleton and choose whether to terrorize or please the villagers. Or both for that matter. The game features unconventional gameplay, heinous methods of gaining victory and a non-existent variety of ways to customize your character. Plus an overdose of twisted humour as a bonus.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kel-reaper-of-entropy"}
