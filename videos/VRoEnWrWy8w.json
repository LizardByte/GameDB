They will control a submarine or a diver and take photographs of alien animals, plants and artefacts. A tutorial level is available, and a bonus mission phase with several self-contained games is opened upon successful completion of the initial three phases.

The different vision modes, sound effects and music make the experience varied and engaging. Some of the context is realistic to a certain extent, based on real research, science and hard science-fiction. The player is placed in an international context, where humanity works together to push the boundaries of knowledge\u2026\n\nUse of African music in a science-fiction game.\nNot many people associate space travel and the exploration of our universe with anything related to Africa. This is often so, because many of us are biased to rather associate these topics with classical music, or sometimes western music, or bespoke \u2018futuristic\u2018 music. The Kaiy\u014d Mission wants to break this sub-conscious bias.\n\nAn indie game localised in Basaa language.\nThe Kaiyo Mission is probably the first indie game localised in the Basaa language, widely spoken in Western Africa.\n\nMini games on an alien planet based on traditional African games.\nSome traditional games of the Basaa tribe are included in the Bonus Mission Phase perpetuating these parts of African culture that are threatened of being lost in the near future\u2026", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRoEnWrWy8w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRoEnWrWy8w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRoEnWrWy8w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VRoEnWrWy8w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "The Kaiyo Mission - Trailer (text updated: game playable now in 15 languages!)", "description": "'The Kaiy\u014d Mission\u2019 is about peaceful yet dangerous space exploration in hostile underwater environments of ocean worlds.
