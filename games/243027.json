In the 3D races, Spider-Man needs to move higher or lower between buildings to avoid obstacles. The 2D levels are more traditional: climbing walls and ceilings, slinging webs at opponents, taking pictures for the Daily Bugle newspaper, using spider sense to reveal secrets, etc. The events are loosely based on the story of the Spider-Man 2 movie. The game offers fifteen 2D levels, five 3D levels, some Spider-Man comics' classical villains as bosses (like The Lizard, Rhino, and Doc Ock) and a scoreboard on N-Gage Arena.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spider-man-2--4", "videos": [{"id": 88483, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rUSmk0nFXbs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUSmk0nFXbs", "title": "Spider-Man 2 - N-Gage - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rUSmk0nFXbs/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 108, "name": "Spider-Man"}]}
