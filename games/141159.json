Since ancient times, fabulous creatures goblin, kikimors, swamp spirits and many others have always helped ordinary wanderers and heroes. They gave them gifts in every possible way and supported them in their development. And there was an idyll between people and creatures, everyone lived in peace and harmony. But over time, more and more people began to be attracted and interested in the wealth of fairy-tale heroes. Because of human greed and cruelty, the first disagreements arose. People began to enslave creatures with impunity. Greed and lust for profit overshadowed their minds. And then Perun decided to protect the creatures from people and endowed them with incredible strength and abilities to protect humans from the misfortune. He split the old world and created several new ones, scattered riches over unknown distances, which the creatures reliably guarded. \n \nThe strategic component of the game is determined by two main conditions: \n1. There are two types of interaction between players in the game. Either the player becomes a prince and develops by capturing and surrounding locations belonging to other players, or he becomes a fiefdom and at these locations is mining items and materials. In fact, this is a symbiosis, some players are engaged in mining, others protect them by receiving profit from them, while they jointly expand their possessions by spreading their influence to other principalities and cities. The mechanics of capturing and surrounding locations is a separate game, reminiscent of a game of \"dots\" on a large spherical world with a size of 25,000 hexagons. \n \n \n2. Players, through close social interaction, identify leaders who are appointed to govern cities and states as a whole. Such players, while occupying positions, have mechanisms at their disposal to manage the economy of the game. They also develop a strategy for the development of the state as a whole, dictating foreign and domestic policies and the conditions for the existence of the players themselves in it. Such appointments occur weekly, so the dynamics of development in the game depends entirely on the correctness of the actions of the gaming community, as well as on the insight and wisdom of the rulers. \n \nIn the game, the strategy is the main point, however, in addition to this, all the basic familiar mechanics are implemented, grind for grinders, battle for battles, sandbox for sandstone, casual for casual, craft for crafters, etc., but made with a new look at making games. Everything here is comfortably balanced and everyone will find for themselves what they need.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 43070, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LHjEUHi7D0I"}]}
