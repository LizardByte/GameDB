Each time you save the village from the latest threat, you'll rise in fame and unlock more features.\n\nGather better weapons and magic as you navigate non-linear regions. Choose paths that offer the most reward at the least risk. (Room contents are generated procedurally.) When ready, enter the dragon lair and finish the job.\n\nThe combat mechanics involve hex grids, attack modifiers, and poly dice. The strategy involves using room layouts to your advantage, wielding the proper weapons and magic, and knowing when it\u2019s time to sneak, fight, or ... flee!\n\nWitty NPC remarks, without long monologues or dialog trees. Meaningful weapon choices, without complicated inventory management. Fantastic art, without annoying cut-scenes.\n\nUse the best hero for the job, swapping mid-quest as needed. The Human Swordsman is a well-rounded fighter who excels with his blade. The Elven Huntress, with her archery and leaping ability, does best when keeping her distance. The Dwarven Brawler, relying on his trusty shield and deadly fist, enjoys charging into a crowd. With experience, each hero will gain new skills and improved feats.\n\nYou\u2019ll start each dungeon run with weapons that only a blacksmith\u2019s mother could love. That +1 Sword of Cutting Remarks will not always be helpful. Procure better swords, shields, and bows through stealth or force. You'll also find magic scrolls such as Flame to create defensive barriers, Leap to reposition yourself, Haste for a free action, Vanish to become unseen, and Bolt to cast lighting when you have all your orcs in a row.", "summary": "Dungeoneers is a classic dungeon crawler game 10 years in the making.
