The core of the gameplay is to explore in order to see how different is each point of view. The player will switch from one character to another trying to correctly and fully interact with all the environment. Missing an interaction or trying to interact with the wrong elements will determine \"loss\" in the game, causing the game to restart from the beginning.", "videos": [{"id": 6462, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lt5FeQCSk9M"}]}
