It was also released for the following home computer platforms: Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW, BBC Micro/Acorn Electron, MSX, Atari ST, and Amiga.\n\nAlong with the version developed by Mirrorsoft's American sister company, Spectrum HoloByte, it was originally released before Andromeda Software was able to get a licensing deal with Elorg. A contract between Andromeda Software (the sublicensing party), and Elorg was eventually signed on May 10, 1988, which secured the legality of the products.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tetris--11", "videos": [{"id": 128101, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0doETf-J5UE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0doETf-J5UE", "title": "Tetris / MirrorSoft / C64 / 1988", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0doETf-J5UE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
