The jungles surrounding the village of Minofu are under the thumb of the evil Jagu cult who require a blood sacrifice. A beautiful young woman named Flare has been selected as this season\u2019s offering, however her boyfriend Gogan will not stand for it. Equipped with the legendary axe \u2018Sting\u2019, he braves the six zones of Jagu\u2019s territory to defeat the cult and save his love. \n \nThroughout the zones are breakable Jagu idols which drop various sized gems for points leading to extra lives, health revitalizing orbs of differing strength, crown-like crystal containers, and wing icons. Four crystal containers can be earned which charge the destructive power of Sting\u2019s strike, while up to two wings can be collected increasing the speed of subsequent strikes. \n \nEach time you use the axe, the power meter drains completely then recharges as long as you don\u2019t continue to swing. The added strategy of - is it better to dodge and charge the axe for a crushing blow, or is it better to hack away as fast as possible \u2013 sets this game apart from most other hack-n-slashers. When you die, one level of speed and axe power is taken away and you must re-find an icon to get it back. The game doesn\u2019t lock you to only scrolling right, so there are times where you can backtrack to find items. \n \n-http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Legendary_Axe.htm", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
