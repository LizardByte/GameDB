Location: SATAZIUS, a long-abandoned planet.\n\nThe cruiser Agano was on patrol when it was attacked and stricken by a confederacy of space pirates that had established a base on SATAZIUS. The pirates attacked the Agano intending to steal the assault ship \u2018Trafalgar\u2019 that was stowed aboard the Agano, but the Trafalgar made a successful emergency escape.\n\nThe crew of the Trafalgar calculated the probability of successfully escaping the pirate overrun planet at 0.02%; the probability of charging into and successfully destroying the pirate base was 1%. Taking the higher probability escape plan, the crew of the Trafalgar turned their ship toward the pirate horde and began their charge into the heart of SATAZIUS.", "summary": "SATAZIUS is an awesome old school side-scrolling arcade shooter by accomplished indie developer ASTRO PORT (Gigantic Army, Armed Seven, Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser), featuring an arsenal of 13 types of upgradeable weapons, power-ups, obstacles and boss encounters that arcade veterans will enjoying getting to grips with. Customize your ship by selecting two side weapons which can be selected at any time during and a charge attack to unleash massive destruction.\n\nThere is a plethora of enemy ships to shoot down, tight spaces to navigate, power ups to grab, and bonuses to acquire.
