Voice actors are the same as that of \"BS Super Mario USA\", but Excitebike adds a new character, Wario (Chikao Ootsuka).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/excitebike-bun-bun-mario-battle-stadium-3", "videos": [{"id": 58694, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "z-LCYObUWqU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-LCYObUWqU", "title": "\u30a8\u30ad\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u3000\u3076\u3093\u3076\u3093\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u3000\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30a2\u30e03", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z-LCYObUWqU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
