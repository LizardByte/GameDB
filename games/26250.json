Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.\n\nVarious segments of maps are scattered around the galleon, which will form a complete view of the game's overworld once all the segments are picked up. Other scattered items in the game include keys for locked doors, gunpowder to fire cannons and pieces of jewellery, the latter having no additional use other than adding to the player's score.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blackwyche", "videos": [{"id": 105425, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zbk3xNMGbvw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbk3xNMGbvw", "title": "Blackwyche Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbk3xNMGbvw/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2542, "name": "Pendragon"}]}
