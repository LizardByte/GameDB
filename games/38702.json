It features three different game modes, each one with 3 difficulty levels (bronze, silver and gold):\n\nDirt Rally: a regular race mode, against the 5 other characters.\nHot Lap: a time trial mode. The player gets to see a \"ghost\" of his/her previous lap, trying to beat his/her own time.\nDelivery: the player has to pick up goods and deliver them to their destination within a time limit. A minimap shows where the next destination is.\nThe player selects one of six available characters (Cletus, Otis, Bubba, Lurlene, Floyd and Hank), each one riding a different vehicle (from trucks to rally cars, with customizable colors in the iPad version). There are 5 tracks to choose from (8 in the iPad and Zeebo versions), each with its reverse version to be unlocked by earning medals.\n\nThe game offers 5 different steering modes: standard, tank, tilt (which uses the accelerometer function, where available), half wheel and full wheel. There's a multiplayer option for up to 4 players (on Dirty Rally or Hot Lap modes). Best times can be posted on online leaderboards and ghost races can be traded between players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reckless-racing", "videos": [{"id": 143819, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "PcZtPHZ7noo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcZtPHZ7noo", "title": "Reckless Racing", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PcZtPHZ7noo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
