Le Mans. Salzburg. Crisscross the globe to do battle with the world's greatest racers in the sport's premier events. \n \nWho's got the guts? Who wants the glory? Who'll hoist the trophy of world champion? \n \nThe only motorcycle game with a first-person perspective. \nTrue racing realism. Look over the handlebars and see the pavement disappear under your wheels. Sense the undeniable rush of full-throttle speed. \n \nRace on 15 authentic Grand Prix courses. \nTracks like Suzuka in Japan put a premium on handling and acceleration. From Australia to Brazil, you'll file down the foot pegs on the most grueling layouts in motorsports. \n \nChoose from 5 different skill levels. \nWill the racer in front of you blast into the lead or dump his bike trying? Each skill level alters the racing ability of the competition. (Nothing quite like wiping out at 90 mph. How do you say \"ouch\" in Italian?) \n \nRace in 3 different performance classes. \nRide a bullet or a bumble bee. Choose either 500cc, 250cc, or 125cc class races. Check out this baby's specs. It's one road rocket with a license to thrill. \n \nCompete against 9 of the circuit's best Grand Prix riders. \nDon't look behind you know but there's a pack of hungry road warriors right on your tail. There guys chew asphalt for breakfast and burp exhaust. Better eat your Wheaties.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}]}
