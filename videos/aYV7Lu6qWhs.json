But they aren't exactly green anymore, they are now rainbow stars!\nI tried changing most of the green stuff used for green stars to be rainbow but I couldn't change some stuff. Infinite Fluttering and Mega Side Flips are not required to get all Rainbow Stars! I still hope you enjoy your journey to find all 147 Rainbow Stars!\nThanks to Rinusoide for testing the Riivolution Version!\n\n#1 Update Notes: Added a 264 Star Barrier in World Run that unlocks Grandmaster Galaxy. You won't be able to select the first Gold Star though, so just select a Rainbow Star and get the Normal Star without collecting the Rainbow Star ^^\n#2 Update Notes: Added Death Barriers on Beat Block and Flip-Out so you can't cheese the Rainbow Stars anymore lol\n#3 Update Notes: Moved Rightside Down's 1st Rainbow Star a bit to the right. It was impossible to get.\n#4 Update Notes: Rainbows Stars are now unable to spawn in Normal or Comet Missions! I also made some Stars a bit more difficult. Enjoy! ^^\n#5 Update Notes: Changed the position of Honeyhop 3 and removed Rainbow Stars from the Fleet Glide Race.\n#6 Update Notes: Boom Bunker 3 was impossible and has now been fixed!\n#7 Update Notes: Moved Cosmic Cold 2 and Flipsville 1 cause they were too easy or could've been cheesed.\n#8 Update Notes: Moved Tall Trunk 2 to a way better position. ^^\n#9 Update Notes: Moved Fiery Flotilla 1 and changed the 2nd Star to be the 1st one and the 1st to be the 2nd one. Changed the directory of Gravity Gauntlet's Launch Star so you don't die when using it. Moved Shiverburn 3 a bit higher. Moved Boo Moon 1 a bit lower. Deleted my Version of Grandmaster and put in the new one made by TGWaluigi and added Rainbow Stars in that Version. Make sure you unlock the Grandmaster Comet before playing the Rainbow Stars or it'll crash your game! :)\n#10 Update Notes: Sky Station's nonavoidable crash is now fixed! Moved Dusty Dig 1, Hightail Falls 1, and Gravity Gauntlet 3 to be in harder-to-reach places. ^^\n#11 Update Notes: Puzzle Plank 1 has been moved to a different location and is now unable to spawn in the normal mission.\n#12 Update Notes: The music in daredevil comets is now back to normal and doesn't play the unused song anymore.\n#13 Update Notes: Changed the position of Yoshi Star 3 (now Rainbow Star 1), Rightside Down 1, Boo Moon 2, and Twisty Trials 3 (now Rainbow Star 1); Made all 3 Stars of Starshine Beach, Freezy Flake 2, Boulder Bowl 2 + 3 and Sweet Memories 2 + 3 harder.\n#14 Update Notes: Added a SpinSwitchArea to Rightside Down 1 that spawns a DeathArea when spun in. Try avoiding spinning when falling onto the star to not die, if you get softlocked, spin ;D\n#15 Update Notes: Made Boom Bunker 2 a tiny bit harder and more hidden.\n#16 Update Notes: Flip-Up Rainbow Stars are now unable to spawn in regular missions and Slipsand 1 is now even harder. :)\n#17 Update Notes: All text regarding green stars is now changed to be rainbow colored ^^\n#18 Update Notes: Changed the position of Shiverburn 2 (now Star 1).\n#19 Update Notes: Removed the Cheese in Puzzle Plank :)\n#20 Update Notes: Added back a DeathArea in Cloudy Court.\n#21 Update Notes: Corrected some text issues in the German translation.\n#22 Update Notes: Added a brand new Galaxy as a reward for collecting all 269 Stars! The Galaxy has 1 normal Star, a Comet (which you have to access through Rainbow Star 3...) and 3 Rainbow Stars! Have fun collecting those colorful prankster comets! :)\n#23 Update Notes: Added Custom Rainbow Star Names! Now it'll give you a little hint on where or how to find the Rainbow Star.\n#24 Update Notes: Swapped Grandmaster Galaxy Rainbow Star 1 + 2's Name.\n\nRiivolution (Wii/Wii U):\nhttps://mega.nz/file/TGZgSTTZ#IYgeEVgYkIUw_2xJP_0rESBEPr9dvLXKpwnt2wPEom4\nNote: You will have to import your save file if you already played KMG2 before!\n\nDolphin Emulator:\nhttps://mega.nz/file/SXwGjb7D#4-f3KGfxBkRujlpMViI3NZoDCzn1fO5FJvw9Po6htl8\nNote: You will have to beat Bowser's Galaxy Generator for the second time without the 'Main' Code enabled to spawn the rainbow stars! But don't forget to turn it on afterward. A more detailed guide is in the download.\nI won't be releasing a new Download Link for the Custom Rainbow Star Names with the Iso Builder, use the Riivolution Patch instead or extract the files from the Riivolution Download and put them into the Mod Files Folder of the Iso Builder and build it like that.\n\nJoin TGWaluigi's discord server!\nhttps://discord.gg/tqGaskj58W\n\nJoin my discord server if you like!\nhttps://discord.gg/RDqWJgA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aYV7Lu6qWhs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aYV7Lu6qWhs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aYV7Lu6qWhs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aYV7Lu6qWhs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aYV7Lu6qWhs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Kaizo Mario Galaxy 2 Rainbow Star Update Trailer + Download (100% Reward Update!)", "description": "Since TGWaluigi didn't want to add green stars, I did his job and placed them myself.
