But he must steel himself and fend these would-be lovers off with his radiant gaze (known as the Pheromone Shot), as he tries to win the affections of one of the main protagonists. Gal*Gun is the crazy combination of arcade-style shooting action and dating sim that truly has no equal. \n\nDespite it's ridiculous premise, Gal*Gun has been universally recognized for just how well it plays as a shooting game! Many Gal*Gunners around the world have already experienced this sensation since the series debut in January of 2011, allowing the series to continue to stir the hearts of people to this day!\n\nTime sure flies though, because next year in 2021 the Gal*Gun series celebrates its 10th anniversary!\n\nTo honor the occasion, there's no better way than to bring back the game that started it all, remastered and making it's \"everywhere except Japan\" debut with the release of \"Gal*Gun Returns\"!\n\nFor the Japanese fans (and all you crazy bilingual importers), this will feel like a warm homecoming.
