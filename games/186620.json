Try to find a way out, but don\u2019t forget about the rumors of a big blue monster that lives in the tunnels.", "summary": "Ohr Oni is an Ao Oni spinoff game created with the OHRRPGCE (Official Hamster Republic Role Playing Game Creation Engine), a program that was pretty popular in the late 90s/early 00s pre-RPG Maker years. It is made in the style of late-80s Famicom games like Sweet Home and MOTHER, so if you\u2019ve ever wanted to be chased around by a very cute, chunky 8-bit Oni, then this is your chance. The game is veeeeerrrry short (for players on their second playthrough, it can be cleared in less than 15 minutes) and has two endings.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
