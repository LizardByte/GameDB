Each screen presents a different puzzle ranging in difficulty from the exceptionally easy to the mind-bogglingly difficult.\n\nYour task is to reconstruct a series of pictures by collecting scattered tiles and placing them in the right sequence. It's an apparently simple assignment on the surface, but don't be fooled. You will also have to cope with tile-pinching chess pieces, dissolving tiles and causeways, transporter tiles, and horrendously tight time limit.\n\nNevermind is a unique combination of arcade action and mind numbing problem solving, and uses a clever blend of computer-generated and hand-crafted puzzles. Is your brain up to the most intriguing challenge of the decade? There is only one way to find out.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nevermind--1"}
