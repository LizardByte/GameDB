It was released as an arcade game by Konami in Japan on January 29, 1999. It has a total of 32 songs: ten from the original Dance Dance Revolution arcade game and 26 all-new songs. An updated version, Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix Link Version, was released to Japanese arcades on April 28, 1999. This version came with a PlayStation memory card reader, installed in the middle of the arcade cabinet. It supports cards that have Link Data from the home version of Dance Dance Revolution, allowing each player to save high scores and play custom step edits. 2ndMix Link Version adds five new songs to the game, two from the home version and three new licenses, for a total of 37 songs. Future Dance Dance Revolution releases in Japan, up to and including Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, integrated Link Data functionality in-game. However, these required different home games to produce different Link Data formats: 3rdMix, 4thMix, 4thMix Plus, 5thMix and New Version.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dance-dance-revolution-2ndmix-link-version", "collections": [{"id": 602, "name": "Dance Dance Revolution"}]}
