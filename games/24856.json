Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s novella \"At the Mountains of Madness\", but largely set after the original story.\n\nYou, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you\u2019re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near south pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister...\n\nExplore the antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues, unlock secrets but avoid macabre beings at all cost.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/conarium", "videos": [{"id": 10257, "name": "Teaser Trailer", "video_id": "slZIrUUeeb4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slZIrUUeeb4", "title": "Conarium - Teaser Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/slZIrUUeeb4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14181, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "1WTuUvMCQm8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WTuUvMCQm8", "title": "Conarium - Launch Trailer (4K Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1WTuUvMCQm8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 24437, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5Z1_NaERhg8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z1_NaERhg8", "title": "Conarium - Console Launch Trailer (PS4 & XBOX ONE)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Z1_NaERhg8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
