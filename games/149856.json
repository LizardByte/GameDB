A lone island, sitting in the middle of an endless ocean, and the site of a magical phenomenon known only as the Rift. It was once a source of limitless power for humanity, through magical creatures called the Ateyan. Capable of incredible and wonderful feats of magic, they lived alongside humanity for centuries - until something destroyed this harmony. The Ateyan disappeared, becoming motes of light on an almost deserted island. Human civilizations crumbled, its formerly great cities and industry reclaimed by nature. Generations passed in the shadow of ancient splendor. Then, something happened: The Rift began consuming the island, threatening the survival of humanity's remnants.", "summary": "Explore an island filled with collectible creatures, a vast and varied wilderness, and dangerous towers on your way to restoring harmony with the land of Akama.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 69570, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Aq59s2LeJoc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq59s2LeJoc", "title": "Monster Tribe - Official Release Date Trailer | Summer of Gaming 2022", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aq59s2LeJoc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
