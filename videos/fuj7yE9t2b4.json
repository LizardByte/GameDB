This is Theme-Gawad, a limit-removing megawad CP full of fun themes!  Played in DSDA blind on Ultra-Violence difficulty, continuous play (recommended in text file), complevel 2.  I was drawn to playing this because it's another CP that laid down lots of requirements for levels, something which I enjoyed in Solar Struggle as it led to a more cohesive feel.  I played through the first episode of 5 maps here and got to experience some cool locations like fetid sewers (which I pronounce wrong lol), mines and especially a very cool canyon map full of interesting rock formations.  Starts off very accessible in difficulty as well, but expect it to ramp up during each of the 6 episodes!\n\nDownload Theme-Gawad https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/133436-theme-gawad-a-doom-ii-megawad/\n\nJoin Sandwedge's Sandy Wedge discord! - https://discord.gg/asS7XHRw4r\n\nSupport my channel here: https://streamelements.com/sandwedge/tip\n\nChapters\n00:00 Map 1: Zero Hour by A.H.
