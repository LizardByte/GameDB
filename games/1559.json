They were released in Japan on January 29, 2004, in North America on September 9, 2004, in Australia on September 23, 2004 and in Europe on October 1, 2004.\nAs the first remakes in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, the games revisit the original pair of Pok\u00e9mon games, Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green Versions, and so feature all of the characters, plot elements, and challenges of them, but with several important upgrades to bring them up to speed with other Generation III games.\nThe Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter was initially included with the games when they were first released, eliminating the need for Game Link Cables when trading between the two games (and later Pok\u00e9mon Emerald Version). In later copies, it was sold separately.\nFireRed and LeafGreen went on to become the second best-selling games of the Game Boy Advance, only behind Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire Versions. They also received Nintendo's Player's Choice awards.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 10002, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "XBmgAp_PlgI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBmgAp_PlgI", "title": "Pokemon Fire Red Version Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBmgAp_PlgI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
