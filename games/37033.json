The Dragons in Heroes of Skyrim appear across all attributes, and many will reward players for playing them with other Dragons.\n\nShouts, Companions, & More\n\nOne of the biggest new gameplay changes in Heroes of Skyrim is the introduction of a couple of new keywords, namely the Shouts. Much like in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Shouts have three different levels that increase in power. Where in Skyrim you would be able to \u201clevel up\u201d a Shout by finding words of power, your Shouts in Legends power up the more you use them. The first time you play a Shout, you get its first level. The second time, you get the second level, and the third time\u2026 well, you get the picture. There are even cards that progress your Shout cards more quickly, which we\u2019ll talk more about soon.\n\nThe Companions are represented by a spin on the Change ability introduced in The Fall of the Dark Brotherhood. Companions will change into their Beast Form when you break a rune. Beast Forms are often more powerful, and bringing the beast out can even trigger abilities.", "summary": "This brand-new set of over 150 cards will include new mechanics like Shouts, familiar characters, and, of course, dragons... lots of dragons.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-legends-heroes-of-skyrim", "videos": [{"id": 14308, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8_37vi96t1Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_37vi96t1Y", "title": "The Elder Scrolls: Legends \u2013 Heroes of Skyrim Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8_37vi96t1Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 120926, "name": "E3 2017 Trailer", "video_id": "ETaPXybU-PM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETaPXybU-PM", "title": "THE ELDER SCROLLS LEGENDS Trailer (E3 2017)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ETaPXybU-PM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
