I am a very, very friendly squirrel; I swear, I never intend to hurt that poor snail. As it becomes colder and colder, I want nothing more than to store some nuts in my caves, lest I should be no more after the winter. But why in the world is that greedy snail always hiding somewhere to rob me of my nuts, just like those highway men? See what a dilemma I am involved in? To keep away from that cunning snail, should I go on carry the nut to my cave or gather a newly ripe one?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 27608, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "koFOc80NkV8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koFOc80NkV8", "title": "Snail Against Squirrel (Atari 2600) - Player 1 Going For 1 Run 1984", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/koFOc80NkV8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
