In an effort to keep the Relic and oppress others, the Nezai and Zarai clans join together and call themselves the Chosen. Unfortunately, the Relic is stolen and the Chosen want it back to continue their dominance over the other clans. The other clans want to use the Relic to break free from the oppression brought about by the Chosen. Pick from eight different fighters, each with different skills, and try to claim the Relic. All of the fighters start out with simple combinations and skills, but as a fighter progress through matches, he or she will gain more powerful skills and weapons. If your friends think your skills will not win the Relic, challenge them to a match with the Two-Player mode. Can you claim the Relic for your tribe?
