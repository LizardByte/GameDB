Joe, before becoming a more generic action/extreme sports hero on a 3D animated television show. The goal of this kid's action-adventure game is to raid your arch nemesis Dr. X\u2019s island, rescue your sidekick who has been kidnapped and prevent Dr. X from destroying the world by polluting the environment and doing terrible experiments on plants and animals. \n \nYou start in your base and create your own hero choosing different faces, shirts, pants, etc. Training missions will improve your skills on a firing range, bungee jumping, scuba diving, taking photographs, and street luge. Then other areas will open up and Action Man will journey through varied locales such as urban cities, tropical forests, and the frozen arctic. You'll swim, jump, and climb your way through levels battling criminals and avoiding dangers of all sorts. \n \nFrom your secret headquarters, you can use the monitor to see a map and choose which adventure you want to play. You can access various equipment, weapons and tools. Other features include a print function giving hard copies of colourful maps, missions, stickers and secret documents.", "summary": "Raid has been kidnapped by Dr. X.
