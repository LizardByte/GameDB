Here, it is the regular, classic \"Amazing\" Spider-Man, and Spider-Man 2099 \u2013 in a story awash in time travel, temporal battles, and Anti-Venom.\n\nThe backbone of this story seems to play out more like a Spider-Man 2099 story, since he is the only character truly aware of the happenings in the game, and the changes that both Spider-Men encounter. From the opening, things are bleak for Amazing Spider-Man who begins the game nearly dead, and 2099 is the only one who can help. A new villain Walker Sloan enters the picture with a plan to rebuild the past (from the year 2099) in his image and design, which turns to affect both Spider-Men. From this point, chaos unfolds in typical comic-book fashion with gameplay evenly split between Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2099, with every other level interwoven with the events of one Spidey to the other.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spider-man-edge-of-time", "videos": [{"id": 74936, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gKrzXRC0TnE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKrzXRC0TnE", "title": "Spider-Man Edge of Time |\u00a0E3 trailer (2011)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gKrzXRC0TnE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 74937, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ogN9hrhTFVs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogN9hrhTFVs", "title": "Spider-man: Edge of Time - Comic-Con 2011 Trailer (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, DS)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogN9hrhTFVs/sddefault.jpg"}]}
