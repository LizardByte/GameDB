While the games feature several expansions in key areas, the overall plot follows the same direction as the original Gold and Silver. Some aspects exclusive to Crystal are also included. Like how FireRed and LeafGreen could link up with Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald to complete the Pok\u00e9dex by trading regionally exclusive Pok\u00e9mon, HeartGold and SoulSilver can link up with Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum to obtain Pok\u00e9mon unavailable in Johto and Kanto (such as the Sinnoh starters) and vice versa.\nKris, despite being the female counterpart of Crystal's player character, is not included as the female player character, with a new character instead taking her place. Whether she is chosen to be the player character or not, this new character will still appear in the game. The unselected protagonist will take a pseudo-rival role similar to the unselected characters of Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.\nThe games were released on September 12, 2009 in Japan, February 4, 2010 in Korea, March 14, 2010 in North America, March 25, 2010 in Australia and March 26, 2010 in Europe (this excludes the Netherlands, Luxembourg and parts of Belgium due to an in-game save error, with the patched copies later released on April 2, 2010).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-heartgold-version", "videos": [{"id": 9930, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "bejL0Nmjp_k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bejL0Nmjp_k", "title": "Pokemon Heart Gold Introduction", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bejL0Nmjp_k/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9909, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HSkT_Kfa5Gk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSkT_Kfa5Gk", "title": "Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold & SoulSilver Nintendo Channel Trailer 26/08/09", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HSkT_Kfa5Gk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9908, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lR9HlHS7YMM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR9HlHS7YMM", "title": "Pokemon HeartGold & SoulSilver Versions-NDS Trailer 2 (JPN)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lR9HlHS7YMM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
