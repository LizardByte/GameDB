I really wanted to like this mmo, the pixel art style is gorgeous and the towns, buildings, flora & fauna all look great also but I just really couldn't get into the way the game is controlled.\n\nThe music is really nice and suits the game very well, and the title screen music is awesome if you leave it play. I'm certainly going to have to hunt down the OST for this game and listen to every track cos at least this is ONE thing Nexon got right. I think I ran into a couple of people whilst playing so the game ain't dead but there's very few people playing it at the moment.\n\nKru once again has put a lot of the game behind a paywall, (like Nexus), but you can play quite a bit of the game without paying, just certain things you won,t be able to do, which i'm unsure of what exactly because I didn't get that far into this game.\n\nComparing this game to something more modern.. this game has a very early feeling of the mmo... \"Tree of Saviour\" which I haven't done a video of yet, but will eventually, so if you're a fan of that mmo then it's possible you would like this one.\n\nSo! if you guys are interested in trying this one out then follow the link and sign up to play. http://www.darkages.com/\n\n\nDon't forget to Like, Subscribe, and Comment guys!! let me know what you think of this mmo, if you've tried it, and how you feel about the game.\n\nThanks!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5YV7zApBS94/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5YV7zApBS94/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5YV7zApBS94/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5YV7zApBS94/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Dark Ages (Gameplay, mmo, 1999)", "description": "Dark Ages is an old-school mmo from 1999 by Nexon, and now currently being run by Kru Interactive. \n\nI'm NOT going to either bother sugar coating this game for you, like the other Kru game I have covered, (Nexus TK), this game has a very similar point and click to move game style, but this game does it all wrong.
