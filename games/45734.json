The graphics have been improved since the original Battle Mania (for example, the frames of each animation has been increased) and the game uses more anime styled art direction than its predecessor.\nBattle Mania Daiginjou builds on the first release by introducing several improved features including tweaked weapon system where players now have more options to choose from for how they want to play the game. The game's pace has been significantly altered within the difficulty and the length of the stages. Uncommon to most shooter games, Daiginjou uses both vertical and horizontal scrolling for its stages. It has nine levels altogether, three more than its predecessor.\nUnlike the first Battle Mania, it was not released in English, as it would have required too much editing which would lead to severely compromising the game experience given its deeper Japanese-centric flavor and emphasis on the game's heroines. Battle Mania Daiginjou is widely coveted by video game collectors and is one of the most expensive Sega Mega Drive games today. Vic Tokai had a limited print run of this title and it is very difficult to find in complete condition with box and instructions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
