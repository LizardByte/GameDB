The player looks through a large periscope to aim at ships moving across the virtual sea line at the top of the screen, using a thumb button on the right handle of the scope to fire torpedoes. The periscope swivels to the right and left, providing horizontal motion of a targeting cross-hair. The cabinet features a mixture of video game and older electro-mechanical technology for player feedback. Using back-lit transparencies reflected inside the scope, the number of torpedoes remaining are displayed, as well as a red \"RELOAD\" light which lights up momentarily when the player has launched five torpedoes. Additionally, when ships are hit on the screen, an explosion \"light\" is reflected inside the scope. A blue overlay is affixed to the screen to provide a \"water color\" to the sea. Sounds include a sonar ping and the sound of the PT Boat racing across the screen. Sea Wolf is time-limited, with the player having an opportunity to win bonus time by reaching an operator-set score. The player's score is shown on the bottom half of the screen as well as the high score, one of the first known instances of a high score in a video game. Targets include destroyers, a fast moving PT Boat, and mines floating across the screen can that serve as obstructions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sea-wolf", "videos": [{"id": 104564, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "T6kopmm1-Jw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6kopmm1-Jw", "title": "Arcade Game: SeaWolf (1976 Midway) [Re-Uploaeded]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T6kopmm1-Jw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
