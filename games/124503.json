The game features technically superior visuals and soundtrack, as well as more detailed animation (e.g. enemies actually visibly collapse and die rather than blink and disappear).\n\nThe most significant change in this release is the addition of an entirely new opening area, the town Barbado and its surroundings. Overworld areas have been expanded as well. There are also many more characters and a few additional side quests in this version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ys-eternal"}
