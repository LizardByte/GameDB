See the classic action platformer the way it was meant to be seen, heard, and played... on a PC!\n\nKurt Hectic in his snazzy suit with ribbon chute is back to save the universe. This time he is teamed with the genius Dr. Hawkins and the 6-legged gun-toting robotic dog, Max. Together they must out-sneak, out-blast and out-think their enemies as they attempt to reclaim the Earth from a vile alien menace.\n\nAnd this time they're in HD.\n\nAll three characters - Kurt, Doctor Hawkins and Max are playable, each has his own levels, powers and items and a completely different gameplay focus. Kurt is about stealth and sniping, the Doctor has a few direct attacks but also has the ability to create items and effects out of simple household objects, while Max is a cigar smoking, quad gun toting demolition squad of a dog. Key Features 10 Levels\nOver 20 Enemies\nThree different player characters, Max, Dr Hawkins and Kurt\nUnique levels and items for each character\nBrand new HD graphics\nEnhanced audio from the original sources\nTweaked gameplay - now Easy really is Easy, while Hard is BONE CRUSHING!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mdk-2-hd"}
