It\u2019s a real-time live action game which means that it has to be played at 10pm in your local time zone. Written and Directed by Jed Shepherd (writer and exec producer of HOST - \u201cThe Scariest Movie of the last Decade\u201d - Dread Central & \u201cThe Genre Phenomenon of 2020\u201d - Forbes) in partnership with Visible Games & Limited Run Games. The game takes inspiration from the works of Manx screenwriter Nigel Kneale and the blurring of fact and fiction in the found footage movies from the last 25 years. However, unlike previous games in this oft-forgotten genre we\u2019re creating a horror experience that aims to truly chill your blood and send full motion video games screaming into the modern day.\n\n#limitedrungames #FMV #GHOSTS #playstation #pc \n\nSUBSCRIBE \u25ba http://bit.ly/LRGYT \n\nJOIN THE LIMITED RUN COMMUNITY\nTwitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/limitedrungames\nInstagram \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/limitedrungames\nFacebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/limitedrungames\nBlueSky \u25ba https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.bsky.social", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqCu1LLte1I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqCu1LLte1I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqCu1LLte1I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqCu1LLte1I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqCu1LLte1I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "GHOSTS | FMV Game Trailer", "description": "GHOSTS is a full motion video, horror game stepping into the shoes of Night Trap, Phantasmagoria and The 7th Guest.
