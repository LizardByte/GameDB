While ghosts and obstacles may be moving in some of the fifty stages, Spotto remains stationary in the lower left corner all the time. In the Story Mode, the player gets five bombs at the beginning of each stage and loses one for every toss that doesn't kill an enemy. After a kill, a super bomb which causes more damage, is sometimes awarded. Besides the ghosts, some boss characters will have to be beaten.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spotto"}
