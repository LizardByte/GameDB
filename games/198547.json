The game remains mostly unchanged; however, the Flicky collection system (part of the core gameplay of the original game) has been removed, allowing the player to complete the levels without needing to collect all the flickies in the level to advance. This makes it much more similar to traditional Sonic games, where the goal is to simply make it to the end of the level without dying.\n\nThis hack was later built upon further in the hack, Super Sonic in Sonic 3D, which was also created by Sik.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-3d-no-flickies"}
