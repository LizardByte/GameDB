However, the Baron never intended for anyone to escape except himself and after re-building The Chaos Machine, the Baron reveals that he has lied to you and calls you fools for setting him free leaving both players stuck forever in the machine.\nSadly nowhere near in the same league as it's prequel, the gameplay has been completely altered from a 2-player tag team shooter to a one-on-one death match shooter with puzzles to solve and switches to press to gain access to the next levels, it can get so complicated at times because by the time you are half way through a level, you have forgotten the instructions given to you from the Baron, so if that happens then it's best to just kill your opponent after he's collected most of the stuff, steel it and then get to the exit like i did on a few occasions ;-)\nThe music is good but not as cool as it's prequel.\nNo game intro, lack of speech compared to the prequel, split screen...yuk, and a questionable end-sequence with no end credits,...it feels to me that this game wasn't quite finished, it just has that feeling to it that time or effort had run out, this A1200 version does contain some speech when you pick up objects unlike the A500 version but it still is a disappointing sequel on that format also.\nChaos Engine 3,...if only.\nI have used the infinite energy & supplies cheat so i could upload the entire game for your viewing pleasure.\n\nI hope all you Amiga fans enjoy this upload.\n\nPlease note: NONE of my game uploads are emulated in any way whatsoever, they are 100% original recordings by myself taken directly from the original hardware the game was intended for, that way you know you're watching the real thing.\nI will also always state weather i am using any cheats in the game, if not mentioned then i am not using any.\nCheck out my channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/ZEUSDAZ/videos), dedicated to gamers who loved the games of yesteryear.\n\nSwitch to 480p for best video quality and feel free to leave comments on my channel and vid's.\n\nKeeping the memory of the Amiga and it's cool games alive!!!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-919P0MGyZc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-919P0MGyZc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-919P0MGyZc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-919P0MGyZc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "THE CHAOS ENGINE 2 (AGA - FULL GAME)", "description": "Zeus presents The Chaos Engine 2 (un-emulated) for the Amiga A1200, a true classic from the golden era of amiga gaming which must not be forgotten alongside the software house and all programmers that were involved in making this game.\n\nYear of release: 1996\n\nWell here we have the forgotten sequel to The Chaos Engine, only released on the Amiga A500 & A1200 back in 1996.\nTurns out after rescuing the Baron from the first game, player 1,2 and the Baron himself are trapped in the machine, he therefor has to re-bulid the Chaos Engine but needs all the vital parts from all four worlds and the twist is he can only allow one of you to escape while the other stays trapped forever, hence now why player 1 & 2 spend most of the game killing each other,...it's survival time!
