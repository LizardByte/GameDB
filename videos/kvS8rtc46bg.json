It is played on a soccer field.  This is a video game that replicates that excitement.  It's like the ice hockey of the lawn.  Soccer.  Enjoy a tall cool glass of soccer.  David Beckham is not in this game.  Neither is Pele.  Neither is Joe Montanna.  But if they were, it would still be called Championship Soccer.   Why?  Because it isn't Championship Tennis.  Enjoy it because CGRHD doesn't review many sports titles because we're sports inept.  If watching science fiction and Star Wars was a sport we'd be the Serena Williams of the Star Trek fan club.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. CGRHD is reviewing video game from the past 30 years, from 1978 to the present including Playstation 3 PS3, Sega Genesis, Nintendo Entertainment System NES, Atari 2600, 7800, N64, Dreamcast and Xbox 360.
