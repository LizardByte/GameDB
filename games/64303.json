It features a campaign with 27 unrelated missions set in the Gulf region. Typical examples are the bombing of ground targets or escort missions. On most missions the player gets help by other aircraft including the famous A-10 Warthog.\n\nThe game strongly focuses on the realistic simulation of the F/A-18 Hornet so the player has to work with a complex set of key combinations to control it. Twelve tutorial missions are designed to introduce the player step by step to the aircraft. The game also features an editor to create custom missions.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/f-slash-a-18-operation-iraqi-freedom"}
