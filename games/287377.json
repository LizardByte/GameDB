As you follow the trail of the treasure, you discover that a secret organization, the \"Society of the Ancients,\" is also searching for the temple. So, in addition to solving the mysteries of the diary, you must also escape from the Society. The three-chapter chase takes place across two continents and over a dozen locations. Starting from the legionnaires' fortress, we travel to a ruined jungle fortress, a German castle full of secret passages, and the forgotten basement of an old museum.\nThe gameplay is partly reminiscent of the old \"choose your own adventure\" books, where you could choose from multiple possible paths, while the majority of the game time is similar to old point-and-click adventure games where you can freely move between locations, interact with the environment, pick up and use objects, and talk to the characters in the story. We do all this by communicating with the game entirely by voice throughout.", "summary": "Let me tell you a story! Meanwhile, you can sit at the fireplace, close your eyes, and listen to the tale about ancient hidden treasures and secret societies. This time, you won't just listen. You will be the hero of the story. It will be your adventure. Your voice guides the way. Can you solve the mystery just with your voice?\n\nMy game is highly optimized for blind and visually impaired people (thanks to the extensive testing by the Applevis forum members).
