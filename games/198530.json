Vector the Crocodile is a character first playable in Knuckles Chaotix and later playable in Sonic Heroes. His abilities are based on those found in Knuckles Chaotix. Moves include a spindash, air dash, and wall climb. The move list can be found in the readme. As in Chaotix Vector has reduced jump height and acceleration, making Vectors air dash move all the more valuable.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
