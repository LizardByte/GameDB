Taking on the role of an explorer grave robbing Tutankhamun's tomb, the player is chased by creatures such as asps, vultures, parrots, bats, dragons, and even curses, all that kill the player on contact. The explorer can fight back by firing lasers at the creatures, but he can only cover the left and right directions. The player is also endowed with a single screen-clearing \"flash bomb\" per level or life. Finally, each level has warp zones that teleport the player around the level, which enemies cannot use.\n\nTo progress, the player collects keys open locked doors throughout the levels, searching for the large exit door. Optional treasures can be picked-up for bonus points. Each level has a timer; when it reaches zero the explorer can no longer fire lasers, and once a level is cleared the remaining time is converted to bonus points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 23960, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "hcGZ4K6fCvo"}, {"id": 23961, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4IZskeao6fU"}]}
