Each squad possesses unique skills that can be improved as you progress in the game.\n\nElements such as bonfires, cauldrons, and other objects on the battlefield have an impact on the abilities of your warriors. Placing your units near these objects can provide a significant tactical advantage.\n\nThe Mist is a source from which hordes of creatures emerge. These formidable beings represent a relentless force that poses a significant threat to all who cross their path. Their agility and speed allow them to swiftly traverse the terrain, making them a daunting challenge to overcome.
