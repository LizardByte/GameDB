This project was my first attempt at creating a mobile game in Unity with Ads and In-App Purchases.\n\nAlthough the final outcome didn't meet my expectations, I believe it's a solid starting point! I'm particularly proud of the AI Bots I developed\u2014they can plan, strategize, and operate independently. They feel pretty \"alive\"! (However, there are a few bugs where they occasionally freeze in place.)\n\nI don't plan to continue developing this game or publish it on Google Play or the App Store. Maybe I'll release one final update to add some finishing touches, but I hope you enjoy playing this game! :)\n\nDOWNLOAD AND PLAY THE GAME HERE:\nhttps://williamjacobproductions.com/wordbrawl\n\nStay tuned for future projects!\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nCheck out my Games:\nhttps://williamjacobproductions.com/\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/WilliamJacobP\n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/williamjacobp/\n\nFollow me on TikTok:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@williamjacobp", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g617hf4TZWg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g617hf4TZWg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g617hf4TZWg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g617hf4TZWg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g617hf4TZWg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Word Brawl | Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Hey everyone!
