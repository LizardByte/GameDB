Strange lights and shapes will try to distract you from your path to freedom. The story unfolds in the form of medical records which, with the passage of time, will help you to remember how you got here in the first place.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/countless-rooms-of-death"}
