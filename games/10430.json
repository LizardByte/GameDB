The slots for the marbles are organized into pyramids; there is one main pyramid in the center and one or more supplemental pyramids around it. The game starts with the main pyramid fully filled with randomly shuffled marbles. Your goal is to move the marbles back and forth between the pyramids so that all marbles in the main pyramid are sorted by color (all marbles of the same color are on the same row).\n\nYou can only move the marbles laying on top of other marbles (and don't have any marbles on top of them) and you can only move them to another slot in the same or any other pyramid where they will be on top of other marbles as well.\n\nYou can set up your own board by selecting the size of the main pyramid and the number and sizes of supplemental pyramids. You can also play a scenario (easy, medium, or hard) where you need to go through a sequence of levels with time or count limits.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/protologic", "videos": [{"id": 4190, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BrISnf8BrVQ"}]}
