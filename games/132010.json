It changes all aspects of the game, from graphics, audio, and special effects to various gameplay and AI features. The modification evolves from the ideas started in Call of Misery, a previous project from the mod\u2019s author. Major inspirations for Dead Air have been projects such as NLC, MISERY, Autumn Aurora, and OGSE. Dead Air prioritizes the development of the game platform\u2019s potential, gameplay complexity, and attention to detail, along with addressing both the quality and quantity of all content."}
