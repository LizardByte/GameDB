Arena shooter where you have freedom of movement, your ship has some physics for flying around, and shoots whichever direction it's facing.  You go LIGHT SPEED to a star system, attempt to shoot everything in site\u2026 and that will advance you to the next star system.  Very cool.  Good rate of difficulty ramp up, I think system 5 was rather hard, but easily got through systems 1-3.  One of the best on Bally Arcade.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gHL2TOribis/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gHL2TOribis/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gHL2TOribis/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gHL2TOribis/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gHL2TOribis/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Solar Conqueror - (1983) - Bally Astrocade - gameplay", "description": "Bally Midway \u00a9 1983\n[Console] Bally Astrocade\nEmulator: MAME 0.226\n\nThis is a good one!
