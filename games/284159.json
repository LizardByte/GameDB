You're faced with the task of filling your \"full\" bar up faster than your opponent by out-eating him/her/it using chopsticks and one big Nabe pot filled with food.\n\nYou control the chopsticks over a never ending Nabe pot in which food is constantly cooked. Pressing X makes you poke at the food to see if it's cooked properly, and O makes you eat it. If you get three of the same kind of food you get bonus points. Same goes if you eat the combination of food suggested by the chef of the current game. However, if you eat raw or undercooked food you get stunned for a short while and lose a little bit of your \"full\" bar, and you have to hit the buttons fast to recover.\n\nThe rounds are timed, and whoever gets the biggest meter at the end of the round wins the game.\n\nThere are bonuses such as ones that empty your current food combo, stuns the opponent and score multipliers. The occasionally pop up from under food you've eaten from the Nabe.\n\nYou can play the game by yourself or face off against a friend/foe in a vs. game.", "summary": "A cooking game from Media Entertainment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gourmet-action-game-manpuku-nabe-kazoku", "videos": [{"id": 105837, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LW6b4w5vRUQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW6b4w5vRUQ", "title": "PlayStation - Gourmet Action Game - Manpuku!!
