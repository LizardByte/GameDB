{"id": "seOg79vGDkY", "snippet": {"title": "Metrico+ - Worlds Trailer | PS4", "description": "This trailer offers a peek into the reimagined world of Metrico. Metrico is a living world filled with infographics. You have to navigate through Metrico, while all the bar charts, line diagrams and pie charts directly react to your movement, actions and input. One bar diagram might grow for every step you walk to the left, while another could decline with every jump you make. You will have to explore Metrico and carefully analyze your every move to see how it affects the world, and whether it will get you further. This mechanic is called \"Input Morphing\" and it makes you think about actions you normally don't think about. Metrico is a combination between exploration, skill, experimentation, and most of all: thinking outside of the box. Metrico+ is completely reimagined version, finally coming to PlayStation 4 on August 23.
