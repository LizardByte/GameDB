I saw what I saw with my very own eyes! I told you a thousand times already, I was NOT tired, I was not feeling sick when I saw IT!\"\n\n\"We respect your condition, Major Railey, but please try to understand how difficult it is for us to comprehend the story you are bringing before us today...\"\n\n\"The story? it's not a story, it's the truth, I saw Hell with my own ****** eyes!\"\n\n\"Major please calm down, there is no need...\"\n\n\"Don't tell me to calm down you ****. While you were here on Earth filling out forms, I was in outer space, volunteering to examine the Phenomena. And I am telling you that something terrible is on its way here\"\n\n\"All right Major, let's say that the Devil himself really came out of that place...\"\n\n\"Let's say!? Let me say something to you - you better get of your stupid **** and prepare my elite cadets of the 1st Aerospace Academy to defend Earth, or soon there won't be any Earth to defend.\"\n\n\"Major, please, do not insult the General...\"\n\n\"**** you, **** the General, I am going to the Academy to prepare a surprise attack on the enemy.\"\n\nMajor Railey was soon after locked away. But, fortunately for the Earth, before that, he managed to discover a way on how to project a residual image of our most advanced crafts to the Dimensions. Residual images were navigated from the Earth.\n\nIt was then that this Dimension was named T-Zer0.\n\nThe first craft that was sent out was destroyed in less that 0.2 seconds upon entering the T-Zer0 Dimension. But, it's computer managed to gather and send back enough information so that a proper resistance could be organized.\n\nIt was then that we learned the truth about the five Guardians. Each Guardian is protecting one diamond, and it was only by collecting all five diamonds that we would be able to open the Dimension portal and face the main Guardian.\nthe name of the main Guardian was impossible to pronounce by us, humans, so he was given the name Kakistos. The word Kakistos originates from Greek mythology, and means \"the worst of the worst\". It was used to depict the worst demon of all.\nSo, we only found it appropriate enough to name him this way.\n\nIt is now up to the brave cadets of the 1st Aerospace Academy to defend the Earth. We trained them the best we could, and we gave them the best crafts and weapons we have. There is nothing else we can do.\n\nThe fate of our Dimension is in their skilled hands.", "summary": "T-Zer0 (formerly Trauma Zero) is an arcade, side scrolling, shooter with a sci-fi theme.\n\nThe game is AGA (over 256 colour graphics), scrolls at 50hz with a 2-player coop option, featuring a choice of three ships to control, two main gameplay routes with collectibles, power-ups and enemies to defeat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
