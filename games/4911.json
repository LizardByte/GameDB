Sayuki then travels across the land with her pet snow rabbit, Toto, to find the ingredients for the cure to his curse.\n\nIn multiplayer, the story is about a beauty contest held by the Snow Goddess Tribe. Sayuki and her younger sister, Koyuki, decide to compete for first place. The contest is a trial race for the two sisters to destroy the most ghosts and collect the most snowballs in their path.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heavenly-guardian"}
