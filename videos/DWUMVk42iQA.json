Both involve ninjas, but this time, you play as a professional golfer and ninja all-in-one. It's so utterly bizarre that you really can't help but just stare in wonder at the forces that conceived of this idea. It looks great for a 7800 game, as you'd expect for a game released in 1990, and it plays shockingly well - if you aren't using the 7800 joystick. This is much better played through emulation with a modern controller, and even then, it's difficulty level (even on normal!) is unrelenting. The beat 'em up sections are similar to those in Kung Fu, China Warrior, and Vigilante (if they were all hopped of on stimulants - this game is fast!), and the golf sections are a pretty fun and welcome break in the action, and have a hugely meaningful impact on what the action stages will bring. Each hole's stages change based on your ball-flight trajectory, and really makes you weigh if it's worth going for a longer shot if it forces you into difficult water or forest areas. \n\nIf you think that ninjas and golf sound like a potentially mind-blowingly awesome combination, as long as you have a lot of patience and skill, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how well game will satisfy you.\n\n____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DWUMVk42iQA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DWUMVk42iQA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DWUMVk42iQA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DWUMVk42iQA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Ninja Golf (Atari 7800) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Atari's 1990 beat 'em up golf game for the Atari 7800, Ninja Golf.\n\nPlayed through on the normal mode.\n\nThis is such a cool concept, and really evokes a lot of the same feelings with its uniquity as The Last Ninja did.
