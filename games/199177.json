There are animals, meat processing plants, farming machines, workers with different skill sets, warehouses with cooling, anti-pesticides, and many more. A lot of different strategies can be successfully executed to make the farm profitable. You can surely make a jack-of-all-trades farm to min-max the systems, but perhaps just a fully sustainable and independent apple juice company can drive the prices up and be more profitable? Maybe using only eco-friendly energy sources will pay off in the long run, especially with the government grant? Or you just *love* beef steaks and want to make the best quality filet mignon in the world? Any farm-related business idea seems possible in Farm Tycoon!\n\nIt\u2019s the first game of its kind made with consoles in mind from the ground up. The whole user interface is tailored to sticks and buttons, without the usual hassle of virtual cursors present in the genre. Moreover, the 2XD Rendering technology, developed specifically for optimal Nintendo Switch experience, brings stunning visual effects while ensuring stable performance throughout the game.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farm-tycoon"}
