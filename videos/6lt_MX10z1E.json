I guess you\u2019re wondering what this game is. It\u2019s the return of one of the all time Spectrum classics \u201cSkool Daze\u201d. It was released in the 80\u2019s. Yeah, you heard that right, probably before you were born! Spectrum? What\u2019s that!

And, being Eric, you realise that you must at all costs remove your report before it comes to the attention of the Headmaster.\n\nThe combination to the safe consists of four letters, each master knowing one letter and the Headmaster's letter always coming first. To get hold of the combination, you first have to hit all the shields hanging on the school walls. Trouble is, this isn't as easy as it looks. Some of them can be hit by jumping up. Others are more difficult. You could try and hit a shield by bouncing a pellet off a master's head whilst he is sitting on the ground. Or, being Eric, you may decide to knock over one of the boys and, whilst he's flattened, clamber up on him so that you can jump higher.\n\nBACK TO SKOOL\n\nHaving managed to steal your report during the last few skooldaze of term, you've spent the whole holiday forging teachers' signatures and handwriting to make yourself look like the brightest, sweetest natured, most helpful little soul ever to carry a satchel.\n\nNow all you've got to do is get it back into the Head's safe\u2026\n\nA couple of years ago, your elder brother had exactly the same problem and has lent you his old copy of the School Rules, on which he's scribbled some notes in invisible ink.
