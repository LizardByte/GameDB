With five pre-built purchasable houses already present in Skyrim, it's now possible to own property in every hold, except Winterhold.\n\nIn addition, an adoption mechanic has been introduced that allows the Dragonborn to adopt children and raise them in the newly built home, provided there is room for them. In addition, previously bought homes can be altered to have a children's bedroom fitted into them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-hearthfire", "videos": [{"id": 17557, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Sem7K6MxfBg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sem7K6MxfBg", "title": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Hearthfire - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sem7K6MxfBg/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6, "name": "The Elder Scrolls"}]}
