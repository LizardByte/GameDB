I'm running a final-build 16KB cartridge image on the U1541-II, and the game will be available to buy on limited edition C64 cartridge in the new year (we are just waiting for the specifically manufactured dove-grey shells to arrive).\n\nThe game concept is (of course) by Adam Saltsman.  The SID chip rendition of Danny Baranowsky's 'RUN' is by Mikkel Hastrup (encore).  C64 code is by Paul Koller (Paulko64).\n\nThe game was created for RGCD's 16KB C64 Cartridge Game Development Competition 2011.  The limitation of 16KB file size meant that there was no room for sound effects, but pretty much every other feature of the original was squeezed in.  The open source code was used as a reference when programming this conversion, so the building generation and physics are as close as possible to the original game.\n\nIf you are interested in grabbing a copy of the game for the C64 emulator of your choice, it is freely available from CSDB (http://noname.c64.org/csdb/release/?id=103143) - featuring a different and original score by Andreas Slotte (Ghormak).
