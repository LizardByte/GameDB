And he wants revenge! Sludge Vohaul, the demented evil scientist (whose sinister plan you unknowingly foiled in our last episode), is seething over his Sarien slip-up. Madder than a drenched Astrochicken, (and still determined to rule the galaxy) Vohaul has devised a new plan. A nasty plan. A plan so evil that only one as wickedly sadistic as he could imagine it. Yes, the worst nightmare ever is about to come knocking on your door- and it won't take No for an answer!\n\nIt's The Invasion of the Insurance Salesmen! Hordes and hordes of pushy, obnoxious (genetically engineered) salesmen will soon be dumped upon your home planet- unless somebody dumps on Vohaul first. And who knows more about getting dumped on than you?\n\nRoger Wilco to the rescue! Once again, you, Roger Wilco, sanitation engineer and involuntary hero, must don your sanitary space mittens and prepare for the onslaught of evil that Vohaul has prepared. A chore not for queasy or fainthearted. And if you can stomach that\u2026Get ready for the Granddaddy of Gross. The Emperor of Evil. The first name is Nastiness, Sludge Vohaul himself! With nothing to protect you but your wits and your wet mop, you haven't got a chance! (But that's what makes the game so much fun!)\n\nHave fun staying out of trouble! Beat the odds. Conquer insurmountable obstacles. Defy gravity. Cry for help. Misfortune awaits you at every turn\u2026 Boggle your way through the humid stenchlands of the jungle planet Labion. Blunder your way onto the asteroid fortress of the slime-sucking Vohaul. Flounder your way through more perilous escapades than you can wiggle a space worm at.\n\nGuaranteed to make you laugh! Packed with comedy, tragedy, suspense, horror, and many other nouns, Space Quest II will tickle your funny bone and relieve that heavy feeling in your wallet.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-quest-ii-vohaul-s-revenge", "collections": [{"id": 8, "name": "Space Quest"}]}
