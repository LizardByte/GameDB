The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times!\n\nTrying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/q-star-bert--18", "videos": [{"id": 132050, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "vkZhWsiHCqM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkZhWsiHCqM", "title": "Atari 2600: Qbert (Q*Bert)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vkZhWsiHCqM/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4087, "name": "Q*Bert"}]}
