This game is called \"Kalpa: The Sign of Omen\". Due to its low price of 25 yuan for the full version, it attracted a large number of players.\n\nMost people were initially scared off by its difficulty, making the most common screen seen at the beginning \"defeat.\" Then, there were a lot of game-breaking bugs, causing many players to have to start over. There was even a rumor online that the game company was treating players as free testers. As a result, the magazine \"Software and CD\" had to include a patch in its August issue to appease the players' anger.\n\nIn September 1999, the \"enhanced version\" of \"Kalpa: The Sign of Omen\" was released at a price of 69 yuan. In addition to a big box packaging, the game also came with a full-color manual and a fan comic. The game version was also upgraded to 1.1. This version looked like a deluxe edition, and many players who owned the standard edition were not interested in it. However, this version contained a big secret, which was the perfect ending of the game. The relevant levels were not included in the standard version.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kalpa-the-sign-of-omen", "videos": [{"id": 84609, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6oPArUBXh4I"}]}
