The Wind Warriors along with Zephyr and Nimbus uncover the anti-matter being known as Omegaton, who's six orbs of power were taken away from him by his enemies; flaming little buggers known as the Fire Flyers. In return for helping him regain his orbs of power, Omegaton provides the Wind Warriors with a Light Weight Object Amalgam Device (shorten as L.O.A.D. STARR) to protect them from the sun's deadly radiation.\n\nNear the end of the game, it's revealed that Omegaton was from a backwards dimension; a hero in space is a villain on Earth. The game ends with Zephyr, Nimbus, and the Wind Warriors defeating Omegaton, and returning to their homeworld, Harmonia.", "summary": "Harness the power of a raging tornado and battle the forces of evil in an effort to save to world!\n\nSinister forces have deceived you to believe that your destructive behavior will save an epic hero.
