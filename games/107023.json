Rising from this new dark age are powerful diseases and illnesses, reminiscent of the plagues from times long passed. The probability of becoming infected by a serious illness has sharply increased, while at the same time traditional medical techniques have become less effective.\n\nIn the face of such an onslaught, large-scale pharmaceutical companies have begun to invest large amounts of money and manpower into the study and development of nano-machine technology. From this medicinal arms race the NCR (Nano Core Robot) was born \u2013 a new and highly effective weapon in the war against sickness. But is this truly the savior we have been calling for, or is there something more lurking beneath the surface?\n\nBacterium puts players behind the controls of an NCR nano-machine.
