It is a time of great upheaval coupled with tremendous scientific breakthrough. Humanity, now spread across the stars, have waged war against countless species, and in doing so brought many to the edge of annihilation.\n\nThose who had been banished or enslaved by mankind across the far reaches of the Orion Spur became the first to discover the true nature of the soul. In doing so, the combined work of a collective known as \u201cOMEGA\u201d brought about the science of soul scanning, a process that held repercussions not only for those scanned, but for the planet on which they resided.\n\nWhile some secrets had been stolen by humanity, OMEGA\u2019s revelation of the inner mechanisms upon which sentient life existed, led to the deciphering of life\u2019s greatest secret, the soul map. They revealed that some species had not one, but several souls, merged together in what could only be described as quantum chaos.\n\nLittle did they know that each soul held portions of embedded code that were not part of any species map. In time, fragments of the code came together, eventually to be translated into a cryptic message: \u201cthe core holds the path to the keys of the galaxy..\u201d\n\nAfter this breakthrough, OMEGA\u2019s council moved forward to begin the task of reclaiming what humanity had taken from them. Their worlds, their lives, their souls. The reunification took its form as MONSTER Legion, their sole purpose dedicated to the advancement of soul reclamation.\n\nWill you become a master of harvesting corpses and souls, or will you be consumed yourself? As the Soul Revolution dawns, no corpse or soul is safe. The future is not set, every sentient species in the galaxy has the chance for ultimate control and power to wield the key to immortality itself.
