The ships vary in shape and use modified versions of basic weapon types. Each ship starts with a low-damage gun and can upgrade and change the weapon to spreading fire, slow but powerful lightning attack, and others. The ships are also equipped with a claw-like tail, which is activated with a separate button. The tail can attack enemies in a circular motions and retracts back to the ship. Most stages require alternating between firearms and the tail for successful completion.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nScorpius is hard, brutally hard. The first two levels are purposefully easy so that you can get the hang of the game, but after that the difficulty of the game increases. Levels require that you know when and where to pull out your tail and when you should stick to your main gun. There's very little room for error in Scorpius and if you die, you get sent back to a checkpoint. Dying also removes whatever powerups you collected, but that doesn't mean too much here. Levels themselves start off simple, but turn into winding tunnels and scrolling gets faster during some parts. If you can memorize the levels, they should get a little bit easier, but the game is still brutal hard.\n\nScorpius has some detailed graphics. The sprite work in the game is amazing, on par with the best of the X68000. You get all kinds of sprites with many moving animations and rotation effects. Backgrounds are varied, have several layers of parallax scrolling, and add life to the worlds that you're exploring. Your scorpion tail has a lot of animation to it. The music is loud and ominous, perfect for accompanying hostile worlds and fighting huge armies of enemies around every corner.\n\nCHEATS:\n\nHold q while booting (loading now),  a level select screen will appear , then choose continue.\n\nScorpius is one of those X68000 exclusive titles that really make the system worth owning. Definitely recommended!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9lxDbcNIAxM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9lxDbcNIAxM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9lxDbcNIAxM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[x68000] Scorpius \u30b9\u30b3\u30eb\u30d4\u30a6\u30b9 - Longplay", "description": "Scorpius is a shoot'em up  for the sharp x68000 developed  by  Shinseisha (the publisher of the legendary arcade magazine Gamest) and released in 1991.\n\nThe game is called Scorpius because your ship gets a long scorpion-like tail weapon that you're supposed to master in order to beat the game.\n\nScorpius is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player can choose to control one of the three available spaceships on their way through exotic planets populated by hostile alien races.
