The rules are simple: solve puzzles by making target numbers with factors on the board. For example, make 12 from 4*3 or 2*6.\nFactor Find is more strategic than it initially appears. With the right strategy, it's possible to solve even the most complicated puzzles without doing complicated math! Calculators might be better than people at simple arithmetic, but they could never solve a Factor Find puzzle!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/factor-find"}
