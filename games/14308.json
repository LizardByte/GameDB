Of the Hood's 1,415 crewmen, only 3 survived. \n \nBismarck's guns are powerful enough to hurl automobile-sized shells for miles. With such awesome firepower, can she invincibly prowl the sea lanes? Can Britain stop her? \n \nBismarck- The North Sea Chase is a taut, multi-level game featuring full joystick control; real-time action; and variable speed and difficulty levels. You're in charge of an exciting array of technical controls: Main Screen Map, Air Reconnaissance Screen, Weather Forecasting, Radar Search, Bridge Command and more! \n \nAnd when it's time for action, you direct the anti-aircraft and heavy guns; launch torpedo attacks; and manage damage control! \n \nIf you tire of command from the bridge, you can pilot a Fairey Swordfish torpedo plane off a carrier flight deck. Hunt Bismarck from the air via this exciting, cockpit-perfect flight simulator. \n \nWith options to control either The Royal Navy or the infamous German battleship, Bismarck-The North Sea Chase provides an abundance of intriguing, sharp-edged game play.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bismarck-the-north-sea-chase"}
