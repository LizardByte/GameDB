Out of this chaos, Earth's last hope has arisen with a Biomech cyborg that travels through the five realms (levels) of the game in order to destroy the alien menace and bring humanity back from the brink of annihilation.\n\nThe gameplay is a side-scrolling action game, where the player travels throughout stages using weapons such as lasers, heat-seeking missiles and plasma boomerangs to destroy the various enemies scattered throughout the stages and face the standard huge menacing bosses to advance to the next level. Power-ups can also be picked up that range from weapon upgrades to crystals that can produce a temporary shield to protect the player from enemy fire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/realm"}
