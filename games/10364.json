Innovative in many aspects, mixing rogue-style RPG and Beat 'em Up in a unique way, this game is a clear departure from the usual Fantasy formula.\n\nYou have very little time to find where your girlfriend has been taken, and to defeat whoever did it.\n\nIt seems a tough and big task. But true love doesn't calculate - it's the highest form of emotion, and this is why you just go after her... death or success, what will it be? Maybe YOU can decide on the outcome!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/girlfriend-rescue", "videos": [{"id": 8678, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zoVVLnk5St8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoVVLnk5St8", "title": "Girlfriend Rescue (Aldorlea Games) - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zoVVLnk5St8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
