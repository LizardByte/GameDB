They sent in a paramilitary task force called HUNT (High risk United Nations Task force) to investigate. It consists of five people (the same of the original game: Taradino, Lorelei, Ian, Thi and Doug) and they arrive in with a small boat. When they are spotted, the boat is blown up and they need to find a way to get off the island.", "summary": "Rise of the Triad is a reboot of the 90's first-person shooter Rise of the Triad: Dark War. It stays very close to the concept of the original game, but with modern graphics, completely different levels and entirely designed in the spirit of the first title. Defining features include very fast gameplay with a focus on explosions and twitch action rather than a tactical approach, huge traps such as spinning blades and spikes, launch pads to bounce and fly through the air, an extreme amount of blood and gore, and many ludicrous and very powerful weapons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-the-triad", "videos": [{"id": 15286, "name": "Reveal Trailer", "video_id": "FV-RD6_GXZ8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-RD6_GXZ8", "title": "Rise of the Triad (2012) - Official Reveal Trailer (HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FV-RD6_GXZ8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 15287, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "8qCNxM0c2zk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qCNxM0c2zk", "title": "Rise of the Triad - AVAILABLE NOW!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8qCNxM0c2zk/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 34655, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1YqpIkdotVs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YqpIkdotVs", "title": "9 Mins Gameplay : Rise Of The Triad (No Commentary)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1YqpIkdotVs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
