Choose story mode when playing for the first time. As the story goes on, the dance begins with a certain trigger. There are choices in the middle of the story, and the dance songs and the characters you meet will change depending on how you proceed. At first, the purpose is to select various routes and collect characters and dances. When you finish the story, the result will be reflected and you can make your own picture book, you can read it in \"picture book mode\", and you can also enjoy dancing with the songs and characters collected on the way. Unlike traditional music games, there are no commands, so it's simple, easy to remember, and easy to get used to.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jagainu-kun"}
