Black Mirror 3 is developed by Cranberry Production, who took up the series mantle with the second game and is the third and final part of the dark, Black Mirror story.  Coming from the high-end of the 2.5D point and click adventure spectrum, the Black Mirror series has secured a loyal following, with its beautiful visuals and absorbing  story of dark deeds, murder, and the fate of the mysterious Gordon Family.\r\n\r\nI have a fond place on my shelf for the second title; not only was it the first game that I reviewed for GamingLives, but it was the title that shoved me back into the genre playpen and slammed shut the gate.  With the second game done and the story left grasping the edge of a precipice with its clawed hands, news of the third part couldn't come soon enough -- hopefully not subject to the same gap between the first two titles.  However, we were recently able to get our itching hands on a sizeable preview version before the 22nd April release, and it was with anticipation that I stepped back into the town of Willow Creek for the trilogy's closing act.  I shouldn't have to point out to our sexy and intelligent readers that in talking about the third part of a trilogy, some faint spoilers, especially in regard to previous parts, are to be expected, but to play safe, consider this a warning nod.\r\n\r\nBlack Mirror 2 was set 12 years after the brutal events of the first game and introduced a new protagonist in the shape of Darren Michaels, or Adrian as we should now call him, who has a master's degree in sarcasm and a penchant for grungy jackets.  Events conspired to lure him from  Biddeford in Maine to Willow Creek, England, home of the infamous murders from the first game.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JBfCOLiiFKI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JBfCOLiiFKI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JBfCOLiiFKI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JBfCOLiiFKI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JBfCOLiiFKI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Black Mirror 3 Trailer", "description": "Black Mirror 3 Feature Trailer brought to you by http://www.gaminglives.com\r\n\r\nFollow us: http://www.twitter.com/gaminglives\r\n\r\nLike us: http://www.facebook.com/gaminglives\r\n\r\nRead our full preview of Black Mirror 3 here http://www.gaminglives.com/2011/03/27/black-mirror-3-preview/ and just below is a taster.\r\n\r\nYou wait seven years for a Black Mirror game and then two come along at once, or, in this case, roughly one year apart.
