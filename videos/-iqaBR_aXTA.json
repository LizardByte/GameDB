{"id": "-iqaBR_aXTA", "snippet": {"title": "Hansel & Gretel and the Enchanted Castle (Longplay / Hard / English): Part 1of4: Menus", "description": "Hansel & Gretel and the Enchanted Castle is an adventure game developed by TerraGlyph. It combines classical point-and-click elements with hidden objects gameplay and, obviously, based on a classical fairy tale. The game was published in 1995 on a single CD.\n\n-----------------\n\nTechnical note: The game doesn't want to work for me with Microsoft Windows XP (it keeps asking for CD), so, I've recorded it with Microsoft Virtual PC + Microsoft Windows 98 installed. That's why the game works a little slow - my good old PC needs to emulate Windows 98 AND record the video. Sorry for that, can't do anything about it.\n\n-----------------\n\nBefore I show you the game itself, let's take a quick look at the menus. They're very nice and each menu has a voice commentary. Also, you may like to learn about controls. So, let's take a look.\n\nImportant note: To enter the main menu during the game, move your cursor to the lower left part of the screen and when it'll look like an orb, press the LEFT mouse button. The \"Pause\" button is always active in the main menu. The \"Restart\" button will let you start a new game, which means that ALL random things will change. \"To Castle\" button lets you to skip ALL introduction and move directly to the castle. There's no penalty for that and if you feel that you can't find the stuff you need in the castle, you may use the \"Restart\" button and then \"To Castle\". All random stuff will change and you'll be able to explore the castle right away.\n\nP.S. As you can see, my version is Multi-5, with English, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish languages included. There are no subtitles in this game and when you choose the language, it means that all voices will be in the language you chose. Except songs that'll be in English no matter what. Also, note that voices for story and voices for hints have their own selector. So, for example, you may have Japanese voices for story and English voices for hints.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iqaBR_aXTA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iqaBR_aXTA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iqaBR_aXTA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iqaBR_aXTA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Hansel & Gretel and the Enchanted Castle (Longplay / Hard / English): Part 1of4: Menus", "description": "Hansel & Gretel and the Enchanted Castle is an adventure game developed by TerraGlyph.
