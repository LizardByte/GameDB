This world offers you the opportunity to shape your own utopia with real players because it is a user-generated world. Establish your country, customize it, and set your own rules, or find a profession you are fond of as a citizen. Both choices will lead you to different paths. Alongside being a citizen, basic professions (such as farmer, forester, etc.) are designed to create a purpose-based atmosphere; in this way, players can internalize the profession on their way to being president. These professions consist of various quests and popular casual games, which are aimed to be educational and entertaining at the same time.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/polity", "videos": [{"id": 58594, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "zeV4oCUwQc8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeV4oCUwQc8", "title": "Polity Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zeV4oCUwQc8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
