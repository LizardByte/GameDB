The presentation is more accurate to the real Street Fighter II than the re-releases/hacks that came afterwards. Like Cony's other games, the AI is considered to be unfairly difficult and is known to frequently spam specials. The special moves themselves are executed differently to the official Street Fighter II, requiring the player to press a direction on the D-pad plus A and B at the same time, with the exception of special moves that require to press a button repeatedly. The ending is a simple credits screen which appears in many of Cony's other games.\n\nStreet Fighter VI (12 Peoples) (1996) - This version removes Dhalsim and Zangief from the roster, possibly so the game uses less space.
