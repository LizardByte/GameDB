Can your team defeat rival exterminators, shoddy gear, and City Hall?\n\nYou've been a daemon dissipator for years, carrying a rainbow blaster and learning the ins and outs of magic to zap electromagnetic monsters into static. After following the jobs from one end of Septenland to the other, you've settled down here in Barrington: an old city. A weird city. A city boiling with spirits, specters, and daemons. It's the perfect place to start a company of your own.\n\n\"The Luminous Underground\" is a 660,000-word interactive secondary-world science fantasy novel by Phoebe Barton, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based\u2014without graphics or sound effects\u2014and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.\nYour team is just you and McCowan, your friend and business partner, but it's hard for two people to run an operation like this. When you applied for a contract with the Barrington Transit Commission, you didn't expect anything but a flat rejection. But you got it! And now you've got to find more teammates, sharpen your skills, and put a dent in the spirit population while staying well clear of the electrified rail.\n\nBut you'll find that Barrington's underground is much more than its tunnels. There's a forest down here, teeming with crystalline trees that glitter under your flashlight. There's a portal to the Vitalscape, a super-luminous alternative realm of being. You can enter it through a mural, but you'll need a crystal tuning fork to get back. There are giants, robots, daemons, and even a giant robot daemon.\n\nOf course, corruption and mismanagement festers down here. Is this all part of your competitors\u2019 attempts to secure the subway contract for their own? Is City Hall's stingy maintenance budget to blame? How much can you get paid not to fix this problem?\n\nAre you ready to patrol your patch of subway, or will you stand by and let it crumble?\n\u2022 Play as male, female, or nonbinary; gay, straight, aromantic, or asexual.\n\u2022 Descend into a magic-drenched subway and face down spirits beneath the streets!\n\u2022 Help time travelers integrate into the incredible world of today.\n\u2022 Dig up megacorporate corruption while you dust off vacuum tubes.\n\u2022 Investigate mysterious disappearances down in the underground.\n\u2022 Cooperate with other outfits in town, or act on your own\n\u2022 Lead the mayor to safety through a gauntlet of terrors!\n\u2022 Save the lives of a missing crew under an impossible sky.\n\u2022 Calm down a giant woman who's got you in the palm of her hand.\n\nStrange things are crawling out of the subway.
