We\u2019ve also streamlined mechanics from other platform fighters to make it easy to pick up and to change main characters. We\u2019re constantly adjusting balance and slowly adding new mechanics to the game to raise the competitive ceiling. We\u2019ll continue expanding Brawlhalla by adding new characters, weapons, maps, and game modes for as long as players want to keep brawling. \n\nAs always, community feedback is incredibly important to us and will continue to be throughout the lifespan of the game.
