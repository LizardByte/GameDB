It was previously ruled over by the immortal Queen Marika, who acted as keeper of the Elden Ring, a powerful force that manifested itself as the physical concept of order. When Marika shattered the Elden Ring and disappeared, her demigod children began fighting over pieces of the Ring in an event called The Shattering. Each demigod has a shard of the Ring called a Great Rune, which corrupts them with power. In the game, the player character is a Tarnished, one of a group of exiles from the Lands Between who are summoned back after the Shattering. The player must traverse the realm to repair the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord.", "summary": "Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Deluxe Edition includes:\n\n\u2022 The base game\n\u2022 The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion\n\u2022 The base game's Digital Artbook & Original Soundtrack\n\u2022 The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion's Artbook & Soundtrack", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-deluxe-edition", "videos": [{"id": 135539, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "qLZenOn7WUo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLZenOn7WUo", "title": "ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLZenOn7WUo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
