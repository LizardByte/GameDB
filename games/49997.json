Based on the coin-operated classic, QIX, this GBC sequel to the puzzle-based original offers similar gaming styles and a few welcome updates. In this take, you'll use a cursor to draw boxes on the screen, avoiding the Qix. If you can draw a compete box without the Qix touching its perimeter, that area of the screen will disappear and get you one step closer to advancing. Adding an element of story, QIX ADVENTURE casts you in the role of Speedy, a treasure hunter who's traveled to a mysterious island. Each level that you pass will help you in your quest to rid the island of all its strange creatures. Easy to learn but extremely difficult to master, QIX ADVENTURE is addicting fun for puzzle lovers and other gamers. Are you quick enough for Qix? Find out alone or against a friend.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/qix-adventure"}
