With the extras bonus stage, i had to edit them because in order play the extra stages: Next, i had to play the game in hard mode (which requires me play the entire game again) to access the extra stages which is hard to play; so, right after the credits i decided to put the bonus stage at the end to make it more \"easter eggish\" (im not sure it thats the correct term). Anyways, I tried many times to get this right and im not doing this again.\r\n\r\nOther then that this game is really fun, but man is it hard to play. You get to play as 3 characters with diffrent fighting style and magic. Look at the length of this game, this is by far the longest longplay i have ever done.\r\n\r\nAct 1 5:12\r\n\r\nAct 2 14:13\r\n\r\nAct 3 20:48\r\n\r\nAct 4 31:40\r\n\r\nAct 5 41:09\r\n\r\nAct 6 49:21\r\n\r\nAct 7 58:21\r\n\r\nAct 8 1:10:11\r\n\r\nAct 9 1:17:35 \r\n\r\nFinal Battle 1:25:13\r\n\r\nAct x 1:37:04 \r\n\r\nAct x (Valis III Sutherland) 1:40:02 -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EDJ_5coqztw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EDJ_5coqztw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EDJ_5coqztw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PC Engine Longplay [045] Valis IV", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\r\n\r\nPlayed by: Valis77\r\n\r\nThis was the most frustrating recording i ever done.
