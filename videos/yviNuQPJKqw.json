Its a little faster than the Amiga version, but that is likely due to the smaller resolution and loss of roadside details. Its also a lot brighter. Apart from that the game is mostly the same with the edition of in game music. The game it self is a re-imagining of Crazy Cars III released previously on the Amiga.\n\nI haven&#39;t bothered to race every race. Just enough to buy all the upgrades and move onto the next championship. I havent seen the ending to Lamborghini on the Amiga, but compared to Crazy Cars III, the ending has been drastically cut in this version making this playthrough a little disappointing for me.\n\nI have cropped the bottom of the screen, as most of the game would have a huge black bar at the bottom. Nothing is massively cut from the menu screen apart from the password, but you don&#39;t need to see that right??
