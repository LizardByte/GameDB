There is no ending to watch either.\n\nThis is a port of the Amiga original by codemasters to make use of there J-Cart for 4-player action, like with there micro-machines series.\n\nIt seems to have lost something in the translation though as its missing little things like ramps and other scenery.  They seem to have missed the point of the skid marks name though in that there is no track ware.\n\nI played through all 4 race types of Championship league to unlock Pro League.  I then played through pro to unlock the Formula1 and cow races.  In the end this resulted in a code to unlock Low Gravity mode (Not Shown in video).  Finishing all the above also unlocked turbo and nitro game speed for single matches as well as adding f1 and cows to the vehicle list.\n\nOne last thing to note.  This is the forst game ive knowingly encountered that used the full 320x240 resolution so can be show in full 480p (doubled) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uB-SZ_BPEbs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uB-SZ_BPEbs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uB-SZ_BPEbs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uB-SZ_BPEbs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [179] Super Skidmarks", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by MadMatty\n\nI wasnt going to scrap this vid, but decided to keep simply as a gam3e for the archive as theres no real enjoyment to be had watching the video.
