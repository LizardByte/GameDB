Far from the glamour and romance of Bourban Street, you find yourself prowling the seedy bars and alleyways of the waterfront for clues.\n\nThe word is out on the grapevine. A nosy reporter (you) is snooping around for information from everyone and anyone who'll talk. If you're the kind of ace reporter that judges your sources carefully, you could end up with the story of a lifetime. If not, you could find yourself on a pleasure cruise down the Gulf - minus the boat!", "summary": "Nightwalker! Beautiful women. Dangerous men. A weird gravedigger. They're all here in this interactive tale that challenges you to crack a dangerous underground heroin ring.\n\nNightwalker is an interactive story, so your decisions during the game have a direct bearing on its outcome. You collect evidence, buy information, log observations, and interview townspeople. You must successfully gather enough evidence to present to the police for a bust.\n\nNightwalker is a text-oriented program that is beefed-up with some sharp graphics routines, and has an extensive data base that assures you of many, many hours of varied excitement - if you survive!", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nightwalker"}
