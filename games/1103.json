Upon further exploration of the Station, she finds the Baby in a small capsule. As she approaches, Ridley appears and grabs the capsule. After a brief battle, Samus repels Ridley, and he activates a self-destruct sequence to destroy Ceres.\n\nAfter escaping the explosion, Ridley flees to Zebes, and Samus goes after him.", "summary": "The Space Pirates, merciless agents of the evil Mother Brain, have stolen the last Metroid from a research station, and once again Mother Brain threatens the safety of the galaxy!
