But it has been a very long time since any one has been able to accomplish the ritual to \"there\". It is even said that the gatekeepers have forgotten the ritual itself. More and more shapes now wants to get rid of the ritual to get to a better place. First came vocal protestation but since those stayed ignored it quickly turned into war. Shapes wanting to get \"there\" rush in huge numbers to the gate while the gatekeepers try as mush as they can to prevent them.\n\nBut one day a simple square arrives here. The chosen one.
