Led by the famed general Ajax, Solvia's imperial forces soon invaded Meledian shores. Once Meleda suffered a critical defeat in the Battle of Frist, the Empire quickly swooped in to seize the royal capital of Regina. Crushed beyond any hope of recovery, Meleda was forced to watch its invaders brutally wipe 500 years of history right off the face of the map. And so, one year passed... Once thought to have gone missing, the young princess Athol miraculously returned to the royal capital and freed its people through a furious battle.\n\nThe one who fought valiantly by her side and helped lead her to victory was none other than Zadrian, the young heir to Redessa. Meleda praised Zadrian as a national hero, showering him with fame and glory that far exceeded what they had once shown his elder brother Zecharias, the kingdom's finest knight. Zech was not only engaged to the princess, he was also the acting commander of the Meledian army... And most importantly, he was Zade's big brother\u2013 the man who Zade loved and respected more than anyone else. Feeling like his very presence had become a stain on his dear brother's reputation, Zade decided to leave the capital and set off on a new journey to the Temenos of Vesta. He took with him on his quest only a single traveling companion: Accorte Roland, a student of Sphire's magic academy and the daughter of a man who once saved Zade's life...", "summary": "Vestaria Saga II continues the adventures of Zade, bringing the tales of him and his companions to a thrilling, satisfying end. They will encounter allies both new and old while uncovering more mysteries behind the vile Margulites and their plan to plunge Vestaria into a new age of darkness.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vestaria-saga-ii-the-sacred-sword-of-silvanister", "videos": [{"id": 67817, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "gMjxIHgnPjM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMjxIHgnPjM", "title": "Vestaria Saga II: The Sacred Sword of Silvanister - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gMjxIHgnPjM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 69140, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "ZFrXM2v1BpQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFrXM2v1BpQ", "title": "Vestaria Saga II: The Sacred Sword of Silvanister - Release Date Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZFrXM2v1BpQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
