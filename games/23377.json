After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team's members. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. It soon becomes very clear that it isn't just any mansion, but a hellish place where the undead walk the corridors and other horrors are lurking in the darkness, waiting to eat some heads.", "summary": "Resident Evil: Director's Cut is an arranged version of the original game produced to compensate for the highly publicized delay of the sequel Resident Evil 2. The game contains a new arranged mode with various changes made to the game. The original release of the Director's Cut advertised an uncut version of the opening cinema in full color and never-before seen. Notable aspects of this video include shots of a corpse with bites taken out of the face, close-ups of zombie dogs bleeding when shot, and graphic quick-cuts of Joseph being bitten by these dogs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-directors-cut", "videos": [{"id": 46548, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "B1p9VYx-o_U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1p9VYx-o_U", "title": "Resident Evil - Directors Cut Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B1p9VYx-o_U/sddefault.jpg"}]}
