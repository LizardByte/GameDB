An outcast in your own vampiric sect. A political prisoner of no particular value. An immigrant who never found her roots in a city of immigrants. A chainsmoker whose favorite pastime is staring blankly at the streets through the windows of a fast food joint at 4AM. The sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach tells you that you\u2019re doomed, and distorted voices from the shadows seem to agree. The curse of your clan makes interacting with everyday technology difficult. Dissociation is your natural state.\n\nBut when New York\u2019s Anarch leader meets a gruesome end, out of all the bloodsuckers in the metropolis, you\u2019re the one picked to investigate. Make no mistake: this is obviously a trap, yet another move in the horrible game of Jyhad, the eternal struggle for power between warring vampire generations. But you\u2019re Lasombra, and if there\u2019s one thing you know, it\u2019s this: if the Ventrue Prince and her followers underestimate you, they\u2019re going to deeply regret it.", "summary": "Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Shadows of New York is a visual novel set in the rich universe of Vampire: The Masquerade.
