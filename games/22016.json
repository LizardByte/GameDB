This new game created and published by Too Tidy Games, is made exclusively for Apple TV and the Siri Remote.\n\nGunKinger Bonanza is a fun and relaxing game for up to 4 local gunslingers, using the Siri Remote to aim the six-shooter and the touch surface on the Siri Remote to handle the gun with swipes / tap gestures. The player will have to aim and shoot from the hips like a real wild west gunslinger, and develop the sense of feeling the target hit point instead of simply aiming.\n\nWith stunning 3D graphics, artistic style and gameplay, GunKinger Bonanza is a really fun experience to compete with friends and family on the big screen.\n\nThere are 3 game modes and an easy option for the younger players. Everyone that plays the game will increase the common gold stock and with 25K in gold a bonus game will be unlocked.\n\nThe special ammo like shotgun-bullets, explosive-bullets and TNT-barrels extends the games replayability. The special ammo can be earned for free or purchased within the game.\n\nThe dynamic character reactions and animations in combination with settings as gold-fever, bandit-bullets and wind-strength, makes for a real entertaining and unique gaming experience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
