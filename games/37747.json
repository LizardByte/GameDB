It is set in the Sengoku era of Japanese history.\n\nZan II: Spirits is the first Super Famicom game in Wolf Team's series of strategy sims set in historical Japan. It was eventually followed up with a sequel, Zan III: Spirits.\n\nAs with its thematically-similar contemporaries, like Shingen the Ruler or Nobunaga's Ambition, Zan II puts the player in the geta of a Japanese feudal lord, or daimyo, with designs to wrest control over the rest of Japan from the other daimyos. The game is more focused on warfare than day-to-day resource management, with armies of samurai marching across the map to attack fortresses and pagodas that host enemy flags.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zan-ii-spirits"}
