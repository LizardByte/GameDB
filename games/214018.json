Stranger now because the accident wiped your memory clean and there are no answers to any questions. A map slightly jolts your mind with the thought that you are meant to be here, but where exactly are you and where is everybody else? Only by trekking through the landscape of this island can you figure out why you are here, and why you have placed yourself in such a dire circumstance. Search the island coasts and interior to recover your memory. Investigate an ancient temple, a sunken ship, and gloomy catacombs to find answers. Uncover helpful items, solve intriguing puzzles, and capture images within stunning locations. Each clue brings you closer to unveiling all of the truths, and perhaps your ultimate destiny.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lost-lagoon-the-trail-of-destiny"}
