As the name says, it is to be its successor. The first server was created on February 13, 2020 and it was the Turkish server. The Polish server was created on March 10, 2020. The game is currently in beta.\n\nIn this version, the game has more features than on a normal MSP. MovieStars can eat, sleep, look in the mirror and many other activities that we do in real life. There are also many more facial expressions that you can buy. In addition, after purchasing this facial expression, the gait of our MS also changes. After creating an account, we go to the chatroom.\n\nUnfortunately, there weren't many features known from MSP for a long time: forum, Design Studio, and movies and ArtBooks can only be made in the Studio section. This is most likely because the game is still being tested.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moviestarplanet-2", "videos": [{"id": 50177, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "F0QlLFKYDhQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0QlLFKYDhQ", "title": "Walk the runway \ud83e\udd33", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0QlLFKYDhQ/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 7064, "name": "MovieStarPlanet"}]}
