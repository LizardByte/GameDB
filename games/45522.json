The souls of the hidden mansion have asked you to return, because they have recognized that you possess special powers that allow you to see the butterfly manifestations of the souls living there. Something terrible is afoot at the mansion, and you must investigate things and set them right. Along the way you must discover the true purpose of the mansion and it's significance in the universe.\n\nMuch like the Sega CD game, this is an FMV adventure. You move from location to location via video sequences, and solve puzzles to move on in the story.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-mansion-of-hidden-souls", "collections": [{"id": 8505, "name": "Mansion of Hidden Souls"}]}
