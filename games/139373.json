It was initially released on December 10, 1995, and saw an updated release in February 1996. In contrast to most megawads, it is designed especially for cooperative multiplayer gameplay, although it can be played in single-player as well. It is also one of the few PWADs that are allowed to be used in Compet-N speedruns. The soundtrack was composed by Mark Klem, who also designed one level and co-designed another, and is available in a separate file named MMMUS.WAD. The phrase Memento Mori is Latin and is translated as \"Remember that you will die\" or \"Remember death\".\n\nIn 2003, this WAD was named one of the Top 100 WADs of All Time. However, it was erroneously listed as a 1996 WAD, when it was in fact originally released in 1995; 1996 was merely the release year of the final version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
