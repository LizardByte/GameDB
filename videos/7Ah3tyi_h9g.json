A true classic from the golden era of amiga gaming which must not be forgotten alongside the software house and all programmers that were involved in making this game.\n\nYear of release: 1990\n\nVery tricky game to master, go round the maze, collect all the pods but you must not collide with yourself (like Tron) otherwise you die. Took me over 6 bloody minutes just to get past the first level, lots of skill needed.\n\nHope all you Amiga fans enjoy this upload.\n\nPlease note: NONE of my game uploads are emulated in any way whatsoever, they are 100% original recordings by myself taken directly from the original hardware the game was intended for, that way you know you're watching the real thing.\nI will also always state weather i am using any cheats in the game, if not mentioned then i am not using any.\nCheck out my channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/ZEUSDAZ/videos), dedicated to gamers who loved the games of yesteryear.\n\nSwitch to 480p for best video quality and feel free to leave comments on my channel and vid's.\n\nKeeping the memory of the Amiga and it's cool games alive!!!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Ah3tyi_h9g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Ah3tyi_h9g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Ah3tyi_h9g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Ah3tyi_h9g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "CREEPY (AMIGA)", "description": "Zeus presents Creepy (un-emulated) for the Amiga A500.
