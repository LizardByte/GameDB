Due to the market conditions for Atari 2600 cartridges at the time, Actionauts was never completed, and was not shown or released to the gaming public until 2008. The original, seemingly simple puzzle-game challenges a single player to use the program editor to construct a sequence of commands to navigate an onscreen robot to reach the 'cheese'.
