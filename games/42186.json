You control a canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy the rows of bomb-dropping invaders! The invaders march back and forth on the screen; each time the edge of the screen is reached, they drop a row closer towards the bottom. If they reach the bottom of the screen before you destroy them, the game will be over. Destroy all the invaders, and you move on to the next, more difficult level. Occasionally, a flying saucer will appear at the top of the screen; this can be shot for bonus points. Between levels you will also have an opportunity to earn bonus points by shooting the saucer as many times as possible before it flies off the screen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
