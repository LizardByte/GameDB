{"id": "g8WW6RvJ7HE", "snippet": {"title": "Cool World (NES) Playthrough", "description": "A playthrough of Ocean's 1993 license-based action game for the NES, Cool World.\n\nCool World for the NES was one of the many games produced by Ocean to be based on the 1992 movie starring Brad Pitt and Kim Basinger. The movie was a box office flop that got crucified by critics, and the NES game didn't exactly set the world on fire when it finally released a year later. \n\nThe SNES version (https://youtu.be/8nbf5YHqYGY) met with a rather tepid reception, but the popular gaming magazines never even bothered to acknowledge the existence of the NES game. Rightfully so, I say.\n\nRemember the movie's awkward tagline? \"Holli would if she could ...and she will.\" I suppose the intention was to sum up the movie's plot - that Holli, a trashy Jessica Rabbit wannabe, wanted to become real, and she was willing to do *anything* to make that happen - with a spicy bit of innuendo.\n\nThe game follows that same basic idea: you play as Frank Harris, a cop who has to stop her from turning herself human with the \"golden spike\" (oh, more innuendo, how clever!) and unleashing the \"doodles\" (ah, what a knee slapper!) on the real world.\n\nDoing this on the NES involves collecting map pieces that, when put together, reveal Holli's location. You can play the first four stages in any order, and once the map is complete, you move on to the Ocean Tower for the final showdown. The goal of each stage is to collect the map piece from the boss, but since your pen is useless against these guys, you'll need to gather a stockpile of special weapon ammo before throwing down the gauntlet.\n\nThere are a few irritatingly arbitrary \"puzzles,\" but the cycle generally goes like this:\n\n1. Frantically run away from swarms of baddies as you search for the pen so you can defend yourself (if the pen doesn't forget to spawn itself).\n\n2. Attempt to interact with every innocuous object you come across in the vain hope that you'll find a way to move forward, only to be insta-killed by a car or electricity.\n\n3. Collect special weapons and candy canes while falling through false platforms into acid vats and bottomless pits.\n\n4. Scream in frustration at the playfield's wonky sense of depth, the fact that attacking and ducking are both assigned to the B button, the inability to move diagonally, the way jumping from a platform to the floor leaves you momentarily stunned, and the flaming trainwreck of a soundtrack.\n\n5. Reach the boss and pelt them with your items (whenever they aren't glitching out) until they drop the map piece, and if you don't have enough items to finish the job, well... it sucks to be you. Unless you have a huge stockpile of extra lives, you might as well hit the reset button. \n\nSo yeah, it's understandable that Holli would want to escape Cool World, and I'm confident that she will. It's hardly worth the effort to stop her.\n\nNot cool, Ocean. Not cool at all.\n_____________\r\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \r\n\r\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g8WW6RvJ7HE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g8WW6RvJ7HE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g8WW6RvJ7HE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g8WW6RvJ7HE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Cool World (NES) Playthrough", "description": "A playthrough of Ocean's 1993 license-based action game for the NES, Cool World.\n\nCool World for the NES was one of the many games produced by Ocean to be based on the 1992 movie starring Brad Pitt and Kim Basinger.
