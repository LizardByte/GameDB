Your task is to solve interesting challenges by building geometric constructions with a straightedge and compass. If you design the most elegantly simple solutions in the least number of moves, you\u2019ll earn the highest scores. Solutions are scored in lines (L) and elementary Euclidean constructions.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t a math wizard. Euclidea starts out with simple challenges that guide you through the basics. Once you master the fundamentals, you\u2019ll move on to tougher, more mind-bending challenges such as inner/outer tangents, regular polygons, and more. There are 120 unique challenges in total, which are organized in packs for simpler navigation.\n\nEuclidea has been shown to help with imagination, intuition, and logic, all wonderful skills to develop.\n\nEuclidea is a FUN & CHALLENGING Way to Create Euclidian Constructions!\n\n> 127 Levels: from very easy to really hard\n> 11 Tutorials\n> 10 Innovative Tools\n> \"Explore\" Mode and Hints\n> Easily Drag, Zoom & Pan\n> No Advertising!\n\nNew levels are unlocked as you solve the previous ones. You can complete the whole game only if you earn all the stars. But you can buy an IAP that removes this restriction.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/euclidea", "videos": [{"id": 17778, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "cAwhR6-ZHLs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAwhR6-ZHLs", "title": "Euclidea: Geometric Constructions Game App Demo - State of Tech", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cAwhR6-ZHLs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
