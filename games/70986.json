Players band together in two teams (in either 2v2 or 4v4 matches) and are set loose on an asymmetrical map where they battle for control of the map's relic. Only one team can escape with the relic so strong team coordination, intelligent strategy, and mastery of character abilities are the keys to victory.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/relic-raiders"}
