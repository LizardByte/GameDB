However, the Prince accidentally starts a conflict between Persia and India. Over the span of the game, the Prince fights the Deavas, a mythical race of demons contained in a box he opens, and Kalim, the Prince of India and brother of his long lost love Farah. Because of the wars the Prince becomes darker and matures. The game gives information as to what happens in between the two games in the Sands of Time trilogy.", "summary": "Battles of Prince of Persia is the first game in the Prince of Persia franchise to make its way onto the Nintendo DS. The storyline takes place in the time between the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones.
