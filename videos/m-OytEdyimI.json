{"id": "m-OytEdyimI", "snippet": {"title": "Mickey no Tokyo Disneyland Daibouken Game Sample - SNES/SFC", "description": "Original Air Date: May 27th, 2009\r\n\r\nMickey Mouse sure is popular in Japan! There are a number of Japan-only Mickey Mouse games, some better than others. In this Mickey Mouse game published by TOMY,  you're out to stop old Pete as you travel through various Tokyo Disneyland attractions using balloons and find your friends so you can rehearse for a parade. Balloons? Yes, balloons! This isn't the first game Mickey uses Balloons either. In Mickey Mouse III: Yume Fuusen for the Famicom, Mickey also uses balloons... and that game actually came to the U.S., well, sorta. It was changed to \"Kid Klown in Night Mayor World\"... a game in Kemco's \"Kid Klown\" series.\r\n\r\nVisually, this game is surprisingly good and is pretty comparable to the Capcom Mickey games. The sound is also pretty good, but the gameplay is an acquired taste, if only for the slippery controls. Mickey has two kinds of balloons. The first kind are water balloons (blue) and can defeat enemies, put out fires and even be used as boosts for jumps and pressing down switches. The second are helium/gas balloons (yellow/orange) and can be used to float about and travel under various instances. \r\n\r\nThis game may look simple enough and you get a lot of life, but the game is deceptively difficult and you will die very often if you fly about randomly. This would be an interesting game for those TAS folks, but playing it normally can be an exercise in frustration, though you are awarded with passwords after levels. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a fun, challenging game and worth a purchase of you're a fan of Mickey Mouse and tough video games.
