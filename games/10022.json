This monumental pleasure dome, called 'The Utopia', features 1000 apartments, a shopping mall, and hundreds of offices and leisure facilities. All under one roof. Its grand opening was supposed to have been two year ago. That event never happened. A chain of mysterious events has now left the Utopia abandoned and silent.\n\nPeople have gone missing. Electromagnetic disturbances are increasing. Armed with only a camera and a torch, you must journey there alone to explore its winding corridors, its secret passageways, and its gloomy halls. Local townspeople say Wittard kept a terrible secret. They speak fearfully of someone or something malevolent living at his city. They say it is waiting and growing in power. They say time is running out... players will have to face the lurking horrors of this desolate place and find out what dark secret the Baron kept from the world.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/baron-wittard-nemesis-of-ragnarok"}
