Perhaps it\u2019s the chocolate shake with a shot of cognac which she carries in her backpack which makes her different. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that at 7 years old her favourite things are the transfer of energy, magnetic fields and electrical engineering! But being the odd one out doesn\u2019t matter to Nika. She doesn\u2019t care that her parents don\u2019t understand her, that her teachers ignore her or that her friends are completely nuts. She has a plan to solve everything. A really\u2026 odd plan.\n\n- Join Nika in her quest to destroy the Psychotic world!\n- Extremely cool and colorful visuals.\n- You will face many puzzles with different ways to be solved.\n- Cool references to many other videogames, movies and music.\n- Serioulsy, you shouldn't skip the chance to play this game.\n\n\nMango Protocol are\nMariona Valls Porta - Graphics\nJavier G\u00e1lvez Guerrero - Design and programming\n\nMusic by Guillem Vilamala Serrano.\nEnglish translation by Adam Giles Levy.\n\n\nWeb: http://www.mangoprotocol.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/MangoProtocol\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/mangoprotocol\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCswvRC9zpU5W_c1HnOSu3lA\nEmail: info@mangoprotocol.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kHM5RwPwiqg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kHM5RwPwiqg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kHM5RwPwiqg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kHM5RwPwiqg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kHM5RwPwiqg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "MechaNika - Launch trailer (Steam | Google Play | Apple App Store)", "description": "Available on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/384680\nAlso on the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/mechanika/id984552419\nAnd Google Play: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mangoprotocol.psychotic.mechanika\n\nMechaNika is an adventure game that you will enjoy with Nika, an intelligent girl that doesn\u2019t fit the world in which she lives.
