Latisha has been variously described as \"feisty\" and \"brimming with attitude\" by critics.\n\nThe three characters journey to Earth, in order to retrieve the stolen twelve Sacred Albums of Funk and return them to Lamont the Funkopotamus. Levels take place on terrains that represent Earth's ecosystems. The game's ultimate antagonist is the Anti-Funk, whose defeat will \"save the world from all that is unfunky.\" The \"funk\" has been described as a parody of the Force from Star Wars, with the Anti-Funk being the dark side.", "summary": "The alien duo is back in an all-new adventure.
