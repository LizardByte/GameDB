You must help Pooh get to a certain place on the game board within a specified number of dice rolls. Along the way, he will encounter his friends Tigger, Piglet, Rabbit, and Eeyore, who will play along with Pooh and open mini-games for the loveable bear to store in his cupboard. The mini-games will have the player helping Pooh look for honey, exercise, fish, get unstuck from Rabbit's hole, bounce with Tigger, and catch acorns. The more you play WINNIE THE POOH: Adventures in the 100 Acre Wood, the greater the chances of finding a new path or mini-game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
