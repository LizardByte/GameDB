Together the paladin and death-knight must venture forth to find a way to break that forging. To succeed is to resume the path you have set for yourself. To fail is to spend eternity linked to that which you have despised.", "summary": "You were a disciple of the Divine, a servant of light on a never-ending crusade to fight evil. But fate has made a terrible turn on you. During an epic battle with a powerful necromancer, dreadful daemon named Samuel tricked you and dragged you to his dimension. There you were trapped and tortured. But like every typical daemon lord, he had a very twisted, sadistic sense of humour, so he decided to chain your soul to that of a Deathknight. Thus he cursed you to spend the rest of eternity bound to a creature you were fighting all you life. Now you must work together to escape your prison and find a way to break this curse!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beyond-divinity", "videos": [{"id": 4706, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2KEkuqszBZI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KEkuqszBZI", "title": "Exclusive Beyond Divinity  trailer by GOG.com", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2KEkuqszBZI/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1024, "name": "Divinity"}]}
