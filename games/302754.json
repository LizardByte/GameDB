The player is presented with a fixed view of a valley and a number of icons that are used to play the game. The objective of the game is to make the valley flourish by tapping on the icons in the correct order. If unsuccessful the player will lose by either running out of icons to tap on or by triggering a major disastrous event. Each time an icon is tapped it will go up in level and it is when all icons has reached their maximum levels that the game is won.\n\nAll the icons (except for one) pollute the environment in different ways. This includes leaving garbage, building factories, cutting down trees, spilling chemicals, polluting the air and dispersing oil. The final icon is a heart which can be used to revoke damage. When one icon is tapped it can have an effect on the levels of other icons. For example building a factory can lead to more air pollution or trees being cut down. In this way all icons can be leveled to max even if they are just tapped once. When starting out levels are divided into sub-levels which means that the player manually clicks on icons to see these effects being played out. Later on a quick play mode can be unlocked where effects happen automatically.\n\nBy leveling up icons the player earns greencoins that can be used in the game store to buy hints on how to succeed with the game. By discovering different scenes the player can also earn stars which are needed to turn on the quick play mode. Greencoins can also be used to unlock a fast forward button and to reveal the current levels of the icons.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ipollute"}
