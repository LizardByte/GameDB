Hopefully you can follow directions!\nThis version has unlimited lives, so you can replay levels as many times as you like! No Ads or In App purchases, just puzzle fun. To play this unique game you will need to get Bu the Blob around the board by following the arrows. Every time you remove a block, Bu will move the direction of the next arrow. There are different kinds of blocks - spiky, bouncy and slidy. This makes the puzzler, because you need to think about the right block to remove at the right time. And to make things more fun, there are teleports. Who doesn\u2019t love moving through teleports?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mislead"}
