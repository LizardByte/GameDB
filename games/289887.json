Here is the description on what he says about his homebrew:\n\n\"Puck-Man Puzzler I couldn't exactly copy Pac-Man, or steal any graphic's from his existing games, so I had to make my own original Graphics, which are not that great as my Puck-Man isn't animated an is based on a Square but it works for now this is just the first Demo, of what may or may not become a full game. It only has 8 levels..\n\nUnlike Pac-Man there are no Ghost, Enemies, or Power Pellets in this game instead you just collect the coins then go to the exit to proceed to the next level. This is just the concept I am trying out for now in future versions it may be a bit different.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puck-man-puzzler", "videos": [{"id": 108546, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yoZ21aKwIdI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoZ21aKwIdI", "title": "Puck Man Puzzler - NES Homebrew", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yoZ21aKwIdI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
