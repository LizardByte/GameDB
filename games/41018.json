Based on Photon Storm's excellent Quartet game, Assembloids is a frantic reflex-based puzzle game in which you must assemble faces from four different sets as quickly as possible against an increasingly tight time limit. \n \nFeaturing open border design, high-score codes so you can keep a record of your achievements and full (comparable speed) PAL/NTSC compatibility, Assembloids requires no keyboard input and is designed to work on the C64GS as well as regular commodore computers.
