They're protecting their homes. You see, cats have been fighting an endless war for centuries against a nearly invisible menace: Dust Bunnies.\n\nEvery night, these mischievous little creatures rise up from the cracks in the floorboards to cause havoc, but our faithful felines stop them in their tracks.\n\nIn all this time, all the cats have been able to do is break even. They stop the bunnies, but expend all their energy for the day simply holding them off until the next. (Why do you think cats nap all the time? They're exhausted!)\n\nToday, though, the tides turn in the cats' favor with the latest technology on offer.\nEnter: The Roomba\n\nWith this dust-defeating droid, the cats don't need to lift a paw to protect their people! Finally, they can diligently defeat their fearsome foes!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/roomba-ruckus"}
