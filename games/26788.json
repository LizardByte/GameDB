Face intergalactic traffic and space pirates!\r\n\r\nHey guys, this is my new arcade game Space Pilot! It's actually one of my old test games from back in 2013. I've decided to finish it, and since it's actually already playable, I thought why not share it to you guys so that I'll be able to get some feedback while I develop it! I hope you guys enjoy playing my game. Any and all feedback is very welcome!\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n\r\nLeft Arrow Key - Move Left\r\nRight Arrow Key - Move Right", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-pilot--2", "collections": [{"id": 2503, "name": "Space Pilot"}]}
