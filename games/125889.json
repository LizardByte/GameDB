The goal is to get your marble to the goal as quickly as possible. There are 24 unique levels to master. \n \nThis game is the result of a fractal physics engine developed by CodeParade that allows fast collisions with fractals and other procedurally rendered objects. As far as I'm aware, it is the first game to ever use this technique. \n \nThe game is also open source: https://github.com/HackerPoet/MarbleMarcher", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marble-marcher", "videos": [{"id": 41168, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "9U0XVdvQwAI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U0XVdvQwAI", "title": "Marble Marcher - A Fractal Physics Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9U0XVdvQwAI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
