The game is based on the popular internet creepypasta about a mysterious place that exists between the walls and floors of buildings, a place where people can become trapped and lost for days, weeks, or even years.\n\nIn the game, you play as a person who has become trapped in the Backrooms, and your goal is to find a way out before the endless maze drives you insane. The Backrooms are a surreal and unsettling place, filled with strange noises, flickering lights, and mysterious creatures that seem to be watching you from the shadows.\n\nAs you explore the Backrooms, you'll need to find keys, solve puzzles, and avoid dangerous traps and obstacles. You'll also encounter other lost souls who are trying to escape, but not all of them can be trusted. The deeper you go, the more unsettling the Backrooms become, and the harder it is to tell what's real and what's just a figment of your imagination.\n\nBackrooms: Realm of Shadows is designed to be a tense and atmospheric horror experience, with a focus on exploration, puzzle-solving, and survival. It's a game that will keep you on edge from start to finish, as you try to find your way out of this terrifying and otherworldly place.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/backrooms-realm-of-shadows", "videos": [{"id": 88857, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "OW1G-PZYT-w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW1G-PZYT-w", "title": "The Backrooms: Found Footage | Gameplay Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OW1G-PZYT-w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
