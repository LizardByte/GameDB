Garden Edition is a ROM hack that started development in July 2009. \n\nMy initial idea was to create a ROM hack of Sonic 3 & Knuckles that would have brand new level layouts from start to finish. In total, 13 Zones of new layouts, providing 23 unique acts of game play.\n\nAfter 6 years of development, I achieved my goal. The first fully edited and completed Sonic 3 (& Knuckles) ROM hack was finished.\n\nThe ROM hack was submitted to the Sonic Hacking Contest as a private entry several times until it's release, where it was made public. In that time, it won several trophies including the Green Hill trophy (in both 2012 and 2013) for feeling the most like an original Sonic game, and the Lava Reef Trophy for Best Level Layouts (in both 2013 and 2015).\n\nYou can download the Sonic the Hedgehog 3: D.A.
