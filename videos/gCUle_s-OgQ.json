{"id": "gCUle_s-OgQ", "snippet": {"title": "Ehrgeiz [Arcade] - play as Cloud", "description": "This is a playthrough using Cloud in the Arcade version of Ehrgeiz: God Bless The Ring. Read on below for more information...\n\nCloud is a hidden/bonus CPU opponent in the game who can be fought against if a time condition is met after beating Stage 8. He is a time-release playable character in this version of the game.\n\n===== CLOUD TIME RELEASE =====\n\n30 days from the initial install and first boot of the game.\n\n===== ABOUT CLOUD =====\n\nHe is an arrogant mercenary and was once a member of an elite warrior unit force called SOLDIER. Only focused in the tasks he is hired to carry out, he does not show interest in anything else.\n\nAs he discovers more about his past, and with the help of his friends, he learns that there is more to being a hero than just having physical strength and fame. He develops compassion for the planet and the people he fights to protect, and defends them from his nemesis, Sephiroth.\n\nIn battle, he wields a large broadsword named the Buster Sword.\n\n===== GAMEPLAY =====\n\nCloud is a decent character in Ehrgeiz, with good close-up fighting abilities. Pressing the Special button allows him to go into the sword mode to wield the Buster, which grants him powerful sword strikes, at the expense of continuously decreasing the gauge. His charged special consists of summoning some meteorites which is next to useless due to the ridiculously long amount of time required to charge up for it.\n\n===== EXTRAS =====\n\nAdditional footage of Cloud actually beating Red Scorpion (the credits boss) and getting the Ehrgeiz sword. This begins around 16:21 in the video.\n\n===== ADDITIONAL INFORMATION =====\n\n---- When he is the bonus CPU opponent, he is named as \"Guardian\" under his lifebar. When a human player plays as him, he is called \"Cloud\" instead.\n\n---- He has a forward somersault drop move, which looks similar to the Mishima's Demon Scissors from Tekken.\n\n---- His basic jumping kick is a Tekken style roundhouse. In fact, it looks exactly like it.\n\n---- On the character select screen, his image portrait is not a 3D-rendered style one like the regular characters.\n\n---- He is 1 of only 2 characters in the game to have his own victory/map music theme after winning a match.\n\n---- \"Ehrgeiz\" is a German word, and it means \"ambition\". It's pronounced as \"air-geitz\", not \"ur-guyz\". =)\n\n===== ABOUT EHRGEIZ =====\n\nEhrgeiz is a 3D fighting game developed by Dream Factory, who are the creators of the Tobal games and the company are a subsidiary of Squaresoft (not sure about now). Namco published the game for the Arcades.\n\nThe game does not use the typical versus fighting game controls, instead it uses a free roaming 360 degree movement system where you can move around the arena, much like the one found in Power Stone and wrestling games. As well as that, there are also changes in elevation in arenas and you can interact with certain objects, most notably the boxes. Breaking the boxes releases power-up type items and even a knife weapon.\n\nInterestingly, there are elements in the game that are based on Tekken... such as the main character Godhand, whose real name is Ken Mishima (no relation apparently lol), having moves from Kazuya, Heihachi, Paul and Baek from Tekken. Also, if you study some of the fighting animations of some of the characters, they are rather Tekken-like... for example some of the jump kicks.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCUle_s-OgQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCUle_s-OgQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCUle_s-OgQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCUle_s-OgQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCUle_s-OgQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ehrgeiz [Arcade] - play as Cloud", "description": "This is a playthrough using Cloud in the Arcade version of Ehrgeiz: God Bless The Ring.
