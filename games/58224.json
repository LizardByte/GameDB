Where do the Arks come from? What are the Cubes? Fans of the original game will find answers to some questions, but others will remain a mystery.\nYou\u2019ll also meet various alien races and get the opportunity to learn more about their people\u2026 If you can master their language, of course.\n\nIn this universe that is so far from your own in distance and in time, a sharp mind and an instinct for survival are your only weapons.
