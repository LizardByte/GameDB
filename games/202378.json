To get Mario out of sight (or maybe for some other reasons?) he warps Mario and his Castle in the Second Reality. Mario's only chance to stop Zycloboo is to find the Power Supply station, which can give him the power he needs for the task - or at least that's what Zycloboo told him, heeheehee!", "summary": "This is the sequel to the \"Second Reality Project\", which is something different from the first part. This game features new GFX, some new custom blocks and custom sprites, a new overworld map and different music. The game contains a lot of ripped GFX from other games like \"Super Mario Land 2 & 3\", \"Sonic 1 & 2\", \"Alfred Chicken\" and much more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 68479, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ffilTZOK47g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffilTZOK47g", "title": "The Second Reality Project 2 \"R\" Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ffilTZOK47g/sddefault.jpg"}]}
