Your goal is to reach the treasure room in the center of the castle, grab as much gold as you dare, and make it safely to the outside. But this task is not an easy one; the castle's passageways are different every game, there are traps to catch the unwary, and a deadly horde of minions is on the prowl. As if all that weren't enough, the treasure chamber is patrolled by the evil wizardess herself.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/castle-chaos--1"}
