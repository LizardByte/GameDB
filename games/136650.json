Different to those titles the game does not offer initial content where the player has to race and earn experience to perform upgrades and additional cars and tracks. Instead, all of the content is available right away and players can race in any mode, class, car and on any circuit immediately. Similar to games like iRacing and Assetto Corsa it offers very detailed customization where players can fine-tune almost any aspect of the cars, but contrary to those two titles there is not only multiplayer racing, but also a full career mode with offline races against AI-controlled opponents. Optionally various assists can be enabled to simplify the gameplay.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-cars-perfect-edition"}
