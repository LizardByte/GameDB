Loki, who was in charge of ordering this murder after knowing the prophecy: the death of Balder would bring the decline of the gods, who would be attacked by a pack of rabid wolves without mercy. And that is precisely what our protagonist must prevent.\n\nThor must destroy a series of eggs, where the components of the wolf litter are developing, which are located in a castle in the distant lands of Vendha, where the children of the devil Surtur guard them jealously.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thor", "videos": [{"id": 72233, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Jf6G_9wXpdY"}]}
