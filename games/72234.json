There are commands for both heavy shots and for light ones, making you choose the strength to hit and throw the ball. There are no power bars and once hit, the ball flies to the opposing side automatically.\n\nThe special moves can be triggered whenever you push certain button combinations (triangle and circle, circle and cross, etc) at the right moment. If it is a defense move, for instance, you must do it in response to others attacks.\n\nThere is a Tournament mode, which is the main solo entertainment (although you can also play single matches vs the AI), but this game is clearly designed around player-vs-player mode, for arcade matches against human opponents.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/v-ball-beach-volley-heroes", "videos": [{"id": 80573, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "ILzAYXr4L_k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILzAYXr4L_k", "title": "V-Ball Beach Volley Heroes PS1 Gameplay HD (DuckStation)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ILzAYXr4L_k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
