Seventeen games in four tears wait for their completion, ranging from boring stuff like \"find the differing image\" or \"choose the right exit from the labyrinth\", to more inventive tasks where the player evades Gozilla's stomping feet or performs magic tricks in form of button combinations. \n \nThe presentation is nothing to write home about. Everything looks distinctively low budget, especially the narrow color range leaves a rather weird impression."}
