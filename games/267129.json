A world where all light has been swallowed up. A world destroyed and fragmented, annihilated by a fatal omnipotence. Everything could have ended there... But there was one last glimmer of hope. One last glimmer. A last, precious, fragment of light. A spark that will awaken the first Photophore...\n\nThis is the story of a new world recomposed. A world recomposed in the form of a challenge, as if a return to normalcy had been a possibility from the very beginning of its alleged destruction. This first Photophore and the luminous fragments scattered throughout the spaces are proof of this.\n\nThe photophore is therefore the only element capable of travelling through this world and finding all the fragments of light. This is certainly a futile task. But I assure you it's going to be so cool!", "summary": "An arcade game that oscillates between shooting, brick-breaking and reflection.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/photophore-chapter-1"}
