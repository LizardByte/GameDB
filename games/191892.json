Using these catalysts, Student Transfer seeks to explore the themes of swapping bodies or minds, possessing other people and gender bending them (or yourself).\n\nThe story is told through the perspective of the main character, using a first person narrative while using a traditional text and sprite-based visual novel model.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}]}
