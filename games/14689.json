And yes, you were right, but you can always fight fire with fire, as the saying goes. Or, more fittingly, fight those artificial monsters with arcane machinery: engulf them with poisonous fumes, scorch them with tongues of flame or deploy mechanical allies and traps and let them do the rest.\n\nVan Helsing: Arcane Mechanic DLC now allows you to play a totally different kind of monster hunter, a specialist class. The Arcane Mechanic is the master of weird devices, deadly gadgets and occult machineries. Monster hunting just got even more exiting with your customizable Chargerpack and the multi-functional Discharger in your hands. Forget the traditional weapons and prepare your custom-made mechanical wonders. Put on your helmet and the protective goggles and show them the power of true Science!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-arcane-mechanic", "collections": [{"id": 873, "name": "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"}]}
