Unfortunately your scheming younger brother, Prince Balnard, through cunning and deception, has insinuated his way into consideration for the throne.\n\nYour father, kind and righteous in his intentions, has been unable to see through Balnard's facade. He cannot think ill of his own child. Being a fair and concerned ruler, your father desperately desires the most honorable and capable successor. Night after night he wrestles with his decision. Which of his children should ascend to the throne?\n\nOne evening, your father summons you and your brother to his private chamber. As you and Balnard enter the room, you notice things are slightly different. Your father has laid out a small table in the center of the room, and on the table are three simple items: a bottle of wine, a loaf of bread and a silver chalice from the castle's fine collection. Your father relates the Last Supper of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n\"Through the years that cup has been lost,\" he says, \"but I am certain that it still exists. It has been said that the person who possesses the Holy Grail will wield great power. Such power, my children, could be used to eliminate suffering and bring joy to Lantavia if wielded by a just and honorable ruler. In the hands of the wrong person, I shudder to think what dread might befall us. I charge you both to go into the world and seek out this Holy Grail. When you have this magical treasure, return to me and claim your position as my heir. For I tell you that the people of this empire deserve only the very best we can give them.\"\n\nYou know full well the evil that awaits the empire should you fail and your brother succeed. You are determined to emerge victorious. Balnard evokes stark terror in the hearts of the people. On the throne he would be a tyrant, and an age of suffering and persecution, the likes of which has never been seen, would befall the empire of Lantavia.\nYears pass by. You search hither and yon. Your trek takes you to Mepalotan. To Rotamia. To the Misty Isles. Always you hear the same story. Yes, the Grail has been here and gone. Always, you find that your wicked stepbrother has been there before you. No matter how fast you travel, no matter how hard you search, he seems to be always one step ahead. Worst of all, your searching thus far has been totally for naught. You have visited every backwater village in the known world. You have talked to peasants and paupers, kings and princes. And still you are no closer to your goal than you were when you left home, lo those many years ago. You now grow impatient, afraid that Balnard may have found what you cannot.\n\nThen one dark night, you hear a plaintive cry for help. With no thought whatsoever for your personal safety, you ride straightaway to answer the call. You find a lone Bishop under attack from a ruthless band of brigands. You draw your trusty sword and rush to the fight. You cut and slash with the strength of justice, and drive the evildoers away.\nBut you suffer terribly in the process. Your gallant white horse dies at your feet, his mighty heart shattered from the exhaustion of this last battle. And your sword, your only means of protection in these hostile lands, lies rent asunder on the dusty ground.\n\nYou attend to the Bishop who suffers from naught more than a badly bruised spirit. The Bishop thanks you profusely and asks what mission brings you to a land so far from the boundaries of civilization. You tell him about your years of struggle, your search for the fabled Holy Grail and how you must find it before your brother does.\n\nThe Bishop lays his hand upon your forehead. His eyes journey skyward and then close. \"I sense in you the goodness of the ages,\" he says when his eyes once again open. \"You have the proper courage and temperament to accomplish your difficult task, if only you persevere. You have saved my life, brave knight. I regret I have little to give you in the way of material rewards, but I can impart to you these words which may prove even more valuable than the coin of the realm:\n\n\"Straight ahead, down this road, lies the Monarchy of Beronia. There, if you have your wits about you, and are stout of heart, you may well find that for which you so earnestly seek. Make haste, brave knight, in the pursuit of your adventure. Act wisely, and be kind to those who would be kind to you. So search with every fiber of your being for the wondrous Holy Grail. You will never have another chance.\"\n\nWith that, the kindly Bishop takes his leave. With the Bishop's words fresh in your memory, you start down the road to the Monarchy of Beronia, unarmed and afoot, but imbued of a much renewed spirit.", "summary": "You have to find the Holy Grail before your evil brother Balnard does in order to prevent a tyrant from ruling over your father's kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-holy-grail", "videos": [{"id": 118686, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rS-VDar-LvU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS-VDar-LvU", "title": "The Holy Grail walkthrough (Apple II - Hayden Software)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rS-VDar-LvU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
