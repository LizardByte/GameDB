From his attack, mankind found and harnessed G-Energy, an energy source taken from Godzilla. 60 years later, Godzilla appears again to feed on the G-Energy. Godzilla progresses through Japan, fighting off Kaiju that are seemingly attracted to him and destroying G-Generators. Mankind takes information on Godzilla, and it is revealed that since Godzilla's first attack, G-Force has been constructing a Godzilla-like robot. Once all the data on Godzilla is collected, the robot is deployed. This can either be Super Mechagodzilla or Kiryu depending on the player's difficulty. Godzilla defeats the robot, and destroys the last two generators. Godzilla then appears to be returning to the sea. However, the energy he absorbs causes him to enter critical mass, and becomes Burning Godzilla. It is theorized that he will explode and destroy the world. The G-Force Operator suggests freezing him, and freeze tanks are sent out. The Super X3 arrives, but is damaged. Soon after, what appears to be another Godzilla appears, but is also defeated. The Gotengo and Super X3 manage to freeze Godzilla, and Kiryu carries him out to sea. They both sink into the ocean, and humanity begins to rebuild.", "summary": "Godzilla is a video game developed by Natsume Atari and published by Bandai Namco games for the PlayStation 3 and 4. It was released on December 18, 2014 in Japan, on July 14, 2015 in North America, and on July 17, 2015 in Europe.\n\nThe Japanese version of the PlayStation 4 Godzilla is titled Godzilla VS and was released on July 16, 2015. Godzilla VS is the exact same game as the PlayStation 4 Godzilla.\n\n\"Godzilla, the King of the Monsters, first appeared in 1954. Scientists studied Godzilla and found that they could harness energy from the monster. Called \u201cG-Energy,\u201d this seemingly endless source of power was used to better the lives of all mankind. 60 years later, just when mankind\u2019s memory of the beast faded, Godzilla appeared again. Godzilla destroyed at will, all in search of more G-Energy. Such irony, the same G-Energy which was used to better the people\u2019s lives, also caused Godzilla to awaken. Can the G-Force, mankind\u2019s last hope, stop Godzilla? What fate awaits Godzilla once he has consumed all of the G-Energy, and grown to his full potential?\n\nBash your way through over 20 stages of mayhem. Explore Mission Mode, Diorama Mode, and King of Monsters Mode! Collect G-Energy in each stage to Power-Up your Godzilla up to 100 Meters tall! Your offensive and defensive prowess will increase with your size.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/godzilla-the-game--1", "videos": [{"id": 3429, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "sy875iT91oE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy875iT91oE", "title": "Godzilla The Game - Godzilla 2014 Vs.
