In digital space, we can abandon the logic of reality and are freed from its boundaries. New worlds with total freedom are possible, worlds only limited by our creativity and the potential of art.\n\nModules will expand to contain Maxim Zhestkov\u2019s entire body of work. Over the course of years, the project will grow as he grows, expanding into new territories and blurring the boundaries between art, games, and reality. With experimentation at its core, it is Zhestkov\u2019s playground, where he is able to refine his work with no end, challenging the limits of his own medium.\n\nFilm by James Medcraft", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5D0nOyH1qQI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5D0nOyH1qQI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5D0nOyH1qQI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5D0nOyH1qQI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5D0nOyH1qQI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Modules by Maxim Zhestkov - Launch film", "description": "Modules is a project by Maxim Zhestkov, where different forms of art \u2013 architecture, sculpture, film, and music \u2013 blend together to create an intense, interactive virtual experience.\n\nA total work of art by Zhestkov, it is a world that questions the established definitions of our reality.
