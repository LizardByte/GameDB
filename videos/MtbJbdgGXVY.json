The game seems to draw some inspiration from Taito's \"Darius\"  games, which is always a plus in my book. The underwater environment, combined with dark colors and ominous enemies, really set the tone of an aquatic horror game. Being developed by doujin soft maker \"Buster\" , the game has slick visuals, detailed enemies, and an excellent soundtrack. You also have three different weapons that all have various uses.\n\nYour \"cannon\" shot is extremely powerful, but it is a single shot and it isn't good for destroying enemy bullets. It's great to use on bosses. Your \"riot\" shot is a widespread shot that sprays bullets. It is good for destroying waves of weak enemies, but it isn't very powerful. Lastly, your \"force\" shot is moderately strong, but it has the shortest range (it is a small explosion generated in the player's hand). It might not seem like it at first, but you will soon realize that the force shot is an outstanding weapon, because it destroys all small enemy projectiles. \n\nIt is important to switch weapons depending on the situation because your ammo is limited. Destroying bullets and enemies gives you weapon power to fight back, and as long as you have at least one \"power\" stock (used for firing weapons), getting hit will generate a barrier around you and protect you from damage. Using weapons in moderation is important, because if you fire too quickly, you won't have any stock, which means getting hit will deal damage to you. You can also run out of weapon power and must resort to attack with small energy needles that have limited range.\n\nLastly, you have an alien creature (that functions like an \"option\" that floats around you. If you have no weapon power, you can change the position of the creature to destroy enemy bullets and gain power to fight back...It's pretty sweet stuff. I recommend that you play the game in fullscreen mode, but if you must play it windowed, you can download a windowed version of the game too (at 320x240 resolution).\n\nYou can find the game at:\n\nhttp://kerubin.web.fc2.com/game.html\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nVisit GS At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MtbJbdgGXVY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MtbJbdgGXVY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MtbJbdgGXVY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Vacant Ark [\u30f4\u30a7\u30a4\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a2\u30fc\u30af] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Original Air Date: January 05, 2010\n\nThe name of the game is Vacant Ark (\u30f4\u30a7\u30a4\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a2\u30fc\u30af) and it puts you in control of a merman with powerful energy attacks.
