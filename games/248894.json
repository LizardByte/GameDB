Tell me, is there someone that you have a crush on?\"\n\nShe couldn't sound more sketchy if she tried.\n\nWhen I decided to ignore her, the girl thrust the notebook angrily toward me.\n\n\"This is the Love Note, you know. The Love Note! With this, you're sure to find romance with any girl you like!\"\n\nApparently, by writing the name of the person you're interested in, the notebook will tell you your current level of \"fatedness\" with said person, as well as what to do in order to raise it.\n\n\"What's more, I'll lend you my assistance too!\"\n\nHowever...\nIf the owner of the Love Note is unable to find the bride of his dreams within 90 days, he will be rendered impotent. Forevermore.\n\n\"So there you have it. Do your best, 'kay?\"\n\nAnd so, with the help of this angel of love, I began putting this so-called Love Note to use in order to fulfill my romantic endeavors.", "summary": "In the midst of leading an ordinary life, I began to feel the urge to find myself a girlfriend.
