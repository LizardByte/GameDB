{"id": "D8XrzdN3Zbg", "snippet": {"title": "Worms Ultimate Mayhem - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "Worms Ultimate Mayhem is an expanded and improved HD remaster of Worms 4: Mayhem, released on Steam, PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) and Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) in 2011. The latter two also saw a physical release as part of Mastertronic's \"Worms Collection\" compilation that also had Worms HD and Worms 2: Armageddon (as well as all of the latter's DLC).\n\nWorms Ultimate Mayhem adds in voice acting for the cutscenes in the Worms 4 story mode, a picture-in-picture display when attacking, many quality of life improvements that fix many issues found on the original version of Worms 4: Mayhem, the campaign mode and levels from Worms 3D, online multiplayer*, HD visuals and more. If you own the Alien Breed Trilogy and Worms Reloaded (or 2: Armageddon, if on console), you would get exclusive, bonus maps and customization items.\n\nThe game also launched three DLCs along the way. Single Player DLC (which is free on Steam) adds six new challenges, new achievements and a new map. The Multi-Player Pack DLC adds six new achievements and five new multiplayer maps. Finally, there's the Customization Pack DLC, which includes a number of crazy new hats, glasses, gloves, 5 new speech-banks and 5 new gravestones. The \u201cCustomization Pack\u201d also includes 5 new weapon payloads for the Weapons Factory.\n\nWorms Ultimate Mayhem (C) Team17\nSteam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/70600/Worms_Ultimate_Mayhem/\nGOG page: https://www.gog.com/en/game/worms_ultimate_mayhem_deluxe_edition\nAvailable on PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\n*Online Multiplayer not available on the GOG release of the Deluxe Edition\n\n#worms #wormsteam17 #worms4 #worms3d #worms4mayhem #wormsultimatemayhem #steam #steamgames #steamgame #team17", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8XrzdN3Zbg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8XrzdN3Zbg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8XrzdN3Zbg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8XrzdN3Zbg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8XrzdN3Zbg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Worms Ultimate Mayhem - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "Worms Ultimate Mayhem is an expanded and improved HD remaster of Worms 4: Mayhem, released on Steam, PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) and Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) in 2011.
