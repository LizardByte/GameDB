Rotate the cow to give her flight direction. Use the milk jet to move faster, fly higher, push physical objects, overcome various obstacles and defeat enemies with plungers (they are very cute and very fierce. Did I mention that they have a plunger?)\nCollect all the coins and play on the special toy machine with toy cows. Unlock new cows and build your own special collection of cows. You could also win one of the very rare cows, with a unique jet (yes, there are cows that have more than just milk pouring out of them. It's amazing, isn't it?)"}
