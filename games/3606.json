Older vehicles (primarily those regarded even today as classics) are retrofitted with futuristic engine and turbo technology, in addition to jets mounted to allow the car to perform midair stunts. These stunts, including flips, barrel rolls, etc., allow the player to accumulate cash rewards during races on levitating tracks. Money accumulated is used to purchase new cars, as well as upgraded parts for cars (This increases the value of the vehicle. Oddly enough, this feature is relatively useless because vehicles can't be sold.)", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
