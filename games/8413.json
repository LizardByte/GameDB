The gamer plays a human escaping entrapment by Terminators. After escaping hostile enemy territory in the first mission, the player meets with John Connor, the leader of the Resistance. From that point on, one plays as a Resistance fighter. Skynet's uprising in 1990 has left most of humanity dead, with control in Skynet's hands. All around is death and decay, scattered with remnants of a past society shattered.\n\nFuture Shock is played in the first person perspective at all times. Each level in the game requires the player to solve a number of objectives before continuing to the next level, while fighting enemy robots with a wide variety of guns and grenades. Another obstacle in each level is the harsh terrain, as many areas contain too much radiation for the player character to remain alive. The terrain is navigated in three ways, 'on foot', in a jeep with a mounted cannon, or in an Aerial Hunter-Killer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-terminator-future-shock", "collections": [{"id": 4129, "name": "Terminator"}]}
