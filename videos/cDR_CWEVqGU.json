{"id": "cDR_CWEVqGU", "snippet": {"title": "Jump Tracks - Gameplay Trailer", "description": "*Coming July 25th on Steam!* https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490690/Jump_Tracks/\n\n--------------------\n\nAction! Danger! Coins! What more could you want from a game?! Jump Tracks is a game all about timing and reflexes. Zoom off the tracks, clear each level, and try not to die along the way in this tiny and twitchy arcade tapper. It's harder than it looks! You'll need precision and laser focus to become a Jump Tracks pro... good luck!\n\nJump Tracks is pure skill based fun! Each level challenges you to collect all the coins by jumping at the right times. Sounds easy! But miss a jump and you'll be sent careening into a spike wall or off the level entirely. Deceptively simple yet hard to master, this is the perfect game for quick bursts of actiony goodness or pass-and-play fun with friends!\n\n*Features:*\n* 42 levels across 7 worlds.\n* One-button gameplay controls - fun for all ages!\n* Bonus level goals: number of jumps & time.\n* Play with mouse, keyboard, or gamepad.\n* A simple, fun, and small game! Who's got time for story or complicated controls?!\n* Short and sweet! Play through in a single sitting if you're quick enough!\n\nAre you ready for the challenge?\n\n*A note from the developer:*\nI had so much fun making Jump Tracks! I hope you enjoy it too!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDR_CWEVqGU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDR_CWEVqGU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDR_CWEVqGU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDR_CWEVqGU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cDR_CWEVqGU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jump Tracks - Gameplay Trailer", "description": "*Coming July 25th on Steam!* https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490690/Jump_Tracks/\n\n--------------------\n\nAction!
