The young soccer players Leon, Vanessa, Maxi and Raban are practising in the woods - but suddenly Leon disappears. Of course his friends search for him and suddenly arrive in the land of vampires...\n\nThe player alternately takes the control of the four protagonists and solves item based puzzles. To do so he explores his surroundings, takes everything he finds, talks with people and combines items with each other. In each scene the player can instantly switch between day and night which alters the persons he meet and the items he can interact with. When stuck the player has access to a hint system.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dwk-5-hinter-dem-horizont"}
