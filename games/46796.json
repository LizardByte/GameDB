After gaining leadership of his automobile factory from him, the brothers' skills became renowned throughout the country. Eventually, the Federation approached the brothers with an extremely profitable contract to help produce military vehicles for it. The Wayne brothers accepted the contract and created weapons without peer.\n\nA short time later, the skies turned dark with the Federation's encroaching airfleet, and towns and cities everywhere were ravaged by these armies\u2014including Brian and Jason's home town. To their horror, the Federation was using the weapons and vehicles they themselves had designed to reshape the land to their pitiless will. Taking up planes whose designs had never been submitted to the Federation, the Wayne brothers prepare to destroy the Federation's mad scheme. They are aided by the four heroes from Mahou Daisakusen.", "summary": "Battle Garegga is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up arcade game. The storyline takes place in a sort of diesel punk versions of the 1940s. Main heroes are brothers Brian and Jason \u2014 the sons of genius designer who want to destroy the evil Federation. Players control planes (4 air crafts to choose), fly forward, collect items and shoot to enemies. Unlike in most other scrolling shooter games, where bullets are brightly colored to distinguish from the background, bullets are realistically colored, making it difficult for players to see them. As a bonus, by entering a code, you can unlock four of the characters from Mahou Daisakusen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-garegga", "videos": [{"id": 31357, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "qZfNrJXTeCA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZfNrJXTeCA", "title": "Battle Garegga / \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ac\u30ec\u30c3\u30ac - Sega Saturn - Unlockable Superplay 1CC video RGB [HD 1080p 60fps]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZfNrJXTeCA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 92813, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TfgYq6qQy7M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfgYq6qQy7M", "title": "Battle Garegga (Europe / USA / Japan / Asia) (Sat Feb 3 1996) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TfgYq6qQy7M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
