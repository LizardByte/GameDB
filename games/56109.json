Games are quick, allowing for rapid experimentation, iteration, and advancement. \nCunning and creativity are rewarded as you chain upgrade modules for powerful synergies. \nAccess over 120 modular upgrades as you progress and expand your arsenal. \n \nBuild to play how you want. Snipe, command a drone army, discharge your shields, charge up, burn enemies with your thrusters, or smash right through them... there's a way to make it work. \nUnlock various challenge modes, providing greater risk and rewards. The stakes are high, as death is permanent! \nEvery game is randomly generated, keeping the fight intense and unpredictable. Fight through the campaign or play endlessly... \n \n \nNova Drift is a living game.
