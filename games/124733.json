In a month-long struggle than began at Gazala, Rommel had defeated the 8th Army and driven the British back to Egypt, once again surrounding Tobruk, a prize that eluded him the previous year. Then in a surprise move, he doubled back, and captured Tobruk in a single day before turning his Panzer Army once again toward Alexandria, Cairo and the Nile. But the British would deny him the ultimate prize with a heroic stand at a lonely, unheard of railway stop known as El Alamein.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/panzer-campaigns-el-alamein-42-gold"}
