It is the first Tiger-based LCD game to use the rectangular-shaped 3rd generation casing. The game features two flipper buttons (with the left one doubling as a ball launcher) and looks to have been a standard pinball game. It also contains four function buttons on the center of the console that turn off the system, toggle sound effects, displays the high score, and turns on the system and starts the game. The background of the game features a level similar to the Machine in its 16-bit counterpart.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball--1"}
