She takes matters into her own hands, and made her way to the southern shores of Donkey Kong Island, to the Northern Kremisphere, a Canadian and northern European-inspired landmass. There she meets Wrinkly Kong, and Wrinkly confirmed that the Kongs had passed by. Dixie then makes her way to Funky's Rentals. Funky suggests her to take her baby cousin Kiddy Kong along with her in the search. Funky lends them a boat and the two venture off to find Donkey and Diddy Kong.", "summary": "Donkey Kong Country 3 is the Game Boy Advance version of the SNES game \"Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!\".
