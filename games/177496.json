But if you're curious, this is about showing the frustation of not being able to fully verbalize feelings. Sometimes saying \"I'm not feeling ok\" can be very hard.\n\n\"How are you?\" is a simple question that can help people in dire situations. Keep in mind that, though asking it is a great gesture, the other part might not feel up for it. Never push people if they don't open up. It's a casual question and you can ask it again some other time.\n\nWe need to forget about mental health stigmas and remember that the most important thing is to check on those close to us.", "summary": "Saying some things can be very hard."}
