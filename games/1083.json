The game allows the player to pilot one of a selection of craft in races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player can pick up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wipeout", "videos": [{"id": 14038, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GRKWc6XxiXk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRKWc6XxiXk", "title": "wipeout trailer - 1995, pc.avi", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GRKWc6XxiXk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
