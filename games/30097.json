What sets this game apart from other games is its unique environment/setting, the action based power up that is both offensive and defensive, the strategic and athletic game play that arises from the variety of enemy abilities, the fluid energy system, and the engaging upgrade system. There's also an infinite wave Endurance mode to see how deep into your subconscious you can go. And who knows, maybe you'll learn something about your own shadow.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
