However, the crew managed to activate the ruins' defense system.\n\nThe system operated by identifying the Sol system as the intruders' origin, then launched the Sun-Fish (\"Manbou\" being Japanese for \"Sunfish\"), an ultimate weapon bio-mechanical starship capable of destroying an entire solar system and protected by an impregnable force-field bubble. The surviving members of the crew, however, find a chance to stop the Sun-Fish. By using an unearthed Manbou-J (i.e. Junior Sun-Fish) fighter and activating a teleportation system in the deepest part of the ruins, one pilot, Cleaver Mule, can actually get inside the force bubble and destroy the Sun-Fish from there.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-manbow"}
