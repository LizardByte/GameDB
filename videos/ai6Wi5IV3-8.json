Explore a vast procedurally generated galaxy in which the narrative is directed entirely by you, the players. In Infinite Fleet, you are a commander within the United Sol Federation Combined Fleet, a military organization tasked with defeating the merciless Atrox alien threat. Change the entire destiny of humanity by building and customizing your fleet, securing territory, traversing the deep recesses of space, and joining forces with your friends to turn the tide of the war.\n\n\u201cDearest Mila\u201d has been made entirely with in-game assets, using the Unity game engine. So, the visual effects of this trailer should closely resemble the final game product. Infinite Fleet is the future of real-time strategy games. We are blending traditional RTS mechanics with an innovative new approach that will revitalize this fantastic genre. Our team is led by industry veterans hailing from AAA studios such as Relic, Blizzard, CCP, Ubisoft, Bethesda, and more.\n\nLet us know what you think about the trailer in the comments section on YouTube, share it on your favorite social media platforms, and most importantly, subscribe to our channel!\n\n\ud83d\ude80Stay tuned on Infinite Fleet's latest development: https://www.infinitefleet.com/newsletter\n\nOr follow us on:\n\n\ud83d\udc26Twitter: https://twitter.com/infinitefleet\n\ud83c\udf10Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/infinitefleet\n\ud83d\udcf7Instagram: https://instagram.com/infinitefleetgame\n\ud83d\ude4aDiscord: http://discord.gg/NVr3vhj\n\ud83e\udd16Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteFleet/\n\ud83d\udc8cTelegram: https://t.me/infinitefleet", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ai6Wi5IV3-8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ai6Wi5IV3-8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ai6Wi5IV3-8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ai6Wi5IV3-8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ai6Wi5IV3-8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Infinite Fleet - Dearest Mila Trailer", "description": "Pixelmatic releases the much anticipated first official trailer for Infinite Fleet, \u201cDearest Mila.\u201d\n\nInfinite Fleet is an epic sci-fi massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game.
