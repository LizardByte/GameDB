When he is not working on DEEP, a virtual reality game he designed, he heads the studio of the award winning bitSmith Games and teaches in DIT's new BA programme in Game Design. He has spoken all over Ireland and Europe on game design, community building and production. His mission is to bring about an increased awareness of the value of playfulness in everyday life.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
