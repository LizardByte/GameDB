Hope y'all will like your visit in the Lone Star State, Texas. This place ain't full of cowboys anymore but the spirit lives on, especially in ranches you can find all 'round. We also got a lot of cattle and other livestock so your truckin' adventures will be lively.\n\nWe also love music. Like, really love music. Just look at Austin, the live music capital of the world. Party on. Look plumb over yonder and you'll see the city which got the message about the problem. Sure'nuff, we're talking about Houston. So enjoy the drive.\n\nGet your lasso ready and catch all the news by hittin' the follow button and wishlisting Texas.
