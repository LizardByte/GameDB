{"id": "K8ip8frzPZc", "snippet": {"title": "The Addams Family (TurboGrafx CD) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of NEC's 1991 TurboGrafx CD license-based platformer, The Addams Family.\n\nThe TG16's take on the The Addams Family is totally different from the slew of games Ocean dumped on the other consoles at the time. It follows a similar layout and structure (explore the creepy house to find things needed to progress) to Ocean's games, but it is not a hop-and-bop style game like those on the Nintendo systems. Rather, it's more a (tame) run-and-gun style game that follows the star-studded 1991 movie featuring Raul Julia, Angelica Houston, Christopher Lloyd, and Christina Ricci. Oh, and the dad from Clueless/captain from Alien: Resurrection, but I don't remember his name. \n\nIt's also a bit odd, or at the very least a novelty, since you don't play Gomez Addams in this one - you actually play Tully Alford, the villain lawyer from the movie. Weird twist, huh? Every weirder, you can get a potion from Puggsley's chemistry set that makes you a werewolf. \n\nSomething that you might not expect from this early CD title is that it was developed by ICOM. ICOM Simluations became famous in the 80s for their MacVenture line of graphic adventures (Shadowgate, Deja Vu, Uninvited), and their popularity grew in the 90s with the classic FMV Sherlock Holmes games (of which the first two appeared on the Turbo and Sega CD) and the excellent Beyond Shadowgate, another TGCD exclusive.\n\nThe platformer genre was one that the company didn't have much experience with before, and it shows in this title. Don't get me wrong - it's certainly not bad - but it's awkward and commits a number of faux pas that probably resulted from inexperience - enemies that hit you the instant you walk through a door way, narrow platform jumping with slippery controls, doors that lead straight back to the beginning and random hazards that attack without any prior warning are among the biggest offenders. They don't ruin the game - they can all be handled by a bit of memorization - but they do bring it down a bit. \n\nThe Addams Family does look and sound quite good. The full-screen digitized movie photos look great, the spritework is full of cool little details (anyone notice the flying NES that attacks you in Wednesday's room?), and the backgrounds all evoke an appropriately creepy mood. The music and sound design is also pretty good - the intro and the credits play the full television show theme song (which has been cut out in this video to avoid copyright issues), and there's plenty of sampled atmospheric noise and music playing in the background over the course of the game. It's fairly low-quality in its playback since it's not Redbook audio, but for 1991, it's pretty good. \n\nOverall, I like The Addams Family quite a bit. If you're familiar with the other games sharing its name, this is a much stronger game than the NES title, and probably a hair shy of matching the SNES and Genesis versions. Either way, whether you're a TurboGrafx 16 fan looking for a solid and fairly obscure platformer, or a fan of creepy and kooky TV family, there's a fair amount to like here. I enjoyed it thoroughly. \n\n__\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8ip8frzPZc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8ip8frzPZc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8ip8frzPZc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K8ip8frzPZc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "The Addams Family (TurboGrafx CD) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of NEC's 1991 TurboGrafx CD license-based platformer, The Addams Family.\n\nThe TG16's take on the The Addams Family is totally different from the slew of games Ocean dumped on the other consoles at the time.
