While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen. The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-star-sweep", "videos": [{"id": 138710, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GRGZdm9WRJE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRGZdm9WRJE", "title": "StarSweep ...
