In doing so, the player can hire up to three customizable bodyguards to accompany the main character. It is possible to take control of any of these characters at any time in the game. More bodyguards can be created and can be switched in and out of the party.\n\nIn the main town there is also a Quest Shoppe where only one character can enter and complete various tasks to gain money and rare materials to create new equipment.", "summary": "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time is an installment in the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series.
