Get exclusive content, and maybe win cool stuff!\n\nIf you've read the book, then you know that Gordon Edgley dies. If you haven't read it, then we've just totally spoiled it for you. Only kidding - he dies quite early on, and there are lots of exciting things that happen after that. You should get on with reading it, really, instead of wasting your time with this boring page where all you can do is have a chance to win really cool stuff.\n\nIf you have read the book and you know that Gordon Edgley dies then you also know that he leaves Skulduggery a coded message to help him find the Sceptre of the Ancients.\n\nBut here's the thing: Gordon Edgley didn't leave just one code, he left several secret codes for Skulduggery and Stephanie. Your quest will be to discover all the secret codes, enabling you to unlock FREE and EXCLUSIVE content on the Skulduggery Website. We're making the first code really easy; it's DARK (see, we said it was easy).", "summary": "The Quest was the first video game released on the Skulduggery Pleasant Website.
