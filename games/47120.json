The line of golf games was a flagship brand for Access, and the series spanned several years: from 1990 to 2003. Several versions of the game and expansion packs (containing new courses[1] and golfers[2] mainly) were created for the Mac and PC over the years. A version for the Xbox named Links 2004 was released in November 2003. In 1991, Links won Computer Gaming World's 1991 Action Game of the Year award.\n\nIn 2004, Microsoft sold the Salt Lake City studio to Take-Two Interactive, where it was renamed Indie Built. Indie Built was subsequently shut down in 2006. It is therefore unlikely that Take-Two will produce any additional versions of Links.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/links-ls-2000", "collections": [{"id": 190, "name": "Links"}]}
