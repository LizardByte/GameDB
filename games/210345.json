Despite his training efforts, all Star Man has really learned is how to walk; other than that he functions exactly as he does in Mega Man 5. In order to attack you must create a shield while on the ground and then fire it while in the air. With practice this can be a surprisingly effective attack method, while also working good for defense.", "videos": [{"id": 72278, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ihKp7iDTw-s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihKp7iDTw-s", "title": "Mega Man Fan Game - Star Man Upgraded - Casual Playthrough Part 1/3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ihKp7iDTw-s/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
