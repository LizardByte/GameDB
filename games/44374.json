TI's offering, Blackjack & Poker, allows you to play Blackjack or Stud Poker against the computer, or with up to three other players. The Blackjack game has most of the features of real Blackjack, except for the \"split\" option. The Stud Poker game pits you against three other players (human, computer or both), and follows the rules for 5-Card Stud. \n \nWill you break the bank, or lose your shirt? Only Lady Luck knows for sure!"}
