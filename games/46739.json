The rest of humanity had to flee underground and one sole hero, the vindicator, goes out on his quest to kill the Dark Overlord.\n\nThe game has three distinctive parts: the first is set in an underground complex where blueprints containing a way to destroy the aliens have to be found. To do so the vindicator has to navigate a maze, find keycards, kill aliens in the way and finally solve an anagram puzzle. After that stands a long way towards the alien base which plays out as a vertically scrolling shooter section. Here the player takes control over a plane or - after a life loss - a jeep with a regular weapon with unlimited ammo and a special weapon (bombs or grenades) for larger enemies. Inside the base the vindicator has to navigate side-scrolling platforms while using lifts and trap doors and shooting a lot of opposition.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vindicator"}
