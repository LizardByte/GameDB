Now DID are about to bring you F22 ADF - a \nsimulation of America's next-generation combat aircraft that is \nset to raise the standards yet again.\n\nF22 ADF is the most comprehensive F22 simulation ever created - \nnothing else comes close! With full wingmen control, you're \nnever alone in F22 ADF. What's more, you can escape from the \nconfines of your cockpit into the E3 Sentry airborne warning \nand command aircraft (AWACS). \n\nWith F22 ADF, there are more ways to play; more ways to win.
