Now the friends have only one thing to do: to escape. And their faithful \u201cbumer\u201d - the only hope for salvation. To stay alive in the criminal world, the friends need to find the leader and get to him.", "summary": "Bumer: Sorvannye bashni is an arcade first-person shooter with racing elements. It is based on the Russian movie Bumer, but as a free interpretation. The gameplay consists of racing, gang chases and gunfights. Racing levels are similar to sprint races from the Need for Speed series. The player races point-to-point tracks and needs to finish before an opponent.\n\nChases in Bumer consist of racing and shooting elements. AI-controlled passengers of the character's car kill enemies to defend the car. For every killed enemy the player receives new weapons. These include assault rifles - AK-47 and AKSU, Makarov and Tokarev pistols, double-barreled and sawed-off shotguns, grenades. Temporary bonuses are also provided, such as invisibility, health regeneration, faster speed, slow motion, full ammunition, radioactivity and others.\n\nThe gameplay of the last two levels is pure first-person shooting: you kill enemies, take the bonuses and weapons for every killed enemy and complete objectives such as placing the bomb, killing a boss, and defending against enemies.\n\nAn additional game mode called 'Sorvannye bashni' is a survival level where you need to defend against waves of enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bumer-sorvannye-bashni"}
