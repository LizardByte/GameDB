For the first time, you will have the chance to master the challenges of daily traffic in the cockpit of double-decker and electric buses.\n\nGet ready for the brand-new, impressive US map Angel Shores and a revamped version of the European Seaside Valley map from the previous game installment \u2013 including its map extension. The even greater open-world approach of Bus Simulator 21 means that you will get to experience the exciting daily life of a bus driver in two massive, freely explorable cities, including industrial and outlying districts, a vibrant Chinatown district, a promenade, the surrounding hilly countryside, and the business park. Different difficulty levels and play modes are also available for a wide range of player types.\nIn Bus Simulator 21, you will not only become a capable driver with countless miles on the road \u2013 you also have the option to use extended management elements. Creating detailed timetables, buying and selling buses, and planning efficient routes that take into account the daily number of passengers at peak hours \u2013 these and more varied tasks are available for you to enjoy.\n\nDo you prefer getting up from behind the desk and taking steering your buses into your own hands? No problem! The auto-features of Bus Simulator 21 can take over your management duties and let pure bus drivers simply enjoy their time on the road.\n\nPlus, the revised traffic and pedestrian AI, improved graphics, and a dynamic day-night cycle tightly linked to the peak hours system as well as different weather conditions ensure an even more immersive bus driving experience.\n\nPlay in either single-player or synced multiplayer mode, transport your passengers safely and promptly to their destinations and be rewarded for your timely and safe driving at the end of pay day.\n\nFreely usable convenience features, such as quickly jumping to desired stops on the map (fast travel), fast forwarding time, and directly taking over the routes of your NPC buses, all complete the virtual bus driver package and guarantee even more fun behind the wheel!", "summary": "Experience the daily life of a bus driver in two open world cities either in the USA or Europe.
