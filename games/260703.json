Now coming to VR.\n\nExplore an infinite number of ever-changing new lands, expand your settlements from sprawling villages to vast cities and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere.\n\nIn Islanders: VR Edition, you begin with a blank canvas and a small set of minimalist buildings. Your goal is to populate and enrich each island with your creations, unlocking new buildings as you go by achieving a maximum score. Points are earned by carefully placing each building, being mindful of their surroundings like providing clear access to natural resources and making sure entry isn\u2019t blocked.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can travel to a new land, exploring Islanders\u2019 stunning new environments along the way, while building bigger, more expansive structures. The more you build, the higher your score will be and the grander city you\u2019ll be able to gaze upon before starting all over again for just one more round.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/islanders-vr-edition"}
