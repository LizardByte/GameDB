To fight him, beat the game then access the Battle Simulator back at the station.

Use a combination of Malenz's \"Quick Repair\" and Mirad's \"Revive\" to keep the team alive, while using Bio-Beta's \"Duplicity\" to increase your dodge chance. He is immune to slow and stun, and you can't hack his stats, so just focus on dodging and reviving. Proto-Wall can deflect the hits, and using Blindness will work for a few seconds which is just enough to dodge one hit.\n\nAlso, keeping the minigames active is important to provide a steady stream of bar refills. Set the minigames to provide speed and attack power, since defense and life refills will be useless.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VSAoggVnbb4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VSAoggVnbb4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VSAoggVnbb4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VSAoggVnbb4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "The Desolate Hope- Secret Boss", "description": "This is the fight against the secret boss in The Desolate Hope.
