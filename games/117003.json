Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter's first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action-adventure title. The game is organized into distinct days and nights: days mostly consist of lessons where usually Harry will learn new spells, but the more interesting stuff happens at night when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons and other important scenes from the film and book. Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.", "videos": [{"id": 53647, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NomMjme9DL8"}]}
