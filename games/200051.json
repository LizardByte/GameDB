To achieve this, you will need to place tiles such as houses, trees, farms, animals, and much more! Each tile you position is unique in its characteristics and will be scored accordingly. You'll also create roads, rivers, fences, and more to connect all your tiles together in a meaningful way.\nHowever, your task is not as simple as it sounds. You have limited control over which tiles you can place where. Each round will feel like a new challenge, so you'll have to plan ahead to succeed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/square-valley"}
