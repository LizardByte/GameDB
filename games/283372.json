If you were a good person in life, you will go to heaven, otherwise you will pay for your actions in hell.\n\nIn this world that is a mixture of past, present and future, souls await their destiny, whether good or bad. But there is a soul who denied his destiny, and wants to leave this world before he is judged for the actions he committed in life.\n\nAnd now the world of souls is in great danger, as is the world of the living, as an ancient evil that was once banished wants to return to life.", "summary": "Memories Of Mana is a fangame created using RPG Maker XP by Moghunter. The game features graphics from Square Enix's Seiken Densetsu 3 series. This was not only Moghunter's first but perhaps also his only completed game.
