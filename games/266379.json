In this game many things are not what you'd expect and the goal of each level is counter-intuitive: you need to die.\n\nEach stage presents a new challenge. There are several objects you can use to solve puzzles, and in later levels the game will even break it's own rules to surprise you.\n\n50 clever levels and a boss fight at the end. We hope you have fun (killing yourself)!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/karoshi-suicide-salaryman"}
