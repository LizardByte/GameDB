Gil, here. Your average 20-something with few career prospects. Ya know, when I applied for this job at Spotless Services LLC, I thought it would be like any other after-hours cleaning gig. Quiet, simple, gross at times, sure, but at the end of the shift I go home to veg-out and not think about work until my next clock-in.\n\nI was so wrong.\n\nThis ain\u2019t no ordinary gig. The boss lady, Nat, managed to procure contracts for some of the sketchiest places around town. The clients are total weirdos, and they leave these sites filthy. Like, dustbunnies-hopping-right-at-your-face, filthy. At this point, I\u2019m happy to make it out of a shift with all of my fingers attached. And then I spend all my time off anxiously preparing for the next shift, hoping to do just a little better. I guess working for Spotless does have some benefits though\u2026", "summary": "Clean, Clash, and Collect across the crummiest corners of this Single-Player Rogue-Lite.
