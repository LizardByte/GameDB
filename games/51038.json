The Cages Pro-Style Batting Practice is also compatible with Wii Motion Plus giving players an even more realistic experience! \n \nCustomize your experience by editing your batters and pitchers to give them real-world physics including left vs. right hand, stance, height, weight and more. A natural learning curve allows players to develop their skills and take on up to four other players for an in-game homerun challenge! Behind all of this fun is a fitness element that tracks your cardiovascular progress by reporting on calories burned while players are obtaining their hitting goals. In addition, the use of the Wii's motion controller helps players develop their hand/eye coordination skills.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-cages-pro-style-batting-practice"}
