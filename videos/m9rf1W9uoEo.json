{"id": "m9rf1W9uoEo", "snippet": {"title": "STRAYLIGHT VR Game Announcement Trailer", "description": "COMING JANUARY 31, 2023! ON ALL THE VR THINGS!\n\nSTRAYLIGHT is a new VR game that uses the revolutionary Fling Engine, allowing you to swing, soar, and fling yourself around the cosmos in a completely comfortable way.  Designed from the ground up for comfortable movement even for those new to VR, grappling and flinging yourself around should cause no more discomfort than standing-in-place VR experiences. Fly through beautiful and deadly cosmic playgrounds, all to a completely original score composed by Rob '88bit' Kovacs. It isn't all freedom, however; you will need to navigate increasingly diabolical obstacles to reach the end of each stage. Though the gameplay is simple at its core, it is endlessly replayable as you try to nail that perfect, beautiful run. STRAYLIGHT encourages you to swing too fast, soar too high, and die WAY too much. Can you master the STRAYLIGHT?\n\nWebsite: https://www.drbloc.com/\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1215000/STRAYLIGHT/\nMeta AppLab: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4131312370236664/\nSideQuest: https://sidequestvr.com/app/11601/straylight\nPlaystation Store: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003076/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dr_bloc\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbloc/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gaming/drblocgames\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/cXj5pQz", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m9rf1W9uoEo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m9rf1W9uoEo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m9rf1W9uoEo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m9rf1W9uoEo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m9rf1W9uoEo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "STRAYLIGHT VR Game Announcement Trailer", "description": "COMING JANUARY 31, 2023!
