Now most of the planet surrounded by rocks. \nFloating in the air dust from the destroyed buildings. The mechanoids themselves become covered with stone chips. \nAnd they began to build their structures, which are called hives. Hives transform the earth into a more useful resource for mechanoid - stone. \nWith which they build their world. \n \nBut not all the people died.
