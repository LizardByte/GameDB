Fortunately, he makes new friends...including a girl named Keiko. The story is mostly lighthearted with a tragic element, but is mostly considered a part of the Iyashikei genre. It is also linear, so could be more aptly referred to as a kinetic novel. There are 20 characters with Japanese voice acting and multiple expressions, along with spectacular backgrounds and a custom soundtrack.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/keiko-everlasting"}
