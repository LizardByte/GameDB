Players take the role of Martin \"Marty\" Michael\nHall, an average high-school student who has just been granted an incredible power.\nThis power leads him to attract the ire of the world's most notorious villain, Commander\nHood.\n\nTech Specs:\n\n    Episodic Gameplay: The story and gameplay of Saturday Morning RPG takes\n    place across several episodes, each of which tells a complete self-contained story.\n    Players can play any episode in any order, at any time! All of your stats and items\n    carry between episodes. It's a unique spin on the tried and true New Game Plus\n    mode. On top of that, small decisions made in some episodes will carry forth into\n    others -- adding a layer of replay to each episode.\n\n    Active Turn-Based Combat: Saturday Morning RPG draws quite a bit of\n    inspiration of games like Nintendo's Paper Mario series. Battles in the game are\n    turn-based, but the player is always participating by actively defending against\n    attacks and completing reflex tests to power up their own assaults.\n\n    Defeat Enemies With Regular Stuff: Marty fights all his battles in the game\n    by channeling magic through everyday objects. Use a pack of striped gum to\n    summon rainbow zebras that trample your foes -- or call upon a transforming\n    action figure to morph you into a semi-truck!\n\n    Nostalgia Fueled Everything: Everything in Saturday Morning RPG centers on\n    nostalgia. Marty receives his magical abilities thanks to a certain kind of garish\n    plastic notebook, he can equip scratch 'n sniff stickers to get statistical boosts, and\n    he'll traverse worlds inspired by the entire gamut of Saturday morning cartoons.\n\n    Endless Battle Mode: Take on wave after wave of enemies in an endless survival\n    mode where resource management becomes everything!\n\n    Quests: Each episode of the game features several optional side-quests that the\n    player can complete to earn extra items and experience.\n\n    Radical Soundtrack: Saturday Morning RPG features a full soundtrack from\n    legendary composers Vince DiCola (Rocky IV, Transformers: The Movie) and\n    Kenny Meriedeth (contributor for Duck Tales, Power Rangers, X-Men, and\n    more).\n\n    Built For PC: The version of Saturday Morning RPG that hits Steam will\n    embrace the platform completely! Players can pick between three control\n    methods: keyboard, mouse, or controller (or a combination of any of those).\n    We've built the controls to be intuitive for each choice -- everything from the\n    touch screen version of the game will be completely controllable through any\n    of those methods.
