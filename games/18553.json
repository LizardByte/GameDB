You have to jump from one lily pad to the other and try to catch the insects which fly across the pond with your tongue. In doing that you have to be carfeul not to fall into the water since getting back to your lily pad will cost you valuable time. The frog who has caught the most insects after a three minute time limit has won the game. A nice touch is the changing of the times of day from morning through midday and afternoon to night time which makes it harder to see the oncoming insects.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frog-bog", "videos": [{"id": 49193, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TnjC03Tsg1c"}, {"id": 54178, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gPxZsW7lslY"}]}
