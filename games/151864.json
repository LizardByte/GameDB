Not exactly like that because Eve lives there, a sweet lady who has lived alone since the death of her husband with only the company of a white-furred cat.\nAfter explaining what happened, Eve graciously agrees to let them stay until the storm subsides. Neither Marth nor Kira wanted to stay the night, but the weather conditions will force them to stay overnight.\n\nThe minutes pass and the rain does not stop. Lightning strikes the roof and Kira wakes up startled. But where is Marth? And what are those strange noises behind the walls?\n\nHelp Kira find Marth and find out what's going on in the house.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lullaby", "videos": [{"id": 50308, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iA-lQynpNYY"}]}
