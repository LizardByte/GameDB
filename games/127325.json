Wage war in action packed, 6 vs. 6 strategic warfare, as you fight to control the battlefield, and destroy the opposing Elder. Choose from an array of classes, each with their own unique abilities, discovering and mastering the potential they wield.\n\nEach Myth has an exclusive set of skills and abilities they can command to help them control the battlefield in their own unique way. Passive abilities, Primary and Secondary attacks, three unique active abilities, and a powerful Ultimate ability that can help turn the tide for your team at any moment.\n\nThe path to victory is simple. Push with your allies and destroy the enemy's Elder; the heart of the enemy team's defenses. This task however, will be one of possible peril if not careful. Disperse your forces across three distinct lanes, maximizing the efficiency of your team combination. Allied minions will march from your base, and it is your mission to escort them down each lane through the enemy forces. Standing in your way across the Ether's expansive map will be many obstacles; objectives to control, neutral monsters to tame, and enemy minions and Myths to slay. The journey to glory and honor will assuredly not come easily.", "summary": "In Ethereal: Clash of Souls, players clash as 2 teams of 6 on Elysium, an enormous three-lane map with a dense and dangerous jungle. Myths must guide their minions down the lanes, leading them on the path to destroy the towers and lane spire that guard each path to the enemy team's Elder. The vast jungle contains many monsters for the Myths to defeat for valuable experience and rewards. As the game progresses, Elysium's dangerous Guardian Drakes will appear throughout the jungle, offering potentially powerful rewards. Atropos, the most powerful and lethal neutral objective is an epic behemoth with three different evolutions, offering the most game-changing rewards for the team who can defeat him.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ethereal-clash-of-souls", "videos": [{"id": 62320, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "dGqwnohV0hg"}, {"id": 62321, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "1hSV6-PWibo"}]}
