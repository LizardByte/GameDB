Numerous dreadful monsters infested the forest around the city of Brann and high walls could no longer protect residents from the attacks. The menacing army of the neighbouring kingdom suddenly landed on the outskirts of the city, wreaking havoc. There is no hope for salvation \u2014 the strength of the defenders is running low, but the King and his loyal Champions had vanished. \n \nSeries of sudden events and odd coincidences force people to act. Get acquainted with each of the heroes and unite them \u2014 entirely different, sometimes bizarre and frightening, with their motives, but one purpose for all \u2014 to find out the real causes of what happened to them. \n \nLead the group of the adventurers on a journey and explore a varied and intricate world, meet new characters and reveal plot-related secrets. Remember, beauty is deceptive \u2014 danger lurks everywhere. Test your skills in challenging turn-based battles, adjusting your combat tactics and optimal team combinations for each foe you met on the way. \nKey Features \nSeven memorable characters, including Kiba, the dark child, Charlie, the talking sniper badger, Alister, the brave guy with an Ether gauntlet, and Ruby, the princess of the thieves. Each of them has their role (sometimes more than one) on the battlefield and their own mission on a big journey. \n \nCharacter development system is based on equipment: each piece of armour, weapon or accessory gives a unique skill to a particular hero, expanding their range of attack types and defensive boosts. Find, trade for, or craft new equipment to improve your characters and make them versatile and adaptable. \n \nComplex tactical turn-based battles: a variety of elaborate enemies won't let you complete the whole game using a single tactic or invincible team build. Choose wisely the squad you take in a fight \u2014 proper positioning and awareness are essential to your success struggling against powerful foes. \n \nThe vivid and diverse world of Ree'fah: immerse yourself in the hand-painted fantasy universe of Grimshade and discover an impressive history in more than 20 hours of an exciting journey.", "summary": "Grimshade is a story-driven tactical RPG featuring a turn-based combat system and non-linear progression, set in a fantasy world.
