It features a Turn-Based combat along with a \"Turn the camera\" mechanic that also turns all monsters and projectiles, causing interesting outcomes such as: Monsters walking into traps; or attacking one another. Find powerful Artifacts and Blessings in each dungeon run. With the right combination, you might even feel like a god. There are many different types of monsters, and each move and behave differently in puzzle-like patterns. Every time you die, your gold is transformed into Ghost Coins, which can be used to purchase permanent Upgrades in the Spirit Shop. The game uses a Half-Procedural generation method to create random encounters but also familiar scenes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
