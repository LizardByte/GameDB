{"id": "mIU21A8cv5w", "snippet": {"title": "Skywind Gameplay Demo - Battle at Nchurdamz", "description": "It\u2019s been one year since our last gameplay demo and a few months since our last developer update. The \u201cBattle at Nchurdamz\u201d represents some of the progress we have made in every avenue of development - world region design, sound effects, quests, 2D concepts, 3D modelling, implementation, mechanics, weather/atmosphere, voice acting, and more.\n\nOne of the most exciting things in this video---although it may not look like much right now---is that we finally have simplified the process for creating custom creature skeletons and animations! Our Dwemer spider was the first test using these tools, and in fact uses a different skeleton than the Skyrim Dwemer spider. This marks a major milestone in our development, as these tools have been in the works for years. This opens the door to all sorts of new creature animations, such as for the guar, betty netch, silt strider, kwama, and much more.\n\nThe lifeblood of Skywind is the passion of its volunteer team. Our motivation is to do justice to a game that helped define the RPG genre, and we'd love to have more contributors help bring this mod to life. As we continue to finalize quests and dungeons like those shown in the demo, we are seeking applicants with voice acting, level design, coding, 3D modeling, and Creation Kit experience to join our team. \n\nAnyone interested can apply at https://tesrskywind.com/\n\nFor regular progress updates, please join our discord: https://discord.gg/Wzs4QTd\n\nIf you would like to hone your skills before joining Skywind or another Skyrim modding project, become a student at the Arcane University!\n\nAU Website: https://beyondskyrim.org/au\n\nAU Discord: https://discord.gg/qSXd72c\n\nBe sure to follow us on social media:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TESRSkywind/\nhttps://twitter.com/TESRSkywind\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/skywind/\nhttps://vk.com/tesrenewal", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIU21A8cv5w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIU21A8cv5w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIU21A8cv5w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIU21A8cv5w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIU21A8cv5w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Skywind Gameplay Demo - Battle at Nchurdamz", "description": "It\u2019s been one year since our last gameplay demo and a few months since our last developer update.
