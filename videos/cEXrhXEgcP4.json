CHEESE'S SUPER COLLECTION for Nintendo Wii Video Game Review", "description": "Classic Game Room presents a CGRundertow review of Chuck E. Cheese's Super Collection from UFO Interactive for the Nintendo Wii. Chuck E. Cheese's Super Collection is a compilation of two prior Chuck E. Cheese games (Party Games and Sports Games) on a single disc and a budget price. If there's one word I'd use to describe Chuck E. Cheese, it's fun. I would use a very different word to describe these lousy Chuck E. Cheese video games. They are stereotypical Wii minigame collections with very thin games and very thin premises. In Party Games, you're bored, you're watching television and you see a commercial for Chuck E. Cheese, so you beg your dad to take you. It's like a motion-controlled commercial. This video review features video gameplay footage of Chuck E. Cheese's Super Collection for the Nintendo Wii and audio commentary from Classic Game Room's Derek.\r\n\r\nCheck out more reviews from Classic Game Room at http://www.YouTube.com/CGRundertow and http://www.YouTube.com/ClassicGameRoom. \r\n\r\nFor the latest trailers, visit http://www.YouTube.com/CGRtrailers. \r\n\r\nGet more Classic Game Room on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/ClassicGameRoom and at http://www.ClassicGameRoom.com.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEXrhXEgcP4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEXrhXEgcP4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEXrhXEgcP4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEXrhXEgcP4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "CGRundertow CHUCK E.
