The goal is to help Clover inside of a gate by rapidly clicking on the door. As the gate opens, the clicking action switches from opening the gate to seemingly groping/slapping Clover's breasts.\n\nThree gates are presented, though Clover's outfit changes depending on which gate the player is presented to open. The first gate's outfit is her typical getup in Virtue's Last Reward, the second is a sukumizu (\u30b9\u30af\u6c34), and the third is a black bikini. The third gate is notably difficult and its reward is cut short by Clover covering up her nearly-revealed breasts while K's portrait is laid over her face.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kyokugen-dasshutsu-minigame-renda-shibou-desu", "videos": [{"id": 111852, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ORNlqA-U-x4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORNlqA-U-x4", "title": "How To Properly Prepare for Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ORNlqA-U-x4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
