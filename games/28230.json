Outlast is a first-person survival horror series developed by Red Barrels. The critically acclaimed franchise is now available as a complete package. The bundle features over 20 hours of terrifying gameplay across Outlast 1, Outlast Whistleblower and the all new Outlast 2.\n\nThe protagonists of Outlast have no fighting abilities. They must run, hide or die. Their only weapon is a camcorder they must use to capture the horrible events unfolding as they progress through the game. The camcorder also has a night vision mode to navigate through dark environments.\n\nIn Outlast 2 you are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe.\n\nThe investigation has led you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/outlast-trinity", "videos": [{"id": 16433, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "9eJqzL8i4lo"}]}
