These cooldowns vary across different units, and their attack and movement. You will need to balance these cooldowns and constraints in your building of new units, as well in the actions you command your units making their way to the enemy nexus.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/areigna-tactics", "videos": [{"id": 74809, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "YJtYuBAhRUk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJtYuBAhRUk", "title": "Areigna Tactics: Steam Early Access Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YJtYuBAhRUk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
