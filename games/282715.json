Yes it appears that Warren was tinkering with a sequel to his smash hit Adventure in his spare time while working at The Learning Company which he founded in 1980 after leaving Atari. It\u2019s unknown if Atari actually ordered a sequel or if Warren was doing this on his own and hoping to sell it to Atari. However since Atari was considering calling \"SwordQuest: Earthworld\" Adventure II (and \"Fireworld\" Adventure III) the later scenario sounds more plausible. Either way, this prototype has an air of mystery about it.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elf-adventure"}
