It was released in 2004. The module requires the Hordes of the Underdark expansion pack and offers around eight hours of gameplay.\n\nThe module is set in his own setting which borrows many elements from Forgotten Realms and other D&D settings. The story takes place near the Keep of Cyan, a northern part of this world. The game's goal is to win the election and become the Lord of the Keep. In order to do so, the player character has to persuade at least 4 of 9 guilds to aid him. Only then the character will have a chance to fight his nemesis, the Masked Man - a mysterious mage who uses a small army of creatures to conquer the Keep. On his journeys, the player character also has to reveal the mystery of his own nature and past. An unknown ally of great power also helps the character by granting him a sentient magical weapon with a friendly personality. The player could enlist help from two of four NPCs who traveled with him before the beginning of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neverwinter-nights-kingmaker", "collections": [{"id": 31, "name": "Neverwinter Nights"}]}
