Human kind built a massive spaceship, an ark to travel through space in search for new home. Everyone is asleep in stasis hibernation, hoping to wake up when the ark ship finds a new home, and construction bots build a fresh base.

You are now in full control of the disaster recovery procedure. Use your worker robots and drones to rebuild the ship, restore the ecosystem, and ensure the survival of the small remains of the fragile human kind.\n\nThe future of the rest of humanity is solely in your hands.
