Unfortunately, due to unforeseen bugs and errors, you have the ability to aim a gun, but you know nothing about how it works or even how to reload it.\n\nBut, you can figure it out step by step. Hold a magazine, load and lock the magazine into your pistol, and pull the slide back to chamber a round. Now, you are ready to fight.\n\nAll you have is a pistol and a few magazines. Now, get ready to escape a building filled with armed gang members - all by yourself!", "summary": "Reloader: test_subject is an experimental \"Bullet Counting Reload Action\" game that features realistic gun control combined with movie-style cinematics.
