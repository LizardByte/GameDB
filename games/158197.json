The path in the maze is drawn by swiping the cursor in a given direction, and it will draw as long as there is a surface underneath. By hitting so-called sound emitters on its way, the cursor activates different tones, percussion elements or musical chords.\nEach time you solve a new side of a planet a new musical loop is added to the previous one, revealing more and more of a musical composition.", "summary": "A relaxing puzzle game where you create music by solving mazes.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rytmos", "videos": [{"id": 69723, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "uAqwkmEIUPU"}]}
