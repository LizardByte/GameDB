Rool, also know as Donkey Kong vs. K. Rool Challenge, is another fan game by Nimaginendo Games produced by Vin\u00edcius Lemos to celebrate Donkey Kong's 40th Anniversary.\n\nThis, reimagines K. Rool's Kingdom level from Donkey Kong Land, in 16-bits pre-rendered DKC SNES style. The story is different from the original game! This time K. Rool captured Diddy Kong. He also wants to destroy DK Island with TNTs. Are you ready to rematch this battle in a new style?\n\nVini: I started producing this fan game in July, day 11. And finished the work in the day 21. So in day 22 I fixed some really bad bugs and re-released the fan game on the Kiddy Kong's Show Time facebook page. Also a very more easy battle was added.  Before was only 1 DK Barrel and now had various during the K. Rool battle. The last update was in the day 24, fixed K. Rool's mask when he is walking.\n\nTrailer made by Vini and Jacob\n\nVinicius - DKC style sound effects + text + fan game and videos from the gameplay of the fan game + fan game logos\n\nJacob - Added effects + musics from start + K.
