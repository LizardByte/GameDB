The game is played in real time, with a day/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his/her competition against other networks.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-ressha-de-ikou"}
