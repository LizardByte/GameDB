Unfortunatly so does the music on level 1 have some sort of bug that makes it go silent from time to time.\n\nIn this video so does i reach the castle level for the first time and the last boss was a bit difficult, i really wasted many lives there but finally figured out how to beat the boss (two bosses really). Everytime you die so do you loose the speed and hit power powerups and i really thought i had messed up and would fail, but thanks to good gamedesign so could the last boss be beaten without maximum powerups :-) \n\nAfter i completed the game so did i restart just to show the game over screen in the video also :-)\n\nSome shortcuts:\nTitle screen - 00:42\nLevel 1: The Village  - 03:47\nLevel 2: The Swamp - 22:11\nLevel 3: The Mountains - 36:00\nLevel 4: The Jungle - 50:34\nLevel 5: The Castle - 01:09:57\nLast boss - 01:21:22\nGame Over screen: 01:36:12\n\n*****\nRecorded from my Atari ST (1 mb) using Micomsoft RGB capturecard SC-500N1 and Xsync-1, software used is AmarecTV and Virtualdub.\n*****", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uv2xQ9Zgp1o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uv2xQ9Zgp1o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uv2xQ9Zgp1o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uv2xQ9Zgp1o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uv2xQ9Zgp1o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Torvak the Warrior - [Atari ST] Longplay (1990)", "description": "Torvak the Warrior by Core Design in 1990.\nI have some shortcuts listed later in the description if you want to skip loading times.\nThis is an amazing game that i never played when it was new, it was just about a month ago i first played it and it for sure is one of the best Atari ST games ever.\n\nThe design is superb, the enemies are not spawning all the time like in other games but are carefully placed in positions for a fair game challenge, the graphics are very well done and varied, the programming is excellent even if it has some slowdowns so does it not disturb the gameplay... and on top of that so does it have some catchy music.
