Experience living through a feverish historical event as Lotus--a hobbyist game developer, whose head is too stuck in the clouds to perfectly comprehend it. Interface with their noisy world of internet and game-fanatical nonsense. Inspired by Japanese Sound Novels in terms of edited photographical backgrounds, and ethereal environmental soundscapes.\n\nMade for Brackey's Game Jam 2024 by Team Millennium, composed of two people in its one week deadline. Trying to make a video game under a deadline can be seen as a narrative about game jams as a whole, though we promise this stuff is inspired by more events in our life than the jam (this didn't stress us out that much!!) The theme of \"The calm before the storm\" inspired us to write a story with increasing tension to a dramatic, climax, though it's up to you if you interpret it that way. We hope you enjoy regardless!!", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/requiem-of-last-lunar-phase"}
