You start with an empty field and have to uncover squares one at a time. Underneath each is either a space, a number, or a mine. The numbers tell you how many mines are in the adjacent boxes, the mines kill you dead. To win, you have to clear the field without touching a mine.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/minesweeper-deluxe"}
