{"id": "-gtDUZSo8BQ", "snippet": {"title": "MIDWAY Presents Arcade's Greatest Hits - Sega Saturn - Intro & showcase of games and extras [4K60]", "description": "Now this is a North American exclusive retro collection on Sega Saturn, that is a must for shmups fans as it includes six all time classic arcade games, Defender, Defender II (Stargate), Joust, Robotron 2084, Sinistar and Bubbles. All of these were in fact Williams arcade games and the title screen shows the game name as Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits. However Midway bought out Williams around this time and appeared to have change the game name at the last minute.\n\nThis collection was also released on Sega Megadrive / Genesis and Dreamcast. However the MD version has no extras and doesn't include Bubbles were as the Dreamcast release only contains the six arcade games. So all the Saturn video content and history is all missing, making this Saturn version the best release in terms of content on SEGA formats. Strangely despite the latter two versions getting released in PAL the Saturn version didn't.\n\nDeveloped by Digital Eclipse is present six emulated versions of the arcade games list above. They are decent recreations of all six games, but as the arcade flow, isn't fully recreated some Easter Eggs, like the ones seen on  Sinistar aren't accessible as it doesn't recreate the coin chutes and some other elements of the original hardware. Pressing Y, A and Start Buttons allows you to access the arcade menu from the attract screen in all games bar Defender (It did include a ROM test menu, however) which is a feature rarely included in these types of arcade collections and should be standard.\n\nAs for the games themselves, you have six classics from the 80s, Defender remains a hugely important title on the history of gaming and still plays well. Defender II improves on the original, but doesn't offer enough new content over the first game. Joust is still a very unique looking and playing game, that still fun to play now and remains a large following. Robotron 2084 for many will be the best game on the collection, but it suffers a bit due to having to use the Saturn buttons to fire, Sinistar is the most modern looking and playing game here, worth playing just to hear Sinistar's taunts to the player. Bubbles is the weakest game here, but fun to play and the easiest to get to grips with.\n\nIf you weren't playing these games in the 80s you many find these score arcade titles a little dated these days and the limited number of game on this set may put some people off. But for those of you who want to relive that 80s arcade rush it's a real rush.\n\nOn top of the games themselves is a background history on all six titles along with a introduction about Williams. All the titles bar Bubbles include video interviews with the staff who worked on and created the games. Which provide a great insight into the background on these games, even if these interviews are 25 years old now. There's also a gallery of art images showing concept art, flyers and unreleased content on various games.\n\nTimestamp for video:\n00:00 Intro & Credit \n03:30 History on games and interviews\n23:00 Defender\n29:40 Joust\n37:00 Robotron 2084\n42:54 Sinistar\n50:54 Bubbles\n55:16 Defender II\n1:02:10 Media Gallery & Art work\n\nKnown as: Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1 (Dreamcast)  Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits (Title Screen)\n\n\u30a6\u30a3\u30ea\u30a2\u30e0\u30ba\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u30d2\u30c3\u30c4\u304c\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u3055\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f \n\nRelease: 1996\nDeveloper: Digital Eclipse\nPublisher: Midway\nFormat: Sega Saturn (SS) / \u30bb\u30ac\u30b5\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3 / \uc138\uac00\uc0c8\ud134\n\nMIDWAY Presents Arcade's Greatest Hits was also released on PlayStation, PC, SEGA Megadrive / Genesis, Super Nintendo and Dreamcast.
