As the couple progresses, tunneling deeper and deeper underground, they'll have to stray off the main path to get their hands on precious gems.", "summary": "Chariot is a humorous physics-based couch co-op platformer in which a brave princess and her suitor carry a funeral wagon through ancient caves. They must fend off swarms of looters while amassing riches to bury the King's remains in a worthy gold-filled tomb. If only that dead King would keep quiet...\n\nThe Chariot's large wheels and long tethers allow the heroes to reach higher ground, swing across chasms and perform all sorts of impressive maneuvers. Extract riches from the very walls of the caves in multiple environments, and make your way to the exit by avoiding envious looters or by beating them back as they attempt to steal your hard-earned loot! With skill-testing coordination mechanics and thrilling physics-based stunts required, Chariot will definitely please couch coop enthusiasts as teamwork and cooperation unlocks new possibilities.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chariot", "videos": [{"id": 64255, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Bli55fqmnqw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bli55fqmnqw", "title": "Chariot - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bli55fqmnqw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
