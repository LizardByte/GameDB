You control a chef, and your goal is to make burgers! The screen consists of various platforms which contain the ingredients you'll need: buns, burgers, and lettuce. When your chef walks over an ingredient, it will fall to the level below. When all the ingredients in a column fall to the bottom of the screen, you'll have a complete hamburger; complete all of the hamburgers on the screen, and you can move on to the next level. Unlike BurgerTime, the ingredients won't cascade downward; there needs to be an open space below for an ingredient to fall into so you'll have to work your way from the bottom of the screen upwards. Of course, there are enemies (in the forms of burgers, pickles, cheese, and mushrooms) that wander about to make your task more difficult! Each platform has an enemy which wanders back and forth; although they can be crushed by falling ingredients (for bonus points), they will appear again and be faster than before! Your only defense against the various opponents is to avoid them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burger-builder"}
