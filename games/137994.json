The game plays very much like Whac-A-Mole, but features alligators coming out of the cabinet horizontally instead of moles coming out vertically.\n\nA digital remake was made in 2006 for Point Blank DS on the Nintendo DS, and retains the original design from the Japanese release. The game was digitally remade again in 2007 for Namco Museum Remix under the name Gator Panic Remix. This version has the player swing Pac-Man at the alligators by using the Wii Remote and Nunchuck; it was included again in Namco Museum Megamix which was released in 2010. An iOS version of Gator Panic was also released in 2010, but was removed from the app store on March 30, 2015.
