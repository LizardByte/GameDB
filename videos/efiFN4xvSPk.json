{"id": "efiFN4xvSPk", "snippet": {"title": "The Terminator (Genesis) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Virgin's 1992 license-based shooter for the Sega Genesis, The Terminator. \n\nThe Terminator is easily one of my all-time favorites movies, and I remember feeling pretty badly let down by the NES game for it. The SNES one was okay, but didn't really do much for me.  Then I finally had the opportunity to play the Genesis version, and it was completely awesome. I had expected more of the blah gameplay of the other two games, and this one blew me away. The graphics, the controls, and the music especially were all on point. Really, The Terminator theme sounds uber-cool on the Genesis FM (even if it is way too fast).\n\nThe levels really appealed to me too. They were straightforward  but interesting and all managed to recognizably depict specific scenes and settings from the movie (I love the little intro to the Police Department stage with the car). It also has some neat cinematic scenes with digitized photos to tie it all together. There are a ton of little flourishes in the details as well, like how Kyle has a completely different sprite for the first stage, or how he jumps over trash cans in the second stage instead of just running past them. \n\nThe only gripe I really have with it is that it's disappointingly short and easy. I'm glad it's not padded out with mazes and endless hallways that look the exact same, but the movie had other scenes that could've been used to create another stage or two. \n\nWell, I lied. One other gripe: how could they leave out Dr. Silberman? I mean, it could've been fun if Reese had to fling hot coffee in his face or something to escape.\n\nAnyways, fantastic game. I know the CD version has quite a following, but for me, this is where it's at. I mean, when a game finishes with such a ridiculously awesome voice sample, how can it be bad?\n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efiFN4xvSPk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efiFN4xvSPk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efiFN4xvSPk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efiFN4xvSPk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/efiFN4xvSPk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Terminator (Genesis) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Virgin's 1992 license-based shooter for the Sega Genesis, The Terminator. \n\nThe Terminator is easily one of my all-time favorites movies, and I remember feeling pretty badly let down by the NES game for it.
