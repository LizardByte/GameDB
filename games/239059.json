These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately, these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers, and rivers amongst other hazards.\n\nYou are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom is a selection of functions that can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating, and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lemmings--9", "videos": [{"id": 84680, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_jCbVqBYD0Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jCbVqBYD0Y", "title": "Lemmings: Atari Lynx (1993)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_jCbVqBYD0Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
