Every monster drops gold, spent on unlocking levels, skill tree branches, new classes reflecting your playstyle, new enemies to face, new cards to experiment with\u2026\n\nEvery unlock brings with it new ways to play the game and prepare your heroes for meeting the final challenge!\n\nALL ABOUT VICTORY\n\nEverything you do between bouts of heroically bloody fighting in the arena matters. Your heroes earn you Glory. You can then spend Glory to get more heroes to throw into the meat grinder, unlock new spells, cards, and change the dynamic of the game. Then, it\u2019s back to the arena for them to fight (or, if you're daring, dig up artifacts while under fire). Victory or death! Quite literally, actually: Fail to manage your heroes properly and face utter defeat and humiliation!\n\nEVERY RUN IS UNIQUE\n\nPlay your own way, combining classes, party compositions, factions, skills, and decks for an endless variety of playthroughs. And if you fail? Lather, rinse, and repeat, with a different roster of heroes and an entirely unique set of challenges tailored to them and their party.\n\nAre you ready to take on the challenge of the Clicker Arena and emerge victorious?", "summary": "Clicker Arena, the place where heroes are made and wheat is separated from the chaff. It's a new generation of idle games, the laid-back gameplay of clickers with randomness, replayability, and resource management usually found in roguelikes.
