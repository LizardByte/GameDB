That crazy, one-eyed caveman, the Trog, is hungry... and dinos Spike and Bloop know what that means: RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! Here's your chance to change the course of history and save the dinosaurs. Don't become Trog's Stone Age feast! Instead, use your reflexes and wits racing through 50 fun-filled islands, packed with dino-mite action and surprises. You'll witness the greatest inventions of all time: fire, the wheel, the pogo stick (the pogo stick?) - all invented by Trog to catch his dinner - you! Just watch out for the Tar Pits... sticky business. You've got special pick-ups to keep that carnivorous chow hound in check, like pineapples that turn you into a ferocious Trog-munching T-Rex. It's like this: either you save the Dinos... or you're extinct!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trog--1"}
