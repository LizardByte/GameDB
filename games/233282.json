There are several tracks to choose from, and players can tune their car to personalise them and enhance them.\n\nThere are two modes: Arcade Race, where the player will race against other cars (human or computer opponents) and Tournament Time Attack, where the player can race alone to score their best possible lap time. Players can choose from four different cars and four different racetracks. The four different circuits vary in difficulty and players can choose dry, variable and wet weather to race in for each of the tracks. Players accumulate points during their race and may use these points to buy accessories with which to tune their car."}
