Dennis must use a variety of vehicles (motorbike, jet-ski and ski-doo) to perform a number of stunts. The only controls are accelerate, brake and jump. The screen is split into four platforms. When the character leaves the end of one, he appears at the start of the next but there are also (on most levels), gaps in the platform where the character can fall through and land on the platform below. There are many hazards scattered across the platforms that must be avoided. These range from static objects like trees and houses to moving objects such as jumping policemen and speeding ambulances. If Dennis hits any of these objects, he is flung from his vehicle as it bursts into flames and he must start again (with 'take 2'). If he crashes too many times, he is 'fired'. Points are given in the form of a wage.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daredevil-dennis"}
