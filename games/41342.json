It was never released outside of Japan.\n\nThe title of 19 is based on the Greek pantheon of Gods, of which there are nineteen. \"Neunzehn\" is simply the number 19 in German. The player controls one of four heirs with an equal claim to the throne of the Greek hero Achilles. The latter sends the four to procure a magical stone that confers omnipotence to the user, originally left behind by the Greek gods. Through warfare, the player-chosen hero must defeat the armies of their three rivals and claim it for themselves.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/19-neunzehn"}
