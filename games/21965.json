When Gedo disappears, the shrine's protective power is thrown out of balance and strange things start to happen. \nGedo wasn't the only one to be spirited away, however, as Suzume's brother Toshiki vanishes one summer night while out catching fireflies. During a frantic search through the woods, Suzume crosses paths with the mysterious fox Izuna and the two decide to help each find what the other is looking for.", "summary": "Miyamori is an action-adventure platformer set in a small town in northern Japan. It draws its inspiration from games like Okami, Majora's Mask, and Yoshi's Island, as well as folktales from the Tohoku region of Japan and the works of Miyazawa Kenji. It is being developed for PC, and will likely release on Mac as well.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/miyamori"}
