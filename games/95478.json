This game features digitized sprites instead of the hand-drawn anime-style art from the other titles. It was released for the Sega Saturn three months later and the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2009. The subtitle of this game loosely translates to \"The Ultimate, Most Strongest Man in the Milky Way\" or \"The Ultimate, Invincible, Most Galactically Powerful Man.\" The game is based on the engine of the first Cho Aniki. Idaten and Benten are again the main two characters. The game is often derided as having the worst play mechanics in the series. Even some of the most fervent fans of Cho Aniki claim that the campy fun is inhibited by poor control and impossible difficulty. Koji Hayama returned to score a few songs for the soundtrack, along with Don McCow, Taku Iwasaki and Sanae Kasahara.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chou-aniki-kyuukyoku-muteki-ginga-saikyou-otoko", "videos": [{"id": 23374, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "WBEpWbhIAHg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBEpWbhIAHg", "title": "Cho Aniki: Gameplay, Let's Play [HD 720p]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WBEpWbhIAHg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
