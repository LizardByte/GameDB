It was developed and published by Bandai in 1988 for the Famicom as a sequel to the first Famicom Saint Seiya game, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu.\n\nThis version picks up where the first game left off, with the Bronze Saints about to take on all twelve of the Gold Saints in order to save Saori before time runs out. The game remains faithful to the original story, to the extent that your options are limited if you try to choose match-ups that didn't occur in the show.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/saint-seiya-ougon-densetsu-kanketsu-hen"}
