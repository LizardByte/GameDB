Now, in 2023, the fan studio WarMachine has released Castlevania Chronicles 2: Simon's Quest, which takes the same approach for the divisive NES sequel.\n\nThis remake takes the bones of Simon's Quest to craft a whole new game. You still explore an open-ended overworld, get hints from NPCs, and explore dungeon-style mansions to acquire key items. But the world has been remixed, the mansions have been completely revamped, and the old currency system has been completely revamped.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/castlevania-chronicles-ii-simons-quest", "videos": [{"id": 82841, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "fddKTZsaHZ4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fddKTZsaHZ4", "title": "Castlevania Chronicles II   Simon's Quest release trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fddKTZsaHZ4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
