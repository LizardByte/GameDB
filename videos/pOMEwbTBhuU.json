The LaserActive plays proprietary LaserDisc formats that contain video, audio, and data that is interpreted and executed by swappable modules.  While digitizing and recording normal LaserDiscs is possible with the right equipment, and emulating normal games for most systems is possible today, emulating the LaserActive in a way that processes the data along with the AV is currently impossible and may never be achieved.  Instead, this is my humble attempt to capture live footage of the experience being played, in the most complete way possible, while being upscaled to a resolution that modern displays understand and that provides archival quality for the future.\n\nWhen you see repeat content here, it is usually because the LaserDisc itself has multiple audio tracks, and I wanted to capture all of them.  In a couple cases, there is repeat content with the same audio only because that is how the disc plays if I don\u2019t exit out of any playback (which I specifically didn\u2019t, even when I could see that happening).  When one track is music and the other is sound effects, I put the music first.  When both are music, I put them in the order listed for tracks A and B in the credits of the manual.  It\u2019s possible in the video to see a few cuts here and there where I realized this track switching feature existed for more than just the Peacedelic sections and had to re-record sections and splice them into the original; my apologies, but it\u2019s about as close to seamless as I could make it.\n\nThe 3D section towards the end will not be in 3D as you are watching it.  To view it properly on the LaserActive, it requires an adapter to plug in to the rear of the system, the 3D goggles themselves, and to be played on a CRT, since an LCD display introduces too much lag for the active shutter glasses.  Rest assured that I viewed it in 3D, and it is quite pleasant.\n\nNote for surround sound users: This game lacks any Dolby badging, but the audio is encoded in matrixed surround sound nonetheless.  To hear, set your receiver to Dolby Pro Logic, Pro Logic II, or Dolby Surround (2014).\n\nHere is the tl;dr recording setup:\nMelon Brains disc - LaserActive console - gcompsw switcher - RetroTINK 5X-Pro upscaler (1440p) - Elgato HD60 X capture card (1440p) - Windows PC + OBS Studio x264 encoder + OpenShot Studio for splicing in the extra shots\n\nFor archival purposes, I have a much lengthier description of the recording setup - equipment, cables, encoder settings, firmware versions, etc. but it is too long for a YouTube video description.  I will find somewhere to post it and link back here later.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Spencer Clark for providing high quality recording equipment, and to the @LAPProject for their Pioneer-ing efforts to record this system for the future.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOMEwbTBhuU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOMEwbTBhuU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOMEwbTBhuU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOMEwbTBhuU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOMEwbTBhuU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Melon Brains (LaserActive, 1994) - Side 2, \"Dolphin Odyssey\"", "description": "\u00a91994 Studio Garage, \u00a91994 Multimedia Creators Network, \u00a9Pioneer Electronic Corp. 1994\nAll original content contained in this recording belongs to the rights holders and is used with their forgiveness for archival purposes.\n\nCheck out my recording of Side 1 here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTwik7kQCFc\n\n00:00 Startup, Loading, Title, Menu, Help\n03:20 Peacedelic Tour - Ambient (Garden Mix & Peace Blue Mix)\n33:39 Peacedelic Tour - Emotion (Luminance Mix & Bravo Mix)\n1:00:18 Ogasawara Islands\n1:07:29 Sea (collection of sea and sunlight video clips)\n1:33:15 Bob Talbot - Bahamas\n1:40:02 Bob Talbot - New Zealand\n1:44:12 Bob Talbot - Editorial Stills and Interviews\n1:48:30 Bob Talbot - 3D Dolphins\n1:51:14 3D Museum Trailer, Bob Talbot Profile\n\nThis is a recording of Side 2 of Melon Brains, an educational experience about dolphins for the Pioneer LaserActive system of the early/mid 90s.
