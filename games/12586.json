Players control Vitorc, a space marine equipped with an armored exoskeleton suit, as he navigates through 125 screens of hostile alien terrain. The game's core gameplay revolves around precise shooting, strategic grenade use, and skillful maneuvering to overcome a relentless array of enemies and environmental hazards. Known for its high difficulty level, Exolon challenges players with fast-paced action that demands quick reflexes and careful planning.\n\nWhat sets Exolon apart is its distinctive visual style, which pushed the graphical boundaries of 8-bit computers in its era. The game features detailed sprites and backgrounds that create a unique sci-fi atmosphere, complemented by a pulsing soundtrack that enhances the immersive experience. This combination of challenging gameplay, striking visuals, and atmospheric audio helped Exolon stand out in the late 1980s gaming landscape, earning it a cult following among retro gaming enthusiasts. Despite its simple premise, the game's intense action and memorable presentation have secured its place as a notable title in the history of side-scrolling shooters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/exolon"}
