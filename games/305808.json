The maps all vary quite dramatically in theme, and are similar only in terms of size and design - given the short time Jimmy had to make these in, his general approach to mapping is pretty obvious in how each map plays and is structured, but this should hopefully contribute to a well-rounded, consistent end product.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jiffy-bag"}
