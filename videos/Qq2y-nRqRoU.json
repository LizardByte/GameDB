From the cold, magic-rich highlands of Fareach, home to the player\u2019s Barbarian Clans, to the Borderlands with their fertile river valleys and deep woods where witches and monsters still roam free; from the Sunken Land, submerged through a great Cataclysm and filled with treacherous swamp and Lizardfolk, to the refined and temperate Empire to the South, home to wondrous cities and built upon undead labour. Your campaign will see you fight across very different battlefields, requiring variable tactics and army composition.\n\n#FantasyGeneral2\n\n\nFollow us on: \n\nFacebook Fantasy General II: https://www.facebook.com/FantasyGeneral2/\nSlitherine Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/slitherine/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SlitherineGames\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/slitherinegroup\nDiscord: https://discordapp.com/invite/slitherinegames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2y-nRqRoU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2y-nRqRoU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2y-nRqRoU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2y-nRqRoU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq2y-nRqRoU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fantasy General II - Announcement Trailer", "description": "#FantasyGeneral II is the reimagination of the strategy game classic from the 90s! \n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Wishlist on Steam: https://bit.ly/2YKupG4\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Wishlist on GOG: https://bit.ly/2G1nSQ1\n\nArmies once again draw battle-lines on the war-torn land of Keldonia, and a new generation of commanders will test their bravery and tactics against each other.
