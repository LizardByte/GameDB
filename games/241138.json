In this game we have a nice monkey under control. On its way Titus meets rebellious robots.

Professor's T'Alent assistant built a mechanical army. The monkey is not unarmed: it uses laughing gas, tosses coconuts, it can roll like a ball and shake its arms. Friends it meets on its way give it helpful advices.", "summary": "Monkey's Adventures (Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek) is a platform game in Polish, inspired by the cult comic book by Henryk Chmielewski. The player takes control of the comic's protagonist \u2014 Tytus, a talking chimpanzee. One of Tytus's friends, the ingenious inventor Professor T. Alent, needs your help: his robots have gone haywire, and are going wild all over the city.\n\nOn each level, the player needs to collect a specific amount of the indicated items (such as candy or coffee cups) and then reach the exit. There are various robotic enemies in the game, which can be defeated by rolling into them, beating them up, or shooting them with weapons collected along the way.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monkeys-adventures", "videos": [{"id": 85854, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "615Xiw4TDQM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=615Xiw4TDQM", "title": "Monkey's Adventures PC game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/615Xiw4TDQM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
