The game was one of the most popular arcade games in its day and is credited with popularizing the trackball. Twenty-five cents would allow 90 seconds of playtime, while adding more quarters would allow longer play. Considered physically exhausting to play, Atari Football involves spinning the trackball as fast as possible to win the game. Just 90 seconds of play could result in sore palms, and longer could cause blisters.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atari-football"}
