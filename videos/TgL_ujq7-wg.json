Players traverse a variety of environments, moving through forests, cities, caves, and wilderness to advance through the game's story. Utilizing swords, engaging in melee combat, and employing stealth are key to overcoming hostile enemies. For most of the game, players take on the role of Rajendra Chola \u2014 the Tamil Chola emperor of South India who succeeded his father, Rajaraja Chola I, and ascended to the throne in 1025 CE.
