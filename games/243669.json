Thunder was rumbling and the ocean was raging. A thunderbolt broke the mast, and destroyed the boat. Link lost consciousness.\n\nHe ended up on the beach of an unknown island, still alive but fainted and wounded. A young girl named Marin took him in and looked after him until he finally woke up. She explained him that he was on Kohlint island, a tropical island in the middle of the ocean. Link also soon met Tarin, her father, who found Link\u2019s shield on the beach.\n\nWho are these people? Where is Link? And why is this island both so strange and so familiar? And what is this giant egg at the top of the mountain? You\u2019ll discover the truth by guiding Link in this epic and oniric quest.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Dream is a fanmade remake of the Game Boy cult classic The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening, first published in 1993 and enhanced with colors in 1998 with its DX version.\n\nThe Solarus-made remake uses A Link to the Past graphics, extended with lots of custom sprites and tiles, in order to represent all the game\u2019s characters, enemies and landscapes. Even the music has been remade in SNES-like fashion, to get the perfect feeling as if the game was released on Super Nintendo.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-dream--1"}
