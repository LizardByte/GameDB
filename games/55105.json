The computer controls both your partner and your opponents, either of which can be set to an expert or novice skill level. In the novice game, you will be able to see your partners hand while bidding while in the expert game your partners hand remains hidden. For each game, you can choose to play to either 13, 21, 25, or 29 points. After a hand is finished, you have the option of replaying the same hand if you want to practice, or you can have the computer deal a new hand. If you don't like the way a hand is going, you have the option of restarting the hand to try again. Included with the game instructions is a complete guide to how your computer partner will bid in different situations in order to help you form your strategy. Bridge was designed for people who already know how to play the game, it won't teach you how to play.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
