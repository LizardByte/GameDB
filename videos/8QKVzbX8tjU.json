Who is watching who? The teaser explores an idea I've been experimenting with for years:  what if ghosts know we are watching? What if the very gadgets we use to 'hunt' ghosts provide a conduit, a portal, to their world, the ghost world?! Imagine an existence that sits alongside ours, invisible, like dark matter, but it occasionally 'seeps' into our world, creating ghost sightings and apparitions. \n\nDo we, in turn, appear in their world, the past? Perhaps our appearance generates the very story that we are investigating? Or, we cause some sort of chronological damage? A rip in time, that leaks and distorts the here and now, a connection with all times? Basically, rather than think of ghost sightings as one-off, or occasionally recurring events, think instead that the ghosts are there the entire time, all around us. You just need the right tech, the right place, the right questions, and those connections become stronger.\u201d", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8QKVzbX8tjU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8QKVzbX8tjU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8QKVzbX8tjU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8QKVzbX8tjU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8QKVzbX8tjU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Last Crown: Blackenrock - Teaser Trailer", "description": "The teaser trailer for the ghost-hunting adventure game The Last Crown: Blackenrock. \n\n\u201cGhosts!
