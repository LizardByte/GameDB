The traveler\u2019s knowledge, skills\nand power led them to believe that he was the chosen Emissary of the god Ceth. As time passed, the\ntraveler taught the people of Shrikar how to Weave, or shape the natural energy flows of their planet. The\nEmissary also taught the basic skills of architecture and of controlling creatures of the land, improving the\nway life for the people of Shrikar. An age of prosperity and enlightenment began and the people lived\nbetter than ever before.\n\nAs the people of Shrikar continued to advance in their skill and knowledge of Weaving, the Emissary left to\ncontinue his journey once more. To honor him and his teachings, the people created the Arcomage Guild; a\nschool dedicated to the knowledge that the Emissary brought to Shrikar. Graduation from this Guild\nbestowed the title of Arcomage upon the worthy student, one who understood and excelled in the ways of\nWeaving, of Control and of Building. The Golden Age of Shrikar had reached its pinnacle.\n\nOne hundred years after the departure of the Emissary, the first Arcomage War struck the people of\nShrikar. The Arcomage Crowhain assaulted the citadel of the Arcomage Ralbeard. The surrounding\ncountryside was laid to waste. Years after the war started, Ralbeard completely destroyed the citadel of his\nenemy. The scars upon the world of Shrikar were slow to heal. Over the next five hundred years the people\nof Shrikar would experience the wars of Arcomages hundreds of times, as mages strove to increase their\npower and reputations.\n\nYou have been challenged, Arcomage! The enemy is at the gates and it is now time to put your skills and\ntactics to the test. Gather your resources, summon your armies and join the battle!", "summary": "A card-based mini-game from Might and Magic VII and VIII, the popularity of which convinced New World Computing to turn it into a standalone game.
