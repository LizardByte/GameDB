This culminates in the 'Combat Unlimited' level where the number of enemy tanks is unlimited and the player must destroy as many as possible before losing their only tank.\n\nThe tank controls include the standard left/right forward/reverse and fire in addition to turret right, turret left and turret centre. The game screen features a small radar which shows the location of enemy targets, a compass for orientation, and a status bar. The actual game screen contains features such as trees which can be destroyed, so neither the player nor the enemy can hide behind them. The game has four save slots.\n\nThe full game consists of four levels\nCountry Carnage\nWasteland Warriors\nDesert Destruction\nCombat Unlimited\nOnly the Country Carnage level was included in the shareware release.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/annihilator-tank"}
