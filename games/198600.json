They were offered as a part of Happy Meals for a limited time in 2004. Strangely this game seems to have not been released in all regions of the world and a totally different Knuckles themed game was released elsewhere.\n\nThe objective of the game is to catch baseballs thrown by Sonic. This is done by pressing the button at the correct time after the ball is thrown. If ten are caught the game will advance by 1 level and the speed of the game will increase.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knuckles-baseball"}
