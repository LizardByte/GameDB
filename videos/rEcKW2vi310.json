Official Site: http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/ascension\n\nIn Nobunaga\u2019s Ambition: Sphere of Influence - Ascension players can experience all aspects of the life of a Warring States officer. For the first time in the series, they can advance from a Retainer to a Daimy\u014d, a feudal lord, with Officer Play. This mode opens a world of possibilities: rise through the ranks with aid from other clans, through conquering the land, by following orders and advancing in status, or by overthrowing superior lords!\n\nThis exciting new mode also affects the way battles are experienced as players will have the opportunity to witness thrilling battlefields first-hand through the eyes of an Officer. Aiding in victory or defeat, every command made will affect the outcome of battle, with bonuses awarded for successful deployment of a new strategy. This installment also introduces Combat Quests:  extra missions that appear in the course of battle and provide extra rewards upon completion. These dynamic objectives change based upon the tide of war and allow for more in-depth dramatic battle experiences.\n\nPlayers will be able to exploit the entire breadth of strategic options available to them in Nobunaga\u2019s Ambition: Sphere of Influence Ascension with the introduction of two new types of warfare, Siege and Naval battles. Full-scale Siege battles create a realistic simulation that allows blockades to be deployed as a defense mechanism, as well as the use of tunnels and cannons, to gain the strategic advantage over their opponent and overtake the enemy stronghold. Naval battles provide the option to carry out skirmishes and strategic blockades on vast bodies of water such as oceans, to overcome the enemy from every angle.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rEcKW2vi310/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rEcKW2vi310/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rEcKW2vi310/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rEcKW2vi310/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rEcKW2vi310/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: SPHERE OF INFLUENCE - ASCENSION - LAUNCH TRAILER", "description": "\"Like\" us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/koeitecmogames\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/koeitecmoeurope\n\nComing to PS4 and PC (via Steam) on October 28, 2016.
