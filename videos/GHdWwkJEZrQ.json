{"id": "GHdWwkJEZrQ", "snippet": {"title": "Banjo Kazooie The Hidden Lair - BK RomHack - Demo 1", "description": "Decided to put this out with all the recent Banjo hype going on! Quickly whipped up this video. Sorry, for the long wait. Hope you enjoy! Details in the thread below!\nBe sure to read the instructions and known issues carefully. Remember this is a demo.\n\nBanjo Kazooie The Hidden Lair is a passion project by me and Oldum77. It shows a possible continuation of the series; showing possible events after Banjo Tooie. It features a new area of the original Grunty's Lair, called the Hidden Lair. The goal is to have 9 worlds in the end. The hack aims to be close to vanilla in terms of feeling and charm. This is a BK hack, not for Banjo Tooie, so keep in mind that moves from that game are not present here.\n\nDifficulty lies a bit above the vanilla game; obviously because we assume most people who play it will have played BK as well. However, it should still be relatively easy to beat. 100% can be quite tricky; many of the tokens and honeycombs are hidden quite well! Have fun!\n\nLink to the original trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtbr88Pig3U\n\nDirect download (look up online how to apply an xdelta patch):\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/file/uvlq11rt07p32bd/BKTheHiddenLairDEMO1a.xdelta/file\n\nBug tracker:\nhttps://github.com/Daveyx0/BanjoKazooieHiddenLair/issues", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHdWwkJEZrQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHdWwkJEZrQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHdWwkJEZrQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHdWwkJEZrQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GHdWwkJEZrQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Banjo Kazooie The Hidden Lair - BK RomHack - Demo 1", "description": "Decided to put this out with all the recent Banjo hype going on!
