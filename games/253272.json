{"id": 253272, "name": "Magnetball Lite", "slug": "magnetball-lite", "summary": "MagnetBall is played by bouncing iron balls straight at red magnets to get points. Each ball falls from above by gravitational force. You must bounce the ball using a steel bar. The bar is controlled by your finger sliding over the iPhone/iPod screen. Control can also be had by using a multi-touch interface. This will give enhanced angle and speed control. If you like a challenge, this is it!\nThis game has many levels. You must avoid penalties for missed balls to advance. Difficult magnet locations and external forces make successive levels more challenging. Bonuses are awarded for reaching a level without losing any balls.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magnetball-lite"}
