SpongeBob SquigglePants puts you in the driver\u2019s seat for a dizzying series of lightening-speed Nanogames, giving you mere seconds to finish one before moving right on to the next. Within this rapid-fire succession of challenges, SpongeBob SquigglePants exposes players to never-before-seen SpongeBob art styles from the Nickelodeon vault. SpongeBob SquigglePants also lets players digitally draw, paint, color and choose from dozens of SpongeBob-themed stamps, using the uDraw to create a masterpiece worthy of a place in Patchy\u2019s own collection of SpongeBob art, or their own refrigerator, thanks to the uDraw\u2019s exclusive ability to export art to the Wii\u2019s SD card slot. The entire game is hosted by SpongeBob\u2019s biggest fan, Patchy the Pirate, in a never-before-seen live action experience for an added level of under-the-sea silliness.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spongebob-squigglepants"}
