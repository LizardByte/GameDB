{"id": "dckvmWB3R3M", "snippet": {"title": "Shady Trial English Trailer", "description": "Shady Trial is a Touhou fangame that parodies Ace Attorney and never holds back. I've translated it with cooperation from Myofuukai, the one-person circle who created the game.\n\nIn Shady Trial, you play as Patchouli Knowledge (AKA \"Patchy\") and defend clients suspected of murder... but, the twist is that you're the murderer and you're trying to set them up to take the fall for you.\n\nDue to Shady Trial referencing so many different properties and parts of Japanese culture, a lot of its humor had to be localized more aggressively than I'd usually be on board with, but I think I managed to create an entertaining experience while still maintaining a lot of the game's soul. Try to guess which jokes were kept as-is and which ones were localized while playing! I guarantee you'll guess wrong a few times.\n\nAs of September 29th, the game is purchasable from the link below! It'll be available on Fanza in the near future as well.\n\nPurchase link: https://www.dlsite.com/home/work/=/product_id/RJ244256.html/?locale=en_US\n\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/HakanaiBlue\nDeveloper's Twitter: https://twitter.com/myohukai\n\nAs always, I wouldn't be able to do large-scale translation projects like this one if it weren't for the support I receive over on Patreon and Ko-fi.
