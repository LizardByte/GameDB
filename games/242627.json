The previous system for weapon levels was converted into a higher starting level for existing players while the max level is decided by the number of weapons owned, their rarity and their upgrad rank ,\n\nWeapons are now auto-upgraded, or sold when already maxed, as duplicates are acquired and the inventory storage space used for them was removed from the game, refunds were given to players for the resources used to expand it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tales-of-the-rays-last-cradle"}
