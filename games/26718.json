I studied PHP/MySQL/CSS/HTML/Javascript for a majority of my younger years and worked on my little gem here as a starting project which I eventually (15 years later) completed.  Welcome to my imagination and I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r", "summary": "Sol Source Online is a free to play text browser based strategy/casual game that throws the player into a galaxy filled with chaos. \r\n\r\nEach new player takes control of an empire destined for greatness and fights their way through the ranks of other players to reach the ultimate goal of absolute power within Sol.\r\n\r\nBuild massive fleets, ground armies, upgrade your base, research new technologies, the list really goes on.  \r\n\r\nCheck us out today and be a part of a beta-release game that stayed true to the original browser gaming roots.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
