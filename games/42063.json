Gaia no Monsh\u014d is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce B\u00f6ser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 43374, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ojCyGGpzEvo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojCyGGpzEvo", "title": "Gaia no Monshou (PC Engine) full playthrough, part 1 of 2 (English)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ojCyGGpzEvo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 43375, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3nbRq6bCjhE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbRq6bCjhE", "title": "PC88\u7248 - Gaia no Monshou - Campaign", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3nbRq6bCjhE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 43376, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SKoq_HzeG18", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKoq_HzeG18", "title": "\u30ac\u30a4\u30a2\u306e\u7d0b\u7ae0 \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SKoq_HzeG18/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
