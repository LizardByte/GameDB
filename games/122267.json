The objective is to control a spellcaster, moving sideways at the bottom of the screen, and shoot gems from the wand at a series of multi-colored spherical jewels, to make matches of three or more of the same color and make them disappear. The jewelry line rolls on twisting tracks occupying most of the screen, being pushed by an enemy character and moving towards an exit hole. If three or more enter the exit, the player loses a life and the level has to be replayed, and the game is over after all the lives are spent. A meter at the top fills with each match, and the level can be finished when it is full.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/myth-match"}
