The game is a fictional, comedic, non-violent fighting game with tongue-in-cheek satire and in-jokes about college life and surviving at a certain university, and based (loosely) on real campus settings as levels, and archetypal student types and figureheads as characters. The university\u2019s mascot is Robert Morris (the financier of the American Revolution), and the football team is the \u201cColonial Crazies\u201d, hence the title of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/colonial-combat"}
