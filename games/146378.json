The hero in this game possesses a magical mirror with which he witnesses a duel between his best friend and an unsympathetic aristocrat. After accidentally killing his opponent, he is taken prisoner by the royal guard. The friend now tries to get him freed, but first he has to do a number of quests for the king before his plea will be heard.\n\nThe characters are controlled just like in an RTS or many Western RPGs of that era, for example Baldur's Gate. It's always reccomended to turn on the AI, as manual combat controls are terribly unresponsive. Unfortunately, the gameplay is really slow, and there's not much for the player to do while waiting till the heroes reach the end of a map or kill the inventively designed monsters. Characters can run, but only until their stamina runs out, which happens all too quickly.\n\nThe dialogues in Eryner are fully voiced, and interestingly there are even English subtitles, although they're apparently not translated by a native speaker and completely ignore linebreak rules, and it doesn't seem like the game has ever been published in an English speaking country. Never mind though, because the shoddy QA makes it very much unplayable. The fact that the installation simply doesn't work on modern systems can be worked around, not so much the many severe bugs like missing background graphics, crashes, broken save games and\u2014worst of all\u2014crucial events that just won't be triggered.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eryner"}
