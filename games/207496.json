After a long confrontation with the invasion of demons, the goddess of Alfira weakened so much that she could not cope with the curse left by demons - Bane, which gradually devours all life. Cities fall into the ground, people, elves and orcs die from Bane poisoning or mutate into terrible monsters. As if that was not enough, a former ally, a mad necromancer, decides to become the new god of a dying world and turn all the living into his army of the undead.\n\nYou are the Sentinel - the last hope of this world. A mysterious creature created by an ancient race to oppose demons. At the disposal of the Sentinels are melee weapons, shield, various superpowers and pistols. You are opposed by hordes of the undead and even other Sentinels enslaved by the necromancer. There are rumors around the world that the demons have returned and will soon begin their march through the world of Alfira again, devouring the remnants of the survivors.", "summary": "Tracery of Fate VR is a dark fantasy cooperative/solo VR game in magic post-apocalyptic world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 72531, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "eUKS1w8yvUs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUKS1w8yvUs", "title": "Tracery of Fate", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eUKS1w8yvUs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 72532, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "W_Y2PdV3aXQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_Y2PdV3aXQ", "title": "Tracery of Fate | Combat trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_Y2PdV3aXQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 72533, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "awAV29sh8DI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awAV29sh8DI", "title": "Entrance to the dead city.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/awAV29sh8DI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
