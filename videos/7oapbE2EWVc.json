{"id": "7oapbE2EWVc", "snippet": {"title": "Mystik Belle Release Trailer", "description": "Being a student of mystical arts is hard work, doubly so if you are Belle MacFae - a freshman student at Hagmore School of Magic. The teachers and the staff are mean, her friends are few, and her grades suck. Worst of all \u2013 Belle has a tendency to be at exactly the wrong place at exactly the wrongest time. Like tonight, for example, when she stayed up late to practice her fire magic, but instead got framed for upsetting an ancient ritual. And what better way is there to punish an unlucky first-year student, than to charge her with an impossible task on the worst night of the year? Re-create the Walpurgisnacht Brew, or be expelled, and with all manner of spooks taking over the school, expulsion is starting to sound better by the minute.\n\nInspired by games like Slightly Magic, Puff in Dragonland, and the Dizzy series, Mystik Belle is a hybrid of a classic point-and-click adventure and a modern metroidvania. While playing it you can expect to do some of the following:\n\n*Get hopelessly lost in the massive school building and its surrounding areas.\n*Find items and solve inventory puzzles. Or just clog up your pockets with useless junk.\n*Interact with other inhabitants of Hagmore. Learn clues, help them out, ruin their day with angry flies.\n*Fight through hallways infested by over 60 unique monster types.\n*Defeat 8 bosses.\n*Learn new magical and not-so-magical abilities.\n*Ogle at retina-burningly colorful pixel art.\n*Punch Cthulhu in the face.\n\nBe warned though - Mystik Belle is a true adventure game, and not just a metroidvania. You will not get far without having to solve puzzles or talking to people.\n\nLastly, the game may contain some language not suitable for younger kids.\n\nYou can currently purchase the game for Windows, Mac and Linux from my own page via the Humble Widget (includes Steam and in the future, a Desura key):\nhttp://darkfalzx.blogspot.com/p/mystik-belle.html\n\nSteam store page\nThe game is currently out on Steam:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com//app/332610?beta=0\n\nDesura store page (out on June 24th.)\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/mystik-belle", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7oapbE2EWVc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7oapbE2EWVc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7oapbE2EWVc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7oapbE2EWVc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mystik Belle Release Trailer", "description": "Being a student of mystical arts is hard work, doubly so if you are Belle MacFae - a freshman student at Hagmore School of Magic.
