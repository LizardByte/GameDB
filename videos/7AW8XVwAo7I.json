{"id": "7AW8XVwAo7I", "snippet": {"title": "I Promise Visual Novel Playthrough (No commentary)", "description": "Since this is a Christmas themed Visual Novel, I thought I might as well play this just before the holidays. And wow, a SFW furry visual novel. I have truly come across a rare sight. This VN came out in 2015, and is a spin off of the VN Great Troubles.\n\n\nPlot (taken directly from creators): Scott with his classmates went to a little Christmas travel. They're up for great recreation, skiing, tubing, snowboarding and much more! But are that the only things waiting for them?\n\n\n\nOverall Thoughts: Honestly, the story is nothing too special, it's somewhat generic with a bit of romance but it's not so in your face, so I appreciate that. However the story ark with Ollie is just flat out heartbreaking and I really wish they had better explained all of it, but despite it's extreme sadness, it's probably my favorite part of the game. But this game mainly redeems itself through the art style, particularly of the character models (sprites). They all are really well drawn out and look very cute, making it easy on the eyes and charming to look at. The characters are good, especially Vincent, who is my favorite character (and no, it's not for the looks either). A minor complaint is the game's aspect ratio, which I believe is 16:10. Obviously, this does not fill up the entire screen, though I'm a little surprised it's not 4:3 as most VN's were in 2015. As I said earlier, unlike the game it's spun off from, Great Troubles, this game is completely SFW and is a real breath of fresh air after seeing so many furry visual novels (especially those on itch.io, this game was from furaffanity) that have NSFW scenes left and right. (SPOILER ALERT!) There is a little kissing at the end, but thankfully doesn't lead into something else. Anyways, this story is rather short too. I played it in 44 minutes- the shortest VN I have ever played. I've played the game a couple times as well to see if there were different routes, and there kinda are? It mainly only changes minor things like who you talk to and stuff, it doesn't affect too much really, or jump you into an entirely different story, so this game is rather linear. I'm not entirely sure which route I got through on this particular gameplay, I think it was the Gabriel route. Anyways, would I recommend this VN? I'd say it's up to you. It's free so even if you don't like it, thankfully the most it'll ever take away from you is 197 MB of storage. Here is the link to download the game: https://www.furaffinity.net/view/22114371/.\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter! https://twitter.com/Matt6438", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7AW8XVwAo7I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7AW8XVwAo7I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7AW8XVwAo7I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "I Promise Visual Novel Playthrough (No commentary)", "description": "Since this is a Christmas themed Visual Novel, I thought I might as well play this just before the holidays.
