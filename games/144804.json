It features a large open area with a few weapons, extremely limited ammo , and one very fast monster. The idea is to kill the monster to unlock the exit to escape. However the monster is extremely hard to hit and moves at lightning fast speed. If you do nothing \"Choke\" will bite you to death in seconds. Killing the monster allows the exit switch to raise from the ground, but due to a bug the level can be exited at any time. Originally the WAD used DEHACKED to create the monster but was updated with DECORATE support.\n\nThe Ghoul's Forest was intended as a small joke to scare a handful of players. However it gained enough attention, when it was uploaded to idgames, to gain a sequel.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ghouls-forest", "collections": [{"id": 6853, "name": "The Ghoul's Forest"}]}
