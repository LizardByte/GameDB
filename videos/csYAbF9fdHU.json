Set in a rich, science fantasy world called Lumerea, the game breaks new ground by combining the real-time, skill-based teamplay and action of MOBAs with the adventure of co-operative MMO dungeon runs.\n\nIn Evercore Heroes, four teams of four compete with each other simultaneously in a brand-new session-based PVE experience.
