It has been designed and developed by Toukana Interactive (creators of Dorfromantik) in collaboration with kurzgesagt - in a nutshell, the science storytellers known from YouTube.\n\nStar Birds, Toukana\u2019s second title, will offer a fresh and accessible approach to a well-established genre: base building and automation!\n\nIn the game, players will join the Star Birds on their mission across the vastness of space and help them gather much-needed resources by mining asteroids. Over time, they will establish a thriving mining operation, take care of the growing birds' needs, and discover new technologies to advance their operation even further. \nAnd who knows? They might uncover some truly out of this world mysteries\u2026\n\nThis official reveal Trailer offers an exclusive first look into the game\u2019s mechanics, gameplay, and design. Inspired by kurzgesagt\u2019s well-known art style, Toukana has created 3D graphics that combine both studios\u2019 visual styles. In the gameplay scenes shown in the trailer, buildings are placed on asteroids, resources are mined and transported through hand-drawn connection pipes for further processing. This creates a bustling network of production facilities, with rockets transporting the products to other locations within the asteroid field. A montage reveals several developed asteroids, each varying in shape and color. \n\nStar Birds is set to launch into orbit/space (and into your Steam library) in 2025.\n\nToukana's Links\nWebsite: https://toukana.com/\nX: https://x.com/_Toukana \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/toukana\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@toukana_interactive\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/toukana_interactive/\nFor media inquiries, please contact: press@toukana.com\n\nkurzgesagt's YouTube Channels:\nEnglish: https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell \nGerman: https://www.youtube.com/c/KurzgesagtDE \n\nkurzgesagt's Social Channels:\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@kurz_gesagt \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/kurzgesagt\nX: https://x.com/Kurz_Gesagt \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Kurzgesagt \nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/kurzgesagt/ \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/kurzgesagt \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/18468378/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pk8aiXMQJU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pk8aiXMQJU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pk8aiXMQJU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pk8aiXMQJU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3pk8aiXMQJU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Star Birds - Official Trailer - New Game by Toukana & Kurzgesagt", "description": "Find out more on Steam \ud83d\udc49 https://star-birds.com/steam\nJoin the Newsletter for exclusive updates & news:\nhttps://star-birds.com\n\nAbout the game\nFormerly codenamed \u201cProject Mango\u201d, Star Birds is the first PC game in the kurzgesagt universe.
