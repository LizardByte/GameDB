But this year's Oaths of Light ceremonies might be... different.\n\nOur story takes place a little before Eden's seventeenth birthday.\nShe, like many others, was summoned to the capital for the ceremonies of the Oaths of Light. And she will have to leave the peaceful village where she has always lived to attend it.\nMoreover, lately, hunters from the village have reported sightings of very agitated wildlife and unusual activities in the woods.\nYou will be involved in the investigation initiated by the village chief and help to uncover surprising history and mysteries.\n\nWhat will happen next is history yet to be written before your decisions in this adventure...", "summary": "Play as a young woman whose life is forever changed by a series of unexpected events.Unfold mysteries, enjoy non-linear storytelling with branching paths based on your choices, and engage in JRPG-inspired battles mixing real-time and turn-based elements.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oaths-of-light", "videos": [{"id": 139391, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "L4lmQ40hrNU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4lmQ40hrNU", "title": "Oaths of Light trailer I", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L4lmQ40hrNU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
