As you move through each screen, various obstacles must be avoided such as falling rocks, lava and birds. If you dawdle for too long, the dinosaur appears behind you and chases you until you make it to the end of the screen. There are also treasures to collect and if you get six in a row without dying you receive a bonus. On the last screen, you need to try and trap the dinosaur in a cage.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bongo--1"}
