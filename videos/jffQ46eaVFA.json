The game offers players 6 drivable streetcars - three different models, each in two different lengths - including detailed and interactive cockpits. In addition to being able to define and drive your own routes, you can also control your passengers' tickets. Of course, players should also keep an eye on the traffic and the numerous random events that await them during their journeys!\n\nIn Tram Simulator Urban Transit, players have three different game modes to choose from: In Story mode, there are more than 10 challenging missions to master as part of the exciting campaign. In Career mode, players can start their tram company without any guidelines and expand it according to their wishes - due to the low starting capital, it is of course important to manage well while trying to lead the company to success. In Sandbox mode, meanwhile, streetcar fans can create their company without any limits - everything is unlocked directly and players have unlimited funds at their disposal, so they can develop completely freely right from the start. All three game modes can of course also be played in multiplayer with up to three additional players.\n\nTram Simulator Urban Transit is now available at a price of 19.99 EUR / 19.99 USD (SRP) for PC on Steam.
