To avoid another lawsuit with Atari (which they had previously received for creating \"Super Missile Attack\", a Missile Command hack), G.C.C. presented the game to Bally Midway for approval of release. Midway, impatient for Namco to release the then-upcoming Super Pac-Man, purchased Crazy Otto for their own release.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
