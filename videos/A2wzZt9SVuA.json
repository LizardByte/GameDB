I first played it on the demo disk that came with my DC, but not to long after, Sonic Adventure, and Crazy Taxi were the first two DC games I picked up (aside from the disappointing Smash Pack that came with my DC).

The only real complain I have is I don't like Big's quest, but the rest of the game I had a blast with. It's easily one of my favorite DC games, and the biggest complaint people have against the game (the camera problems) could be applied to just about any other 3D platformer (including Mario), so I don't really care about that unless it's completely crippling to the game, and it's not. \n\nI do need to get my hands on SA2, I honestly haven't played it. I know, I know, but I can't play every game ever made. I'll get it here soon though.\n\nAlso, I'm using an S-video connection in this vid, if you still play and own a DC, you really should get yourself a VGA box. I mainly just got it to see if I could improve the quality of my vids, but it really does make an improvement, and some of the games look spectacular on a VGA monitor as well.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A2wzZt9SVuA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A2wzZt9SVuA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A2wzZt9SVuA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A2wzZt9SVuA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast) Gameplay", "description": "NOTE: My replacement computer isn't that good, so there may be some framerate stuttering, and visual glitches in this vid that aren't there in the original game. \n\nDreamcast fans, do you remember where you were when you first played this level?
