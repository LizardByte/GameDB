Let's kick those into orbit now, essentially \"storing\" them for later when we are finally ready to get there. But best of all, given the bureaucracy and rules governing on-planet junk disposal, sending those dryers off-world, even with disposable one-time-use rockets was in fact less expensive, as counter-intuitive as this may be.\n\nUnfortunately this space city idea did not come to fruition. Developing those cities would have required a big investment, but any sacrifice today for the sake of tomorrow in those times was a career ending move - and potentially even life ending in extreme cases. So the world's political context in those decades simply failed to give birth to a leader willing to develop orbiting cities.\n\nAll those \"space dryers\" (as they became called) were left alone until they began to fall from the sky due to orbital decay. After one of those fell on a brewery, disturbing beer supply for weeks and leading to social unrest, the space cities plan was finally set into motion! (Use those dryers to stop them from raining down!)\n\nThis is where you come in! Your task is to collect those dryers (just ram into them with your ship) but it is a challenging and unforgiving job. You will NOT be forgiven if you fail to collect even one dryer, and you must spare your fuel (and make more using your asteroid-to-fuel converter beam)", "summary": "Part of the DOS Games June 2023 Jam.\n\nPlay as long as you can and try to beat your own score.\n\nCollect clothes dryers (to prevent them from eventually falling on cities below) without missing any, and don't crash into the cities yourself!\n\nThe ship has very little fuel on-board, and every action (thrust, shots) use some fuel. Make more fuel by shooting asteroids, with your asteroid-to-fuel converter beam.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orbit-salvager", "videos": [{"id": 98256, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "o5fuY2XDcvk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5fuY2XDcvk", "title": "Orbit Salvager (CGA DOS game)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o5fuY2XDcvk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
