The numbers can sum up to 5 along the row, column or diagonally.\nNumbers get cleared up when they add to 5 so that more numbers can be placed. When none of the rows/columns/diagonals add to 5 and the 9x9 cells fill up, the game is over. The game supports two modes - infinite and timed mode. Friends can challenge each other for high scores in timed mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/555"}
