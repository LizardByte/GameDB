Disgaea 2 is the sequel to 2003's Disgaea: Hour of Darkness and was released for the PlayStation 2. It is also the predecessor to Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice for the PlayStation 3.\n\nUnlike Nippon Ichi's previous games, Disgaea 2 is on DVD-ROM and has an animated opening movie. It was re-released for the PlayStation Portable as Disgaea 2 Portable (\u9b54\u754c\u6226\u8a18\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30ac\u30a4\u30a2 2 PORTABLE Makai Senki Disugaia 2 P\u014dtaburu?) in Japan and as Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days in North America and Europe. It also is available on playstation store (PSN) for digital download distribution.\n\nStory:\nFifteen years ago, a powerful Overlord by the name of Zenon appeared in Veldime and cursed its human population. Since then, all its inhabitants have become demons and are to remain that way if the curse was not broken. However, a young man named Adell was the only human unaffected by the curse. Wanting to save his family and return them back to their true form, Adell decides to seek out Overlord Zenon and defeat him. Adell's mother tries to summon Zenon and fails, but instead summons Rozalin, Zenon's daughter. They later go on a quest to find Zenon and return Rozalin to him, and then defeat him so that the curse would be lifted, making his family and the rest of the world human again.\n\nMain Characters:\nAdell (\u30a2\u30c7\u30eb  Aderu?): The main character of Disgaea 2. Adell is the only human left on Veldime, and has been training for years to defeat Zenon and lift the curse. Courageous and determined, Adell dislikes women, demons and lies, and will never back down from any challenge or resort to dirty tactics. He is nice to those he cares about and will never ever break a promise. Voice actor: Hikaru Midorikawa (JPN) / Shiloh Strong (US)\nRozalin (\u30ed\u30b6\u30ea\u30f3\u30c9 Rozarindo?): The only daughter of Overlord Zenon. Rozalin was summoned during a failed attempt by Adell's mother to summon Zenon. Due to the summoning contract placed on her, she is unable to leave Adell and must help him find Zenon. Rozalin is unaware of the world around her due to her pampered life, with her books being her sole source of information. Because of this, she has no battle experience and tries (and fails) to get Adell killed indirectly on several occasions. In addition, Adell's vow to bring her back to her father begins to make her think differently.
