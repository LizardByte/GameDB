Probably late evening, perhaps 6 or so. You are a little kid, sitting on your bed, wrapped in a blanket with your \"Game Kid\" handheld device (not backlit) and play your favorite games while your mother brings you some hot cocoa. You don't know it yet but this is the best life will ever be. \n \nThis feeling, the feeling of playing those handheld games back in the day, this is what Pixel Pileup Party is all about. This game collection includes four new \"Game Kid\" styled games in one package, so that you can feel like a child again. Unless of course that kid never was you, in that case you'll encounter four great games styled after a 90s retro device. One way or the other, you'll get some awesome games is what I'm saying.", "summary": "A green on green 4-in-1 game collection styled after the most popular 90's handheld ever!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pixel-pileup-party"}
