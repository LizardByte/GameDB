Industrial ships were rebalanced and optimized, with addition of the Orca-class ship, \"a sub-capital logistical ship with a mining command focus.\" The staged delivery of the expansion began with the recent implementation of new technology such as StacklessIO and EVE64 which upgraded the server hardware and streamlined communication between server and client to reduce lag. These improvements provide performance allowing for player vs. player battles with thousands of participants. Further hardware and software improvements are planned. Other features of the expansion include further graphics updates as started in the Trinity expansion; the ability for players to group their vessels' weapons for easier interaction; changes to autopilot routes and avoidance of player-defined solar systems. This patch also brought a controversial overhaul of the speed system.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eve-online-quantum-rise", "videos": [{"id": 139074, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lKviRpvGXBs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKviRpvGXBs", "title": "EVE Online: Quantum Rise Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lKviRpvGXBs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
