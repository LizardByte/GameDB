I am an indie developer currently working on a small game called Tadpole tales in Unity. The game is about a tiny tadpole cleaning the river and fighting pollution. Alongside I am mostly working with my best friend Giacomo who is an amazing artist/animator. This is my devlog, where I post my weekly/monthly progress either about the game or myself as a game developer in general. \nThank you for checking in! \n\nPeople who works/worked on the Tadpole Tales\nAndrew(me)\nGiacomo - https://www.instagram.com/ginkovonagrum/\nRebecca - https://www.instagram.com/rebeccaperr...\nActEsper - https://www.youtube.com/user/ActBlader\nSebastian - https://www.facebook.com/sorrelltheband/\nTomer - Tomer - https://tomerbarnea.myportfolio.com/\n#indiegame #devlog #gamedevelopment\n\n\n\nContents:\n00:00 Intro\n00:33 Development Updates\n03:32 Life Updates\n04:20 QnA\n05:05 Thank you!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acL5u4K33B0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acL5u4K33B0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acL5u4K33B0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acL5u4K33B0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acL5u4K33B0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "2D Hand Drawn Unity Game || Tadpole Tales Devlog 19", "description": "If you wish to support, please Wishlist our tiny game on Steam! \u2764\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1428900/Tadpole_Tales/\n\n\ud83d\udc38Interested in Playtesting?\ud83d\udc38\nHop on our discord!\n\nScreenshake tutorial - https://youtu.be/8PXPyyVu_6I\n\n\u2665 Let's Connect!\u2665\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/wwwR4Wr\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/zizhen96\nInstagram -https://www.instagram.com/zizhenandrew/\nMy Games - https://zizhen96.itch.io\n\nAbout\nHey, my name is Andrew.
