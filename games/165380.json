To survive as a hired soldier for the powerful nations, players either compete and accomplish the missions in a squad or experience major combats between factions in a disputed territory.\n\nCountless meteorites fell all over the world one day, spurring endless conflicts between powerful nations to secure rare resources named Q-on. Mercenaries are hired for the sake of nations, and people start to call them the \"Crowz\".\n\nA mercenary squad is dispatched to the mission of securing Q-on in an open-world map. However, they are not the only one who are looking for the resources. They must overcome various deadly factors - conflicts with other hired soldiers, devastating environment with fallen meteorites, and side effects of forbidden drugs - and cooperation will be the key to completing the mission.\n\nCrowz, hired by powerful nations, are to be formed in a large troop and secure the Q-on extraction sites in the fields of conflict. Although seen as cold-hearted, these merciless soldiers thirsting for coins are divided into two factions and engage in a massive battlefield to obtain the resources.", "summary": "Powerful nations are dispatching mercenaries to secure Q-On at contaminated sites, off limits to most men.
