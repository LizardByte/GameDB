{"id": "_LqvZpglyJ8", "snippet": {"title": "This doom mod was inspired by one texture.", "description": "Sometime around 10 years ago, I learned about the origin of Knee-Deep in the Dead's mysterious white Phobos sky - the karst mountains of Yangshuo County. Right away, I had an idea - why not make a map taking place there? A Doom 1 mod taking place on Earth would be pretty dang unique. Back then, I didn't really have what it takes... but the idea stayed in my head, and eventually evolved into this: an Episode 1 replacement using my own Bite-Sized Threat Dehacked gameplay mod as a base, starring Lorelei Ni.\n\nIf you played Rise of the Triad (or read the Doom Bible), you know that Lorelei Ni is not much of a beefy bullet sponge, but makes up for it with maximum deadliness. That's why she was the perfect fit for a level set built around Bite-Sized Threat, a mod that adds tension and removes the grind by drastically reducing both enemy health and maximum ammo capacity. Then, since I was already making gameplay changes, I decided to add a few more and keep the Doom 1 bestiary interesting. At the same time, since the Yangshuo Invasion's original premise was \"tell a new story with the default texture\", I tried to keep audiovisual changes to a minimum. You'll see most of the original arsenal and bestiary, but not everything will be as you remember. Not even the episode progression - you get 8 maps total, and one is optional!\n\nTry out Yangshuo Invasion here:\nhttps://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/149122-yangshuo-invasion-unique-vanilla-dehacked-doom-1-episode-ft-lorelei-ni/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LqvZpglyJ8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LqvZpglyJ8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LqvZpglyJ8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LqvZpglyJ8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LqvZpglyJ8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "This doom mod was inspired by one texture.", "description": "Sometime around 10 years ago, I learned about the origin of Knee-Deep in the Dead's mysterious white Phobos sky - the karst mountains of Yangshuo County.
