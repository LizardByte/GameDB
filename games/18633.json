The goal was to fly around and collect sticks to build your nest. The player could also deficate on cars, and make them crash.\nThis game marks the beginning of Ben Daglish as a composer, although all he did was write the notes for the death tune in the game, it is still this game that got him into composing game music for the Commodore 64. The Commodore 64 version was programmed by Anthony Crowther.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/potty-pigeon"}
