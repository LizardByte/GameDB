Beating a table just starts you off at the next table, and there is no ending of any kind. There is also no \u201cpuck\u201d counter, the game simply returns to the stage select screen when you lose a \u201cpuck\u201d.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-pinball", "videos": [{"id": 95631, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CYa8hyY1TWI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYa8hyY1TWI", "title": "Space Pinball (Jpn, Prototype) - Virtual Boy [MESS] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CYa8hyY1TWI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
