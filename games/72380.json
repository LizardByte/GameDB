So this is no job for greenhorns, partner.\n\nThe first job is to bring in the outlaw with $5000 on his ugly mug. Next will come his buddy, worth $10000. The third of these no-good twisters has $15000 printed under his picture. Arrest number four and you pocket a coll $20000!\n\nWhen you've made sure those guys are behind bars, their boss will be calling you out for the showdown. When the smoke clears, only one of you will be standing. It is to be YOU or HIM? Folks say he's faster'n a rattle-snake, so, you'll need every ounce of skill and speed you've got to lay him out.\n\nWin that last gunfight, partner, and you'll go down in the golden legends of the west as the best there ever was!", "summary": "Vertical scrolling shooter, similar to GunSmoke", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wanted--1"}
