Starlight aims to try a structure that (as far as I'm aware) hasn't been tried before in SMW. The game has a hub world that lets you explore and find levels freely, but the stages themselves are linear, like a traditional Mario game. Think Peach's Castle from 64 with about 20ish linear stages instead of open world stages. Yoshi Coins act as the main collectable. The more you collect, the more levels and areas of the hub world you will be able to access.\n\nThe hack features...\n- 30 collectable Yoshi Coins (sorta equivalent to exits, to give a rough idea of length)\n- Fun NPC interactions\n- A new unique story\n- A fully original soundtrack composed by me!! Check my channel for the soundtrack upload if you're interested.\n- Secrets around every corner!\n- Many more mysteries to uncover!\n\n#mario #gaming #smwcentral", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8uvuQc4FTKk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8uvuQc4FTKk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8uvuQc4FTKk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8uvuQc4FTKk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8uvuQc4FTKk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Mario Starlight | Release Trailer (SMW ROM Hack)", "description": "Download here:\nhttps://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=35049\n\nThanks to Nic \"13hz\" for the game's artwork and logo!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@13hz20\n\nThanks to bluejet22 on Fiverr for the incredible Bowser voice recording!\nhttps://www.fiverr.com/bluejet22\n\nAfter what feels like way too long, it's finally here!\n\nSuper Mario Starlight is a solo project that takes a unique spin on a traditional hack.
