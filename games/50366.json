Characters are mostly characters from Les Mis\u00e9rables. Each character has special moves inspired by that character's role in the story. \n \nThere's a special condition where characters are about to die (their health draining away) in which they are much more powerful and have infinite special power: the opponent has to avoid those special attacks until that character dies. This sometimes gives the advantage to players who reach low life first. \n \nThere is also a practice mode, where the player can learn how to perform the special moves of each character."}
