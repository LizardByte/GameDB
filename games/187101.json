Instead of learning build orders by heart, each run of the game opens new ways of play. After every level you choose between three blueprint cards that add a new building to your arsenal, like factories, support buildings, turrets or super weapons. Choose wisely to create powerful synergies and combos that allow you to outsmart the overwhelming force of the enemy hordes. Utilize the nano-darkness of robo-necromancy to swarm your foes or set the maps ablaze with fiery chain reactions consuming forests and opposition alike.\n\nDiscover how to use the environments to your advantage. Lure the enemy into billowing fog that slows them to a crawl or stun them by blowing up electrified bushes. Choose a path that plays to your strengths on the overworld map. Discover chests with exciting power-ups or ruins with hidden technologies that might be the key to victory\u2026 or full of unwanted surprises.", "summary": "Classic RTS gameplay fused with a modern roguelike.
