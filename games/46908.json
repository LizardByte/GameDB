According to programmer Steve Baker, he had originally developed the game for the Apple when he decided to port it to the Atari 5200. Since the 5200 possessed a high resolution mode that was on par with the Apple's, the conversion was pretty straightforward. However one side effect of using the 5200's high-res mode was that the graphics were in black & white only. However most players find that this really doesn't distract much from the game since it uses black and white pieces anyway.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/microgammon-sb"}
