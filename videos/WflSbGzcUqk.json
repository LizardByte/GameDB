This is one of the games besides Blue Print and High Noon I got with my brand new c64 almost 25 years ago. I made a death compilation in the end to demonstrate some of the not so funny ways to die in this game. There are for example some random spawns which are practically impossible to dodge. There are several places in which some of the monsters can spawn in each level and those places seem to be random in sequence. Level 5 is particularly annoying because it's very difficult to stay on the steps without falling.\n\nI never played the first Cavelon, it looks quite different.\n\nhttp://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=440", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WflSbGzcUqk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WflSbGzcUqk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WflSbGzcUqk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[c64] Cavelon 2 (1984)", "description": "I was determined to complete this game, but couldn't do it.
