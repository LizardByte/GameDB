No one got along better than these two catgirls when they were younger, but lately, they've been fighting all the time.\n\nDespite their sisterly love, a small misunderstanding ends up driving a wedge between them. As the story of these catgirl sisters unfolds, they'll grow to understand each other and strengthen their familial bonds in this heartfelt catgirl comedy, which is only a little lewd.
