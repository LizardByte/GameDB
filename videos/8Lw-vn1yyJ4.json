As with most coin-ops, it's extremely tough in later levels, but there's sufficient variety in terms of level design and enemies that it's worth persevering with. What's particularly cool is the way the player's dragon gains or loses heads, depending on how powered up the dragon is, as well as the fact the colour changes, depending on the active weapon.\n\nI reckon the production values for Dragon Spirit are definitely up there with the best coin-ops of the time, and the fantasy theme makes for a change from the usual sci-fi space affairs that dominate the genre - go check it out!\n\nChapters\n---------------------------------------------------\n00:00 Attract mode\n00:20 Area 1\n02:50 Area 2\n05:58 Area 3\n09:42 Area 4\n13:30 Area 5\n15:51 Area 6\n20:07 Area 7\n23:25 Area 8\n25:13 Area 9\n31:25 Ending", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Lw-vn1yyJ4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Lw-vn1yyJ4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Lw-vn1yyJ4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Lw-vn1yyJ4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Lw-vn1yyJ4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dragon Spirit Longplay (Arcade) [QHD]", "description": "Game Info\n---------------------------------------------------\nDeveloper: Namco\nPublisher: Namco\nYear of Release: 1987\n\nGame Review & Impressions\n---------------------------------------------------\nAnother mid 80s arcade game more recognised for its home conversions than the actual coin-op, Dragon Spirit certainly looks impressive for 1986.
