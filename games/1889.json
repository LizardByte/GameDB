Godric and Anwen previously appeared as playable characters in Heroes V, while further returning characters shown in screenshots include Cyrus, Findan and Markal. The protagonists have been described as five lost children whose lives are shattered by \"a mysterious Demon Lord with very sinister motives\". This demon lord turns out to be Azh Rafir, Nadia's father, who had devised a mad scheme to use a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding to open the gates to the demon world of Sheogh and drown Ashan in chaos. He is shown to worship Urgash, the dragon of chaos, in Fiona's story. It is also shown, in Aidan's story, that Aidan had unknowingly taken the Blade of Binding. After the revelation that her own father had broken her life and those of her friends, a heartbroken Nadia decides to fight Azh Rafir in his demon lord form in the story's climax. After vanquishing him, she destroys the Blade of Binding and finally derails his scheme, bringing peace to Ashan.", "summary": "Scattered across five different regions, five special heroes must travel their own dangerous paths to grow in strength, unravel a demonic plot & ultimately save the world from chaos.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 5856, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OPbBIoCSeCY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPbBIoCSeCY", "title": "Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes | Launch Trailer [North America]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OPbBIoCSeCY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
