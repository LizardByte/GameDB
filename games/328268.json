Modeled after the single \"Helena\", the game consisted of four levels, the first three of which are top-down shooters. The goal of these levels is to defeat the enemies in red and activate the four pall bearers. Each level has the same layout with an increasing number of enemies and alternating color scheme. The fourth and final level of the game involves a hearse chase and shootout while avoiding obstacles on the road. While the game has been removed from the official website, it can still be played on Albino Blacksheep.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-chemical-romance-helena"}
