There are only three stadiums to pick from; two are generic but the other is the baseball field from the movie Field of Dreams.\n\nThere are several modes such as exhibition games, All-Star Game, the Home Run Derby, and a pennant race. The gameplay is similar to other baseball games, certain buttons to swing the bat and bunting or selecting pitches.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sporting-news-baseball"}
