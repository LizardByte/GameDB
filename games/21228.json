The God\u2019s Envoy is deep meditative state and cannot directly intervene in the situation on Earth.\nMarcus is aware that he is too weak to destroy the God\u2019s Envoy, so he sets free hordes of infernal monsters in order to harvest human souls and later keep them in Golden Tanks. Each new soul makes Marcus more powerful, while the God\u2019s Envoy becomes weaker and weaker. And then one day\u2026 For many years the Mystery Guards Fraternities have trained Hunters to fight the evil. Hard-bitten, well trained in magic and alchemy, they traversed the world fighting against the powers of darkness. Now, their Fraternities need them back to face the whole army of infernal beasts.
