His father explored lost places and donated any treasures he found to let the world see it. However, there had been one treasure he never managed to locate and retrieve: The golden hazelnut of an ancient squirrel temple. Everything he found out about it had been written down in his diary which Scout years later recovered and further researched and eventually located the temple. Now he needs your help to explore the it's secrets and show the world his father's life's work!\n\n'Scout' is a short and compact, atmospheric adventure game, mainly focusing on creating a harmonic environment and nice, simple graphics rather than complex gameplay and features. The goal is to encourage the player to take their time while playing, stop occasionally and just have a look around instead of rushing through it, while still enjoying this ride!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
