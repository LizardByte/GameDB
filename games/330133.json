Giant corporations and the ultra-wealthy have seized all power, acting with impunity to serve their own interests, leaving the majority of the population struggling to survive.\n\nThis drives people from all over the world to risk everything and participate in the NCORE show. The competition is fierce, and only the best of the best earn a chance to prove themselves in the arena.\n\nAll participants must undergo a special procedure, where their consciousness is transferred into a highly durable and powerful synthetic body. It is in this form that they perform on the battlefield.\n\nWith each passing year, more and more gladiators enter the fray, driving the show\u2019s ratings to unprecedented heights. But for the creators of NCORE, this is still not enough. They continue sending scouts to seek out new, unpolished gems.\n\nThey are not just looking for fighters\u2014they are seeking superstars, those who will captivate and keep the entire world glued to their screens.", "summary": "This is a free PvPvE multi-arena shooter in the format of an entertainment show.\n\nFight alongside your teammates in a virtual multi-arena for the right to become NCORE champions!

You can move between hexes, raid bosses, ambush other players, or charge straight into battle.
