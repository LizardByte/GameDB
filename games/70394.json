He meticulously recreated it, but it closed again after only minutes.\n\nThere was no doubt, he had created some kind of disruption in the space-time continuum!\n\nHe was going to need more power to stabilize this thing.\n\nA LOT more power\u2026\nA space-worthy craft was built to enter the portal. They called it a Disrupter Ship.\n\nA space-worthy craft was built to enter the portal. They called it a Disrupter Ship.\n\nAn opportunistic financier named Sidney Trawle learned of Percy\u2019s discovery and the quandary he faced.\n\nTrawle believed the safest way to enter this anomaly would be aboard a space-worthy vessel with enough power to create the disruption field and enter the portal while, at the same time, protecting the people inside from whatever lay in wait.\n\nHe approached Percy with the idea and they immediately began construction of a powerful disruption field generator built into a spacecraft capable of carrying a crew and everything they might need.\n\nThey called it a Disrupter ship.\n\nUpon completion, the ship was christened \u201cThe Magellan\u201d, and a crew of the best and brightest scientists and engineers was assembled to sail into the unknown.\n\nA salty dog named Jake Blade was chosen to be the Captain.\n\nThe dangers of the mission were great, and they knew that if they left, they may never return.\n\nThey said their goodbyes \u2014 and boarded the ship\u2026\nThey said their good-byes and boarded the ship.\n\nThey said their good-byes and boarded the ship\n\nWith the power of her massive plasma engines, the Magellan created a disruption field, opening a new portal.\n\nHer white-knuckled crew held tight as she moved slowly towards it.\n\nA sound like thundering tornadoes shook the ship. It lurched forward and seemed to stretch as it entered the whirling portal.\n\nBodies, equipment and lights became ribbons of color as they moved forward in slow motion.\n\nA frightening wave of metallic clanking rippled down the ship and then suddenly, there was silence.\nThey found themselves in a vast empty space.\n\nThey found themselves in a vast empty space.\n\nThe inky blackness of space enveloped them.\n\nFor several days they sent out probes and scanned the emptiness with only the distant sun as a guide.\n\nThey had entered a solar system they later called Solone.\n\nThen one day they spotted the faint golden glow of what turned out to be a small planet. It was a cloud-covered orb with a thick, but breathable atmosphere.\n\nThey named it Aureus after a gold coin of ancient Rome.\n\nOver the next few years, the spacecraft made countless trips back and forth through the portal, gathering supplies and equipment.\n\nOn a great, round platform high above the clouds where the atmosphere was optimal, the first Sky City was erected on Aureus.\n\nIt would soon become a social, financial, and governing hub of the Solone System.\nOver the years they built the first Sky City on a planet they called Aureus.\n\nOver the years they built the first Sky City on a planet they called Aureus.\n\nAs more habitable planets are discovered, they find each planet dotted with remnants of civilizations, seemingly familiar to those found on Earth in more ancient times.\n\nAnd yet, no human life is detected, what happened to them all?\n\nShoving the mystery and potential danger aside, Trawle\u2019s mind races with a focus on opportunity.\n\nHe quickly forms the AlterVerse Corporation with the intent to build more ships and bring in settlers.\n\nHe and the ranking members of the Magellan decide that they should protect the integrity of these \u201chome worlds\u201d and restore the villages to their previous condition.\n\nThey knew that governments and local currencies would need to be established, work began in earnest.\n\nSettlers will have the unique opportunity to adapt to the customs and lifestyles of the former inhabitants with the added thrill of interplanetary experiences they mused.\n\nFor Trawle, there was going to be ample opportunity to benefit from this new \u201cwild west\u201d adventure.\nMore habitable planets and resource rich moons are discovered in the Solone System.\n\nMore habitable planets and resource rich moons are discovered in the Solone System.\n\nThe first Disrupter ships rolled off the production line and sales began in early 2019.\n\nThe Captains of the newly minted mega-ships began recruiting members for their Alliances as they prepared for their first foray\u2026into the AlterVerse.", "summary": "Disruption is the first of several planned games in the AlterVerse.
