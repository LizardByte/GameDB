You have at your disposal a crude but effective bat and (I assume) nerves of steel. Your castle is surrounded by a brick wall that crumbles whenever it gets hit by the malevolent ball. Defend it valiantly, for a hit to its core will lose you a life (bat). Stick around until your opponents lose their castles and you will progress to a new screen. Be careful - you have only three lives with which to brave the 20 screens and the last screen hides a nasty surprise!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 34906, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "uqIbyIx_qnw"}]}
