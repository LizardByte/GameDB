Dr Heimloch stands at the helm - in the shadow of this egotistical genius dangles the fate of Earth's very existence.\n\nWhen Huxley-5 is triggered, the resulting time-flux detonation - guided by tenuous threads of science and courage - will propel the moonbase, and the lives of those within it back through the fabric of parallel universes, to the dawn of a new day to start the fight again.\n\nA sense of expectation lingers, as ace pilot, Stella Novastorm flies the last surviving Hyper Sentinel \u2013 a super fighter from an almost forgotten time \u2013 on its inaugural test-flight over the long-dead remains of a seemingly inactive Alienoid Dreadnaught.", "summary": "An intense shoot-em-up + roguelite fusion.
