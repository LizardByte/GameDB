Moments later, flames engulfed the training grounds and its surroundings, ruthlessly consuming everything in their wake. With no time to lose, Spiritia and her fairy companion Lilli rushed into the burning forest in pursuit.\nMaking her way through the roaring flames, Spiritia was overjoyed to find her best friend, the cool and collected Freudia Neuwahl, already on the scene. However, her joy quickly turned to horror as she learned the identity of the arsonists; her own organization of magicians, Rosenkreuzstilette, with Freudia herself leading the assault.\nFreudia informed Spiritia of the unit's decision to rise against the injustices fostered by the Empire, inviting her to rejoin their comrades as they declared war on mankind. Not one to tolerate the suffering of innocents, Spiritia refused - and vowed to stop her comrades from making a senseless and deadly mistake.\nJoin Spiritia in her quest to stop Rosenkreuzstilette, a company of rogue magicians led by Count Zeppelin himself.
