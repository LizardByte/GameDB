However, environmentalist pressure is threatening Orion Burger's pretense that it only uses unintelligent raw materials, forcing Zlarg to abduct pet shop assistant Wilbur Wafflemeier from the sleepy American town of Boonsville and test him for sentience before scouring his planet clean.\n\nZlarg is still brazen enough to rig the tests, so that no creature can pass it, and \u2014 like planned \u2014 Wilbur fails miserably. In accordance with inter-galactic abduction protocol, he is supposed to be returned to the moment he left and remember nothing, but he gets a helping hand from the alien-rights activist Astra, who has smuggled herself on board the ship and sabotaged the teleporter. Wilbur arrives intact to a time one hour before his abduction with knowledge of what is going to happen, and has a chance to cheat back.", "summary": "Orion Burger is a point and click game featuring a young man trying to save the Earth from an interstellar fast food chain through a time loop.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orion-burger", "videos": [{"id": 136415, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "z1hS6KaTURE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1hS6KaTURE", "title": "Orion Burger (PC) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z1hS6KaTURE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
