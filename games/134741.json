Since part of it caved in due to a mysterious explosion, the village is haunted at night by dangerous creatures that have already caused one casualty: Terence the Baker. With your companions, you decide to help the villagers (for a handsome reward of course as nobody works for free nowadays) to get rid of said monsters. What starts as a simple \"cleaning operation\" of the mines quickly evolves into an epic drama about lost civilizations, historic guilt, race disputes, and difficult choices about loyalty, justice, and trust. And yes, there is also a love story or two, depending on your choices.", "summary": "Explore forgotten worlds and deadly dungeons with your companions, make difficult choices and endure their consequences.
