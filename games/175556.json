With beautiful graphics and music full of Sinicism, this game brings you back to China and offers you many hours of relaxing fun. As in ordinary mahjong solitaire, the challenge is to eliminate all the tiles from the board, but you need to clear one pair in a particular way. You remove similar tiles in pairs only if you can connect them by a maximum of three lines crossing no other tiles. While the game is full of challenges, it is very easy to play. Rivers Mahjong will fill your every need, whether you want a real challenge, or just a quiet relaxing game of mahjong solitaire. It's never short of fun along the journey."}
