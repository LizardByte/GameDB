London, 1969 was released on 31 March 1999 for DOS, Microsoft Windows. In April 1999, a version for Sony's PlayStation was released. The game uses the same game engine as Grand Theft Auto, thus giving the game graphics and gameplay similar to Grand Theft Auto.

London, 1969 was the first expansion pack released for PlayStation.[1]\r\n\r\nThe expansion introduces 30 new vehicles, 32 new missions, and instead of fictional locations based on real-life cities, as in Grand Theft Auto (Liberty City, San Andreas and Vice City), the game takes place in London in 1969.
