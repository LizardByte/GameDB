In this mode, players are dropped into a modified level and must get to a designated point as quickly as possible whilst simultaneously killing as many enemies as possible and being as accurate as possible. Graphically, this versions is equivalent to the PC version on maximum settings with an high dynamic range lighting, an advanced particle system and HD textures. It also features an exclusive bonus level not found in the PC original, which depicts Holiday's attempt to extract Bishop from ATC headquarters. These versions also features a new weapon, dual wielded automatic handguns.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 port of F.E.A.R. features the same Instant Action mode from the Xbox 360 version. It also has its own exclusive additional weapon (a street sweeper shotgun) and bonus mission, which depicts the Delta Force recon team's journey through ATC headquarters prior to encountering Alma. Like the Xbox version, the game's native resolution was 720p, but the other enhancements were removed for this version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fear--1", "collections": [{"id": 95, "name": "F.E.A.R."}]}
