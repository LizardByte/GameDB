It has suspiciously similar sprites and music to the former but plays more like the latter with its scrolling stages and lack of ground attacks or tornado throws. It has an absurd visual style including a main character that's wearing red leopard pants and white sunglasses.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mug-smashers", "videos": [{"id": 49443, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "1dQZmVF3EI4"}, {"id": 49444, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FbRQMFHQuVU"}]}
