Master tricky obstacles, find shortcuts and use an arsenal of different powerups. Experience a dynamic environment with moving blocks, water physics and changing weather.\n\nFeatures:\n\nProcedurally generated tracks: All tracks are randomly generated. Choose your difficulty level and track length. Never play the same track twice!\n\nMultiplayer: Compete against your friends in chaotic races! Make use of an arsenal of different powerups or simply push your opponent off the road.\n\nDynamic environment: Dynamic weather and water simulation. Race during the night or be washed away by a wave during a storm!\n\nChoose between four different cars: Paint your car, equip a hat, and choose an annoying horn. Beware that each car has different weaknesses and disadvantages!\n\nMaster tricky obstacles: Trackmaster includes a large number of different track parts. Learn how to drive in loops and rotating barrels.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings: This is no ordinary racing game. Finding the way is just as important as driving skills.
