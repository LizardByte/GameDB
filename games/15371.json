You are flying the Skyfox, the most advanced attack fighter plane available to the Federation, from within the cockpit. Skyfox is complete with deflection shields, laser cannons, five guided and five heat-seeking missiles and a top speed of Mach IV. The 15 scenarios can be played at 5 skill levels.
