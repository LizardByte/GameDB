The goal of the game is to explore and collect Costumes. There are also tokens that can be found throughout the virtual world.\n\nWhen you were still in high school, the only social MMO you ever consistently played was Any.One Online.

But that was years ago: even though the servers are still running, Any.One Online is practically a virtual ghost town. For nostalgia's sake, however, you decide to log back in. What you find is a surreal landscape only barely related to what you remember, a decade\u2019s worth of unsupported code, scattered costumes, and the looming feeling that something's not right\u2026", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/any-dot-one-online"}
