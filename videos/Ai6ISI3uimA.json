Bribe your way onto early departures, but don't let yourself go bankrupt or you'll be sleeping rough and begging for aid! Trade items for profit, and collect the equipment for the conditions you'll face: but too much luggage will slow you down... \n\n80 DAYS is a breakneck race, with an in-game clock that never stops running. Trains, steamers, hot-air balloons, boats, camels, horses and more leave and arrive minute by minute. \n\nEvery city and journey is narrated via an interactive story where you control every action. Will your choices speed you up - or lead you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust and respect? Will you uncover the secrets and short-cuts that can shave days off your time? Murder, romance, rebellion and intrigue await! \n\nThe app is network-connected, with a live feed that shows you the position of all the other players of the game, their routes, triumphs and disasters. You can race to be the fastest - or look ahead to learn the secrets of the world. \n\nShare your own journey with friends, and load other's routes directly into your app so you can race head-to-head. \n\n80 DAYS is a complete experience, with no in-app purchases, and was made by a core team of just four people. If you enjoy it, check out our Sorcery! series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R25p1u_ggzo). \n\nMusic by Laurence Chapman", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ai6ISI3uimA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ai6ISI3uimA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ai6ISI3uimA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ai6ISI3uimA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ai6ISI3uimA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "80 Days launch trailer", "description": "Real-time, massively-branching multiplayer interactive fiction: available on the App Store: http://appstore.com/80days (It's release day!
