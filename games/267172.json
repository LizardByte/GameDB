When he eventually runs out of food, he seeks help at the website 4chan but they only mock him, so he decides to finally venture outside and buy food.\n\nWith the help of a sarcastic tutorial owl he has to search for a 9 eleven shop. Once inside however, he is incapable of purchasing the food and his mind transforms the shop into a dungeon where he has to fight cans of soft drinks and hot dogs. The game consists of four main dungeons with a final boss and alternate endings based on some decisions in the game.\n\nThe character's basic attack is screaming, but after gaining experience he can learn new talents. While walking around he is dragged into random battles where he can also choose to run away. The statistics are based on energy and stamina. Saving is done by writing a livejournal blog entry and he shop online at Amazon. There are also some vending machines to buy drinks that replenish stamina. Other statistics are confidence, willpower and mindpower, he can wear weapons in his left and right hand (initially a fist of dork), a hat, a shirt and other accessories.\n\nThe game is very difficult. Some of the graphics are done by Paul Robertson, famous for the animated film Pirate Baby's Cabana Battle Street Fight 2006.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hikkikomori-quest"}
