You can move your player around using the arrow keys or wasd. If you're in your own area, you're safe, but once you leave your area you'll leave a trail behind, once anyone (including yourself) hits that trail, you die. When you get back to your area, the blocks that you have surrounded will be yours. But watch out, because anyone can steal back those blocks at any time. If you surround a couple of blocks while there is another player inside, the land won't get filled with your blocks.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/splix-dot-io"}
