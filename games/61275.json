To fulfill this desire, she leaves the town where she has comfortably lived, and ventures to the port, King\u2019s Bridge.\n\nShortly after her arrival, she gets caught up in a tussle and ends up acting in unison with pirates. From then on, she grew interested in them. Two methods of being able to go to sea appear before her- one being \u201cpirates\u201d, and the other, the \u201cnavy\u201d.\n\nWill she choose to live her life as a pirate aboard their ship; joining the elusive and whimsical crew lead by its chivalrous yet self-centred ore-sama captain and the always calm, cool and collected deputy captain with a scary smile? Or will she join the ranks of the navy; answering to a young-looking naval commanding officer who\u2019s proud of his nobility and the older, taciturn deputy commanding officer who exudes an aura of depth?\n\nWhich will the protagonist choose? What kind of adventurer will she become? Who will become the closest partner at her side?", "summary": "Rian Lawrence is a 16-year-old girl whose mother passed away when she was a child and now her father has gone missing.
