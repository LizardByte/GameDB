It is specifically intended to be used in a clinical context as part of a psycho-education package to enhance friends' and relatives' understanding of people suffering from depression about what their loved ones are going through.\n\nModeling what depression feels like by contrasting it with other mood states (normal and happy), Elude portrays depression metaphorically. The various parts of the game-world represent emotional landscapes that correspond to different moods with the gameplay changing according to mood changes. The core gameplay (i.e. \"normal mood\") happens in a forest filled with \"passion\" objects that resonate and act as power ups when one calls out to them. Only when infused with passion is it possible to overcome the obstacles on the way to the tree tops, where one reaches \"happiness\".", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "videos": [{"id": 51276, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OyNizfNd4mA"}]}
