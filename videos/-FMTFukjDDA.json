{"id": "-FMTFukjDDA", "snippet": {"title": "Philosoma (PS1)", "description": "This video was capture using the actual game on an actual Sony Playstation. The beginning cut-scene was left in for those who wanna know the story. I apologize for the lack of contrast and brightness in the beginning of this video as that part of the game is a little too dark for my cheap capture device to pick up well. \n\nPronounced \"fill-ahh-so-mah\" this is one of the most unique shooters I have ever come across. This was a launch title on the Playstation and it shows due to the presence of heavy full motion video use. However the full motion video sequences are not used in the typical manner that most games in that day used it. As you can see the game launches into a rather long cinematic immediately, but then does something quite unexpected at the end when it shows your ship flying into position and then going into real time. As you can see the transitions are anything but seamless going from the look of the FMV to the daunting real time graphics, but it was kinda cool back in the day nonetheless. My hats off to the developers trying to do something completely different with ever annoying full motion video that was seemingly going to plague games forever. Thank God it didn't.     \n\nOther things that make Philosoma so unique is the transition into all different kinds of perspectives of game play for better or for worse. At times it really feels gimmicky. In the perspective when you're behind your ship, the game plays exactly like Nova Storm on the PC/PS1 or Iridion 3D on the GBA. Not a good thing. Then there is the shooting behind you thing with that little pea shooter. Not very inspiring. Overall the game play mechanics are just a mixed bag. Some good, some not so good, but not really game breaking, just a little annoying if not just straight up stupid sometimes. Philosoma really attempts to make you feel like you're not fighting alone even though you are 100% fighting everybody alone. They have all the radio chatter and story progression built right into the game play. It's actually quite comical that you meet back up with your squad at many of the transitions only to be totally abandon time and time again. I personally don't have any problems with that since I like doing everything myself, but it's still funny. The game can be quite frustrating at times. Sometimes it even seems cheap. As a matter of fact I just about wrote this game off last night while I was playing just frustrated at how big my ship's sprite is and how close I am to the enemy on screen. Then there are the enemies that twirl in suddenly from the background which is very distracting and fire at you almost immediately. Also there are NO checkpoints in the middle of these stages. If you lose all your ships, you have 3 credits that take you all the way back to the beginning of the phase. That's freakin' hardcore. I actually decided not to write the game off while I was making this capture. I actually got into the groove of things and made it further than I had in previous sittings. It was kinda fun. I discovered one of the things that was making the game so frustrating to me. Unlike  most shooters (classic & modern) the enemy actually is shooting at your current position. With the exception of the bosses, the enemy does not fire set bullet patterns. Plus their bullets are kinda quick. Once I got that down it became easier to dodge enemy fire. Also getting used to the weapon power up system which at first seamed kinda tedious became like second nature.   \n\nSo does Philosma deliver the goods? In sort of a unique mediocre way I believe it does. The music is very uninspiring much like Slipheed on the PS2. The weapon sounds are below average except for the charge weapon that I used on Doggy House which reminds me of Total Recall. Explosions are par for the course. Overall I think Philosoma is worth owning just because of how unique it is. It was not revolutionary because most of what makes it unique were mostly gimmicks. Plus shooters like Panzer Dragoon which came out before this game were already completely 3D and allowed you to fire in 360 degrees. Even so, Philosoma is one of a kind because of it's gimmicks that were never used again after it was made. So if you're a fan of shooters and see this game for around 10 bucks or so, I would say pick it up.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-FMTFukjDDA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-FMTFukjDDA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-FMTFukjDDA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-FMTFukjDDA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Philosoma (PS1)", "description": "This video was capture using the actual game on an actual Sony Playstation.
