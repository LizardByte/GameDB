Both sides fought desperately for control over Terra. In the end, there was no victor. The battles ended up leaving the humans and the beasts decimated. The survivors did not have the strength to keep fighting. They no longer fought for control of the planet. They merely struggled to stay alive. 2000 years later...", "summary": "Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible II is a role-playing video game series developed by Multimedia Intelligence Transfer, Sega, and Menue, and published by Atlus and Sega for multiple platforms.
