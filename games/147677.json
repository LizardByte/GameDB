Sounds easy; but, with relentless enemies, zany Mayday events, and unusual water hazards trying to hinder your progress, the goal is anything but easy! Smash Boats includes many unique pools to smash in, including a toy chest, a pool table and even a toilet! The game features 16 distinctive boats that have to be earned via sinking enemies and/or collecting stars by clearing stages. Each boat has a unique smash-ability, such as: frying pan, shark bite, lasers, water-pound, and many more. And with other moves like submerge, ram, backward ram, power-turn and brake, the player has an assortment of smash moves at their disposal to conquer stages, and collect stars. Collect enough stars and you will unlock new boats and pools! Can you become the ultimate Smasher by completing the insane shower pool?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smash-boats", "videos": [{"id": 67321, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iMilnMedvzQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMilnMedvzQ", "title": "SMASH BOATS on Nintendo Switch (Older)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iMilnMedvzQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
