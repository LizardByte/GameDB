The Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition features a making-of DVD, as well as a RE artbook and an art cell of Ada Wong.\n\nThe fourth installment of Capcom's pivotal \"Survival Horror\" series continues on Nintendo GameCube and PS2. The title takes place in 2004 some six years after the events that transpired in Resident Evil 2. The government has destroyed the Umbrella Corporation, which has been behind just about every plot and disgusting bio-chemical mutation in the survival horror series. Now-US agent Leon Kennedy (of Resident Evil 2 fame) has been dispatched to Europe to save the President's daughter from \"crazed organizations.\" RE4 boasts some of the most impressive visuals to date on Nintendo's next generation console, and takes the series into the realm of truly three-dimensional gameplay. Stagnant environments found in previous Resident Evil games are replaced by detailed 3D surroundings complete with dynamic camera work.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-4-premium-edition"}
