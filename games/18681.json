It was developed exclusively for the PlayStation by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. It was available in Europe and Japan but not North America, as ESPN MLS GameNight was released in that territory instead.\n\nIt is the first ISS Pro game with proper licenses, although partial, with some players having real names. The game has an extended Master League, with two divisions and eight more clubs, resulting in twenty-four club teams, such as Leeds United and Boca Juniors. More international teams were added as well. The gameplay also changed, becoming smoother and more realistic. The Japanese version of the game also contains Under-23 National Teams, which are not present in the European versions of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iss-pro-evolution-2", "videos": [{"id": 75987, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xWiYB72sHO8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWiYB72sHO8", "title": "Winning Eleven 2000 U-23 - Peru vs Spain - World Cup - Final", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xWiYB72sHO8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
