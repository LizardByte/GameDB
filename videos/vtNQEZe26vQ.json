Trying to understand herself, she is walking on thin ice, and only you will know the truth after delving into the depths of her mind.\n\nHave you ever wondered what memories are? Can we affect or change them? Maybe they affect us instead? Maria, the story's protagonist, tries to understand herself and find the right way in a row of confusing events. You have to realize what is a reality and what is an illusion. Do false memories exist? Can we recognize them?\n\nParamnesia is a visual novel with the story told in a non-chronological order. You must travel through the heroine's memory fragments, but be careful: some of them might be false. Whether you manage to distinguish true from false will determine the ending. The novel includes three endings, but only one reveals the truth.\n\nTraveling through Maria's memories will happen with a program visually resembling a file grid that initially grants access to memories located on its edges. Your task is to move towards the center. Not all the files are Maria's memories, but they can provide information that will help you unveil the truth.\n\nThe game has 6 types of files:\nConfession - the narration of Maria.\nEtude - performed from the 3rd person.\nDatabase - information about sects.\nSMS - letters that Maria receives from the sect.\nAdditional files - open with the right choice in the \"Confession.\"\nEncrypted files.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.tiktok.com/@meridian4.games \n\u27a1\ufe0f https://discord.com/invite/adMSaZK32K\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://twitter.com/Meridian4\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.instagram.com/meridian_4/\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.youtube.com/c/Meridian4\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://www.facebook.com/Meridian4", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtNQEZe26vQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtNQEZe26vQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtNQEZe26vQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtNQEZe26vQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtNQEZe26vQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Paramnesia official trailer", "description": "Paramnesia is an interactive detective visual novel where Maria, the protagonist of this story, is a member of two radical sects with contradictory opinions.
