The game tells a science fiction ghost story, set in the not-too-distant future. Players take the role of a newlywed, off for a honeymoon on the moon. The vessel crashes before reaching its lunar resort destination, however, separating the just-married couple and leaving the hero alone at an abandoned research base. Players explore the station from a first-person perspective, inside a spacesuit. In addition to the many spiritual anomalies that haunt the forgotten station, strange lunar lighting and relative weightlessness add to the atmosphere of the game's environments.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/echo-night-beyond", "videos": [{"id": 3701, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NyzcaY80UIU"}]}
