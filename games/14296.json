Players will explore new worlds protected by giant god-like guardians, filled with ancient temple ruins, and littered with puzzles to solve and treasures to collect. \n \nA truly unique adventure, Kromaia\u2019s approach to gameplay looks to bring new life to the shmup genre. Providing players with full 360\u02da freedom to fly, spin, and shoot changes the traditional style of arcade shmups significantly. Also, Kromaia\u2019s adaptive AI creates a special kind of emergent gameplay: one that changes variables like enemy speed and formations to offer new, uniquely tailored experiences depending on how the game is played. Combine this with several ultra-maneuverable Armors (pilotable ships/vessels), all with different attributes, and a wide range of ancient, alien worlds to explore, and players have a game that changes the genre forever.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kromaia-o", "videos": [{"id": 6017, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Bd0RfivZmAg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd0RfivZmAg", "title": "Kromaia: Omega - PS4 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bd0RfivZmAg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
