The file selection menu shows the player\u2019s equipment, and as an added bonus, the player\u2019s health is now saved (no need to grind for health every time you resume your game). The save system can be a handy addition for those who don\u2019t like to use save-states, or those playing on a flash-cart.\n\nIncluded is a scrollable map when the game is paused and the ability to combine wave and ice beams.\n\nVersion 0.3 fixes a bug that could prevent the game from booting correctly in some cases. The hack has been tested and confirmed to work on the PowerPak as well as a normal cart.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metroid-plus-saving"}
