It's actually quite fun to play, although the fact that passing, punching and swapping control of the players is all handled by a single button; I regularly found myself tackling the guy and then throwing the ball back towards my own goal line accidentally.\n\nWhere as Speedball 2 placed a lot more emphasis on scoring goals, this game begs you to inflict violence on the other team. A large number of power-ups appear on the pitch, including bombs and sword, all of which can be used to stab, poke and eventually decapitate the opposing team. In fact, if you kill enough of the opposing squad then your team wins by default.\n\nOne small touch that I really loved about this game was the way the pitch gets scored, gouged and covered in craters so by the end of the match it really looks like you've fought a war on the pitch instead of a game of football.\n\nThis video shows the A1200 AGA version, which has a significantly upgraded colour palette over the OCS/ECS original. In fact, all of the graphics appear to have been redrawn for this version.\n\nEnjoy!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_E8zyDUTKKI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_E8zyDUTKKI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_E8zyDUTKKI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_E8zyDUTKKI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_E8zyDUTKKI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Brutal Sports Football (Amiga AGA Version) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Teque Software and published by Millenium in 1993.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nAfter playing a round of this I figured that having seen one match, you've pretty much seen everything there is to see, so here is a single match from Brutal Sports Football rather than a longplay.\n\nThe game is clearly inspired by Speedball 2 and, to be fair, it's not just a knock-off of the Bitmap Brothers seminal title.
