While similar games have opted for an expansion in both strategical and mechanical usage, RUiN opts to head the other direction. We create fun and depth from simplicity. Our game stands tall on the fact that it's built on pure, intense combat. Players select their preferred set of skills from an ever-expanding pool and duke it out on various dynamic arenas. RUiN is set in a fantasy world that mirrors the core values of the game; it's vibrant, fantastic and of course intensely fun.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ruin"}
