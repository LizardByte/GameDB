You control a white U-shaped fighter craft with a variety of weapons, and fly missions on various Single Biome Planets destroying ground and air targets and accomplishing specific other objectives, such as rescuing hostages.\nThe interesting inversion is in the plot- you work for The Empire, attempting to suppress the forces of La R\u00e9sistance. In practice, The Empire is more The Federation and La R\u00e9sistance are no heroic Ragtag Bunch of Misfits, so it winds up seeming like Gray and Grey Morality.\nFire Fight has some impressive-looking sprites, satisfying sound effects, excellent music, a decent dialogue and a nice variety of missions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-fight", "videos": [{"id": 5173, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "IrTz2SpsIXA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrTz2SpsIXA", "title": "Fire Fight (1996) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IrTz2SpsIXA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
