As for what else is included, take a gander below:\n\nSonic Adventure + DX DLC\nSonic Adventure 2 + Battle DLC\nSonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 1\nSonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2\nSonic 3D Blast (Steam Only)\nSonic Spinball (Steam Only)\nSonic the Fighters (Xbox Only)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-legacy-bundle"}
