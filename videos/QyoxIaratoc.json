I'd been wanting to get the powerups working before posting a new video, and a really annoying bug got in the way - past tense, because it's now solved, and there's powerups in Sombrero!\n\nMore updates will be coming more quickly as Sombrero gets closer to release.\n\n*** It seems I only uploaded 720p/60fps footage. I'll make sure the next update is 1080p/60fps. On my development workstation with an EVGA 770 the game runs perfectly smooth at 2560x1440/60fps, so if you've got a decent GPU you should have no issues getting ultra smooth gameplay as well.\n\nSombrero Website: http://sombrerogame.com\nPixelMetal Website: http://pixelmetal.com\n\nPixelMetal on Twitter: http://twitter.com/pixelmetal\nPixelMetal on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/pixelmetal", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyoxIaratoc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyoxIaratoc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyoxIaratoc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyoxIaratoc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyoxIaratoc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "NEW Sombrero Gameplay on \"The Southern Ruins\" Stage! 720p/60fps", "description": "It's been a loooong time since I've posted a video update of Sombrero gameplay.
