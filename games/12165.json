It comes with a short novella by Peter McBride (\"The Sign of the Orc\") explaining the background to the story. \n \nAfter a night of heavy drinking with friends, Grindleguts the orc awakes to find himself strapped to a horse and about to joust with a human knight. His \"friends\" are nowhere to be seen, and he must somehow escape from his predicament and get even with them. Grindleguts must survive in a world of hostile humans while seeking revenge against his tormentors. \n \nAfter the first chapter, the game switches to science fiction setting where Grindleguts is revelaled to be a malfunctioning non-player character in a futuristic MMORPG. Using his power of transitioning between fantasy and reality, he convinces several other bots to join him, and escapes from the simulated reality facility.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knight-orc"}
