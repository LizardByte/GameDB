Unfortunately, nothing was heard about the project since and it has been assumed that the game was scrapped. As further proof that the game has been discontinued, nothing of the sort was unveiled at Nintendo's 2014 E3 presentation, where Star Fox Zero was announced, marking the eighth year of silence about the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-fox--2"}
