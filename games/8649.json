Instead, you must outsmart and outflank your opponents and kill them using various environmental hazards and obstacles, such as lava pits, laser beams, traps, moving platforms, falling crates, etc. This gives a completely new twist to the traditional 2.5D genre!\n\n Each one of the seven arenas is like a playfield with infinite number of possibilities to eliminate the competition. There are pick-ups, crates, lifts, air vents, levers, ninja-launchers, hiding spots and traps to experiment with. The most malicious players will be the most successful ones. Split-screen multiplayer matches and single-player offline matches against bots are also supported.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atomic-ninjas", "videos": [{"id": 3406, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_vajwEeI49c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vajwEeI49c", "title": "Atomic Ninjas on PS3 and PS Vita", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_vajwEeI49c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
