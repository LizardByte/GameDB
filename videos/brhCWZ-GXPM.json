It has over 70 unique maps and two endings.\nTo get to the first ending, the player must collect 13 keys.\nThere's several ways to get hints, for example an in-game item and Mari herself.\n\nTo start, one must be on an alternate (Hikikomori) route save file that is at the end of the normal game, then sleep until day and walk to the closet room. Don't worry, I have included a save file for those that don't have one. It's in the EXTRAS folder inside of the mod folder.\n\nI especially recommend to look around on the wiki because I re-used many cut warps.\nVisit the Corrupted Junkyard first if you don\u2019t know where to begin.\n\nCompatibility\nThis mod is not compatible with any major content mods (BS+, Cecily Space, Reverie... etc). Particularly mods that add extra maps will conflict with AMBIEN. However, these mods have extra interactions with AMBIEN:\n\nGirlmori\nMod Configs\nBadges\nIf you run Girlmori with AMBIEN, you'll see that female pronouns are used.\nIf you use Mod Configs, you'll find a config option that will allow the mod to use your OS name in an ending.
