WretchWorks presents the inaugural Arcade Pack; an homage to the golden age of arcade games! 4 challenging treats for one low price. \n \nThese experiments in coin-op sensibilities all share the same ingredients, but are distinguished with a unique flavor and attitude. Here's what you can expect from each: \n \n* High-octane arena action! Try your best to survive against the endless onslaughts of mutants, aliens, and otherworldly beings! \n* Numbers (they go up)! Be it score, time, or combos, there's always a higher score to chase. Demise and triumph await! \n* Bizarre sights and sounds! Squishy bacteria, howling spirits, and chattering firearms set an appropriate tone for each of these arcade adventures! \n \nMEET THE GAMES \n \nReally Unique Space Shooter - Caught alone in a remote corner of the galaxy; help Captain Scott fend-off hostile alien forces as you collect new weapons and build as high a combo as you possibly can! \n \nCylor vs. The Endless Legions - Hungry for revenge, Cylor plunges deep into the heart of the Mutant Cat stronghold to end things once and for all. . . or at least die trying. How long can he survive? \n \nBullet Cell - White blood cells never have it easy; not when their health and ammo are one and the same! Defend the body from invading pathogens and enjoy surreal sounds as you budget your plasma to the very last drop. \n \nStar Phantom - Battle space-faring ghosts in this 'inverted take' on an arcade classic. Ram into asteroids and harvest their chunks before the Phantoms can, and pray they don't try you as their next meal instead.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wretchworks-arcade-pack"}
