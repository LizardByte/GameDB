It is now out of print and I found it difficult to get UbiSoft to even admit that they had ever heard of it. But it can still be found occasionally on eBay and at yard sales. I hope posting this review and a walkthrough will help lend it some well-deserved immortality. \n \nThe game takes place in the 17th century, just before the Spanish Armada, back when Portugal dominated the seas. Valdo and Marie are two children who are traveling to Japan with their father and uncle aboard one of the most advanced ships of their day. Along the way they will have many adventures dealing with dangers and strange cultures.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-adventures-of-valdo-and-marie"}
