It was released in Japan on September 12, 2009 bundled with every copy of Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and then later released with every localized copy of the games. The accessory has a Pok\u00e9 Ball design with a small monochrome LCD screen and three functioning buttons. The Pok\u00e9walker supports infrared signals allowing players to interact within a short range with a game card of Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold or SoulSilver while slotted in the Nintendo DS, or with another Pok\u00e9walker.\n\nThe system records every time a step is taken, and the daily step count influences which wild Pok\u00e9mon and items will appear. The player can transfer a Pok\u00e9mon to the Pok\u00e9walker from either HeartGold or SoulSilver, which gains experience for each step. Like the Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu and Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu 2 GS, the Pok\u00e9walker uses a currency known as \"Watts\" (shortened to w); every 20 steps will earn the player one watt. Players can also catch various Pok\u00e9mon and obtain items on the device, then transfer them to the game. Alongside the Johto Safari Zone, the Pok\u00e9walker allows for Pok\u00e9mon normally unavailable until after the player has traveled to Kanto, such as Murkrow, to be available before defeating the Johto League.\n\nMuch as HeartGold and SoulSilver are remakes of the original Gold and Silver, the Pok\u00e9walker could be considered to be somewhat of a remake of Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu 2 GS, which interacted in much the same way with the Generation II games. Unlike Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu 2 GS, however, Pikachu is not the only Pok\u00e9mon that can be interacted with, and Pok\u00e9mon can actually be transferred to and from the Pok\u00e9walker at any given time.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokewalker"}
