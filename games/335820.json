In this release you will see:\n\n- Hazard Course\n- Anomalous Materials\n- Unforeseen Consequences\n- Office Complex\n- We\u2019ve Got Hostiles\n\nIt is known that our mod changes many things that affect how the game plays. However, only 3 out of 5 chapters in the demo contain proper combat, so we\u2019ve made a decision not to immediately overload the game with all the new stuff we\u2019ve prepared.\n\nInstead, Day One will serve as the entryway to Extended\u2019s proper gameplay, gradually introducing you to updated weapons and vanilla enemies\u2019 (and allies\u2019) new stats, abilities and weapons.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/half-life-extended", "videos": [{"id": 143370, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "j1xfCit3kco", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1xfCit3kco", "title": "We've Got Hostiles.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1xfCit3kco/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 143371, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "pMTe53iqt7k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMTe53iqt7k", "title": "Half-Life: Extended Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pMTe53iqt7k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
