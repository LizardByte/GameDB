{"id": "zEQFSvG0Zq4", "snippet": {"title": "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Slayer Game Sample - 3DO", "description": "Original Air Date: January 9th, 2010\r\n\r\nAD&D: Slayer is a decent  dungeon crawler and one of the more accessible console games based on the AD&D franchise-- too bad it was released on 3DO. Don't get me wrong; It's a cool game, but it would have had more success if it was put on other platforms too. What's done is done.\r\n\r\nThe game is simple enough on the surface. You select a pre-made character or create your own from a reasonable selection of characters both male and female, set your difficulty (which impacts how deep you can go and how other assets of the game will play out) or exactly how you'd like your dungeon, and then you set off on your quest to get mauled.\r\n\r\nActually, the game is quite a bit more \"reasonable\" when it comes to the dangers of the dungeon, which might actually turn off fans of the brutally difficult games. It also has a nearly non-existent plot. On the bright side, you can save generally anywhere, and rest so long as enemies aren't on your map (and you can't sleep on \"hazards\", and you can sleep while poisoned but will die). You have control of your character most of the time and can move freely to strike enemies. Enemies still move when you access your inventory, though I think they move slower. You don't always know what some items will do and when enemies will show it, so you have to be careful. One interesting aspect of the game is that you can switch between \"Graphics\" and \"Speed\" mode. Under graphics mode, the resolution is a little higher and the textures are cleaner. Under speed, the game is faster. There are other elements in the game, but I won't go over them here. This game is largely about survival.
