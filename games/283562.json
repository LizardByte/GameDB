Born into a caring family, Franky was raised to be serious and purposeful, but his true love lay in stargazing and chasing flies through the swamp. One fateful morning, while indulging in his favorite pastime, Franky wanders too far from home, unaware of the danger lurking ahead.\n\nTragically, he is caught by fishermen, a fear his mother had always warned him about. Captured and imprisoned in a jar, destined to become frog legs, Franky refuses to surrender to fate. In a daring act of resilience, he manages to break free from the jar, setting off a journey of survival and self-discovery.\n\nStranded on a lonely lily, far from home and lacking survival skills, Franky is overwhelmed but not defeated. He resolves to adapt to his new reality, marking the start of a transformative journey. Over the years, Franky ingeniously turns an old shoe into a cozy home, learning to live independently yet still holding onto a touch of naivety.", "summary": "Join Franky on his Adventure!
