It requires a ZDoom-compatible port. It uses the music track \"Sinister\" by Robert Prince. The level was constructed as a homage to celebrate that 2004 was Doom's tenth year. It is a \"new school\" map (using detailed architecture, ACS and other port features) constructed to be evocative of iconic areas from both Doom and Doom II.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/decade"}
