On it, Sora began broadcasting using the transceiver left to him by his father.\n\nThe day after his first rocky radio program, the radio picked up a different mysterious broadcast.\n\n\"This is a follow-up report on the fall of \"Blue Sky.\" The person caught up in the accident at the former site of Terminal 1 has been identified. The name of the deceased is Yamanashi Sora. Furthermore, many injuries are being reported at Nariyama Sky Academy.\"\n\nIt was a radio broadcast from the future.\n\n\"I'll... die in three weeks?\"\n\nAfter listening to the ominous broadcast, Sora stepped into the terminal for the first time in fifteen years. It was once the former gateway to Japan, and the place where Sora lost his parents. The building was in ruins, a shadow of its former glory, little more than a nest to countless artificial pigeons. There, Sora met a silver-haired maiden. She looked straight at Sora, gently stroking an artificial pigeon with her finger.\n\n\"...You won't die.\"\n\nSora was dumbfounded.\n\n\"I won't let it happen.\"\n\"Because I want you to look up at the sky and smile.\"\n\nThis is how Yamanashi Sora and Hazuki Kaguya met.", "summary": "2061, Japan.
