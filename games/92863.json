By directing this rod through the maze without hitting either of the barriers, you will take victory. However speed also must be taken into consideration since a time limit is established for each course. Players can also change speeds by simply pressing the X button to drop down a speed or circle to speed up with a total of five speeds available. The unlimited number of mazes are set through various background courses and obstacles from spinning blades, poker machines and even a metal robot.\n\nThe original Japanese version had an announcer who would yell things to confuse the player and trick them into touching the walls of the maze. This feature was removed from the American version.", "summary": "Irritating Stick (originally Dengeki Iraira Bou), is a carnival game in which the player has to move a spinning stick through maze-like levels, without touching the borders.
