You chose your rhythm tracks, bass lines, guitar riffs, and triangle hits in this complete music-making experience. You can make rock, pop, hip-hop, techno, or jazz songs, and each will be vastly different from the others. There are more than 1,500 riffs and 3,000 instrument sounds to choose from, and you can even write your own parts instead of using the pre-programmed melodies. Just about everything you can think of can be manipulated here, right down to the volume of the floor toms, the amount of reverb applied to each instrument, and the song's tempo. The next step is to create a music video for your masterpiece, and you'll have plenty of 3D clips at your disposal in so doing. Once you have your complete package, you can save everything to a memory card and access any part of it (from an instrument sound or keyboard riff to the entire song) later. All in all, it's about the most creative use of a video game console imaginable.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mtv-music-generator"}
