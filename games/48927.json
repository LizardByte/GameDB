Unlike other games based on the franchise, this is a scrolling action-adventure game reminiscent of Metroid, Konami's own The Goonies II and the later Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Each turtle has a different ability which is necessary to finish the game. Michaelangelo can hover using his nunchakus as a helicopter, Leonardo can drill the floor by spinning with his katana, Raphael can hide himself inside his shell to enter passages that are otherwise too small to enter, and Donatello can stick to and climb walls.\n\nThe bosses are Scratch, Dirtbag, a Triceraton, Scale Tale, and Shredder (in this game known as Cyber-Shredder).", "summary": "The whole sewer crew, except Michelangelo, is captured in a most heinous hideout. Who could be behind this travesty? Who else. Shredder has returned as Cyber Shredder - half-man, half-machine and he's created this twisty-turny fun house of Turtle torture. Use Turtle strategy and all new moves to help Michelangelo rescue the gang from Cyber Shredder's Fortress.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 48073, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "sMKSVjq54k0"}]}
