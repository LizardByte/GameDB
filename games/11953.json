As your journey begins, you are a passenger on a private charter flight (beats taking the boat you jokingly think to yourself) from Newark, New Jersey to the island of Barbados in the West Indies, when in-flight mechanical difficulties force your plane down onto an unknown isle in the Caribbean. Fortunately, you survive the crash! Unfortunately, once you collect yourself and realize that you are abandoned and alone, your struggle for survival becomes paramount! Your assignment is now a demanding adventure challenge!\n\nYou are the sole survivor (or are you?). Therefore, it becomes your project to sustain your own life. Somehow, you must discover a way to escape the evils of the isle and return safely home to write the story of the century! But watch your step! The project is extremely difficult to accomplish. Your task will require the mastery of skills that far surpass any \"Rambo-style warrior\"! Your responsibility entails creativity, intelligence, determination and \"guts\"!\n\nThe Bermuda Project presents many difficult tasks to perform as well as several devilish fiends to confront throughout the course of your challenge (do scorpions count as fiends?). For instance, how are you going to deal with the vicious villains from the Voodoo Village? (Tea and conversation is not recommended!)\n\nBesides struggling to survive, you must explore the various regions of the island if you ever wish to free yourself from this hostile captivity. You only have the slightest chance of leaving the island alive, so choose your actions wisely! The price of failure is a lifetime - and beyond - in limbo. Unless of course, becoming a Zombie appeals to you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bermuda-project"}
