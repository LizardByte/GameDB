While the map itself is short, built like a Rubik's cube in many aspects, with intertwined puzzles opening abstract moving parts of its mechanical pyramids. It runs on the Keep mod and includes a patch for it. This map should last an experienced player at least an hour on the first playthrough.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 66409, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hyLSMssmW0M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyLSMssmW0M", "title": "Q1SP Keep: Egyptoagula", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hyLSMssmW0M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
