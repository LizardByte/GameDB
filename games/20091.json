Players perform given dance moves, which are tracked by the Kinect. The more accurately the player performs the move, the more points he/she scores. Higher difficulties increase move complexity, and the margin for error is reduced.\nFeatures new to Dance Central 2 include voice control, simultaneous two player gameplay in both cooperative and competitive modes with drop in/drop out functionality, an improved fitness mode, a more in-depth and customizable \"Break it Down\" mode, allowing the player to practice only specific moves in a routine, and a campaign mode featuring dance crews of various styles.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dance-central-2", "videos": [{"id": 9903, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uAXRdXvy4zE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXRdXvy4zE", "title": "Dance Central 2 - E3 2011: Kinect Debut Trailer | OFFICIAL | HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uAXRdXvy4zE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
