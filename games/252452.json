For almost a thousand years explorers and archaeologists alike have dreamed of discovering the location of the legendary LOST CAVES and of gaining the riches it is said to hold. The unlucky ones discovered its secret entrance. They perished within its maze of corridors, cunning traps and ancient explosives. Now you are faced with a choice, enter this subterranean nightmare, or perish amongst the cold steel blades of a thousand Nomads.", "summary": "You control the famous explorer, armed only with his trusty shovel. You must collect ten diamonds in each of the sixteen mines. Once these gems have been collected you must find the wooden door which leads to the next cavern.\nYour explorer can clear the soft earth using his shovel, however the Nomads who have followed him into the mines are unable to do this. The explorer may also push boulders which will kill Nomads and detonate bombs, on contact.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lost-caves--1"}
