The original version of the game featured a 16mm-projection screen that had the player shoot the gunman when his eyes blinked. If he or she did so at the right moment, the gunman would be shot down and killed. If they didn't, the player would be shot (in the in-game). The arcade was large and was part of the Simulation System that also included Shooting Trainer, which was much less exciting than its dueling counterpart.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wild-gunman--1"}
