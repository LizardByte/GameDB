You do not need to have read Space School in order to play an enjoy this game, though it is encouraged. This game is a short, fun romp exploring characters I've loved for a long time playing around in a different setting. \n\nThis game has partial voice acting! Nothing is featured in this trailer (just couldn't figure out how to make it fit) but Zeggy is played by Todd's Hollow, and Alkaline is played by Cheesytofu!\n\n*About the Game*\n-Zeggy is a mad scientist stuck in his \"lab\" who suddenly gets a very intriguing (and sexy) visitor!\n-Why is this visitor here? When will he leave? Can Zeggy kiss him?\n-What happens when the relationship gets serious, and something SERIOUSLY bad happens?\n-Half an hour of reading time for the full story!\n-A little bit of voice acting!\n-No choices, just story to sit, read, and enjoy!\n-Completely original soundtrack by Downhill.\n-It's rated PG-13!\n-Content warnings for sexual innuendos, blood, and death.\n\n*About the Artist*\nHey! I'm DCS! A queer comic artist and game dev who enjoys goofy, scifi shenanigans with a lots of romance. This is a small, linear game full of love, so hope you'll enjoy it! If you like the game, please consider tipping the project or buying the PDF via the Itchio page! The funds help me as I work on other projects to release!\n\n*About the Music*\nThis game features an original soundtrack created by Downhill!You can purchase the soundtrack on Bandcamp, and check it out on Soundcloud!\n***Song featured in the trailer is the instrumental version of \"Touch Tone Telephone\" by Lemon Demon. No copyright infringement intended, this is meant as a sample and I am not making any monetary gain from this trailer, or song. This trailer is parody, and therefore fair use.

Please don't forget to comment and review the game! It helps get it in front of more players and that in turn helps me make more stuff.\n\nP.S. this is probably the last AU game I will make for Alkaline and Zeggy!
