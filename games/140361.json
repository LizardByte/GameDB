Alice is dead, that's bad. You don't know who you are, that's the worst. \n \nDo you have what it takes to get out of Wonderland, and more importantly, figure out who you are? \nJust a note, this game is unappologetically hard with some of the puzzles. It's a puzzle game, it's not meant to be easy. However, SHOULD you need help, there is a friendly walkthrough button right in the game."}
