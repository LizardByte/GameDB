The hand-drawn backgrounds and distinct animations paint a rare picture, reminiscent of the old classics! The blend of retro sfx, beautiful arrangements and high definition ambiences give a peculiar atmosphere - thanks to composers/sound designers Nils Ekl\u00f6f and Elias Th\u00f6rnlund.\n\nThis game is a trial that demands skill and willpower, mastering the jump and reaching the top will test the limits of your ability! Do you think you have what it takes to defeat this game!?", "summary": "Jump King is a platforming challenge about struggling upwards in search of the legendary smoking hot babe!
