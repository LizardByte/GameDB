From time to time, a Spectar comes into screen, and can be destroyed for extra bonus.\n\nAction takes place into a 9x9 grid, \"Crystal City\", where the player's vehicle must avoid and chase down 10 enemy wedge-shaped vehicles. When all enemies are destroyed, you are awarded an extra bonus and can access the following level. Two players can alternate in the game. You use a 4 way joystick to control the Whummel, and a pushbutton to fire at enemies. Progressing in the gameplay causes the Targs to become faster and smarter, for a fast and furious gameplay.\n\nA small trivia on the game and characters name: apparently, Targ stands for Target, Spectar stands for Special Target.\n\nThis game has a sequel, always released in 1980, Spectar.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/targ", "videos": [{"id": 102092, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Qaz-xh8igtE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qaz-xh8igtE", "title": "Arcade Game: Targ (1980 Exidy)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qaz-xh8igtE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
