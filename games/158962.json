The missions that are similar (usually those taken from the film) further tend to play out differently, and utilize completely different gadgets and weaponry.\n\nIt also does not feature additional objectives at higher difficulty modes, and only cheats are unlocked by beating specific missions at a specific difficulty. However, it does feature CD-quality music and voices, as well as video clips from the movie for cutscenes. It is single-player only, and features no multiplayer component."}
