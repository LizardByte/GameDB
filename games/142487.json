It received mention in the Cacowards feature that year as not quite a runner-up, but a recommended play as well-made and \"really fun\".\n\nThe mod includes a complete set of replacement weapons and monsters, and a handful of new powerups. Dead marines with PDAs are also encountered. Difficulty settings have been renamed to Easy, Medium, Hard, and Hell Revealed.\n\nThe author states that gameplay is meant to meld Doom with Unreal, although some resources are obviously copied from Doom-related titles, e.g. the Super Minotaur (Maulotaur), invulnerability ring (Ring of Invincibility), and Serpent Staff.\n\nAccording to its readme, Temple of the Lizardmen 2 is compatible with GZDoom versions 1.3.7 through 1.4.2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/temple-of-the-lizardmen-2"}
