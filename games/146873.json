From eggs that only appear once every 250 taps to the insane golden egg that has a one in a trillion chance of appearing!\n\nIt\u2019s not just a case of tapping away and hoping for the best \u2013 some eggs momentarily appear on the screen and you must quickly click on them before they\u2019re gone again.\n\nEvery tap comes with a one in a thousand chance of starting an egg hunt. You have ten seconds to quickly hunt down the egg\u2019s location on the screen! These eggs are often found in a dirty condition and require cleaning before you can see how rare it is, but they come with the added bonus of having a rarity rating \u2013 providing you with more chances of having a super rare egg.\n\nYou may not always find a cute egg but no tap is without it\u2019s reward, you\u2019ll continuously be earning money which you can spend in the shop to speed up egg cleaning or increase it\u2019s chance of being rare.\n\nYou can also raise funds by selling eggs that you\u2019ve already found. Work your way towards increasing your money and being able to buy the possibility of even rarer eggs.\n\nOnce an egg is clean, watch it\u2019s slow reveal and wait in anticipation to see just how rare your egg is!\n\nOne in a Trillion is an idle tapper game that will keep you busy for many hours.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-in-a-trillion"}
