However, they are not as immaterial as mere fantasies. Bookwalkers can also bring valuable items from a book into the real world, and that is precisely what your job is\n\nHunt for powerful artifacts\nTravel between worlds of books in search of legendary items of great power. Even though they are not as powerful in your world, you can still find buyers on the black market.\n\nMeet dozens of characters and learn their stories\nVisit mysterious castle dungeons, a drifting spaceship, a desert city among deadly sandstorms, and much more. Meet the inhabitants of those places and use them to reach your goal. After all, they are not really alive...or are they?\n\nFind solutions to a plethora of puzzles, some quite\u2026 unorthodox\nSome problems will make you think outside the box, and some will require you to travel outside of this world. If you are stuck, just wake up at your apartment. You may find something handy there that you can take with you on your journey. In a book, a crowbar may be just as effective against a lock as a key might be...", "summary": "The Bookwalker is a narrative adventure where you play as Etienne Quist, a writer-turned-thief with the ability to dive into books.
