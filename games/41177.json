Each turn a new '2' or '4' stone will appear on the 4x4 grid, meaning that you'll have to choose your moves carefully. Every time you collide two or more tiles, your score increases by their merged value. \n \nOriginally an entrant in RGCD's 2014 C64 16KB Cartridge Competition, this final commercial version of the game features further visual improvements and minor bug-fixes (such as same speed music played on PAL and NTSC systems).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/c-2048"}
