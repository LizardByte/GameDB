It is a prequel to Paradise Cracked, an earlier game by the same company.\n\nIn the game you control Katy, a new officer fresh from the academy that aims to make a solid career in the police force. You will control her as your main character and recruit additional partners to undertake several missions, which usually involve combat across the urban sprawls of the future against several factions and gangs in the city. As the game progresses a plot starts to surface involving a deranged criminal who aims to bring the city to its knees.\n\nYou can control up to 6 characters and additional backup NPCs, each with their own stats and equipment and issue orders to them on squad-based turns. Since you are part of the police force there's no resource management and instead the equipment availability is decided by your rank, which depends on the conditions in which you complete each mission. The game uses a fully polygonal engine and features branching mission objectives and different outcomes based on your in-game actions.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cops-2170-the-power-of-law--1"}
