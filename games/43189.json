No version of the game was ever released outside of Japan. \n \nThe player moves around mecha and jet units around a world map, trying to conquer as much territory from the forces of darkness as possible in order to repel them. When two opposing sets of troops occupy the same area, the game switches to a hexagonal grid where the two forces clash. When units meet in combat, the game uses animated cutaways demonstrating the exchange of damage. \n \nGaiflame is considered a precursor to Masaya's Langrisser series, along with Gaia no Monshou and Elthlead."}
