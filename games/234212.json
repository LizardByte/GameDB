It was published in 1985 by English Software. Antic Software published the game in the US. The title is a repurposing of the name of the American Chinese dish chop suey.\n\nChop Suey is a one-on-one martial arts fighting game. The action takes place on a box-type stage, watched by an audience sitting in several rows of seats in front of two competitors. Each successful attack on an opponent means their pain bar goes up and when the bar is full, the POW symbol will start blinking. It means the player is in a very fragile state of health - one more punch or kick and the fighter will fall. The match ends when the fighter falls eight times or the timer runs out. At the top of each wall air vents will open occasionally, allowing scorpions to drop to the floor and scuttle away. The players should avoid them at all costs, as they give potentially lethal bites.\n\nIf the player is victorious, a more difficult opponent is faced in the next match.\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chop-suey--1"}
