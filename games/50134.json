The title featured numerous magic items, as well as a spell-casting system utilizing virtual hand gestures. The game also utilized \"runes\" as a way to magically gain abilities or items.\n\nThe game had several features typical of dungeon crawls, such as random treasure, weapon and armor options, treasure chests, and the use of a mannequin to visually aid in inventory management.\n\nThe dungeon in The Summoning was broken up into separate levels and sections, with different types of monsters (such as undead) and NPCs being found in each.\n\nThe featured weapon in the game is a large two-handed blade called \"Warmonger.\" When first found, it is rusty and not very effective. But by repeatedly using it to kill, the magical blade becomes an immensely powerful weapon. The blade is actually a sentient, evil being with bloodlust.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
