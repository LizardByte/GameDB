Now they threaten to obliterate all organic life forms on the planet's surface...\nBut one man, Charles K. Takeda, has not given up hope.\nAs if he had known this day was coming, Takeda and a few of his friends had moved to a secluded insland in the Atlantic Ocean. Bringing with them only a few necessities, their mission was to develop one of Takeda's greatest inventions, the \"Blaster System\". This Blaster System would enable its pilot to freely manipulate the building blocks of matter by amplifying the distinctive brain waves humans generate. This would make it possible for humans to transcend reality by transforming matter and destroying space.\nAt present, two super machines, Blaster 1 and Blaster 2, have been completedand fitted with Blaster Systems. Takeda's son and daughter, Mike and Holly, have been specially trained to fly the Blaster Machines. Their mission is to defeat the M.L.M and to ultimately assist their father in building the ultimate aircraft carrier, \"Blaster Base.\"\nThe struggle is about to begin.\nThe two machines blast off, propelled by hopes and dreams, seeking peace through the avenue of war...", "summary": "Aero Blasters: Trouble Specialty Raid Unit is a 1990 horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Kaneko and licensed to Namco. The game was originally released in the arcades in 1990 and was subsequently released for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (as Aero Blasters) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (as Air Buster in North America) in 1990 and 1991 respectively.\n\nIn Aero Blasters, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. As a console game, Aero Blasters had the distinction of being two player simultaneous, which was rare among side scrolling shooters on home consoles at the time; all games in the Thunder Force, Gradius, and R-Type series were only 1 player on the home consoles.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aero-blasters"}
