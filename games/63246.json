There are different playing modes, most of them intended for games against other human players. But there is also an AI and a campaign mode. The campaign mode against the AI helps new players get accustomed to the gameplay. It also introduces new units step by step - there are dozens of them - and ways of acquiring the three different resources crucial to success. These resources are sometimes injected automatically into the player's (or enemy's) industry, but sometimes they have to be transported to buildings, factories or hot spots by specialized supply and repair/refill units. It goes without saying that intelligence gathering (or denying) and recon units also play a very important role. Like in the original Battle Isle series most units have more than one weapon system, but Advanced Strategic Command adds a slight touch of realism by applying the paper-stone-scissors principle to the combat mechanics. Besides their default damage, which is called punch here, weapons have certain modifiers which make them better against certain type of targets, e.g. a machine gun is good vs infantry but inadequate against armored vehicles. Also some weapons are less effective against distant targets, but can be devastating at closer range. The last build released for general usage as of early 2021 was version 2.6.0,", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/advanced-strategic-command"}
