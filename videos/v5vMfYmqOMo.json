After that, we are free to de-hardcode any of the game mechanics in order to enhance the modding capabilities far beyond what was possible in the original engine. OpenMW also has its own construction set, OpenMW-CS, which will eventually allow developers to create their own games in the OpenMW engine.\n\n--- Please note that one must own the original game files to play Morrowind in OpenMW! ---\n\nCredit for the \"scratch\" sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8839yopoM, author: IR Sound Effects, retrieved on: 2019-03-20\n\nOnline Documentation :: http://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/master/\nTES3MP :: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/mwmulti\n\nHomepage :: http://openmw.org\nFAQ :: http://openmw.org/faq/\nForums :: http://openmw.org/forum/\nWiki :: http://openmw.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\n\nSocial Media\nFacebook :: http://www.facebook.com/OpenMW\nTwitter :: https://twitter.com/OpenMW_org", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v5vMfYmqOMo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v5vMfYmqOMo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v5vMfYmqOMo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v5vMfYmqOMo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v5vMfYmqOMo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "OpenMW 0.45.0 Release Commentary", "description": "OpenMW is a modern, free, and open source game engine created by the OpenMW team.
