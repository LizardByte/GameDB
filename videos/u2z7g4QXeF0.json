The stray laboratory is a puzzle / horror game designed using PS1-era mechanics and graphics combined with modern-day physics and lighting capabilities. The Stray Laboratory is inspired by games such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Maniac Mansion, as well as movies such as The Shining, Psycho and Guest House Paradiso. \n\nThis July update follows up from the smash hit release of the first version of the free demo. The goal of this update was to address every single note taken since then, from you, the audience. From game-breaking bugs to small annoyances, I have endeavoured to fix or at least improve them all* in order to deliver a stable and well-balanced demo.\n\nAlso included in this update is a completely free** ending! By linking many of the individual puzzles, the demo now flows properly, guiding the player around the various nuances, mechanics, puzzles and spooks of what will one day be the full game of The Stray Laboratory. \n\nOverall, for the first time I feel that this demo accurately represents my vision for the full version of this game. I hope you enjoy playing it and welcome all feedback.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2z7g4QXeF0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2z7g4QXeF0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2z7g4QXeF0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2z7g4QXeF0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2z7g4QXeF0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Stray Laboratory v0.3.28 Trailer", "description": "Download the FREE DEMO at https://cursedsolutions.itch.io/thestraylaboratory\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CursedSolutions on twitter for regular updates!\n\nAvoid your fears, survive the experiments, explore your prison and figure out a way to escape.
