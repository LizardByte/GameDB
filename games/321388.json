Rumblings speak of a self-proclaimed prophet of the digital age, adamant that humanity must embrace a new existence in cyberspace, lest our mortal shells encumber us any longer.", "summary": "Further Skies takes place in 2008, following a pair of childhood friends adjusting to the ever-shifting world of online communication and relationships, which allows their world to become ever larger - for better and for worse.\n\nThis will be a story about being a young person in an online age that doesn't quite exist in the form it once did anymore. It's a story about communication, paranoia, grief, the joy of finding your people and your place, and the road to equanimity and internal harmony.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/further-skies"}
