In this game, players use bait received from Miis encountered on StreetPass to try and catch various species of fish across several islands. Each type of fish have certain types of bait they are attracted to, and players can combine bait together in order to catch larger fish. Each island is split up into multiple areas, which are unlocked after players manage to catch a certain type of fish. In addition to the five main islands players can fish across, additional islands can be accessed by encountering Miis from different regions and countries. Catching fish and clearing challenges earns money that can be used to upgrade various fishing rods that they receive during the game, or purchase and upgrade aquariums used to store fish caught during each session, which can be shared with people encountered on StreetPass.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-angler"}
