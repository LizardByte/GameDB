{"id": "N4zghcZRtzg", "snippet": {"title": "New Survival Analog Horror Game - CAPTURED", "description": "Wishlist CAPTURED now on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3114010/CAPTURED/\n\nCAPTURED is an analog horror game where you capture anomalies on camera to escape what seems to be an endless hallway in your own home. Investigate mysterious phenomena, survive frightening entities, and reach the end of the hallway!\n\nExplore a procedural generated endless hallway filled with unusual phenomena and ever-changing rooms. Caught in a never-ending loop, leaving the house only leads you right back into the same hallway. Plunged in complete darkness, room after room, your once-familiar home feels increasingly alien. \n\nUse your camera to zoom in on suspicious changes and select their anomaly type. Missing or incorrectly identifying any unusual phenomena within a loop will wipe your camera's memory. Correctly capture 13 anomalies to escape.\n\nWatch out for unwanted company. While silence may be a good tactic, staying too long within a loop could give away your location. Use your flashlight, camera, and the doors strategically to survive each entity's unique mechanics.\n\n#GameTrailer #HorrorGame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4zghcZRtzg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4zghcZRtzg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4zghcZRtzg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4zghcZRtzg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4zghcZRtzg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "New Survival Analog Horror Game - CAPTURED", "description": "Wishlist CAPTURED now on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3114010/CAPTURED/\n\nCAPTURED is an analog horror game where you capture anomalies on camera to escape what seems to be an endless hallway in your own home.
