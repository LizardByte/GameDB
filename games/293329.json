It is a clone of the arcade game Pengo and the gameplay is very similar. In the game, players controls Pango, a penguin like character, with the goal of clearing an ice maze of all the bees roaming around it within the one minute time limit. The maze consists of numerous ice blocks which Pango can either push around or destroy. The bees are constantly chasing the player throughout the maze and will cause Pango to lose a life if caught. The bees can be eliminated in two ways: they can either be squashed with ice blocks, or if they are near a wall that Pango is kicking the bee will become dazed allowing Pango a short time to squash it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pango", "videos": [{"id": 109945, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XzsJF5qV_Y4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzsJF5qV_Y4", "title": "Pango gameplay (PC Game, 1983)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzsJF5qV_Y4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
