The plot is not overly innovative and features a clash between three groups: Elves, Humans, and Greenskins. Elves are weak in melee combat, the Greenskins, made up of orcs, gnomes, and anything green, are primitive and resilient, and the Humans are average in both magic and melee. Each race has a variety of 14 different units and a dozen base-building types.\n\nThree distinct types of games allow the races to battle for victory. Campaign mode includes a total of 60 scenarios, 20 for each race. Custom games can be played as single-player scenarios using the Scenario Editor that comes with the game, and multiplayer games include a combination of up to eight human or computer opponents. Realms come into play during the multiplayer and single scenario games, since similar races battle against each other, while campaign scenarios require choosing a specific race.\n\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 PC Hardware \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7 8700K\nRAM: 32 GB\nGPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080\nOS:  Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 Recording HW/SW \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nNvidia Share", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3VcExo3szcc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3VcExo3szcc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3VcExo3szcc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3VcExo3szcc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3VcExo3szcc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Rival Realms (1998) - PC Gameplay / Win 10", "description": "Rival Realms (1998) - PC Gameplay / Win 10\n\nSubscribe here \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FirstPlaysHD\nAlso SHARE, COMMENT, LIKE \u263a\n\nRival Realms, an ambitious turn-based strategic fantasy game, relies on heavily used clich\u00e9s, but implements them with skill.
