THE JOURNEY takes you across a variety of locales, challenging you along the way with insidious traps and vicious monsters. The levels are easy to understand, but don't underestimate them because of the lack of massive hordes! Close quarters and strategical monster and item placement will test your skills. The average time to complete a given level is about 8 minutes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-journey--1"}
