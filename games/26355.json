It's a combination of point 'n click adventure, RPG and survival game.\" \n \n\"The intriguing story: \nThe Lemuria 7 spaceship has been missing for almost 40 years.  \n \nNow it is back in the Solar System, however there are no crew members on it. It's also unclear how the Lemuria 7 has returned and why it has been seriously damaged.  \n \nIn Lemuria: Lost in Space, you play as Abrix - the robot with AI that may operate in extreme temperatures, high levels of radiation and that yields weapon and hacking modules in order to explore the whole ship.  \n \nUnique gameplay : \nAbrix has an ability to overrun security systems. The unique hacking mini-game will challenge your math, geographic and logical thinking skills. There is no time to check Wikipedia - every mistake costs you valuable resources!  \n \nAbrix has a special software that allows him to upgrade himself during the mission. You need to be very careful - if you run out of batteries or an anti-radiation cloak, the mission is aborted and the game is over.  \n \nDangerous exploration: \nIn order to explore over 100 rooms of the spaceship, you'll need to solve dozens of puzzles, find valuable resources for the robot and fight with security turrets and other enemies patrolling the ship. \n \nSolving puzzles not only rewards you with priceless resources, but also uncovers the story of the lost crew of Lemuria 7. The level of challenge depends on difficulty - so choose wisely or you'll need to start from scratch.\"", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lemuria-lost-in-space", "videos": [{"id": 11274, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mtIZmD49rPU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtIZmD49rPU", "title": "Lemuria: Lost in Space Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mtIZmD49rPU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12882, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rvHjHsK_QTw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvHjHsK_QTw", "title": "Lemuria: Lost in Space - official launch trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rvHjHsK_QTw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
