It was the company's short-lived attempt to enter the games console market. The console was released in Europe in 1990 and was an upgraded design based on the then still-popular CPC technology. The GX4000 shared hardware architecture with Amstrad's CPC Plus computer line, which was released concurrently. This allowed the system to be compatible with the majority of CPC Plus software.\n\nThe GX4000 was Amstrad's first and only attempt at entering the console market. Although offering enhanced graphics capabilities, it failed to gain popularity in the market, and was quickly discontinued, selling 15,000 units in total.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/amstrad-gx4000/version/initial-version"}], "platform_type": {"id": 1, "name": "Console"}, "games": [{"id": 86208, "cover": {"id": 181428, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3vzo.jpg"}, "name": "Burnin' Rubber", "release_dates": [{"id": 313542, "date": 652147200, "platform": 25, "y": 1990, "release_region": {"id": 1, "region": "europe"}}, {"id": 670265, "date": 652147200, "platform": 506, "y": 1990, "release_region": {"id": 1, "region": "europe"}}]}]}
