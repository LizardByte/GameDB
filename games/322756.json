Soon, she discovers she has entered the Limbo\u2014a realm inhabited by spirits and inaccessible to humans, except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nHer presence is no accident. Juna's soul is caught between life and death, trapped in a coma. She must find a way to return home\u2014or choose to remain in Limbo, helping both spirits and humans by influencing events in the Land of the Living.\n\nHer journey hinges on the ancient runes left by shamans or the powers gifted by Limbo's inhabitants. These abilities will be crucial to solving puzzles and uncovering the mysteries that lie ahead.\n\nLimbo is not one vast territory but a mosaic of fragmented lands, each its own micro-dimension. Juna can lose herself exploring its depths, meeting the spirits who call it home, and discovering a realm she once thought unreachable\u2014or simply glimpse it before returning to her life in the Land of the Living.\n\nUltimately, everything depends on the choice she makes at the Portal of Return.", "summary": "Half Away is a One-Shot Narrative adventure where you play as Juna, exploring a mystical Spirit Realm.\n\nUse her unique ability to hear hidden voices to solve puzzles and interact with enchanted objects and spirits.\n\nDiscover secrets, face challenges, and uncover multiple endings in this magical journey filled with exploration, puzzle-solving, and storytelling.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/half-away", "videos": [{"id": 133799, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XduPM9m--P8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XduPM9m--P8", "title": "Half Away Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XduPM9m--P8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
