Participants connect to the central server through the Internet.\nPlayers can create and evolve Avatars from the world of Cellmons. During the game Avatars gain experience, become stronger and can use increasingly powerful spells. The match between players is based on coming up with your own strategy in attack, defence and choice of spell from the deck, which you have earlier prepared. The one who wins is usually the person who can predict their enemy's moves more accurately. The results of your fights affect your Avatar\u2019s further progress and it\u2019s standings within the Cellmons world hierarchy.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cellmons"}
