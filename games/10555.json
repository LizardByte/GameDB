This game is part one of a two part story, some questions are left unanswered and open to interpretation. To thank our fans for our successful Greenlight campaign, we have added new voiceovers, clues and storylines, and also made the Oculus Rift demo available (which will update to the full version on its release).\n\nThe mixture of cold Atlantic water and coarse sand in your mouth brings you back from unconsciousness. Surrounded by the wreckage of a boat\u2019s hull, you can only draw one conclusion: your vessel has been torn apart by the submerged rocks. The secrets of the island must be uncovered if you are ever going to find a way to escape. Where is everyone; is the island really uninhabited; and what is lurking within the isolated caves?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 11363, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FD28nwhP9wY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28nwhP9wY", "title": "Montague's Mount - Steam Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FD28nwhP9wY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
