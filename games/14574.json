Ramadu, the mighty and sinister ruler of the planet Newbourn, a thousand light-years away, is about to declare war on a weaker and smaller Earth - a war which will mean total destruction or worse total servitude on the part of the people of Earth, to the evil Ramadu.\n\nFor thousands of years the inhabitants of Newbourn (a very advanced society) have watched the struggling and developing Earthlings \u2013 as one would watch animals in a zoo. The Newburites, over the years, had traveled to Earth, sometimes learning, sometimes teaching, always curious. They saw revealed to them in the development of the Earthlings their own beginnings so many million years ago.\n\nBut Earth was cathcing up to Neburon \u2013 technically, medically, scientifically, in all areas. Neburon had once been extremely advanced compared to Earth but had grown comfortable and lazy.\n\nThe Newburites were in a slump. They needed a stimulus. They were angry about Earth's advancement and their on inactivity. Why, if nothing was done about it Earth may very well surpass Neburon in superiority in a few decades.\n\nSo Ramadu had come to power. But instead of spurring his people on to new growth and productivity and perhaps working with Earth to trade knowledge and ideas beneficial to both, he chose war. After all, Neburon was still more powerful than Earth and the Earthlings wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nThe year is 1981. You are an ordinary person walking through a meadow one day when you notice a strange looking contraption right in the middle of the meadow. You glance around yourself. There appears to be no one around. You look inside the contraption \u2013 there are a lot of dials and something that looks like a bucket seat. The outside of the contraption is round with a large inviting doorway. Hesitantly, you enter the contraption and sit down in the bucket seat. Gingerly, you turn a dial and suddenly reality becomes a blur as you enter the greatest adventure of your life.", "summary": "In order to save Earth's future you are given a time machine enabling you to travel into several time periods of the distant past where you meet famous people like Robin Hood, Christopher Columbos or Cleopatra who will help you to change Earth's destiny.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/time-zone", "videos": [{"id": 102579, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "OBE8K0XG65I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBE8K0XG65I", "title": "Hi-Res Adventure #5: Time Zone for the Apple II", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBE8K0XG65I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
