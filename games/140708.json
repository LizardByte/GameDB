They really do not. Before you quit, I want you to understand why. I am a believer of absurdity, that our actions in the end have no meaning in the interacting force between humans and universe. Choices lead you to different paths, but in the end, it's to a place where we share the common ground. But hey, life is about enjoying the journey, right? I hope you enjoy the choices being made along the way."}
