Once again, you must survive a week as a suited worker at Freddy Fazbender's Pepperoneri in the year of 1987 (months after the events of DSaF 1!) Once again, you must wear ridiculous-looking suits, give out cake to screaming toddlers and get through the week without being killed (or worse: fired!) This time though, Freddy's is bigger, has more possessed, mucus-dripping robots, and has even more choices and consequences. Powerful forces are at work and Freddy's has one last chance before they're shut down for good. This is your last chance to make things right. Or kill more kids and hang out with aubergine-man.
