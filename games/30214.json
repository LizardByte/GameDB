Players control the titular hero as he infiltrates an asteroid base to thwart the alien Mekon's plan for galactic domination. Accompanied by the alien Stripey, Dan must explore the asteroid, collect items, and engage in hand-to-hand combat with Treen guards. The game blends side-scrolling exploration with boxing-style combat, challenging players to rescue prisoners, sabotage the base, and ultimately confront the Mekon. With its mix of action, puzzle-solving, and storytelling, Dan Dare offers a classic space adventure experience.\n\nThe Commodore 64 version offers a distinctive gameplay experience with its joystick-controlled movement and context-sensitive interactions. Players can throw grenades, engage in close-quarters boxing matches with energy bars, and interact with objects using a caption-based selection system. The ultimate goal is to free the prisoners, sabotage the asteroid's systems, confront the Mekon, and make a daring escape, all while managing limited resources and solving environmental challenges.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dan-dare-pilot-of-the-future--1"}
