The president knew that he couldn't win the battle because of the lack of resources that their civilians used. In return, the president gave away a few states and is slowly trying to gain more land back, even making new man made states, the first and only one at the time, Stark, was supposed to show a spark of hope for the Americans to start the new Stark Republic. Because of the war and how new the state was, they didn't really have anything to govern a criminal justice system or many other needed things for a state. This changes around the laws and prison system from what they have in other countries. They pay for the first Stark state prison called Stark Penitentiary, holding some of the most interesting inmates that all carry backstory and mixed feelings towards their peers.", "summary": "In this game, the United States is in a war and to save resources they make a new state out of the saved goods. This state is called Stark and due to the location of the state they are still figuring out their criminal justice system. This takes place during the war and it takes place 10 years after they made the state. Anyways this game follows the stories of the main prison of Stark.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 53145, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "rxn2FnOtfg4"}, {"id": 53146, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "xfPHUX5wwiQ"}]}
