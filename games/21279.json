The player may swap any two adjacent tiles, as long as the swap results in a horizontal or vertical line of three or more matching tokens. The matched set disappears, allowing gem tiles to drop into the gaps from above; if more matched sets form as a result, they disappear as well.\n\nWhenever tiles disappear, the background grid positions turn gold. The player must turn every square on the board to gold in order to complete the level. Failing to do so within the given time limit, or reaching a situation in which no more swaps are possible, costs one life and sends the player back to the start of that level.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jewel-quest-expeditions", "videos": [{"id": 52116, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "y_Xyy6c2_UA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Xyy6c2_UA", "title": "Jewel Quest Expeditions DS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_Xyy6c2_UA/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1394, "name": "Jewel Quest"}]}
