It uses Otex textures by @ukiro. It also features custom tree sprites (by @elend and @Negatronica) which really puts the icing on the cake as far as looks go. Also, that nice blue sky is by @Mechadon taken from \"boxoskies-v3\". MIDI's are by @AD_79, which I felt fit the theme very well.\n\nGameplay is mostly strategic with occasional mild slaughter elements. Maps are generally short, tough and fast-paced.\n\nDifficulty-wise, I've tried my best to cater for most players... I wouldn't say UV is ultra hard but it can be rage-inducing without the right care. HMP is much more oriented for fun, although still challenging in parts. HNTR is a walk in the park.\n\nPistol starts are possible, but I personally think continuous play is a lot of fun for this wad!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elysiums-curse"}
