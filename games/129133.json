Little does he know that escaping the dungeon will be just the first part of a new adventure, which will involve invoking ancient powers, meeting an old rival, and of course, having fun with various girls. \n \nRance 5D introduces new features to the standard gameplay formula of the series. The dungeon navigation is done from a \"wheel screen\"; the player has to spin the wheel, and as a result Rance and his party will advance to a new location. Even though the player can choose the speed of turning the wheel, and field representing different locations are displayed on it, landing on a new location depends mostly on luck. Rance can encounter a random enemy, find a treasure chest, trigger an event, etc. The battles are somewhat simplified, using a standard turn-based engine without the strategic element of moving on the battle field. As always in Rance, expect to see some hardcore erotic images.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
