The original stories of animals growing bone like armor, emitting flesh-eating toxins, or using electricity as a weapon were simply just old fisherman's tales. That is until conspiracy theorists everywhere pointed to the original Maneater as solid proof of a Government coverup. Trip Westhaven, driven the brink of madness, fires up his ViewTube channel \u201cTruth Quest\u201d, to take his followers, the \u201cQuesters\u201d into deep waters in an effort to uncover the dark secrets behind this whale of a tale.\n\nManeater: Truth Quest DLC takes players to a brand-new island off the coast of Port Clovis \u2013 and comes packed with new evolutions, challenges, wildlife, and more! Players will once again take control of the apex predator of the sea to Eat, Explore and Evolve their way to the top of the food chain. Those interested in testing the water can also look forward to a free pilot episode, showcasing some of the new objectives players can sink their teeth into while uncovering the mysteries that lie below. This pilot episode features approximately 10-15 minutes of gameplay and is intended to provide a small taste of what\u2019s to come with the full version of Maneater: Truth Quest.", "summary": "Maneater: Truth Quest DLC takes players to a brand-new island off the coast of Port Clovis \u2013 and comes packed with new evolutions, challenges, wildlife, and more!
