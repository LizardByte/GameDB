Sneak into a heart-racing house of horrors in Hello Neighbor, outrun the end of the world in a speeding locomotive in The Final Station, and overtake your friends online in the fast-paced super-powered world of SpeedRunners! All three games together in one place!\n\nHello Neighbor is the hotly anticipated thriller with an ever-changing house and a mysterious neighbor hiding a deadly secret. The Final Station is a road trip across the post-apocalypse where you decide which passengers come with you to the next station- if they survive the monsters that come out at night! And of course SpeedRunners is a 4-player parkour race through the city, where each runner can swing, boost, fire missiles and plant bombs to blast their friends off the road! Is this tinyBuild's most high-speed bundle yet? Yes!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tinybuild-high-speed-bundle"}
