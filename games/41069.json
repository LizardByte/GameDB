Now, you can challenge five of history, greatest naval commanders as you refight some of the world\u2019s, most important naval battles. Or create entirely new campaigns... and write your own history.\n\nPrepare for action. Start by choosing one of eleven great naval campaigns. Alter various elements if you wish. Make things easier for yourself \u2013 or harder. Change the wind and weather. Exchange a frigate for a ship of the line. Or invent all-new battles of your own. You\u2019ll face some of the greatest naval commanders of all time: from the bloodthirsty pirate Blackbeard to the \u201cYankee Pirate\u201d, John Paul Jones. Choose your opponent and the chase is on!\n\nPlan your strategy. Stydy your opponent closely to anticipate his tactics, exploit his weaknesses, and avoid his strengths. But don\u2019t delay too long. For the action won\u2019t wait. While you\u2019re maneuvering, the enemy may escape \u2013 or launch his own attack. Still, good cannon play could save the day. So zoom in to take command of the individual ships, aiming and firing cannons, leading the boarding parties as you grapple in hand-to-hand combat.", "summary": "The Ancient Art of War at Sea is a strategy game that includes a powerful game generator.
