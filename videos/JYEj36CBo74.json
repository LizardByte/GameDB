It's a side scrolling platform game similar to the Genesis and SNES Bubsy series.\n\nBubsy is a bobcat superhero who can defeat all enemies by jumping on top of them. In Fractured Furry Tales, he finds himself in a series of fairy tales. When all havoc breaks loose in the land of fairy tales, Mother Goose sends in a brave and noble hero (who happens to be Bubsy) that will restore peace to the fairy tale land. So, Bubsy has to travel through 15 levels and set things right.\n\nBubsy In: Fractured Furry Tales was originally intended to be a Jaguar port of Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, the first Bubsy game. But the developers at Imagitec Design and Accolade suddenly decided to make it a new game entirely.\n\nBubsy, Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales, Accolade (C) Atari SA\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #atari #atarijaguar #bubsy #bubsyinfracturedfurrytales #bubsybobcat #bubsy_bobcat #atari_jaguar\n#accolade", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYEj36CBo74/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYEj36CBo74/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYEj36CBo74/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYEj36CBo74/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYEj36CBo74/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bubsy In: Fractured Furry Tales - Atari Jaguar Gameplay", "description": "Bubsy In: Fractured Furry Tales is the only Bubsy game to appear on the Atari Jaguar.
