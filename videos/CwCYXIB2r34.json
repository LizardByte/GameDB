Livelock will launch on PlayStation 4 in 2016. \n\nNearly a century after a cataclysmic gamma ray burst, humanity is on the brink of survival. Clusters - groups of corrupted machines control what remains of the earth, fighting each other in an infinite war over resources that now threatens the very planet itself. \n\nThe official announce trailer introduces Hex, one of the three Capital Intellects awakened to put an end to the infinite war. Hex was a renowned e-sports professional who became feared by many as he honed his craft. He was also one of the first to participate in a risky experiment to upload his consciousness to a database, which was later uploaded to a machine by SATCOM. This trailer serves as an introduction into who Hex is, and showcases his rougish personality and some of his tactical abilities. \n\nFor more information about Livelock, visit http://www.playlivelock.com      \n\n\u00a9 2016 Perfect World Entertainment Inc.
