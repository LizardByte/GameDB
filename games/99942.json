You accompany him on this journey, bearing witness to his life and remembering for him as his mind slowly unravels into the void.\n\nA journey through life\nWalk alongside Bernard as you delve deep inside his mind, experiencing everything from his earliest childhood memories up until the very first moment you meet him. Throughout this journey, you will visit over twenty key memories that helped define the man he would become.\n\nRemembering\nExplore every memory you enter and discover pieces of Bernard\u2019s life. When Bernard\u2019s mind fails him, help him to remember. How thoroughly you explore each memory will determine how well some details will be preserved throughout the story.\n\nCharacter-driven story\nMeet a diverse cast of characters on your walk down memory lane; get to know the Penfield\u2019s through Bernard\u2019s eyes. Help him remember the important friendships that endured decades, taking the time to connect with them, not only by talking to them but also by playing with them, working alongside them or simply sharing their passion.\n\nA stronger link\nMusic has long since been connected to cognitive dysfunction and is believed to help stimulate memories. Which is why Spiral\u2019s soundtrack, sometimes youthful, other times melancholic, plays such an important role in telling Bernard\u2019s story. His memories, which are tightly intertwined with music from his past, help draw out the person Bernard once was.", "summary": "Spiral is a third-person narratively driven exploration game sharing a poetic vision of cognitive degeneration seen from the inside.
