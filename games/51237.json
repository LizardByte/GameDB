A sort of tactical FPS, MWLL combines BattleTech's combined-arms warfare and universe with BattleField's vast open maps and domination-style gameplay. The project became a \"standalone mod\" when development was transferred to its own fanbase in 2016, who incorporated a bare-bones Crysis Wars demo as part of the new install package.\n\nMWLL uses CryEngine 2 as its engine and is set in the BattleTech universe. It is one of the few BattleTech-themed mods to have been sanctioned by Microsoft.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mechwarrior-living-legends", "videos": [{"id": 41389, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FZKL7qrTEeY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZKL7qrTEeY", "title": "MWLL: Descent Into Battle", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZKL7qrTEeY/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 43672, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "J1ZVIsJV3Ic", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1ZVIsJV3Ic", "title": "Featured Community Clip: Aerial Excellence!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J1ZVIsJV3Ic/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44687, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "Ny6EgqX1kOY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny6EgqX1kOY", "title": "MechWarrior: Living Legends - The Journey So Far (An Asset Lineup Review), now in Higher Quality\u2122", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ny6EgqX1kOY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97731, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "-Kuv2qbMv1A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kuv2qbMv1A", "title": "Featured Community Vid: MWLL Action Pack", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Kuv2qbMv1A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
