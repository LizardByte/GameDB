The premise of the game is to run around the screen collecting various treasures for points, avoiding monsters.

Each level takes up the full screen and has its own unique hazards, such as arrows which transport the protagonist quickly, and blocks which are removed when stepped on. The game features six difficulty and nine speed settings.
