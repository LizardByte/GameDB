In it, the player is a girl who, water pistol in hand, enters a house where other children are constantly disappearing. However, inside the house she observes that it does not follow a logical order, and each area seems to have no relation to the previous one. Even so, she advances through the house despite her fear, knowing that she is on the right path, as indicated by the presence of the Motogotchi (hand-held video game consoles) of the children who disappeared there earlier.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spooky-scary-spaces", "videos": [{"id": 111372, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zL-YGrdIl5g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL-YGrdIl5g", "title": "TFM Spooky Scary Spaces - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zL-YGrdIl5g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
