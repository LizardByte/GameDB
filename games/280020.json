It is different from bullet hell shmups like most of CAVE's games and Touhou, in which the screen can contain hundreds of bullets that are slow. Seibu-style shmups focus on quick reaction times and awareness of enemy locations, compared to bullet hell shmups, which focus on dodging and weaving through intricate bullet patterns.\n\nThe game has four original ships: the Amada Vipros, the Phyxius, the Zaiva, and the Xelcor. It also features guest fighters from other shoot 'em up games by Psikyo, Capcom, Konami, and others.\n\nThere are 20 stages to play in the game with four different game modes to select from.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xeno-fighters-r", "videos": [{"id": 103308, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FCSOE1OmXZk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCSOE1OmXZk", "title": "Xeno Fighters R - v0.340 showcase", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FCSOE1OmXZk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
