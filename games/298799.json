I remember eating ice cream cones down by the river- shit like that. From what I've gathered it's been like 15 years since I fell out of existence. I hear it doesn't look much better up top. An every time there is a mass burial above us we see a flood of new beasts. I don't like what I do to eat. There really isn't much else to do down here. I want to get up. Get back to where I came from. Its been a while since I've been around here. I can find my way around just fine. My car moves through the empty streets and it rattles its chains. This bucket of frozen motor oil howls. The wails of my tires echo without the slightest bit of resistance through New Athens streets. I feel like an animal. All I want to do is eat and I don't care about the details. A long time ago all I cared about was the story. I wanted to know why. Its not that I only care about the results. I don't. I don't care why it happened and I don't care what's going to happen next. I just want to eat. I want to eat something warm.", "summary": "Unpleasant dreams await you in Psychic Shadows, an independent video game made in RPG Maker VX Ace where every decision matters.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/psychic-shadows", "videos": [{"id": 111803, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EsuJh7nAmXk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsuJh7nAmXk", "title": "CHAPTER ONE DEMO", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EsuJh7nAmXk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
