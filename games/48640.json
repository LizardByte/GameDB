When the Warp Zone in the centre of the screen flashes, it is possible for the Monster Fighter to warp to the \"Maze World\", where monters must be killed with time-delay bombs. The delay is controlled by how long the player holds the button down - but every time he kills one, his bombs will get stronger, making it easier for the Monster Fighter to blow himself up with his own bombs until he returns to Space World.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warpman", "videos": [{"id": 46560, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IT3VdD8rto8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3VdD8rto8", "title": "Warpman (FC \u00b7 Famicom) video game | 54-stage session for 1 Player \ud83c\udfae", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IT3VdD8rto8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
