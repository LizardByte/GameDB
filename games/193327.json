A hope that maybe you can overcome this, maybe you can heal and break free from the chains of the past. Maybe... you'll find the will to live again.", "summary": "Diary of Broken Dreams is a deeply personal psychological horror game about suicidal depression, childhood trauma, emotional abuse, and the fear of one's own emotions.

It's about his story.\n\nThe game builds its atmosphere through depictions of the author's mental illnesses and memories, portraying how they affect him in a nightmare-dreamlike aesthetic reminiscent of the classic Silent Hill games.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diary-of-broken-dreams", "videos": [{"id": 65155, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Yl49wjnZ6E0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl49wjnZ6E0", "title": "Diary of Broken Dreams Alpha Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yl49wjnZ6E0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
