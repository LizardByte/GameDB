A Few days ago, an escape shuttle originating from outpost 41 landed on earth. Its crew had an urgent message: their outpost had been overrun by some kind of unknown, hostile life forms. Just before the alien infestation, the colonists had found some ancient, invaluable paintings from below the surface of the planet. \n \nWe are now sending in a four-member crew to recover those paintings. You will be in control of these men, watching over them from a control room. Your crew has cameras attached to their helmets so you will have a visual on what's going on. Make sure those paintings are brought back to earth!", "summary": "Outpost 41 is a mix of horror and first-person shooter. It is technically 2D, but viewed from first person perspective. You command a squad of four soldiers, proceeding into an abandoned, alien-infested outpost in search of some invaluable alien artifacts. \n \nOutpost 41 supports 2 player CO-OP gaming via network / split screen. \n \nInspired by the old 8-bit 'Aliens' game for the Commodore 64. This game, however, has its own story and is not set in the Alien universe.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
