Your planet will crumble and implode in less than a month, and you must use your remaining time to try to escape. The catch? There is only one escape pod left, and it isn\u2019t functioning. Even worse, the only people who specialized in its systems are all dead from the colony\u2019s mysterious failure. But the colony\u2019s AI is still with you, and together you plan to get yourselves off the planet\u2014by recreating those key colony members and learning how to fix the ship, so you can both flee to safety.
