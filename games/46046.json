Bizarrely Sega of America released this game twice - initially as Sega Saturn Bootleg II (as a \"sequel\" to Bootleg Sampler). The product in its Bootleg II form is far less common, though aside from a changed title screen (on some discs), the two discs are identical.\n\nUnlike Bootleg Sampler, Sega Screams Volume 1 opts for the \"standard\" Saturn demo disc menus often seen in the European Sega Flash series.\n\nSega Screams Volume 1 was followed by Sega Screams Volume 2."}
