It is exactly like the original version of 3rd Mix, except that it fixes the Shuffle bug and adds seven Korean pop songs and one from the original to 3rdMix and SSR modes. An update to this version, Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix verKorea2 was also released in South Korea in March 2000, adding 9 more K-Pop songs. The songs missing in the Asian version is still absent in this game, however. The exclusive songs from the first Korean version would be added to the Japanese version with the 3rdMix Plus update.
