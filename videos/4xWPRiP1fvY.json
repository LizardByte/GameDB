And how the daughter was hiding in an office desk the entire time? Yeah, me neither, but it's still quite a quality brawler.\n\nIt looks really nice running in the Saturn's high-resolution mode,  and the sound is all appropriately grunty and bass-filled. The controls are great too, though they're surprisingly complex for this type of game (not really a surprise when it's from one of Sega's AM teams!) even though the game only uses three buttons.\n\nFinally,  in case you're wondering, the little arcade game at the beginning can be played to earn extra credits in the main game mode. It's a really neat little touch. \n\nIt's too bad that DHA came at the end of the genre's popularity - it did get a sequel eventually,  but I would've loved to see more,  especially on Saturn.
