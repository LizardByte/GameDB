The fuel tank is empty! A group of partying aliens crash their UFO and land on an unknown planet. They seek help at a nearby castle. But their would-be helper is in fact someone with less than kind intentions. Unfortunately for them, they are imprisoned at the castle and forced to perform hard labor. While most of the members of the cuddly troupe are resigned to their fate, Timmy forges a heroic plan to escape servitude.\n\nBy using some very advanced technology, Timmy manages to manipulate gravity and free himself from prison. This is the starting point for a multitude of adventures in which he encounters a number of challenges. On the way he frees all his friends from the spaceship. The player has the ability to take control of the other aliens during the game as well, thus relieving Timmy.\n\nThe aliens must get past tough puzzles that players must apply their brain to solve. In addition to gravity manipulation, players must overcome fire, water, dangerous spikes, portals, and even\u2026 honey!", "summary": "Think in 360 degrees in Alien Escape to solve challenges a dark tower offers. You are a group of aliens that were kidnapped and jailed. To escape you have to solve puzzles where you have to do more than just jumping and running!
