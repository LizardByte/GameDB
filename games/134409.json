The original version of the project appeared in August 2015 featuring the four video game characters Lilith (Borderlands), Lara Croft (Tomb Raider), Elizabeth (BioShock Infinite), and Zoey (Left 4 Dead), who were the girls featured in the fanfiction story.\n\nThe project died out, but it was rediscovered in August 2016 and exploded in popularity, with new characters being added and the community you see today being formed. To date, over 200 characters (in various states of completion) have been made for SPNATI.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/strip-poker-night-at-the-inventory"}
