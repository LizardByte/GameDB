The biggest addition however is the inclusion of a 4-player royal rumble mode and the ability to perform team-up moves in the tag matches.\n\nThe game casts you as a wrestler of your choice in the official Zen Nihon Pro Wrestling league and pits you against the other featured wrestlers in grappling matches. As in the original you get to pick between several game modes including: Tournament, Championship (single or tag) Vs, Team (with the new 4-player variant) and Training.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zen-nippon-pro-wrestling-sekai-saikyou-tag"}
