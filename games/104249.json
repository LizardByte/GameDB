Always equated in battles, kings needed an innovative tactic in order to destroy their opponents. \nSeveral Commanders with completely varied tactics tried to conquer territories in the name of their King, but always with the same result, an impasse. \nDefeated and tired of constant battles, both kings wanted to do the ultimate war tactic. Explosions! For this reason both Kings contacted the Famous Ale Maker Wizards known for their spells cast in their ale kegs, whatever was stored within was doubled! Both decided to keep gunpowder and thus create a trap to destroy the enemy forces with a great explosive force of condensed powder. The resulting explosion was so great that it put an end to the great wars.", "summary": "Keg War is a tactical twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game. \nInstead of playing crosses and circles, players have cards with attributes and specific action patterns.
