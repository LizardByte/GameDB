BARNUM'S ACROBATS! \n(1 or 2 players at a time) \n \nSINGLE PLAYER VERSIONS \n \nPress 0 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nYou are under the Big Top at the Ringling Bros. Barnum and Bailey Circus! \n \nOne of the acrobats is standing on the platform at the left side of the screen. His partner is on the teeter board at the center of the screen. \n \nThree rows of balloons are dancing back and forth high above their heads. \n \nUse the joystick of the right hand control to move the teeter board from side to side. \n \nUse the action button to make the acrobat jump from the platform. If he lands on the high end of the teeter board, the other acrobat will fly into the air. (The closer the first acrobat lands to the high end of the teeter board, the higher the second acrobat jumps. If he does not jump high enough to reach the first row of balloons, he will crash.) \n \nIf the flying acrobat hits a balloon it will pop and give him a bouncing chance to pop some others. Keep moving the teeter board so he lands on the high end when he finally comes down. \n \nA complete game is a series of ten jumps. The number of jumps left in the game is displayed at the lower center of the screen. \n \nScoring: \nBALLOONS IN BOTTOM ROW - 2 POINTS \nBALLOONS IN MIDDLE ROW - 4 POINTS \nBALLOONS IN TOP ROW - 6 POINTS \n \nYour score is displayed at the lower right corner of the screen. \n \nBonus scoring: \nALL BALLOONS IN BOTTOM ROW - 15 POINTS \nALL BALLOONS IN MIDDLE ROW - 20 POINTS \nALL BALLOONS IN TOP ROW - 25 POINTS \n \n \nWhen all of the balloons in a row have been popped, a full row of new balloons will appear automatically. \n \nIf you score over 999 (Nothing is impossible!), the counter at the lower right of the screen will start again at 000. A line directly over it will indicate you are working on your second thousand points! \n \nTo play again, press any key except SPACE or RESET! \n \nPressing SPACE will display the best score in a series of games at the lower left corner of the screen. \n \nPressing RESET will permit entry of game variations. \n \nSINGLE PLAYER GAME VARIATIONS \nStationary shield under moving balloons.
