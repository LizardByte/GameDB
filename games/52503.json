May the gods assist you!", "summary": "Cloven Crania Meadow is a real-time strategy game set in a standard fantasy world. The player takes control of the human kingdom, surrounded by hostile nations, monsters and other evil creatures. The solution to the problem is to beat the aggressive neighbors and the expulsion of monsters. Priority is to develop the city, ensuring prosperity, defend their headquarters and destroy enemy cities. It is important to train military units - only a large and well-trained army can deal with the army of the enemy. Battles emphasize taking control of \"key areas\" on the battlefield rather than simply destroying the opponent's army. The development of the capital consists of constructing important buildings and providing resources.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
