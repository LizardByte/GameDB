Soon, it forgot her sisters as well. Now Isabelline walks in her sleep, every morning a new road home, every morning that home a little different than she remembers it. In her dreams, a shadow twists in agony through the smoke-steeped orange sky. With 80+ hand-drawn pixel art backgrounds, explore and solve puzzles across 3 main areas and a hub world, as well as various dreamscapes and secret locations.", "videos": [{"id": 59586, "video_id": "Uy-mtSB99Ok", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-mtSB99Ok", "title": "Fallow (Release date trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uy-mtSB99Ok/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
