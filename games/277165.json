They both helped bring peace to the world. One day, war broke out between the two races. The humanoids were largely unsuccessful, as the youkai dominated over Gensokyo. During the battle, an important landmark in the eastern part of the land was destroyed: the Hakurei Shrine.\n\nUnderneath the rubble, a young shrine maiden named Reimu Hakurei emerges. You are destined to go out and punish the one responsible. But, there are two paths to take. Armed with a mighty wand, an infinite supply of throwing amulets, and a yin-yang orb, you must make your way across the Aetherworld (Makai) or the Netherworld (Jigoku). But, once you meet the Angel of Death, be sure to keep your stake sharp. And say your prayers!\n\nOriginal by Team Shanghai Alice, adaptation by Drillimation Systems.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-1-the-highly-responsive-to-prayers-nes-demake", "videos": [{"id": 101902, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "0hjo7wL8c_I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hjo7wL8c_I", "title": "If Highly Responsive to Prayers was made in 1986...", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0hjo7wL8c_I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
