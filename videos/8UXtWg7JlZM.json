The Highlighting is based on distance, and offers 3 colors, based on what the player can or cannot do. For this example the tree and block is not currently usable as the player didnt carry the items/tools needed, so the highlight is red. If usable it is green, and if the skill of the player isnt high enough it is Yellow. Other objects that dont require tools or skills, such as opening doors, chests, talking to npcs, will highlight blue. The colors can be changed.\nThe other area in this video shows a start of the implementation of the tracking system. You can simply highlight and press the key you assigned for tracking, and wonder off. The object will highlight and flash, and will remain visable even from behind other objects such as the terrain, this allows you to find something you wasent looking for, and come back to it later when prepared, such as looking for wood, and found iron ore, but didnt have a pick axe with you to mine it, so you can highlight and come back later. You can also track objects that would move, so you can track a villager, bandit, or other object to find where they are going without needing to be to close, so long as your skill is enough :)\nAt the bottom it also shows the current weather and time info from the last vids posted on the new weather system, this will be removed, it is there for debugging the weather system :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8UXtWg7JlZM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8UXtWg7JlZM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8UXtWg7JlZM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Project Kolo - New Targeting and tracking system", "description": "http://gamejolt.com/games/rpg/project-kolo/32202/\nWhile working on other areas with the inventory systems, we worked some on this as well.\nIt allows the player to see objects that can be interacted with, such as harvestable resources on the map.
