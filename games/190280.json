Each hockey team lives on an island surrounding the main continent and ressources produced on the mainland are allocated to the most dominant of these teams.\n\nYou have inherited an abandoned island and the captainship of the worst team in the whole league. Amongst the island's rubbles, you find an old workshop inhabited by an odd character called 'The Blademaster'. This strange character gives your team the edge they desperately need by forging unique artefacts and progressively improving your team.\n\nBecause of the ever-shifting nature of the continent, no two journeys will ever be the same. Each new adventure will have its own randomly generated path where you will have to choose between different teams to play against and unique rewards to choose from. Will you be cautious or choose the risky path...be careful since defeat will send you back to your island.\n\nLosing is only the beginning however. While on your island, set-up your team and improve with the Blademaster while getting ready for the next epic journey.", "summary": "Tape to Tape is a unique roguelite hockey game where every choice matters on your journey to build the ultimate hockey team.
