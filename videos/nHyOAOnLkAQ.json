The classic arcade game, updated with modern (for the time) graphics and gameplay enhancements. The PS1 was a runaway success from the start, and there was a profitable market in taking classic games and refreshing them for the system with 3D graphics. This was pretty common on the PS1, and if I remember right the remake of Frogger was one of the highest-selling titles on the system period.\n\nThis enhanced remake of Asteroids is pretty fun! It's the same classic gameplay, but with snazzy new space backgrounds and some regenerating ice asteroids. The challenge is remarkable, with it being very easy to lose ones place on screen and misspeed into oblivion. Also the wraparound physics really mess with me, I'd need a lot more practice to utilize it well.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHyOAOnLkAQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHyOAOnLkAQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHyOAOnLkAQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHyOAOnLkAQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Asteroids - PS1 (1998)", "description": "From developer Syrox Developments.
