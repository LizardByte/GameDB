Call it the Finland's Daikatana if you will, but you can't deny that this is a freeware game like no other. \n \nThe game tells a story of a man named Simon Miller, a man whose once bright future as a starship captain was wrongfully taken away in order to cover for the incompetence of his superiors. Now as a working captain of a cargo vessel, deeply in debt and in love with alcohol, he's about to embark to an adventure of lifetime. \n \nThe Gameplay \n \nGameplay of StarFight VI consists of three integral parts: problem solving, combat and space exploration. In order to beat the game, you'll need sharp wits as well as an itchy trigger finger. \n \nThere is a complete freedom of movement in SF6, no missions are restricted to a small, confined region of space. This freedom often gives several different tactical options of approach to hazardous situation, but it also forces player to consider his actions much more carefully and relate them to available resources.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starfight-vi-gatekeepers", "videos": [{"id": 34861, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GBs3YJcKvg8"}]}
