Guide the breath of light through the puzzles and try to connect life to life in the most beautiful and fluid ways possible. This is done by rearranging stones in a serene and slightly dream-like Zen garden. These stones can gently push, pull, bend, reflect or shift the flow according to their size, shape and character. Don't worry, there are no scores or time limits. The breath itself has the feel of qi or life force and has a rhythm of its own; trying to rush it will only slow you down. Breath of Light is designed to take you out of the everyday. It is a relaxing puzzle game that's a little Zen garden, a little lotus flower and lot of flowing good vibes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/breath-of-light"}
