Just swipe on your device and the direction of gravity changes. But attention! Not only the main block moves, but every other block too.

And if accomplished all levels you can still challenge yourself by collecting all stars and beat the developers score.", "summary": "Gravity Blocks is the game that forces you to think in other directions. You have to take gravity under your control to change the position of the blocks and win the game. But it's not as easy as it sounds, because if you change the gravity once, every object is affected by it. So there will be many blocks blocking your way to the goal, but also some which will help you. Only if you play smart enough and with intuition, you'll complete the tricky missions of the block heroes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gravity-blocks-the-last-rotation", "videos": [{"id": 17784, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "SYTCrnw5sOw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYTCrnw5sOw", "title": "Gravity Blocks X (By Sirnic) iOS / Android Gameplay Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SYTCrnw5sOw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
