During that year, people are using pink electronic headbands in their sleep to connect to a world called Hypnospace. It is the future, and everyone is using it. But, there are bad apples who tend to break the rules of Hypnospace, and it is your job as an HSPD Enforcer to traverse across the Hypnospace road to bring these people to justice. The gameplay is rather simple, and is split up into three pint-sized levels and even features subtext and social commentary, and ramming your police cruiser into other cars causes your screen to shake, as well as big ol' explosions, and if you hit into oncoming cars, the cars fly off the road completely.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hypnospace-enforcer"}
