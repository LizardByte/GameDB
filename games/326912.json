The project is inspired by Arsinikk and NinjaDelphox's Line Massacre Series and is the sequel to 200 Line Christmas.\nAs the 300 in the title \ufeffsuggests, each map was limited to 300 lines at most. In addition, each map was a collab effort between two map authors.\nThe miniwad comes with 4 maps (technically 7 if you could both \"naughty\" and \"nice\" versions of maps). All but the first map have a \"naughty\" and \"nice\" version with different aesthetics and gameplay. Each map includes two exits (\"naughty\" or \"nice\") and depending on which exits you choose, you can get up to 3 different endings!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/300-line-christmas-naughty-or-nice"}
