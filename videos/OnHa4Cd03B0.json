This new theme includes a series of \u201chaunted\u201d building sets full of awesome functionality and secret surprises that, on their own, provide the build and roleplay fun of any LEGO theme. Activating the free augmented reality app brings the models to life, revealing a hidden world of interactive mysteries and challenges to solve. When combined, the two worlds make each other even more compelling and fun. The app also consists of a digital game that kids can play independent of the building set.\n\n\nDownload from the Apple App store here: http://lego.build/LEGOHiddenSide \n\nDownload from the Google: \nhttp://lego.build/LEGOHiddenSideGoogle", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OnHa4Cd03B0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OnHa4Cd03B0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OnHa4Cd03B0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OnHa4Cd03B0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OnHa4Cd03B0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "LEGO Hidden Side Trailer | Comic-Con SD 2019", "description": "LEGO Hidden Side Trailer | Comic-Con SD 2019\n\nHidden Side\u2122 invites kids to join a fearless team of ghost hunters, who dare see the unseen and help turn a haunted world back to normal, one ghost at a time.
