Taki and the rest of the Pip Club\u2019s members are busy preparing their booth. On to way to the discount store to buy some last-minute supplies, he came upon a new store in a back alley called Kikouya (House of Tricks). Entering the shop, he was greeted by a talking cat Tetmet who took his order and brought him everything he needed, and at a bargain too. When he was about to leave, the storeowner Kuroha asked him if he would like to \u2018buy time\u2019. He was perplexed at her question, but was too worried about finishing up the club\u2019s booth for the culture festival, muttering that \u2018if he only had one more day, then everything would be done in time\u2019. \u201cThank you, please come again,\u201d said Kuroha as he left.\n\nAs expected, there wasn\u2019t enough time for them to finish their preparations, so the club members all stayed overnight at the school to finish up. Although some parts were still not completely done, they planned to give it their all. When they woke up, they began their preparations for the culture festival the next day. An extra day had been added due to Taki\u2019s wish, and he was the only one who realized it.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/timepiece-ensemble", "videos": [{"id": 144171, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tTvefm2ePw8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTvefm2ePw8", "title": "GLac\u00e9 \u300eTimepiece Ensemble\u300f \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tTvefm2ePw8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
