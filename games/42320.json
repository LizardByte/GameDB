In the middle of the game, when the number of known girls was high, these \"bombs\" became the primary concern of the player, forcing careful planning and strategies like round-robin dating. Although the feature was still present in the later games, it was considerably reduced in importance and the difficulty in avoiding it.\n\nIn 1996, it was ported to the Super Famicom as Tokimeki Memorial: Densetsu no Ki no Shita de, and although drastically reduced in graphic and sound quality (the only voice clips were available during loading), included an exclusive CD with a radio drama and new arrangement of the ending theme, \"Futari no Toki\", this time sung by the majority of the girls, instead of just Shiori Fujisaki (the heroine of the first game).", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tokimeki-memorial-densetsu-no-ki-no-shita-de"}
