It was the first Game & Watch game. It is a single-screen single-player Game & Watch.\n\nIn Game A, the player tosses two balls in the air. As the balls fall, the player must catch and toss them up again. One point is earned for each successful catch. A dropped ball will display a broken ball and end the game. The object is to continuously catch the balls that fall and throw them back up, as in juggling. In Game B, the player must juggle three balls, and each successful catch rewards ten points instead of one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ball--2", "videos": [{"id": 42689, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LZSZzJ4UY04", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZSZzJ4UY04", "title": "Very first Game and Watch Commercial [1980]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LZSZzJ4UY04/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 71143, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3UhZwwTfu8c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UhZwwTfu8c", "title": "Ball (Original) Gameplay - Nintendo Game & Watch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3UhZwwTfu8c/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 71178, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cAkiaFPy9wo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAkiaFPy9wo", "title": "Game & Watch - Ball (c)1980 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cAkiaFPy9wo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
