It is the fifth numbered game in the beatmania series (but 6th beatmania arcade game) and is part of the BEMANI franchise.\n\nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch.\n\nbeatmania 5thMIX removed the combo count added in 3rdMIX, and restricted the flashing great judgement to EXPERT mode, both of these changes are reverted in the next entry in the series. Song selection has been reworked and are now shown in a list with difficulty levels shown to the left of the song name.\n\nFor the first time in the series a harder version of a chart is added. Only 4 songs feature them and the can only be played on stage 2 in Hard mode. The Modifiers SUDDEN and HI-SPEED were added.\n\nThe song list has 19 songs returning from 4thMIX, 7 Dancemania licenses and 18 new songs. The total track list contains 34 songs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatmania-5thmix-time-to-get-down", "videos": [{"id": 38202, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "oH1R3wH2nmQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH1R3wH2nmQ", "title": "beatmania 5thmix hardmode", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oH1R3wH2nmQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
