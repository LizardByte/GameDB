The sequel retains many elements from its predecessor, such as the adventure being in outer space, the element of gravity, and recurring objects such as Launch Stars and Sling Stars. Returning items include the Bee Mushroom and the Fire Flower. However, the game introduces new elements as well, such as the utilization of Yoshi, new power-ups like the Cloud Flower, and the use of a guide within the game for beginner players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-galaxy-2", "videos": [{"id": 14139, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "s5t3fV6ELNk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5t3fV6ELNk", "title": "Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Wii) March Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s5t3fV6ELNk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35824, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wGSdQdsHOzo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGSdQdsHOzo", "title": "Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Dolphin 5.0 | Wii Emulator Gameplay | HD.1080p 60\u1da0\u1d56\u02e2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wGSdQdsHOzo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119467, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "O7steQttNTo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7steQttNTo", "title": "Super Mario Galaxy 2 Official E3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O7steQttNTo/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1897, "name": "Voice"}]}
