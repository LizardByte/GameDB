The hero first has to be shot out of a cannon at whatever power level the player chooses. If Kirby falls down the drain three times, the game ends. As with Kirby's Toy Box - Baseball, the game could be played over and over during the brief period it was broadcast, but could not be played after that time, unless it had already been saved onto. Enemies in this game include King Dedede, Mr. Frosty, Kracko, Co-Kracko, Bounder, Waddle Dee, Crack-Tweet, and Elieel.\n\nLike every other sub-game in Kirby's Toy Box, this game could only be downloaded by the Satellaview during the brief period it was broadcast.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kirby-no-omochabako-pinball", "videos": [{"id": 50147, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "li1qDGA-CAE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li1qDGA-CAE", "title": "kirby no omochabako - pinball for SNES", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/li1qDGA-CAE/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 7008, "name": "Kirby no Omochabako"}]}
