After obtaining the necessary key cards and knocking out the guards, Catwoman unlocks the hidden entrance to Riddler\u2019s robot factory, hidden beneath the shop. At the same time, Riddler, still incarcerated at the Gotham City Police Department, attempts to communicate with his factory\u2019s AI system in order to command his Riddlerbots to free him (which he feebly disguises as a call to his lawyer). Catwoman taunts him over the phone, detailing her plan to steal his money and destroy his factory as payback for his actions against her. Furious at this notion, Riddler activates the factory\u2019s security measures, including Riddlerbots, lasers, an electrified floor, and a giant buzzsaw device similar to ones used in other traps of Riddler\u2019s. After evading the traps and destroying the robots, Catwoman reaches Riddler\u2019s main computer and proceeds to empty his accounts before activating the factory\u2019s self-destruct sequence, leaving an irate Riddler stuck in jail to be tasered by Cash (who has caught on to Riddler\u2019s antics).", "summary": "Batman: Arkham Knight - Catwoman's Revenge is a story-driven DLC released in November 2015. Set after the events of the main game, players control Catwoman as she seeks revenge on the Riddler for imprisoning her.\n\nThe mission focuses on stealth and combat, requiring players to navigate a Riddler hideout filled with enemies and traps. Unlike Batman\u2019s sections, Catwoman relies on agility and gadgets to outmaneuver opponents and solve puzzles.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-arkham-knight-catwomans-revenge", "videos": [{"id": 6546, "name": "November DLC Trailer", "video_id": "LsjhsgPm6sw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsjhsgPm6sw", "title": "Batman: Arkham Knight - November DLC Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LsjhsgPm6sw/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 68, "name": "Batman: Arkham"}]}
