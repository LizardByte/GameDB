There are still the standard windmill holes, castles, and the like, but the game really goes nuts by adding in touches like fire-breathing dragons, ill-willed flower patches, and dozens of hidden obstacles. Add to all of that the fact that there's a pack of mischief-making kids running around terrorizing the golfers, and you've got yourself one tense gaming experience. You choose between eight playable characters each of whom happens to be a representative of a species from the wild and make your way through 40 wacky holes. There are eight different game types to shake things up a bit, and four hidden boss characters to ensure that your game won't be easy. All of the graphics are 3D, and the game is packed with shortcuts, power-ups, and lots of other unexpected madness.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/minigolf-maniacs"}
