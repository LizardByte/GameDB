The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives or reaches 999,999 points. A radar, called a Long Range Scanner in the instruction manual, shows all enemies, including those not visible on the main screen.\n\nA player who achieved 10,000 points could send in a photo of the TV screen and receive a \"Chopper Commandos\" patch.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chopper-command", "videos": [{"id": 16627, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ABa0taeFKQM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABa0taeFKQM", "title": "Chopper Command on Atari 2600, 999,999", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ABa0taeFKQM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
