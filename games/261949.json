In that world there was only one living being, who wandered alone in search of company, her name was Orca.\n\nA great white whale with magical powers, the most beautiful being anyone who could see her would have ever met in their entire life. She was beautiful but sad.\n\nUnhappy with her loneliness, Orca decided to use her powers as a magical whale to create the islands of that world, but after doing so, she realized that the islands alone would not be enough to end her loneliness. So she created the beings that would inhabit those lands and divided them up, among all the handfuls of sand she had made.\n\nBut after they were created, the beings of the land complained:\n\n\"Why can only the great Orca cross the seas? Wouldn't it be fair if we had the same power?\"\n\nHearing their prayers, Orca gave them the gift of creation so that they could create boats and travel the world, which was no longer made up of water alone.\n\nSatisfied with her companions and tired of creating Orca decided to nap for a long time until her strength had fully recovered and she could discover more interesting things about the creatures she had created.\n\nIt is said that to this day, Orca rests in the depths of the sea, waiting for someone to wake her up when her world needs her.\n\nBut how do you wake up a whale sleeping at the bottom of the sea, you ask?\n\nFew people know how, but there are many stories about it... and one day one of them will prove to be true.", "summary": "Orca: A Lenda dos Mares is a role-playing game set in a fictional world, where almost the entire planet is covered in water, except for a few islands, created by Orca, a mystical being with the powers of a magic whale, who can create matter, life and give abilities to other beings at will.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orca-a-lenda-dos-mares"}
