This release is significant as it is the first portable game in the Tomb Raider series. This version has the standard Tomb Raider gameplay of running, jumping and switch-flipping, but presented in a side-view 2D style, reminiscent of Flashback. At Lara's disposal are 25 or so moves, which are crammed onto the 2 GBC buttons. There are also game-save crystals at special points throughout the levels. Although it shares its title with the first entry in the series, Tomb Raider for Game Boy Color follows a different storyline.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-starring-lara-croft", "videos": [{"id": 53525, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kA3Q8CErcEg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA3Q8CErcEg", "title": "Tomb Raider -  GBC Longplay/Walkthrough #107 [4Kp60]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kA3Q8CErcEg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
