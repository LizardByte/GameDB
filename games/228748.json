While completing the chores around the house, you find yourself reflecting on situations involving the neighborhood kids that have gone missing & ultimately deciding what you think might have been the right thing to do. Will you be taken by Krampus at the end of the night like the others, or will you be spared?", "summary": "In a final attempt to guarantee your place on the nice list, you decide to try and do some chores before midnight.
