After managing to reactivate the machine, restore the connection between the two worlds and talk to Bamboo, the protagonists try to bring him back to the world of Tanaboo by repeating the process that sent him to the world of dreams, obtaining a bolt of lightning from an old sorcerer. Inu name. However, the lightning also sends Parsley into the world of dreams. Here begins the new chapter, in which the protagonists will have to join forces to allow Parsley and Bamboo to return home.\n\nWhile they are in the world of dreams, Parsley and Bamb\u00f9 discover that the hypothesis developed at the end of the previous episode, namely that the rising of the sun would bring them home, will take a good two months to come true. Having neither food nor water, the two friends look for a way to get home sooner, and so they part ways, with Parsley exploring a giant lemon and Bamboo a giant shell. Shortly afterwards Parsley also reaches his panda friend, but finds him trapped in a gelatinous candy in a room full of sweets under the shell. Exploring the area, Parsley opens another smaller shell and discovers a visual link between the dream world and the world of Tanaboo. Through this connection, Parsley manages to talk to some of his friends (Aurora, Pagui and Mously), who are still in Bamboo's laboratory in Tanaboo. Parsley explains the situation to his friends, including the one with Bamb\u00f9, and Aurora offers to help with a loosening potion present in her magic book which, according to her, would be able to free Bamb\u00f9. Parsley runs to inform the panda inventor of the news, and Bamb\u00f9 reveals that through a device that he was building, it would be possible to exchange objects via the Televisogno, so as to also be able to pass the detangling potion. Pagui offers to look for the project and the pieces of the device, which will then be put together by Aurora with a spell. Pagui then undertakes to procure the ingredients to deliver to Aurora to make the detangling potion.\n\nWith the potion Parsley manages to get Bamb\u00f9 out of the jelly who, while he was imprisoned, had secretly developed the return plan, and explains to Parsley that to implement the plan two sugar crystals will be needed, available in the sweets room. In an attempt to recover them, Parsley accidentally breaks one, but makes up for it by finding another one in the giant lemon. Now ready for the return journey, the Inu sorcerer from the previous game appears in front of the two friends, who turns out to actually be the witch Zenda, their old enemy. At that moment the evil witch proudly admits that she was the one who planned everything about her, so as to make the nights of the inhabitants of Tanaboo full of nightmares, forcing them to buy beautiful dreams from her. Unaware of Parsley and Bamboo's plan and convinced that they will remain in the world of dreams forever, she vanishes into thin air with a: \"Goodbye!\". Meanwhile, the two friends reach the connecting shell with which they reveal the return plan to Aurora, Pagui and Mously. In the end Parsley and Bamboo finally manage to escape the dream world and return to Tanaboo. The game ends with the protagonists outside the laboratory thanking the player for playing and with Zenda covering her face in shame at the defeat.", "summary": "\"Prezzemolo in un Viaggio da Sogno\" is the second PC video game based on the mascot of Gardaland , the dragon Parsley .
