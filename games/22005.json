Almost every stage has unique design. \n- Spice up your game experience by fighting the (cute) boss \n- Play with other characters in New Game+. Access it after you finish the game with equal amount of character used. \n\nThere is no story in Miracle Fly. The characters are just having fun in the Dream World.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
