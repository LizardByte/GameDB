The purpose is to rescue the companions trapped in the mysterious energy hall by Warmon. There are 3 characters that the player can take. Select a \"character that can be used as a weapon\" according to the situation, defeat the nasty \"enemy character\" on the stage, and rescue the \"rescue character\". Since the attack method, speed, and behavior change depending on the selected Nisemon, it is a real pleasure to freely use various strategies.
