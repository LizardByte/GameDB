The Caboclo can help or hinder the local fisherfolk in their work, requiring offerings to be appeased, representing the will of the river or lake itself.\n\nIn some remote communities, however, the offerings are substituted by a gamble with said creature, a roll of the dice with survival on the line.\n\nIn all of these customs, the uneasy human-river tension is replicated in the human-monster relationship.\n\n-- Geography of Fisherfolk Myths, page 48.\n\nAmateur reporter Bento hoped to learn more about this folklore during a night fishing trip, dutifully documented by his camera. What he learned when he gambled with the lake is documented here.", "summary": "Drowned Lake is a horror game that combines exploration with survival elements, with a full announcement coming later this year.
