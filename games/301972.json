With a more elaborated and ambitious scope compared to its prequel, these maps hopefully will offer a different and unique experience. Each map has a different kind of atmosphere and purpose, and high attention was put into balancing the high energy gameplay moments with the quiet ones. Combat varies a lot in terms of encounters and enemy placement, and progression its mostly non linear with an emphasis on exploration and resource starvation if you are playing on UV.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/liminal-doom-2"}
