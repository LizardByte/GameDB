My indie game has entered the beta phase, and I'm happy to announce that all levels are now complete and mostly tested, meaning the game can now be played through from start to finish, with one of three possible endings.\n\nThere are still some gameplay parameters to fine-tune, and I'll be playing through the game several times to adjust the difficulty and length of each level, as well as fixing any known bugs. Additionally, I'll be adding various extra stuff, such as achievements, text translations, and Steam API integration. I'm also considering adding a leaderboard, although I haven't decided yet if it's really necessary.\n\nSome optimization work also needs to be done for weaker devices, balancing the graphic settings. Currently, the approximate playtime is around 3-4 hours, but of course, this depends heavily on the player's skills.\n\n#indiegames #betaphase #gameupdate #gamedevelopment #steamapi #achievements #gametrailers #gameplay #leveldesign #gametesting #optimization #graphicsettings #gaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cjh4tWTTzQ8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cjh4tWTTzQ8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cjh4tWTTzQ8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cjh4tWTTzQ8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cjh4tWTTzQ8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "HARD GLIDE |  Indie Game Beta Phase Update", "description": "Steam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1731390/Hard_Glide\n\nHello everyone!
