It is an updated version of Taito's original Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium. Like its predecessor, it is a straightforward baseball simulation game for the Famicom which was never released outside of Japan. Besides a roster update and a few graphical improvements there is little difference between this and the previous game in the series. This process of having minor incremental improvements between annual releases would eventually become common practice in console sports games."}
