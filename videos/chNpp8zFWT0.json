Oddly enough, it was actually meant to be a tie-in to the movie Japanese movie Gunhed: think live-action Gundam and you've got the idea. Even though it really doesn't bear much resemblance to the movie, it was quite a revelation for gamers in the late 80s, and this game was a huge system seller, both in the US and in Japan. \n\nI also have to give Kanye West a shout-out at this point - though I might not like what the man represents or how he conducts himself in the media, there's no denying he's got great taste in retro gaming!

This time I've uploaded it in 720p, 60 frames per second. Please make sure to watch it in this quality mode: if you watch it at the lower resolutions, many of the items, power-ups, and shots will be invisible because of the flickering effect that the system uses in order to display so many moving objects at once. 60fps allows it to display the same way that it originally appeared with a real TurboGrafx-16 on an old CRT TV. \n____________________________________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Nintend...\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chNpp8zFWT0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chNpp8zFWT0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chNpp8zFWT0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/chNpp8zFWT0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Blazing Lazers (TurboGrafx 16) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A beginning to end playthrough of Hudson/NEC's 1989 TurboGrafx 16 game, Blazing Lazers.\n\nPlayed through on the default difficulty level. \n\nThis is an absolutely incredible Compile shooter that really showed off what the TG16 was capable of.
