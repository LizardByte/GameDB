I didn't expect this to be viewed at all, but I'm glad it brought back memories for so many. I'll answer some of the most asked questions from the comments here again, since my previous replies have been removed due to containing links to downloads.\n\n\"How to play this game now?\" I'm running it on a Nokia emulator (found in the play store) through an Android emulator on PC. For the game itself, just look up the game title + \"java .jar file\" to find the download. You'll find different versions with different aspect ratios, and honestly I just picked the first one that worked at all. The reason I run it on an Android emulator is because downloading from these websites comes with risks of viruses. I don't recommend trying this on the phone you actually use! Consider this a warning. The game doesn't run well with the emulator controls, and it's the reason I've been putting off continuing this gameplay for over 3 years now.\n\n\"What Nokia was this game originally on?\" I honestly have no idea. I used to play it on my LG GW300 in 2009-2010. This game used to run on most phones with Java based operating systems from around that time.\n\n\"How to do/fix this in the game?\" I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that. I used to play this actively over 14 years ago, and I forgot most of it. Only what you see in this video is what I know currently.\n\nThanks for watching and reading.
