The goal is to prevent the screen from turning red by shooting abstract enemies with two crosshairs simultaniously. Constant demand for concentration without much distraction pulls you into a meditative flow. Since the difficulty increases the longer you play, you may need to sacrifice advancement to get yourself some air.\n\nHow long can you prevail? Improve your abilites and find strategies to go for the highest score on three difficulty Levels. Full controller support, including XINPUT and Dualshock devices.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 70227, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "w0uy1Nyei3o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0uy1Nyei3o", "title": "Meditation 5 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w0uy1Nyei3o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
