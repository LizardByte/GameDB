Upon returning to Earth, Billy asks Molly if it would be alright to browse through Mortimer's room, as there could be clues to Mortimer's plans. Persuading her that preventing the destruction of the Universe was more important than her brother's privacy, Billy finds a video tape on Mortimer's desk with a label in Standard Galactic Alphabet. The tape contains a message from Mortimer, giving Billy a clue that the Universal Toaster Cannon is being built on the planet Krodacia.\n\nOn Krodacia, Commander Keen finds a gigantic structure with only one entrance at the bottom, locked by seven keys. It's up to Keen to find the seven keys to get into Mortimer's base, and stop the Universal Toaster Cannon!\n\nThe story continues in Dead in the Desert, the first complete Keen 6 MOD.", "summary": "The Keys of Krodacia is the first complete Keen 4 mod, produced by Ceilick with music composed by KeenRush.
