It all starts when someone sends you a message from your friend's cell phone, asking for help to escape from a situation as complicated as it is obscure. From the various options, choose the ones that seem most appropriate and follow the course of the story, guiding a complete stranger through underground tunnels. Pass by creatures capable of inspiring madness in the eyes of the beholder. Your choice of options can change not only the course of the game's story, but also who you are in it. Find your way out or get lost in the process.\n\nCompared to the original Last Message, 14 achievements and 10 different endings have been added to this game. Much of the game's artwork has been redesigned! Photos have been improved and entire dialogs have been rewritten! Now with audio (the use of headphones is highly recommended) and costs less than a snack at the snack bar!", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-message-plus", "videos": [{"id": 125773, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BpXRTD7q7vU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpXRTD7q7vU", "title": "Ultima Mensagem+ Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BpXRTD7q7vU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
