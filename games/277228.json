Fending for themselves, they soon come across a mansion whose lone habitant is a stoic maid. Seeking shelter, they take refuge in the mansion, only for the stay to be anything but restful.\n\nThis surreal RPG-Maker horror game was a submission in the March 2001 edition of the monthly contest that Enterbrain would host. Gu-L won first place, with Hyogo's very own Yubu Yakushiro receiving 30,000\u5186 as the prize.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gu-l--1"}
