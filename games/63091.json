Most problems are of \"find a key or other way to open the door\" kind, though some tasks are of more intricate kind.\n\nThe action switches between 3 characters. Demir and Ebru are primarily using hand weapons (though can also perform melee attacks to push enemies away). Inzar excels in magic and martial arts - he employs two blades on his wrists to serve justice to the monsters.", "summary": "Kabus 22 is a horror\u2013action game set in Kadik\u00f6y district in Istanbul.
