Since then, Vayne has led the life of a hermit, his only companion being a Mana in cat form named Sulpher. Vayne is invited to the Al-Revis Academy for alchemy training by Zeppel, one of the professors. He is quickly indoctrinated into the school by becoming part of an atelier led by Flay Gunnar (an older student who is known as The Defender of Justice) along with two other students, Jess (a clumsy girl who is nevertheless adept at alchemy), and Nikki (an impulsive beastgirl). They are soon joined by Pamela (the school's resident ghost), Anna (an 11-year-old master swordsman), Roxis (the son of a famous family of alchemists who is quickly forced to join the workshop by Flay), and Muppy (an alien the group discovers on an assignment). The eight of them are able to succeed at completing assignments, learn the skills of alchemy, and allow the workshop to prosper.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mana-khemia-alchemists-of-al-revis", "videos": [{"id": 86321, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "UD7ffLBs1wY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD7ffLBs1wY", "title": "Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis - Opening [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UD7ffLBs1wY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 86322, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VF-GF5CPYiA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF-GF5CPYiA", "title": "First Mana Khemia English trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VF-GF5CPYiA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 86323, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Sz_knNC2bnc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz_knNC2bnc", "title": "Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis Japanese Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sz_knNC2bnc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 86324, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "n5iHS_5CtWE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5iHS_5CtWE", "title": "Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis (PS2) - No Commentary #1 | Gameplay Archive", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n5iHS_5CtWE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
