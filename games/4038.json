It is to this day the only title in the series that uses the \"College Basketball\" designation rather than \"College Hoops\". It is also the only title for the series to appear on the GameCube and the GameCube's only college basketball game. It features former Duke Blue Devils guard Jay Williams on the cover. This game was released in very limited quantities and is one of the more difficult GameCube titles to find.[1]"}
