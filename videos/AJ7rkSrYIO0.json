Now Internet. I couldn't leave you hanging knowing there was a sequel to the first. Sit Back, Have a Pity Laugh...and Enjoy!\n\nYou can Subscribe by clicking this link! Thank you!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Criousgamers\n\nSo it turns out that there was another one...IM SORRY INTERNET. IM SORRY THAT I AM DOING THIS TO YOU. But lets be honest, the first one wasn't 100% garbage. It had some redeeming qualities and ultimately it made me think...or say WTF a few times. Now with that being said, we can move on to the sequel and see if the Developer has learned anything along the way....*queue suspenseful music*\n\nHE HAS! He actually made a better 'Experimental Game' that puts the focus on the Narrator a little bit more. Ultimately it still fails to meet the Stanley Parable Benchmark set before it...or after it...or during it. The game itself lacks awareness and an identity. The narrator is merely reading off of a script, and you as the player have no control in what is going on, you are simply moving from point A to point B, not being able to choose your own destiny.\n\nThe idea of the game is for Random things to happen to you. Which...surely they do...but overall they mean nothing in the scheme of the plot. But hey, maybe that's the idea? \n\n It also doesnt help giving the protagonist a voice. He is suppose to be me...why do I sound like I have broken English?\n\nWell...that's An Apparently Normal Room for ya. I hope you enjoyed it. Maybe the Developer will put out a Third one...ya know, Third Strikes the Charm? \n\nIf you want to play it, you can play it here!...its Free\nhttp://www.desura.com/games/an-apparently-normal-room \n\nFollow me on the Internets!\nhttp://www.twitter.com/ChilledChaos\nhttp://www.facebook.com/TheChilledChaos\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/Chilledchaos", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AJ7rkSrYIO0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AJ7rkSrYIO0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AJ7rkSrYIO0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AJ7rkSrYIO0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AJ7rkSrYIO0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "An Apparently Normal Room (An Experimental Game Sequel)", "description": "Welcome to 'An Apparently Normal Room' The Sequel to the Fantastic game that we all know and loved...\"Insert Title Here\".
