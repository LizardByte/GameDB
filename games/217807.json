To the east, the city-continent of Mantris is home to the Neurotechs multicultural people whose technology has invaded their everyday life.\n\nThat was twenty years ago, and time hasn't softened anyone's resentment. The Appologium is a vestige of the Heroes\u2019 War that has been turned into a sporting event, a noisy cemetery filled with celebrities who died on the field of honor that the audience visits out of nostalgia, while entertaining delusions of grandeur.\n\nTwenty years later, the battle between Chaka and Faustus remains unsurpassed in terms of impact. More than memorable or unforgettable, it's legendary. And it grows even more so every year, since it tolled the end of the Heroes' War.\n\nEach year, gladiators from Arkhant and Mantris reinterpret the duel of champions in the Appologium to try to pick the lock of history, in search of a definitive answer. Which one \u2013 Chaka the Genetic or Faustus the Primus of Shadows \u2013 won?", "summary": "Cross The Ages: TCG is a fast competitive trading card NFT game where players compete in strategic duels to capture more space than their opponent on the game board.\n\nThe game is designed in a \u201cblitz\u201d format.
