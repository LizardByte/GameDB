As the eponymous Guildmaster, the player must save the kingdom from a mysterious threat.\n\nThe player controls a party of two: the Guildmaster and his companion Losi from the previous adventure in The Great Ultizurkian Underland. Basic interaction with the game world is accomplished by using the mouse, talking to NPCs requires the player to type keywords highlighted in yellow. The game boasts a great degree of interactivity, with the player being able to manipulate most items in a way they would behave in real life (e.g. fill a bucket with water and then put a burning torch out with it).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
