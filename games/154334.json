She met her Mr. Clown, she was amused and giggled; she plucked the white rose from her hair and gave it to her Mr. Clown.\n\nBut here is an ancient castle where power is paramount, and the old king personally chose Lin's first dance partner in her life. That was the youngest Earl in the empire, and the old king said that it was the best home for Her Royal Highness the Princess.\n\nThe young princess can't control so much, all she wants is \"love\". Love is something only found in fairy tale books, love is a treasure that the tyrannical princess never had.\n\nEven if this \"love\" is distorted or false, as long as it feels warm to the touch, that's enough. The little princess knows it well, she once thought so.\n\nBut... in order to get \"love\" and to be watched more by others, are the bloody footprints that I have stepped on along the way, those unreasonable troubles and willful actions, are they really correct?\n\nEvery full moon, the undead will walk back and forth in the empty palace. They wept, complained, and told Her Royal Highness over and over again that they should keep their heads down.\n\nNow, light or darkness, it's all up to you to choose - but first, judge, decide which way is \"right\" and which heart is clean.\n\nBoth the rose and the dagger are in the palm of your hand.", "summary": "\"Night at the Circus\" is a horizontal 2D plot-oriented puzzle game, aiming to tell a fairy tale about \"love and reality\".", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ma-xi-tuan-zhi-ye"}
