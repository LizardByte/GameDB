Contrary to most text adventures of its time the player does not use directions like north, south, up etc. to maneuver through the game world. Instead he gives instructions to head to a specific location. Therefore the player has the ability to look ahead. Clues to the solution of the game are hidden in a poem which came along with the game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
