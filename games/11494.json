It is part of the Genkai Tokki series and the sequel to Moe Chronicle. The player will need to make a team of five monster girls for battle. The protagonist Zenox can\u2019t attack, but he\u2019ll help provide support with power ups. The new \"Insert\" command also lets  you move ahead one of the characters in the attacking order. Upon defeating a monster girl, you\u2019ll get to recruit them through its touchscreen \"scratching\" feature. There are also some items that will allow you to get them to join you later without having to do the scratch feature. They will allow you to instead give them a scratch later on your own time.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 4758, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fcHcDrvslYc"}, {"id": 5400, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "RUOpeX4wwSk"}]}
