There are four different levels, each with 2 or 3 stages, where Batman runs around beating up thugs and jumping between platforms before taking on a boss. Each stage ends with a boss encounter - some generic machine or thug in the early stages, and a classic Batman villain at the final stage of the level. The four levels takes Batman through a theater where he takes on the Mad Hatter, a frozen office building where he takes on Mr. Freeze, a graveyard where he takes on the Scarecrow, and finally an amusement park where he takes on Harley and the Joker.\n\nBatman typically fights with projectile attacks - he has an unlimited supply of batarangs, but can pick up other weapons with limited ammunition in small item boxes along the way. They're all more powerful than the batarangs. Once Batman gets close to an enemy, he will switch to melee attacks, which deal more damage than the projectiles. Batman can make several types of jumps, both upwards and sideways. Pressing the jump button twice does a double jump. Batman starts out with 9 extra lives, and instantly respawns where he died after losing one, with a full health bar, all ammunition intact, and all inflicted damage and defeated enemies accounted for. There are also multiple extra lives and life bar refill items spread around on the stages. The game has infinite continues and a password system, allowing the player to start over from any previously reached stage.", "summary": "Break out your Batarang! When the scum of Gotham City decide they want to take over, it's no joke... Or is it? The Joker and his cohorts kidnap Robin as the perfect bait to lure Batman. You can bet that the Dark Knight is going to be up to his ears\nin hard-hitting combat before this episode is over!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 30971, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "g9Dums7YcVw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Dums7YcVw", "title": "Adventures of Batman & Robin | Game Gear Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g9Dums7YcVw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
