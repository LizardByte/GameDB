Fusion works like a temporary evolution during battle, transforming your player character and chosen (human) companion into a single monster form. From then on, until you un-fuse, the two characters work as one, with combined elemental types, stats, and access to both sets of moves. Some of your opponents have access to this ability too, so you\u2019ll need to get creative to come out ahead! \n \nSee how players can use the Fusion system to customize their team to truly reflect their own style in this new trailer. \n \nMade by Bytten Studio and Published by Raw Fury, Cassette Beasts will be released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass, PC and Switch.\n\nCassette Beasts is an open world RPG with turn-based battles where you record and capture a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle! Explore the remote island of New Wirral as you try to find a way home, and record monsters to your trusty cassette tapes to gain their abilities! \n \nWishlist & follow on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/ \nStay in touch on Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/HUWjFX3 \nWeb: https://www.cassettebeasts.com/\n\n#CassetteBeasts #openworld #NintendoSwitch #Xbox #rpg #indiegame #gamepass", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H_TebiMOPvw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H_TebiMOPvw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H_TebiMOPvw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H_TebiMOPvw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H_TebiMOPvw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cassette Beasts | New Fusion Trailer | Wishlist TODAY!", "description": "Follow and Wishlist Cassette Beasts today: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/\n\nIn Cassette Beasts, The Fusion system allows the player to combine any two monster forms of the 120 available in the game to generate over fourteen thousand unique combinations.
