Does it sound easy? In this fun object tapping game, while you advance with the donuts, you pass through a series of endless obstacles on top and bottom while moving the donut. On your way forward, you will come across coffee cups that you have to collect to build a score. If you hit any obstacles on top or bottom, you lose the game.
