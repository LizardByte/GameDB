Inside the complex where, every day, the entity questions world leaders about aspects of humanity - a potentially lethal process - an old scientist of unspecified gender is building a machine.\n\nClinging to a few precious memories, with each passing day the scientist gathers components and toils on their obscure project, as the clock ticks relentlessly towards a horrifying climax.\n\nI dream of you and ice cream is a point-and-click adventure game with a very simple interface and an emphasis on puzzle solving. For every two puzzles solved, players are rewarded with a partial solution which can be used in another puzzle.\n\nThere are no spoken lines or written dialogue in the game: Everything is communicated through speech bubbles, symbols and emotions.\n\nThe game will be available for the Nintendo Switch on June 17 2020 at the price of $4.99 USD. Preordering will be available on June 3 with a 10% discount. Touch as well as gamepad inputs are supported.
