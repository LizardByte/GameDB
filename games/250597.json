In general, in a matter of days, the city has degraded from the cultural capital of the most that neither is the main ass of the planet. The streets are full of homeless people, cops, grannies with bags and all sorts of alien life forms, and not a single bespectacled intellectual, armed with a bag with a dozen books from Mayakovsky. The army? Well, yes, it tried to do something. But, unfortunately, it failed.\n\nAnd so the angry aliens roam the ravaged streets, looking for somewhere else to shit. At the back of the morgue, they find a secluded room where, to the sound of lashing, the last Petersburg intellectuals hatch their evil plans - a sadistic schoolteacher and her favorite student in a hare suit. And now a big yellow robot grabs the teacher with its claws and carries her away to unknown lands. From this very moment, in fact, and begins a victorious expulsion of the abominable aliens from St. Petersburg. After all, now they will have to fight not some military, but the masochistic hare, who has just lost his Mistress. A dangerous adversary, isn't he?", "summary": "Russian action FPS game.
