Venture outside of Hope County on thrilling Expeditions to unique and memorable locations across the USA including wetlands, canyons, and coastal regions.\n- Expeditions and Outposts are different every playthrough, for rewarding missions that increase in challenge and are surprising every time.\n\nFar Cry New Dawn: Story Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UbisoftNA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVEfKfMXSUs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVEfKfMXSUs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVEfKfMXSUs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVEfKfMXSUs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVEfKfMXSUs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Far Cry New Dawn: Story Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]", "description": "Sh*t just got real.
