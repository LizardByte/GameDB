Being the first of the series released for a game console (for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive under the title Lotus Turbo Challenge), the fuel limit and difficulty levels were dropped, and the lap-based levels were replaced with course-based time trials, (not unlike arcade games such as Out Run), with the player required to complete each course within a specified time to qualify for the next one.\n\nIn addition to the Esprit Turbo SE, Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 also featured the Lotus Elan SE, hence 'Esprit' being dropped from the title. There was no choice of car however; the player runs with the Elan SE on odd levels, and with the Esprit on even levels.\n\nLotus 2's single-player mode uses all of the game screen instead of half, and opponent cars appear in a variety of colors (opponent cars in the original game were all white). However, music is absent from racing altogether; the player instead hears the car's engine sound.\n\nLotus 2 was developed for the Amiga and then converted for the other platforms.", "videos": [{"id": 40611, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "vETonlaTZ4c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vETonlaTZ4c", "title": "Amiga Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 Intro OST High Quality", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vETonlaTZ4c/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40612, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JLlWlsb9GpQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLlWlsb9GpQ", "title": "Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 Longplay (Amiga) [50 FPS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JLlWlsb9GpQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
