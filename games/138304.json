The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account.\n\nThe game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one \u2018professional foul\u2019 (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.\n\nThis is the version that would be ported to various consoles, such as the SNES, Genesis, and in North America under the title \"Championship Soccer '94\".", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensible-soccer-european-champions-92-slash-93-edition", "videos": [{"id": 53934, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8DrTZ92M1sg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DrTZ92M1sg", "title": "DOS Game: Sensible Soccer - European Champions 92/93 Edition", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8DrTZ92M1sg/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4702, "name": "Sensible Soccer"}]}
