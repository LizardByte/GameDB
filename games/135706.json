In Dragonblight, the bones of an ancient power stir, and good and evil prepare for a clash that will save the world\u2026or one that could bring about its utter destruction. And it all hinges on one name: Galakrond.", "summary": "Galakrond\u2019s Awakening is the final solo adventure in the Year of the Dragon and will conclude the saga that began with The Dalaran Heist. When we last left our heroes and villains, the Tombs of Terror had been unsealed, spreading plagues across the sands of Uldum. The League of Explorers defeated the Plague Lords, but Arch-Villain Rafaam escaped with the Plague of Undeath. We now know why: to resurrect Galakrond, the progenitor of all dragons!\n\nWill E.V.I.L. prevail and prove that Rafaam is truly the evilest of all villains? Will the Explorers defeat Rafaam and save the world? In this adventure, you have the power to choose. Galakrond\u2019s Awakening is two stories in one, giving players the ability to play through both versions of the story and experience two completely different endings. Unlike The Dalaran Heist and Tombs of Terror, Galakrond\u2019s Awakening returns to the classic linear adventure format, allowing you to progress through the story by completing individual boss encounters in order.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hearthstone-descent-of-dragons-galakronds-awakening", "collections": [{"id": 2342, "name": "Hearthstone"}]}
