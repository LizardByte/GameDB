As in, we rebel against the Robots of the dreaded Rivals - but in style! Spice up your look with four new sets of unique armor (one per class), new helmets, and new Paintjobs. The Robot Rebellion Pack - crudely cobbled together during those long nights spent on the Space Rig waiting for the next engagement. The opposite of chic, perhaps, but eminently usable.\n\n- 4 unique suits of Armor, one for each Class\n- A unique helmet in two variants (Full Face & Half Face)\n- Robot Rebellion Paintjob for other Armors\n- Robot Rebellion Paintjob for your Weapons\n- Robot Rebellion Paintjob for Bosco\n- Robot Rebellion Paintjob for your Pickaxe\n\nImportant note: The contents of this Pack are cosmetic only!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
