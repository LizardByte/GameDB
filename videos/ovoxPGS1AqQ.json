Start the game as the usual unpleasant memory and reincarnate into a real phobia by breaking through the most hidden corners of consciousness of Jimmy.\n\nThe whole game will unfold in the inner world of a boy who once saw several clowns at a fair. Their images secured by support of Depression are making their way into the depths of his consciousness through the nightmare, meeting Jimmy\u2019s memories on their way, anxieties and bright images. Will the clowns be able to supplant all objective fears of Jimmy and take the place of his main horror?\n\nMusic provided by Expecte Amour - https://expecteamour.bandcamp.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ovoxPGS1AqQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ovoxPGS1AqQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ovoxPGS1AqQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ovoxPGS1AqQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ovoxPGS1AqQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fearmonium  - Old Trailer", "description": "Watch the new trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMqDePE7CTU\nWishlist it now - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1068360/Fearmonium/\n\nFearmonium is a psychedelic action-platformer where suspense intertwines with humor.
