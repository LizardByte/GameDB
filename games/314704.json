In a statement, EA said the Don's Edition would \"take full advantage\" of the Sixaxis controller's motion sensor, and would also feature added gameplay in the form of \"The Corleone Expansion Pack\".\n\nThe Don's Edition features a more basic form of the gesture-based BlackHand control scheme seen in the Wii version. The game uses the SIXAXIS' motion sensor functionality in interrogations and, to a limited degree, during melee combat. As in the Wii, if the player wishes to lift someone from their knees, they simply pull the controller upwards. Swinging the controller from side to side swings the enemy likewise. Slamming someone against a wall is accomplished by pushing the controller away from the player. Unlike in the Wii version, however, where shooting and driving were handled using the Wii Remote, in The Don's Edition, shooting and driving are controlled using the analog sticks.\n\nUnique to The Don's Edition are the \"Corleone challenges\". These are time based minigames that have no effect on the story. The player must see how much of a certain action they can accomplish in a given time - such as how many different execution styles they can perform, how many banks they can rob, or many businesses they can extort etc. When the game first came out, the player's scores were uploaded to an online leaderboard.\n\nEA shut down their servers for the game on April 13, 2012, meaning players can no longer upload their scores. However, the mini-games are still playable.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-godfather-the-dons-edition--1", "videos": [{"id": 124116, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7Kvy-iCwlU4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kvy-iCwlU4", "title": "THE GODFATHER: THE DON'S EDITION | PS3 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Kvy-iCwlU4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
