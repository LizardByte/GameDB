It is similar to other squad-based games such as Jagged Alliance and X-COM.\nThe game takes place in a region where civil war has left the country in chaos. The Khondo, a vicious band of looting militia have taken control of the country. You lead a small squad of mercenaries, who have vowed to restore order and rid the country of the Khondo.\n\nYou need to carefully plot your way through the region, recruiting mercenaries, upgrading your skills, procuring armour and weapons and forming alliances with friendly militia. Each location in the campaign map hosts hostile militia, which you must fight in turn-based squad combat. \n\nWhen your squad is strong enough you can confront the main militia army, but it will not be easy - you will need help from your allies and the best weapons and armour.\n\nNearly everything in the game is randomly generated, including the campaign map, enemy and resource locations. Scene layout and buildings are procedurally generated, leading to a huge variety of different scenes which your squad has to fight through.\n\nFor more information see: https://ed-welch.itch.io/merc-tactics", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x-aFolyN4_w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x-aFolyN4_w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x-aFolyN4_w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x-aFolyN4_w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x-aFolyN4_w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Merc Tactics 1.4 Beta", "description": "Merc Tactics is a top-down tactical turn-based RPG in which you engage in epic tactical shootouts.
