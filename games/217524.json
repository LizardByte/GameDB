Now demons, once banished to the bowels of the earth, have escaped. And after their long, unholy hibernation, the Yokai hunger.\n\nMotoori noticed small signs first. The young Orochi was the first to warn of the villagers\u2019 strange behavior. Honorable Nobushi babbled and cursed. Aramusha bent and twisted impossibly. At length, the eyes of the Samurai took on pale glows \u2013 the last mutation before their massacre on Temple Garden. By then the Yokai\u2019s possession was complete.
