It features all 251 Pok\u00e9mon from the first and second generations. It was released in North America as simply Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2, as it was the second Stadium game to be released there. In Japan, Pocket Monsters' Stadium Kin Gin was the third game of the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium series. The Japanese edition also featured the capability to use the Pok\u00e9mon Mobile System from Pok\u00e9mon Crystal which was also released on the same day.\n\nThis game featured support for all three original Game Boy Pok\u00e9mon games (Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, and Yellow) and the three Game Boy Color games (Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal). As in the previous Stadium games, Pikachu from Yellow was a hidden character if the game cartridge was connected. The majority of the game takes place inside the new location White City, where various facilities for battling, organizing, researching, and playing with Pok\u00e9mon are located. This can be considered to be the Pok\u00e9mon League for the second generation games. The sequel to the popular Pok\u00e9mon Stadium features minigames, multiplayer, and league mode.\n\n\nWhile Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 does have a storyline, progress in the game can be made by winning Cups in the Stadium and completing the Gym Leader Castle. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle completed, the player's Rival will appear. Defeating the Rival will unlock Round 2, in which the player must re-challenge the Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and the Rival in order to complete the game. It should be noted, however, that they have different Pok\u00e9mon and the difficulty is much higher.\n\n\nLike its predecessor, Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 is compatible with the Transfer Pak: an attachment to the Nintendo 64 controller with a slot to insert Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, including Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver. This allows players to use Pok\u00e9mon trained in their Game Boy games to compete in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2's multiple game modes.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xq6uOxZqKJQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xq6uOxZqKJQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xq6uOxZqKJQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Pokemon Stadium 2 Official Trailer (2000, Nintendo)", "description": "Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2, known as Pocket Monsters' Stadium Kin Gin (\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30a2\u30e0\u91d1\u9280 Pokemon Sutajiamu Kin Gin, lit.: Pok\u00e9mon Stadium Gold Silver) in Japan, is a video game for the Nintendo 64.
