Players can work together or fight against each other in activities such a mining, construction, PvP, scientific research etc to have fun and increase wealth in their blockchain based assets. EvolutionLand is also a DAO: decentralized autonomous community that allows users to create, experience content and applications, and thus profit.\nEvolution land is a showcase of Darwinia cross-chain solution, the third continent will be deployed on Darwinia Network. On the one hand it\u2019s a game, like SimCity on blockchain, where gamers can buy or sell lands, mine resources like gold, wood, water, fire and silicon materials produced on the land or synthesize the elements into props in smelters, as well as play in casinos, arenas or even in third-party Dapps. On the other hand it\u2019s a perfect learning playground, where people that are far from blockchain technology can gain some experience: when deposit RINGs into Gringott bank and get KTON as a prize (staking) and as a voting rights, as soon as Evolution Land is DAO. And, of course, cross-chain transfers \u2014 when resources are transferred from one Continent to another.\n\n#darwinia #parachain #evolutionland\nhttps://www.evolution.land/\nhttps://darwinia.network/\nhttps://t.me/DarwiniaNetwork", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UjjQ3kBHlUg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UjjQ3kBHlUg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UjjQ3kBHlUg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UjjQ3kBHlUg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Darwinia | Evolution Land | Blockchain Game on Polkadot and ETH | NFT | RINGS", "description": "EVOLUTION LAND AS GAMING, LEARNING AND TECHNOLOGY\nEvolution Land is a virtual management game based on blockchain.
