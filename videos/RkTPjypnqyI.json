Also, I was *quite* pleasantly surprised that it is such an EXCELLENT little game on the order of the original 1980 Atari arcade game Tempest, only on a 2d playing grid this time instead of 3d, and that is what makes this Turmoil so damn fun to play!!!\r\n\r\nRight up front, you have to think as really fast as you can fire in order to take down the many enemies that stand in your way!  As well, you have some serious rapid-fire capabilities to help you out as you move up and down across the grid.  The controls take a bit of getting used to here when you first play, but after you get past them, this is where this game TRULY shines big when it comes to pushing down your adversaries indeed, and I just love this kind of stuff in a fixed shmup... especially today!!!  ;)\r\n\r\nAs for the tanks, the only way to destroy them is if you can hit 'em from behind.  And about the blinking white circles that first appear on the screen, you can go to the inner sections of the grid where they are and capture them for BIG points... but do it quickly or else they turn into rapidly bouncing orbs that go back-and-forth on the horizontal sides of the grid, making travel a nuisance!\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the enemies... well, you can easily destroy them with just one hit.  ^^\r\n\r\nYou DO NOT want to miss this splendid forgotten classic of a game, which is also available on the Atari 2600, too!!
