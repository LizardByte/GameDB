The game focuses on a deep skilling system, massive fantasy open-world, engaging quests, and a complex, skill-based combat system.\n\nIn TitanReach you have the freedom to play the way you want. You can create a tanky sorcerer, a quick and nimble fighter, or even avoid combat entirely.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/titanreach"}
