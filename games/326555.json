Dungeon Odyssey creates a random world for you each time you play. So no two games are ever the same. And to add to the fun, the game is completely customizable (moddable) so that players can create their own modules for others to play.\n\nYou will become a character within the game and will play the role of that character as you venture through the world. You will have one main quest to complete in the module, and many other smaller quests to complete if you wish. As you decide on a style of playing, you can shape your character towards that style with different items, skills, and spells.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-odyssey"}
