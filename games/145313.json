Equipped with Burst technology, these two cutting-edge craft were entrusted to humanoid AI terminal Ti2 and test pilot Riga Pratica. Flying the Silver Hawk Burst fighters alone into enemy territory without network support, the two heroes braved overwhelming odds to secure victory and liberation for Darius.\n\nIt is now 1910 D.C., and repairs on the hyperspace network have begun to reconnect the pockets of humanity scattered across the vast reaches of space. Combat data transmitted from Darius soon sees Burst-equipped Silver Hawk fighters constructed in every inhabited galaxy. The stage is set for mankind\u2019s grand counteroffensive. A team of heroes takes wing, flying into battle and the pages of history.", "summary": "Taito's Darius series began with the titular arcade game, Darius, in 1986 and comprises numerous side-scrolling shooting games released in arcades, many of which were later ported to game consoles.\nThis game is a port of the 2010 arcade game, DariusBurst Another Chronicle EX, including the final update and exclusive new features for this version.\nIt adds the previously omitted Event Mode, with brand new events too, and also includes the Murakumo ship, playable across all modes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dariusburst-another-chronicle-ex-plus", "videos": [{"id": 47878, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "P3VA2IEIPr8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3VA2IEIPr8", "title": "\u30c0\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30ebEX+ \u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u9577\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u521d\u898b\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u3066\u307f\u305f_DariusBurst EX+", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P3VA2IEIPr8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
