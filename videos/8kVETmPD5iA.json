Gameplay footage is not final and is subject to change.*\n\nYour only weapon against an ongoing robot onslaught is your hoverboard. Hop in the shoes of Vihra, a young runaway mechanic, and venture into the remains of a civilization destroyed by greed and fear. Ride your way out of danger and into robots' face plates as you gain new abilities!\n\nAt the core of OVERRIDER lies the satisfaction of movement. Players will need to learn the ins and outs of riding before they can master the rejuvenating Earth\u2019s landscapes.  Engage in high-speed combat with rogue machines. The faster you are, the more damage you deal. With a seamless blend of movement and action, OVERRIDER offers an experience that keeps players on the edge of their seat.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO WOOLIE FOR VOICING THE VIDEO.
