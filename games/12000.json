In the \"gangsters mode\", you simply have to escape the city while avoiding the cops. In the \"police mode\", you have to control 5 police cars in order to prevent the gangsters from escaping the city and arrest them. Those two modes give some diversity to the game although its expectancy is a little short.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 34436, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0c7TqD-hAGw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c7TqD-hAGw", "title": "Chicago 90 gameplay (PC Game, 1989)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0c7TqD-hAGw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 34437, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XzajALhrC20", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzajALhrC20", "title": "Let's Play: Chicago 90 (Amiga)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzajALhrC20/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
