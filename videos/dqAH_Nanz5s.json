{"id": "dqAH_Nanz5s", "snippet": {"title": "Lucky Fighter II [\u3089\u304d\u2606\u3075\u3041\u3044] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Lucky Fighter II is the first of many iterations of Doujin Fighter in a series by D.C.S., originally released in 2008. Over a period of four to five years, the game would go through several phases: \"Lucky Fighter II: Comic 1\", \"Lucky Fighter II: Otsu\" (Second), \"Lucky Fight Vs. Ika Musume\" (Squid Girl), \"Lucky Fight Vs. Ika Musume 2\", \"Lucky Fight Vs. Ika Musume 3\", and \"Lucky Fight Vs. Ika Musume 3X\" (the definitive version). What originally started out as a small spoof of the \"Street Fighter II X Lucky Star\" meme from the anime (in which Konata and her friend's come face-to-face with Guile, who is just labeled as \"Foreigner\") gradually evolved into a fairly competent derivative of Capcom's \"Pocket Fighter\" with old and new mechanics thrown in. We will be going over the base game and the final game in this channel.\n\nIn this iteration, there are only four playable characters and a fifth unplayable boss character (a \"Shin Akuma\" version of Konata). The gameplay is kept very simple along the lines of vanilla SFII and a basic base of Pocket Fighter -- players can not air block, have a few basic special moves, one super move and a three button attack system (Punch / Kick / Charge or Super). To help things move along a little faster, players can dash forwards or backwards and guard cancel for 50% of their special gauge, and each character has different traits. For example, Konata is the only one (in this version) who can do \"Cosplay Combos\" which can be alternated by switching punches and kicks in the sequence (just like Pocket Fighter, this would later be extended to the whole cast on top of a slew of other additions), Tsukasa can double jump, Kagami has a floaty high jump, and Miyuki is the resident charge character. \n\nAs players are attacked, gems will come out that upgrades their basic special moves in range, hits, or utility, and each has three stages. Charge attacks are slow, but they generate the most gems when they connect (and they are the only attacks that can be done when dashing, although it loses its gem modifier), and gems are carried over between matches. The game's difficulty seems to be cranked up by default like a lot of D.C.S. fighters (Rena Fighter, Haruhi Grappler, etc.) which leads to some less than stellar matches as the game's simplicity leaves you with usually one way to approach the opponents without getting steam rolled (as they are psychic, such as Kagami countering every close range attack automatically). In this sense, the lack of an aerial guard is actually a blessing as you can exploit the enemy with good ol' SFII shenanigans and anti-airs.\n\nThe game is pretty simple in the audio / visual department, though there's a few neat effects here and there (this would also get overhauled in later versions). We will go over \"Lucky Fight Vs. Ika Musume 3X\" in the near future which has triple the roster and more fleshed-out mechanics. All iterations of this game seem to be very hard to find, especially the later iterations (which almost never show up for sale) and D.C.S. is still profiting from their works, so no distribution at this time unfortunately, but we are working out a way to keep this game preserved. This is a video of the game in action with a small special exhibition at the end.
