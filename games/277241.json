Knowledge of the series is mandatory to fully enjoy and understand the game.\nThis is an Umineko fanwork unlike any you've read up to this point. Taking place in an alternate world -- the extent of which I cannot share here, I'm afraid -- you take control of a woman, sifting through records of a strange database. The smell of coffee lingers in the air. The night is long.\nWhat will she find? More importantly -- what will you?\n\nThe gameplay is simple: all you have to do is dig for the truth. How far you dig, how much of the truth you know -- or, you believe you know -- is entirely up to you. There is no ending, just as there is no beginning. Dig until you don't want to. Theorize. Have someone else play it and exchange notes -- maybe someone's gotten a piece of information you haven't?\n\nWhen you're satisfied, walk away. The truth is out there, just as much as it may be in here.", "summary": "An Umineko fangame.
