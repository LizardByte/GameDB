It's about getting messages from drunk people, about the need to justify what you're doing and maybe just about ordinary teenage-kitsch, too.\n\nThe game mixes personal experiences with fiction and would best be described as a mood-game. It's not necessarily about the story itself, but about a specific feeling at a specific time. It takes about 10 - 15 minutes to complete.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-happy-new-year", "videos": [{"id": 135017, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6rC6ws8Ki0o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rC6ws8Ki0o", "title": "A Happy New Year Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6rC6ws8Ki0o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
