Wii features completely new courses, custom tilesets, replaced music, edited backgrounds, and a 2D World Map. It's being made entirely out of love for this amazing series of games, and is designed to be played on real hardware, as a free patch.\n\nCurrently, I am the only person working on this mod, purely in my free time. I have been very busy for the last couple of years, as well as having a few hard times. But no matter what, I have fun working on this mod when I can, and I guarantee its full release, even if it takes a while. \n\nI'm so thankful for the support and continued interest from those of you who have been waiting for such a long time for me to make more progress. \ud83d\udc9a\n\nStay tuned to this channel for more updates! I hope to next show how progression works on the World Map, and to post more individual level previews.\n\nHorizon Discord: https://discord.gg/XnQJnwa\n\n- This server is geared a bit more towards documentation and information about New Super Mario Bros.
