You will meet the main character, Minna, and several other characters from The Poison. Even though the two are completely independent works, your experience of the game will have an extra dimension if you have 'been' to Cross Town before.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crosstown-2-angeln", "videos": [{"id": 33977, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "GrYIf7dDGaw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrYIf7dDGaw", "title": "CrossTown 2 - \u00c4ngeln (1999) PC \"Schwedisch/Swedish\"", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GrYIf7dDGaw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
