It was the only title developed in-house by publisher Games & Multimedia, although some of the graphic designers had worked on Twins before. Although the game gets off to a slow start (and a very slow initial walking speed for the main character), its production values and quality came as a big surprise. \n \nOf all Korean RPGs, Protocoss might be the one that most closely follows the Final Fantasy formula, with ATB combat in an enlarged quasi-sideview, numerous characters that join the party during the course of the adventure beyond the five that are active in combat at any given time, and a rather similar visual design to Square's 16-bit output.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
