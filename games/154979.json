He tries to ignore Nyanzou, but Nyanzou has a reputation for being reckless. He forces Kumakichi to come along out to sea. And as expected, Nyanzou\uff06Kumakichi get shipwrecked right after heading out. They drift ashore onto a deserted island. Help these two escape. It's your standard escape game, on the easy side, and highly recommended for beginners. It comes with autosave, hints, and memo functions."}
