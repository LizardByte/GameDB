It was played by Wild-Snail: USI (Savini#) & Bornnam: Wat, their real names are never mentioned however. With Battle Garegga arriving on the PlayStation 4 later in the year and having hit 300+ subscribers we've decided to revisit our previous video on the Saturn port. A never perfect port that really shows off the power of the Saturn, as this is a revamped video of an existing one we have edited down the loading times and crop the screen safe area to give you more picture. The final score is 1PF823440. When we original uploaded the Battle Garegga Superplay it was before Youtube carried 60fps and was captured in ugly composite at 480p and upscaled via an editor to 720p and in yoko mode. Roll on nearly two years later and we can now capture it in 1080p 60fps and in tate mode so it looks nice and shiny.\n\nThis is a full playthrough / longplay / walkthrough / trueplay / 1CC of the game or super play as the Japanese like to call these videos.\n\nTo unlock complete the game for the first time (difficulty level and number of continuations are free), \"SUPER PLAY\" will be added to the title screen. If you start on Player 1's side, you can watch a playthrough by Wild-Snail: USI (Savini#), and on Player 2's side, you can watch one by Bornnam: Wat.
