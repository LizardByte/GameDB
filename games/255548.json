The one that comes to our hero\u2019s rescue is a mysterious and beautiful cat-earred woman.\n\n\u201cMy name is Touka. I am here to protect you, Lord Makibishi, no\u2026 Lord Saiga Kikumaru.\u201d\n\nThese are the words that Touka speaks to a bewildered Kikumaru.\n\n1) There are people that exist in this country known as \u201cdemi-humans\u201d, as well as people of other origins, unbeknownst to the rest of the population\n\n2) These beings served as ninja during the Sengoku period, and still exist here and there across Japan today\n\n3) You were born into the Saiga family, who act as intermediaries between this \u201cunderworld\u201d and mainstream society.\n\n4) And so you are already involved in the struggle.
