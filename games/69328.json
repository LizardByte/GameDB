The Dark Bring were used by the Raregroove Kingdom, and the Symphonia Kingdom fought against them with their Holy Bring.\n\nShiba, the first RAVE Master, attempted to destroy Sinclaire, the \"mother\" of the Dark Bring, with his Decaforce Sword. The aftermath caused the massive explosion known as \"Overdrive\" that destroyed one-tenth of the known world. Shiba, protected from the disaster by Plue, a special guardian \"dog\" who shielded him from the blast, held onto the RAVE required to power his sword. Plue and the remaining pieces of RAVE, however, scattered around the world.\n\nFifty years later Haru Glory, a teenager living on the peaceful Garage Island, fishes Plue up by accident. Several events soon follow, including Shiba's arrival and his desire to reclaim Plue, as well as the appearance of a mysterious organization known as Demon Card, whose members possess Dark Bring and aim to rule the world. After Haru battles one of its members, Shiba discovers he is the second RAVE Master, and entrusts his RAVE, Plue, and the Decaforce Sword to Haru. Haru embarks upon an adventure to find the other pieces of Rave and to save the world.", "summary": "Released only in Japan, Groove Adventure Rave is the first action RPG game based on the Rave Master manga series written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima.\n\nThis action RPG includes a original story with a new character created by the original author Mashima-sensei, featuring the RPD system where your companions trust changes based on the aciton you make.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/groove-adventure-rave", "videos": [{"id": 120573, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ss0HRS-pmP4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss0HRS-pmP4", "title": "Rave Groove Adventure: Rave Eternal Bond (PS1) (2002) Runthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ss0HRS-pmP4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
