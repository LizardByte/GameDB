The gameplay is, by and large, identical to the original text-only version, with the exception of a few adjustments made to the monetary system and a few commands handled slightly differently. Like before, the player types text commands consisting of combinations of verbs and objects. The game recognizes both Japanese and English inputs.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/las-vegas"}
