You\u2019ll need to fend them off with an arsenal of ridiculous weaponry and good ol\u2019 fashioned teamwork to get the best ones.\n\nCarry all the letters you can back to your base and conspire with your team to spell the longest, highest-scoring words in your giant spellbook. Pull the magic lever and presto! Points earned!
