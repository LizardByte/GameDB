The player controls a convict who must bust his way out of prison and escape from the island. In order to do this the player must beat up prison guards collect/ steal/ barter various items around the prison grounds. The HUD has 8 inventory slots, an alert meter to show whether the guards are on the convicts trail, a clock to show the time of day and an energy meter. \n \nDustin involves a lot of point-and-click adventure style trial and error gameplay as the convict needs to collect various items in a certain order and then use them in the right places. One of the games difficulties was in finding out whereabouts to go around the prison since a lot of the screens where identical to each other. Dustin is a more primitive version of games like The Great Escape and is part of the legacy of prison break themed titles.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dustin", "videos": [{"id": 40530, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6x_zFu64DAE"}]}
