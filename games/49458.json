The basic rules are still the same: The player takes the role of a candidate and has to answer 15 questions by choosing the correct answer out of four given possibilities. For every right answer they receive money with the amount doubling with each correct answer. There are also the same three help options as in the televised game: 50:50 which eliminates two false answers, asking the studio 'audience' and phoning a friend, in the game the latter is a prerecorded conversion.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-junior"}
