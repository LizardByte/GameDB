The rulers of Edo have heard about a powerful Dragon God who was sealed long time ago, and whose defeat made it possible to create the country of Japan. He wants to restore this great power for his own selfish purposes. The hero of the game is a young warrior named Gento, whose companion is a feline creature named Benimaru. One day Gento arrives at a northern village and is attacked by Edo soldiers. Determined to find out the reason for this hostility, Gento and Benimaru embark on a long journey across the whole Japan.", "summary": "Appare-den: Fukuryuu no Shou plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG, with world map traveling, random enemies, and turn-based combat. The attacks in combat are animated; after the player has assigned command to all the characters, the animation shows the entire party attack at once. There are also special techniques the heroes can learn and execute in battles.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/appare-den-fukuryuu-no-shou"}
