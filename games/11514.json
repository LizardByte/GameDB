It was the first video game to depict human-to-human combat, while the Midway version was also the first video game to use a microprocessor. Following its November 1975 release in North America, it went on to sell over 8,000 arcade cabinets in the United States. It was ported to the Bally Astrocade video game console as a built-in game in 1977 as well as several home computer platforms.\n\nThe theme of the game involves two Old West cowboys armed with revolvers and squaring off in a duel. Whoever shoots the other cowboy first wins the duel. Unlike in a real-life duel, however, both cowboys get numerous opportunities to duel in order to score points (one point per successful draw).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/western-gun", "videos": [{"id": 104551, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XbnYBB42J6c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbnYBB42J6c", "title": "Western Gun (Original version of Gun Fight) (1975) - First game with violence", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XbnYBB42J6c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
