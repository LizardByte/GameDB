Seriously one of, if not the coolest Hank mod I've ever played, everything about it was absolutely incredible!! My god the entire mod's artstyle and Hank himself just look stunning, I love how unique it looks so much! I seriously can't get enough of how this mod looks. And the songs, my GOD, especially Battered! They all sound so incredible and fit in with the Madness of it all so damn well, the voice acted portions were so damn cool too, I love Hank's voice it sounds super cool! The charts were really damn fun too, not the best accuracy I've gotten, but hey at least I got through it! I seriously can't express how much I love this mod, I am incredibly hyped for the final version to come out, can't wait to see how it looks!

Four arrows fly towards the screen forcing you to press them at the right time to the music.

I also include secrets and extra content that might\u2019ve been undiscovered and show them off through instructional and entertaining ways that can be used as guides, as well as occasionally adding my own input on things happening in the video, all done through my creative editing style that focuses on being concise and transformative. In the descriptions I give my in-depth opinion on the video game as well as timestamps for each part of the video. All the videos were played, recorded and edited by me. #FridayNightFunkin #FNF #Flippy", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-L4Lla6wmtI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-L4Lla6wmtI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-L4Lla6wmtI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-L4Lla6wmtI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-L4Lla6wmtI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Friday Night Funkin' - Perfect Combo - ANTIPATHY Mod (Demo) [F*CKED]", "description": "Absolutely in love with this mod, oh my GOD.
