An updated version was also released for the Sega CD under the name of The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin.\n\nAll versions of the video game are side-scrolling platform games, whereby the player controls superhero Spider-Man to battle various supervillains (Doctor Octopus, Sandman, The Lizard, Hobgoblin, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro, and Venom) to obtain the keys needed to disarm a nuclear bomb that the Kingpin has not only framed Spider-Man for stealing but plans to detonate within twenty-four hours. In the middle of the game, Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane Watson is also kidnapped by Venom.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-amazing-spider-man-vs-the-kingpin", "videos": [{"id": 88267, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "aO_qtnmti88"}]}
