In today's update video, we'll be touching upon common questions asked by the community, reveal the Jellien enemies, and give a rough release date.\n\nAround the Clock should come out in November, probably in time for Steven Hillenburg's one-year anniversary in regards to his passing; while it stinks that we're kinda stuck making this game for a majority of the year, we're putting our heart and soul into making this passion project something to jot down in the history books for SpongeBob SquarePants fans. We hope you stick around until then, especially if you've played Dave's other games like, \"3AM at the Krusty Krab,\" or, \"3:30AM at Floater's Cemetery!\"\n\nAdditionally, feel free to refer to me as Snowmizzle Studio when referring to my involvement with the game; it's a branding thang, hahah.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you'd like to stay up-to-date with Around the Clock, feel free to also visit Dave's channel:\n\nDave Microwaves Games \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEr8Emk3781_Inm-V1q2yPQ\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid you enjoy the video?
