All versions were released exclusively in Japan, currently making it the only game in the series to never receive an international release. The enemy known as 'DOH' still did not get the message and after many years of silence decides to attack once again.\n\nThe 'Vaus' space vessel better be ready to face new, yet familiar challenges, in order to stop 'DOH' once again. The gameplay remains similar to Arkanoid: Doh it Again, the previous game in the series released for the Super Nintendo, in that it features the same powerups , some re-used level designs, and the same board size. The initial arcade game contains only 50 levels, the environment changing every 9 levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arkanoid-returns", "videos": [{"id": 89715, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Qt15-s4rN_Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt15-s4rN_Y", "title": "Arkanoid Returns (Ver 2.02O 1997/02/10) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qt15-s4rN_Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1746, "name": "Arkanoid"}]}
