It was originally developed in Japan by ASCII Entertainment, and released as Cosmo Genesis at the very end of 1986. Acclaim picked up the rights to release the game in the United States and changed the title.\n\nThe gameplay is heavily based on Atari's original Star Raiders concept. Another Famicom game built on this concept is Namco's Star Luster, which many players regard as the better quality game out of the two. Star Voyager is a first-person shooter from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The player navigates through different quadrants contained in a galactic map. Different sections of the ship can sustain damage, but this damage can be repaired by visiting a space station.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 11486, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "bIDptAvzOrk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIDptAvzOrk", "title": "Star Voyager - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bIDptAvzOrk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
