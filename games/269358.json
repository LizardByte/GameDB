Kizuna Arashi", "platforms": [8], "release_dates": [{"id": 521371, "date": 1099440000, "platform": 8, "y": 2004}], "slug": "bakufuu-slash-kizuna-arashi", "summary": "This Eye Toy game is a bit different from the rest of the pack. Included with the game is a \"nail\" controller which you place over your favorite finger and use to make commands in the game. Your goal as young Arashi is to bring peace back to the world by defeating an evil king. To do so you'll take on enemies in real time battles where you use the nail controller to trace out patterns on the screen, with more complex patterns leading to more advanced attacks. To help popularize this franchise, SCE is also releasing some non-game related products for this game. A comic will appear in Japan's popular Coro Coro Comics comic book simultaneously with the game's release. Card decks will be released for the game and will have an effect on the gameplay experience. Placing a card in front of the EyeToy will make the game read the card and will give you access to new skills.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bakufuu-slash-kizuna-arashi"}
