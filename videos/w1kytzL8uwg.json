Unite fallen heroes, morph between them and fight for your life in this tactical dungeon crawler. Chain together elemental powers or lure enemies into brutal traps and turn the dungeon against them.\n\nCharge into undead hordes as the lightning fast Rabbit, morph into the monstrous Ogre to crush them with a Rock Fall and burn whatever remains with the Nymph\u2019s Inferno! In MetaMorph planning your attack and morphing between heroes is just as important as skilled hacking and slashing. Collect and upgrade the spirits of fallen heroes as you descend ever deeper into the dungeon that claimed them.\n\nCustomise your team of heroes for each encounter and transform between them to survive! Freeze poisonous creatures in their tracks, melt ice elementals or simply cleave your enemies in two with a well-timed Sword Flurry. Experiment with new morphs and powers as you conquer a series of increasingly challenging lairs and reclaim your dungeon from the demonic Butcher.\n\nLike - http://bit.ly/FFfbook\nFollow - http://bit.ly/ffstwitter\nSubscribe - http://bit.ly/fftubesub", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1kytzL8uwg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1kytzL8uwg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1kytzL8uwg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1kytzL8uwg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1kytzL8uwg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "MetaMorph: Dungeon Creatures - Early Access Trailer", "description": "Get Early Access - http://bit.ly/mmdungeon\n\nTransform your fate!
