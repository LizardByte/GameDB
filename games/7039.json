However, players must also keep a close eye on Gretchen as her mortality is the key to the duo's survival as Heinrich can never be vanquished. It's time to let the combos fly and lay waste to the hordes of darkness with a liberal dose of medieval panache.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knights-contract", "videos": [{"id": 10578, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yQZW31wV3kY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQZW31wV3kY", "title": "Knights Contract - PS3 / X360 - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yQZW31wV3kY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
