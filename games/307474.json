They can also earn the BRIL token while mining, which can be reused in game to make mining more efficient, or exported and traded on marketplaces.\n\nOther actions include searching for mines, upgrading your pickaxe and mines, and viewing the gemstones you've mined in a high-quality inspection experience.\n\nUp to 6 players can play in the same mine.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brilliantcrypto", "videos": [{"id": 118113, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "twZO7IcW-H0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twZO7IcW-H0", "title": "Reveal Trailer | The Birth of Digital Gemstones", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/twZO7IcW-H0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118114, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "7dwkyAZ2ozU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dwkyAZ2ozU", "title": "Paris Saint-Germain Players Livestream Brilliantcrypto", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7dwkyAZ2ozU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118115, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-q4A8q9cXIM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q4A8q9cXIM", "title": "Brilliantcrypto Mining Tutorial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-q4A8q9cXIM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
