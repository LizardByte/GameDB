First announced as Conker's Quest at E3 1997, the game would have followed the all ages environment of Conker's Pocket Tales, a handheld title released during its prolonged development cycle.\n\nBefore the game could be finished, Rare had already made similar games that had already achieved general acclaim, most notably Banjo-Kazooie and Diddy Kong Racing. The developers began to receive criticism for creating another innocent platformer starring cute and friendly animals. In 1999, Rareware revealed that they were going to entirely redesign the game to appeal to an older audience.\n\nWhile it was first believed to be an April Fool's joke, the game went unreleased and replaced with Conker's Bad Fur Day in 2001.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twelve-tales-conker-64", "videos": [{"id": 44735, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "dDnvVbdEs7c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDnvVbdEs7c", "title": "Rare Revealed: A Rare Look at Twelve Tales: Conker 64", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dDnvVbdEs7c/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44736, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "M6ceNFV2yz4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ceNFV2yz4", "title": "30 Minutes of Twelve Tales Conker 64 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M6ceNFV2yz4/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44737, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bEuFNl4s9yI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEuFNl4s9yI", "title": "Conker's Quest Beta Gameplay [BFD Prototype - UNRELASED!]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEuFNl4s9yI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44738, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KtZj28ItBuI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtZj28ItBuI", "title": "Conker Twelve Tales - Beta Movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KtZj28ItBuI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
