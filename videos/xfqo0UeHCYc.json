The President's son, Tyler, has gone missing, and Delta Squad, sent to investigate, has fallen silent. As Mike, you'll navigate the treacherous terrain of Ko'Verest Island, piecing together clues and facing unknown dangers to unravel the mystery.\n\nUpgraded Combat System\n\nWe're excited to showcase the current state of our combat system in this trailer. Our team has made significant improvements since our last preview two years ago, ensuring that what you see now accurately represents the gameplay experience you'll have in Creatures of War.\n\nImmersive Soundtrack\n\nThe narrative trailer features an upgraded soundtrack by our talented music composer. The gripping score enhances the tension and excitement of the story, making the trailer a must-watch experience that you'll want to revisit multiple times.\n\nDemo Improvements\n\nAlong with the new trailer, we've made numerous minor upgrades to the demo. This latest version on Steam should be the smoothest and most polished rendition to date, giving you a taste of what to expect in the full game.\n\nRelease Preparation\n\nOur team is working tirelessly to finalize the remaining levels and prepare for a strong marketing push. We're also focusing on balance and polish to ensure Creatures of War launches in top form on October 23rd.\n\nThank you for your continued support and enthusiasm. We can't wait for you to experience the full game next month!\n\nCheers,\nTim\nLead Developer\nCreatures of War", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfqo0UeHCYc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfqo0UeHCYc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfqo0UeHCYc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfqo0UeHCYc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfqo0UeHCYc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Creatures Of War Narrative Trailer", "description": "Greetings, Creatures of War community!\n\nWe're thrilled to present our brand-new narrative trailer for Creatures of War, showcasing the intense and mysterious story that awaits you on Ko'Verest Island.\n\nCompelling Narrative\n\nIn this thrilling adventure, you'll step into the shoes of combat operative Mike Ludwig, the last hope for uncovering the truth behind a series of disappearances.
