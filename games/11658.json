Players navigate around the open world using the Nintendo 3DS' touchscreen to find and befriend various Yo-kai, which are scattered across the overworld. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. A new feature in battles is using the touch screen to find a particular sweetspot on an enemy Yo-kai to increase the likelihood of befriending it at the end of the battle, or other sweetspots for extra damage, extra money, or extra experience. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Crank-a-kai (Gasha Machine) by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game's main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended. When the player encounters a Yo-kai, he enters into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player's Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai's Soultimate abilities. While the original Yo-kai Watch featured nearly 250 Yo-kai, Yo-Kai Watch 2 features nearly 450, including several that were featured as bosses in the original game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yo-kai-watch-2-bony-spirits", "videos": [{"id": 5043, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yzsQVuGjUaA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzsQVuGjUaA", "title": "Youkai Watch 2 - Nintendo 3DS Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yzsQVuGjUaA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 120756, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DXId6SHL2CY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXId6SHL2CY", "title": "YO-KAI WATCH 2 - Official Game Trailer - Nintendo E3 2016", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DXId6SHL2CY/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1558, "name": "Yo-Kai Watch"}]}
