Quasi must complete a number of static screens, each presenting the player with different obstacles, to reach Esmerelda. These range from spear-toting guards, to fire chasms to missiles (fireballs or arrows) that must be jumped. Some of the trickier screens can contain more than one of these obstacles, such as spear-toting guards AND missles. One final problem that appears on every screen is the time limit. This takes the form of an enemy guard climbing the castle walls, if the soldier reaches the top, he will try to burn the Hunchback with his torch. If the Hunchback rings the bell before the guard has scaled the wall, a bonus score is rewarded.\n\nNote: No Cheats used.
