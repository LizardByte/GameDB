It was being developed by the now-closed video game studio Victory Games for Microsoft Windows.The game was set to use the Frostbite 3 engine and would have introduced downloadable content to the series.\n\nIt was supposed to be the first game in the series to be developed by Victory Games, making them the series' third developer after Westwood Studios and EA Los Angeles. Command & Conquer would have been available exclusively on Electronic Arts' Origin distribution service.\n\nThe game was originally announced as Command & Conquer: Generals 2, a direct sequel to 2003's Command & Conquer: Generals. It was then re-purposed in August 2012 as what would have been the first in a series of free-to-play games set in the Command & Conquer universe. The skirmish multiplayer platform was slated for release for free around Christmas 2013, with 'pay per play' campaign missions releasing by Q1 2014.\n\nHowever, on October 29, 2013, EA ceased development of Command & Conquer and shut down Victory Games, citing negative feedback over the economy-based experience as a reason", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/command-conquer--2", "videos": [{"id": 1717, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "q3CXrvuBHAU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3CXrvuBHAU", "title": "Command & Conquer Alpha Gameplay 2 Full Matches", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q3CXrvuBHAU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 123262, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "gNm1cZj4vio", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNm1cZj4vio", "title": "C&C Generals 2 -- In-Game Footage Sneak Peek", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gNm1cZj4vio/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 123263, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "kjZEInQZA0c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjZEInQZA0c", "title": "Command & Conquer\u2122 Gamescom 2012 Announce Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kjZEInQZA0c/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 123264, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "e1OxnBHiddY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1OxnBHiddY", "title": "Command & Conquer\u2122 Beyond the Battle: Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e1OxnBHiddY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 123265, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "_5EhIrqG4ZI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5EhIrqG4ZI", "title": "Command & Conquer\u2122 Beyond the Battle: Part 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_5EhIrqG4ZI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 123266, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "80_x6bmzluc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80_x6bmzluc", "title": "Command & Conquer\u2122 - E3 2013 Official Trailer - \"Welcome Back, General\"", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/80_x6bmzluc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 123267, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7dLWafeCbac", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dLWafeCbac", "title": "Command\u00a0& Conquer\u2122 -- Campaign Missions Reveal -- Gamescom 2013 Official", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7dLWafeCbac/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
