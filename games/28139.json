Fighters from across the world gather at the Tokyo Dome to compete in the World Grapple Tournament.

Finally, they have the chance to prove which martial art conquers all!", "summary": "Buriki One is a 3D arcade versus fighting game. It is an offshoot of the Art of Fighting series of video games created by SNK. In the brief time-frame of the Hyper Neo-Geo 64's popularity, it was characterized for its superb graphics that processed at a smooth 60 frames per second and a unique fighting system. So far, it has only been released in one iteration, with no sequels, although the main character Gai Tendo has appeared in later SNK games, via cameos or as a playable character (in the recent KOF XI).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 38552, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "2SRgEHnZgpc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SRgEHnZgpc", "title": "Buriki One World Grapple Tournament '99 in Tokyo Opening", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2SRgEHnZgpc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
