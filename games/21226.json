Kudos is the original inspiration for the game SimSocial by EA (also known as the myspace sims game). Kudos is a turn-based game that puts you in control of a single character and manages their life from age 20 to 30. You get to pick their friends, their job, and how they spend their free time, but there is a catch! You can only choose to do one thing each day, or two at the weekends. This makes Kudos 2 a game of agonizing choices. Do you turn down an invitation from a friend because you are too tired from work? Do you put more time into your friends or your career? When do you find time to look for a better job, or to spend time with your pet?\t \n \nKudos 2 is unlike any strategy or casual game you have played before. The game has a totally original style, and uses artwork by legendary comic artist Jamie McKelvie. Every game of Kudos is unique. Did you become a high-flying corporate lawyer who cruises to the office each morning in a luxury car, but has no social life, or do you become a popular, trendy and much loved guitar-player, who works as a waitress to pay the bills? Will you have the money to splash out on a burglar alarm, or rely on your martial arts (or your faithful pet dog) to protect you from crime?"}
