It has been thought to be the earliest LGBT-themed video game, but was preceded by 1989's Caper in the Castro. In the 2020 Netflix documentary, High Score, Ryan Best claimed that the game was lost as he misplaced the masters to the game. The game was later found with the help of the LGBTQ Video Game Archive. \n \nThe player has to fight hordes of enemies including rednecks and homophobes. The final boss of the game is conservative commentator and politician Pat Buchanan.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
