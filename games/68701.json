Like other Unreal-based games, it is oriented around competitive arena-based play, via teamplay, old-style deathmatch, and other match types, and can be played either multiplayer or single-player with bots. Single-player play features tournament modes with progression and scores. It can be played in matches of up to 16 players via LAN or Internet.\n\nThe game was acclaimed for its excellent execution, capturing the enjoyment of the game on which it is based, but mildly criticized for the fact that those opposed to violence in video games would not be satisfied by \"nerfing\" the violence, so to speak, while it would also lose some appeal to those who are turned off by the lack of explicit violence and its more child-friendly approach.\n\nAs of 2024, there is still a community of players who continue to play the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nerf-arena-blast", "videos": [{"id": 25248, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "nmHdOAFwiug", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmHdOAFwiug", "title": "Nerf Arena Blast 1999 PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nmHdOAFwiug/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
