Fearing for his sovereignty, contacts a secret corporation for the development of biological weapons of mass destruction, with name - Zero Experimental Establishment or ZEE. The project is allocated funds and a place of development - a remote corner of the country - the Montib island, cut off from the world, with a small population and no modern infrastructure.\n\nThe deafening success of experiments is comparable only with the fundamental failure of the all development. The next monthly report says about the fall of a helicopter with samples of biological weapons on the island. And a week later, after reports of the observation - of infection of local residents, communication with the employees of the corporation, and indeed with anyone in general, disappears. The government makes a decision in secret from the world community and, despite the protests of the residents of the country who have relatives there, cut off the entire Montib island from the external world, and under pressure forces ZEE to investigate what happened.\n\nDespite the military patrolling the sea around the island and the likelihood of dying from the virus, the flow of people trying to get there is not running out. Someone wants to find relatives and friends, help residents, and someone wants to take possession of the abandoned property of a corporation or just have fun in a place where the laws no longer work.\nWhy are you there - you decide.", "summary": "A secret organization makes a critical mistake in the development of chemical weapons.
