It began in 2009 as an animated proof-of-concept. This got a surprising amount of positive response, and because of this a couple of us got together with the goal of making a playable game out of it. \n \nThere are mainly two things that set Mega Man 2.5D apart from most other Mega Man games. The first is the co-op mode, where two players team up to take on Dr. Wily. The other is the use of camera perspective changes which is featured a lot in the single-player mode of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 37009, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "hnVrDHHPnPM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnVrDHHPnPM", "title": "Mega Man 2.5D - Release trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hnVrDHHPnPM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
