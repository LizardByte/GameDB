Slide and rotate cubes in this gravity-defying world to find the correct path for Princess Angelica and her friends. Flip the world and you may just discover that the journey matters far more than the destination \u2013 and that stereotypes are not to be trusted.\n\nInspired by \u201cOrlando Furioso,\u201d the 16th-century Italian epic poem by Ludovico Ariosto, the constantly shifting physical world of Roterra reflects the many conflicting points-of-view in the poem. The constant changes in perspective are not only a core feature of the gameplay but the of the narrative itself, prompting players to see female agency and power in a whole new light.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/roterra-flip-the-fairytale", "videos": [{"id": 24483, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_GTTxAsMK7g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTTxAsMK7g", "title": "Roterra Preview Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_GTTxAsMK7g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
