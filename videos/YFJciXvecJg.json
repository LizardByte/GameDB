{"id": "YFJciXvecJg", "snippet": {"title": "Dying Light - Hellraid DLC Launch Trailer", "description": "Dying Light \u2013 Hellraid opens the portal to Hell in Harran!\n\nDying Light \u2013 Hellraid is now available on Steam and will launch on Xbox One and PS4\u2122 tomorrow (August 14th) at 19:00 CEST.\n\nAfter months of intense work by our team dedicated to updating and expanding Dying Light, we are ready to invite you into Ba\u2019al\u2019s Tower \u2013 an otherworldly stronghold infested with servants of Hell. Based on our currently-on-hold first-person slasher Hellraid, the latest paid DLC introduces an entirely new game mode that you can access through a possessed arcade machine located in the Tower in Harran.\n\nDying Light \u2013 Hellraid is much more than just a new map. We wanted to really shake things up by fleshing out the dark fantasy vibe of the setting, so we ditched zombies in favor of brand-new enemies. Those weapons you got used to in Harran had to go to, but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get yourselves some new ones in Ba\u2019al\u2019s Tower\u2019s torch-lit corridors and chambers. The DLC comes with its own progression system and as you improve your Hellraid rank, you\u2019ll gain access to new swords, axes, and hammers. Good news is that you can also wield these completely new weapons outside of the hellish realm, as long as you pay for them with coins awarded for making runs through the dungeon. Of course, you can enjoy a co-op mode for up to 4 players.\n\nThere\u2019s one more thing we need to share with you, and it\u2019s an important one. Dying Light \u2013 Hellraid will be expanded with free content, including new ranks, weapons, collectible notes enriching the lore, and a bounty system. Expect the first update by the end of September.\n\nFollow us: \nWeb: https://bit.ly/DLHellraid_YT\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dyinglightgame\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/dyinglightgame\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dyinglightgame\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/dyinglight\nVK: https://vk.com/dyinglightgame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFJciXvecJg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFJciXvecJg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFJciXvecJg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFJciXvecJg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFJciXvecJg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dying Light - Hellraid DLC Launch Trailer", "description": "Dying Light \u2013 Hellraid opens the portal to Hell in Harran!\n\nDying Light \u2013 Hellraid is now available on Steam and will launch on Xbox One and PS4\u2122 tomorrow (August 14th) at 19:00 CEST.\n\nAfter months of intense work by our team dedicated to updating and expanding Dying Light, we are ready to invite you into Ba\u2019al\u2019s Tower \u2013 an otherworldly stronghold infested with servants of Hell.
