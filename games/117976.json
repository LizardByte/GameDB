You face a series of fantastic computer-generated puzzles - 50 of them. Your goal? Knock similar balls together and make them disappear.\n\nSound simple? It's not. Each puzzle is different and requires a different strategy. Hit the wrong balls together and they multiply. If you don't clear the screen in time, the whole thing explodes.\n\nWhatever you've done before, forget it. Harmony's a whole new ball game. Beat this baby and you can call yourself good. Until then, you're just a pretender.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-game-of-harmony"}
