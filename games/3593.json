The game also features a two-player mode and rumble pack support. Hidden shortcuts and jumps add to the replay value of the game.\nCities used are New York (Uptown and Downtown), Hawaii, Las Vegas, San Francisco (Alcatraz), Los Angeles, and Seattle. Other tracks playable at the start of the game are Stunt, Crash, and Halfpipe. A bonus track can be won where your car is miniaturized and you drive through the offices of Midway Games. Another bonus is the full pipe level, as the last achievement to unlock.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rush-2-extreme-racing-usa", "collections": [{"id": 612, "name": "Rush"}]}
