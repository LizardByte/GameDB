And at NSRT, things happen fast.\n\nStanding in the control room, you watch an anxiously-awaited satellite transmission just coming in from the Amazon field team - the team you've been hired to help. As you watch the transmission, you realize that something is terribly wrong. No ordinary person could bear to watch what you see on the screen before you: the whole expedition team seems to be wiped out right before your eyes. Bodies lie strewn all over the camp. Then the conncetion breaks off.\n\nIn light of the latest events, your mission goals have been altered: You are to meet Dr. Basil Hykem to get some vital information about the expedition and to journey to the expedition's camp in the Amazon yourself.\n\nWhile you just hope to find any survivors at all, for the NSRT there is much more at stake. It is rumored that in the long lost ruins close by to the camp some rare diamonds can be found which are vital for research in the national defense programme.", "summary": "The NSRT (National Satellite Resource Technology) has sent a team to the Amazon rainforest but there has been no communications with the team for some time.
