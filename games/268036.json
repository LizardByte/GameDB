A TV anime based on the series was later produced, titled Sentimental Journey. Sentimental Journey is a collection of twelve short stories about twelve different girls. Though unrelated, there is one common theme that binds the episodes together: each girl's bittersweet experience of first love.\n\nIn this Playstation game the player can choose a girl (or 4 of them if there are 4 players to play) and let her find the love during a board game. There are different boys to meet and different mini games and special blocs to make the game more interesting.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sentimental-journey"}
