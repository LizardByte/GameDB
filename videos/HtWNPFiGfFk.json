I eventually got lost in the mazes\u2026 probably needed to map them out, but didn't ever want to  - just wanted to run & shoot.  Difficulty ramps up, too, making it hard to win.  So, I decided it was time to revisit the game for the good ol' Commodore 64 and BEAT IT.  \n\n I have to report the Atari 8-bit IS probably the definitive edition\u2026 however, its still really fun to try other ports.  C64 is a good one.\n\nC64 - This was the version I discovered as a teen.  Excellent sounds, great gameplay.  A little more \"gridlike\" than the Atari 8-bit\u2026 so felt a little harder overall.  For the ending -- it did add a longer scrolling text message.  \"Congratulations you won\" and then a long text scroll written by a teenager or something.  It was strange, but at least they added something new to the end.  \n\nUnfortunately, even in the highest difficulty (expert) it's the same silly ending.
