It has seen cities come and go over the centuries as the unstoppable forces of both nature and economy have shaped the land and its people. For the most part its inhabitants have lived together in peace, and lively trade both by land and by sea has kept even its most remote communities from growing too distant.\n\nRecently a darkness has invaded the land. An evil being known only as \u201cFaxon\u201d or \u201cThe Faxon\u201d with skills in necromancy has decided to conquer Miskatonia. Together with the help of some daemons and local warlocks of an evil disposition, Faxon has been training sorcerers to be necromancers, raising the dead to attack the living, and driving orcs, goblins, trolls, and even more horrible creatures out into the countryside to pray on the peaceful population of Miskatonia.\n\nMiskatonia is in need of a hero to cure it of this blight. Can you be that hero?", "summary": "The Land of Miskatonia needs a hero to save it from the evil Faxon and its minions. Can you be that hero? Explore Miskatonia and its settlements, talk to its residents, build up your skills, and finally challenge Faxon in its secret lair.\n\nMinima is an adventure RPG in the style of the older Ultima games (Ultima I, Ultima II, Ultima III, Ultima IV, & Ultima V) as played on the Commodore 64 and 128 computers. Just like the original Ultima games, it includes a world view, enterable towns, and 3D dungeon displays. It also features graphics, sound effects, and music that should help one recollect those classics. More importantly, it is a fully playable (and winnable) game with its own backstory, plot, setting, and characters.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 74008, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "N1SRAAX7EbE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1SRAAX7EbE", "title": "Starting a game of Minima", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1SRAAX7EbE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
