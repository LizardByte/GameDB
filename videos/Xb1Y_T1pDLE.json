Power ups are collected at various intervals to upgrade your weapon.  The gas a lot of slowdowns when there are a lot of enemies on screen and also when you fire a lot of bullets.  Together with the  control method makes the game quite difficult.  Sometimes its simpler to spin and fire randomly and hope for the best.  The game goes on for 25 levels and then I show the game over screen. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xb1Y_T1pDLE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xb1Y_T1pDLE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xb1Y_T1pDLE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Master System Longplay [217] Galactic Protector", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nGalactic Protector was another Japanese only release in 1988 for the Master System and uses the paddle controller.\n\nThe game is simply to defend the planets from asteroid and enemy attacks by rotating round the planet and shooting anything that approaches.
