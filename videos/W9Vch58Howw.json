Players of the original game will feel right at home on this relentless voyage, even with the addition of new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a chest-thumping new soundtrack.\n\nWhile the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr the Viking 2 also (mercifully, begrudgingly) offers modern quality-of-life options such as checkpoints, save states, and an undead mode. You decide how punishing your quest should be \u2013 but now anyone can be a viking!\n\nWith new and larger worlds inspired by Norse mythology, multiple endings, and a variety of ruthless bosses to conquer, Volgarr the Viking 2 expands and improves on the original in every way.
