Green Day: Rock Band features virtual depictions of the three band members performing the songs in new venues designed for the game. The game incorporates existing Green Day songs already released for the Rock Band series as downloadable content, and allows players to export its full tracklist to the other Rock Band game titles except The Beatles: Rock Band.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/green-day-rock-band", "videos": [{"id": 33205, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uYFx6f9LP_U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYFx6f9LP_U", "title": "Green Day - Rock Band trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uYFx6f9LP_U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
