Its goal is not only to recreate the assets, looks and atmosphere of the original game on the more advanced engine, but also to extend on the concepts of the original while remaining true to the spirit of what made Carnivores great. The mod adds new terrain to Carnivores' original maps, entirely new areas never seen before and new huntable and ambient animals to the roster to supplement the old classics.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/carnivores-plus", "videos": [{"id": 71586, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "gSoS2d4v-TU"}]}
