Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\n\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city\u2019s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\n\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.", "summary": "Complete your tactical RPG Shadowrun collection from developer Harebrained Schemes with this definitive bundle which contains: Shadowrun Returns + Deluxe upgrade (includes Anthology pdf + Official Soundtrack), Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong + Deluxe upgrade (includes Art Book pdf + Official Soundtrack).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadowrun-trilogy", "videos": [{"id": 55077, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wvCMtU0vU3o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvCMtU0vU3o", "title": "Shadowrun Trilogy Collection Trailer | Nintendo Direct", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wvCMtU0vU3o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 66910, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "IinkPsj5taA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IinkPsj5taA", "title": "Shadowrun Trilogy: Console Edition - Announcement trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IinkPsj5taA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
