You are the last cactus on Earth.\n\nYou live in the scorching deserts of the Rocky Mountains in what used to be Alberta, Canada. The heat is nearly unbearable and wildfires are common. The rest of your fellow cacti have moved to a more temperate climate ... on Mars. They have sent a final spaceship to transport you there.\n\nReaching it won\u2019t be easy. Water has become Earth\u2019s most precious resource, and although you are a cactus, you need every drop. You\u2019ll collect the water as you move through the canyons on your way to rendezvous with your rocket. Every so often, you\u2019ll even find a bucket of water, and you\u2019ll be able rest for the night.\n\nBut watch out for the humans. The few that remain after World War XII think they need the water even more than you. And they\u2019ll do anything to protect it.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-cactus-canyon", "videos": [{"id": 109434, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "f7vxTjqySwI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7vxTjqySwI", "title": "Space Cactus Canyon - Atari 2600 Homebrew", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f7vxTjqySwI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
