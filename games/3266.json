It is the only Grand Theft Auto game to not be developed by a Rockstar studio (formerly DMA Design).\nThe game is played from a top-down perspective; this view angle was seen on the first two games in the series, Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2, but vehicle-based side-missions (such as \"Vigilante\" and \"Paramedic\"), the heads-up display and a large majority of the weapons, first introduced in the three-dimensional counterparts, have also been included. Unlike previous top-down Grand Theft Auto games, vehicles can now flip over. It is the first game from the Grand Theft Auto series which got a 16+ rating from PEGI and an M rating (recommended for mature audiences though any age is still allowed access) from the Australian Classification Board. The game was released on the same day as the North American release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grand-theft-auto-advance", "videos": [{"id": 1808, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EMfSxxZidF4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMfSxxZidF4", "title": "Grand Theft Auto: Advance - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EMfSxxZidF4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 120113, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pt0yR7Y51Y8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt0yR7Y51Y8", "title": "GTA Advance - Full Game Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pt0yR7Y51Y8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
