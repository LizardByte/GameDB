It plays a bit differently than most Yume Nikki Fangames, in that the Nexus can be entered straight away by exiting the bedroom. The player can save anywhere from the menu or by using the desk in the main character's bedroom. The player can progress through the game by collecting effects and exploring new areas. Additionally, there are a couple of readable books on the bookshelf in the bedroom.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sick-mind"}
