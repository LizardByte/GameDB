Each level is set underwater. The player is given a cannon which can be used to fire a ball with varying force. Once a ball is launched, the player can control it to a limited degree with the left and right arrow keys. The player can launch another if a ball is destroyed or offscreen.\n\nThe levels contain obstacles and elements such as fans which block the way, sharp fans which destroy the ball, bubble jets which propel the ball in a specific direction, and others. Solving the level often involves carefully hitting switches to deactivate inconvenient obstacles. There are several different types of balls, in addition to the basic one: the metal ball is heavy and hard to control, but it can shatter glass barriers; the seltzer ball slowly dissolves in water and thus has a limited lifetime, but it can fit in tight spaces and avoid obstacles when shrunk, and it can be made to float upwards at any time. There is also a helicopter ball, which can move freely in any direction but cannot exit the level.\n\nThe game includes a built-in level editor and some unlockable bonus content.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/liquisity"}
