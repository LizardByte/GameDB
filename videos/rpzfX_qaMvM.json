When the virus hit, The Division, a unit of civilian sleeper agents, was activated as the last line of defense. Since then, Division agents have been fighting relentlessly to save what remains.\n\nFor The Division, the stakes are higher than ever. Washington, D.C. \u2013 the most heavily protected city on earth \u2013 is at risk, leaving the entire nation on the brink of collapse. If Washington, D.C., is lost, then the nation falls. As a Division agent who has been in the field for seven months, you and your team are the last hope to stop the fall of society after the pandemic collapse.\n\nA TRANSFORMED WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nIn the wake of the virus, storms, flooding, and subsequent chaos have radically transformed Washington, D.C. Explore a living open world full of diverse environments, from flooded urban areas to historic sites and landmarks, during one of the hottest summers in history. The streets have been overrun with enemy factions, each with its own agenda and each vying for control of DC. It will be up to you to liberate the city and protect what remains of society.\n\nBEST-IN-CLASS ENDGAME EXPERIENCE\n\nTom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2 was built with an \u201cendgame-first\u201d mentality, ensuring players always have access to fresh, unique, and diverse activities long after completing the main campaign. Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2\u2019s endgame will introduce brand new challenges and progression systems, unique twists and surprises, and for the first time, raids. Players will also be able to access a wealth of post-launch content, including a full year of free additional story-driven missions, map expansions, and gameplay modes.\n\nREVAMPED PLAYER PROGRESSION AND NEW SPECIALIZATIONS\n\nAfter completing the main campaign, gain access to new specializations such as demolitionist, sharpshooter, and survivalist. Each specialization will open up an entire new progression system with new skills, mods, and unique talents to acquire and maximize your agent efficiency in your chosen role.\n\nDYNAMIC LIVING WORLD\n\nCivilians and enemy factions are constantly striving to survive, vying for necessities such as food, medicine, and ammunition. As the factions face off against each other in a ravaged DC, they will fight to seize control of resources and locations \u2013 and for their very survival. The various needs and motivations from each faction will collide, triggering different encounters between enemy and friendly factions, civilians, and ultimately you as an Agent, creating a dynamic living world full of surprises.\n\nUNITE THE CIVILIANS\n\nCivilians have banded together in settlements to rebuild their society, but their very existence is threatened. Work closely with them to keep them safe and in turn, they will come to your aid and provide supplies and assistance to build up your base of operations, giving a deeper meaning to the people and the world around you.\n\nAbout Ubisoft   \nUbisoft is a leading creator, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment and services, with a rich portfolio of world-renowned brands, including Assassin\u2019s Creed, Far Cry, For Honor, Just Dance, Watch Dogs, Tom Clancy\u2019s video game series including Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six and The Division.
