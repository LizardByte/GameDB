While most dolls are given a random point value, dolls of legendary Pok\u00e9mon have a fixed value of 50 points. Upon revealing three dolls, the game ends, and the player will be given their score and will receive a random item or set of items that can be sent back to the player's 3DS Pok\u00e9mon RPG."}
