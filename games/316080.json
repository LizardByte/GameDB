He accomplished this task, however, unknown to him, one monster escaped before the cave was sealed. Years passed, and that one monster eventually grew strong enough to break the power of the warrior's magic seal. That monster, who became known as Chaostikhan, unleashed the monsters within the cave on the world once again.\n\nDuring this same period of time, Bubby and Bobby, our heroes, had won the admiration of the villagers of Rainbow Islands by defeating the enemies terrorizing their planet, allowing peace to settle in. To show their appreciation, the inhabitants of the Island entrusted one Magic Parasol each to Bubby and Bobby. In the months that followed, Bub and Bob were so intent on learning to harness the power of the Magic Parasols that they did not notice the menacing presence that was overtaking the neighboring planets. One day, they received an emergency distress signal from one of those nearby planets. Though they had not quite mastered the techniques for using the Magic Parasols, they courageously raised their parasols toward the planet in distress and disappeared into the skies above Rainbow Island, unaware of the danger and size of their new quest.\n\nThe Story So Far\nAfter rescuing the inhabitants of Rainbow Islands in their last hair-raising adventure, Bub and Bob are enjoying a well earned vacation. However, their peace is shattered when the warmongering warrior Chaostikhan unleashes a magma of menacing monsters throughout the universe.\n\nWith their magic parasols in hand (gifts from the grateful Rainbow Islanders) Bub and Bob must defeat the monsters and free the universe.", "summary": "A Port of \"Parasol Stars: Rainbow Islands II\" (also known as Bubble Bobble 3) was published by Ocean for the Game Boy in 1992.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/parasol-stars-rainbow-islands-ii--1", "videos": [{"id": 125647, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "adyX92ZxYSY"}]}
