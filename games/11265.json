Can he hold the Chosen together long enough to reclaim the Cabal and the heart of his one true love? Or will his actions destroy them all?\n\nBlood started it all with its blend of terrifying monsters, powerful weapons, fast-paced multiplayer action, and enough macabre humor to get a mummy cackling.
