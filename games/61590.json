You compete for these zones against others in order to play the game. \n \nBy walking/running/biking to a zone and standing within its boundaries for a short while, you will TAKE the zone from the previous owner and claim ownership. This action will turn the zone green and provide you with income in the form of points. \n \nOn the in-game map you are not only able to see zones and zone details. You can also watch your competitors move around LIVE, making a strategy possible. You can choose to be INVISIBLE, but while taking a zone you must be visible to others.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
