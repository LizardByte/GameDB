Create rudimentary crafting items from blueprints and build dozens and dozens of different workerbots to make your new planet a fully functioning home. Teach AI helpers their duties by showing them what you\u2019d like them to do step-by-step, be it cooking, farming, mining or construction, and then Autonaut\u2019s variety of different helper bots will carry out their duties until they are complete or you can loop activities indefinitely.\n\nAutonauts combines the very best of agriculture, simulation, crafting, building, production-line and resource management titles to create a brand new experience unlike any other.
