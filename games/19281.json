After being abandoned for very long, it seems like the farm finally has new owners - and with a child on the way, no less! Nisse is not the only one who notices this, however. When he leaves to explore the farm, he encounters a forest troll who tells him that she intends to steal the human baby as soon as is it is born. It is up to Nisse to gather enough strength to stop her - or ask the Skogsr\u00e5, the Guardian of the forest, for help.", "summary": "In this cozy little point-and-click fairy-tale, you are a gnome on an abandoned farm. When you realize that humans have come to live there once more, you find yourself useful again - but also that you might have to work harder than ever to keep them safe from the dark creatures that lurk out in the forest. You might even have to call on some of the fair folks for help. Their aid, however, does not come without a price...\n\nThe game draws heavily from Swedish folk lore, with art inspired by artists such as John Bauer and Alvaro Tapia. It uses puzzles and riddles to tell its story, and there are several different ends to it. The player will also get to experience unique music and compelling voice over, as well as discover part of Sweden's history, since the game takes place in the 19th century - a time where over a million people left the country to avoid starvation and build a new life for themselves.\n\nThis game was created by one person, Anna Jenelius, over 6 months - plus composer Douglas Holmquist who made the wonderful music. It fits anyone who would like to experience an atmospheric and cozy fairy-tale, that might remind you of the stories you heard as a child.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/midvinter", "videos": [{"id": 8143, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "17kJ7_9ja8o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17kJ7_9ja8o", "title": "Midvinter Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/17kJ7_9ja8o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 8166, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7UGKQOgZzR8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UGKQOgZzR8", "title": "Midvinter Release Date Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7UGKQOgZzR8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
