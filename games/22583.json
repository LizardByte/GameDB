Like previous installments in the series, the game is an arcade-style racer and focuses on wild, high-speed racing, rather than realistic physics and driving. The name is derived from a partnership between Rockstar and DUB Magazine, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles as prizes. \n \nPlayers race through open world recreations of San Diego, Atlanta, and Detroit listening to 98 licensed music tracks that include hip-hop, rock, and more.[citation needed] The game features a number of graphical views after the player crashes into certain objects, or travels across particular stretches of road. There is also the ability to customize a player's vehicle. Other than modifying the external looks, the vehicle's performance can also be improved (with the exception of all 'A' Class vehicles except motorcycles).", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/midnight-club-3-dub-edition-remix"}
