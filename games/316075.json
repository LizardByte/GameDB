It took him 2 months to build. Although some people found the level too dark he did not change the lighting values nor the ambient settings. The level recieved very good ratings and reached the number 5 position in the top 10 chart at that time on the famous review site of Michael Prager. It has now vanished into the hall of fame on December 2002 and has become a classic title in the tomb raider custom levelworld.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/catacomb-towers"}
