It was later ported to several other systems and was included in the Windows 3.1 bundle Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4 (1992), and the Windows version of the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack (1995), where it found a much larger audience.\n\nThe original game was designed by developer Chuck Sommerville, who also made about a third of the levels. Most of the conversions from the Atari Lynx original to other formats were carried out by Images Software in the UK.\n\nThe game was re-released on Steam on May 28, 2015, along with a sequel, Chip's Challenge 2, which was also designed by Sommerville.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chips-challenge--1", "videos": [{"id": 52397, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Qw4EFHGemfQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw4EFHGemfQ", "title": "Atari Lynx Longplay - Chip's Challenge (OLD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qw4EFHGemfQ/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3892, "name": "Chip's Challenge"}]}
