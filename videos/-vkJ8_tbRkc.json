I didn't lose any rounds and got the best ending. \n\nSFA2 for the SNES was a pretty incredible feat back in the day. I remember quite well drooling over PlayStations (that were still pretty new and expensive - at least, they were if you were only 13 in 1995), especially for this game. I'd played it endlessly at the arcade, and was disappointed when it was only announced for the 32-bit systems. Not long before I got my first PS1 this game out, and it was awesome. The graphics were close enough, and all the moves were there - the only things that stuck out to me were the oddly placed load time right AFTER the announcer says \"Fight!\" (so you have no real exact warning of when you can start), and the music was awful. I remember very well in 1996 recoiling from what this sounded like the first time I played. I loved the arcade game's music, and especially loved that they had the machine turned up hella loud. This sounded like some spastic calliope that a drunkard chucked up in. Okay, maybe I exaggerate a bit, but still. It sounds like a really cheap organ. The whole thing. It was a worthwhile sacrifice, though, if it meant that I could play it on my SNES and not feel cheated. It really did feel like the arcade game, and even with the co-processor in the cart that was there solely to facilitate data decompression, SFA2 on the SNES did the impossible - it smashed a brand-new cutting-edge arcade game pretty faithfully onto a system based on mid-80s tech. Truly nice work, Capcom!\n\nOf course, after I got my PlayStation and a copy of SFA and SFA2 for that, this was quickly forgotten.
