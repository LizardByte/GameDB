This will be our hub to post our Twitter uploads in Higher Quality than the site allows. (kinda to prevent people from re-uploading the lower quality videos as well but shhhhhhh)\n\nThis will also be our hub for content better suited for YouTube's format, so expect potential updates and other content relating to the project's past and present on this channel! \n\nThis teaser was uploaded on September 23rd 2021, where we finally announced the project's triumphant return after a year of progress! Note that what's currently shown in this teaser is not up-to-date with current versions of the game, everything is still subject to change, especially this early on in the reboot's life! \n\nIf you haven't already, please follow our Twitter page! We've been a tad quiet recently, but rest assured; we won't be stopping this time!\nhttps://twitter.com/Sonic_XG", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOQTMN4Dy1Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOQTMN4Dy1Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOQTMN4Dy1Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOQTMN4Dy1Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOQTMN4Dy1Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic XG - 2021 Teaser Trailer", "description": "2002 - 2005 - 2007 - 2012 - 2014...\n\n2021...\n\nIt is time.\n\nWelcome to Sonic XG's official YouTube channel!
