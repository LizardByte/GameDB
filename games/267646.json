The prince of our country (you, the player) and the princess of the neighboring country of Moon Oinu promised each other their future, and both countries were filled with happiness. All the people were satisfied with these peaceful days and lived happily.\n\nBut one day, something unbelievable happened. The King of Moon Oinu was cursed to death by that infamous mage. The mage has taken control of Moon Oinu and is trying to force the princess to be his wife. Moreover, the enchanted Moon Oinu soldiers are attacking our country one after another. As for mages, they must be plotting to take over the world. We must go to Moon Oinu's castle as soon as possible, help the princess, and restore peace. Our country also has excellent soldiers on standby. Command these soldiers with your princely power, and defeat the mage.\n\nOn the way to Moon Oinu, harsh nature and enemy soldiers will be waiting. Therefore, we have prepared two trainings so that you can familiarize yourself with the enemy's strength and terrain, and be ready for battle. First of all, it's strategic training according to the terrain (match mode). Choose your own 20 terrains and command your troops. One more thing. I have prepared one-on-one combat training so that you know the strength of the enemy. (battle mode).\n\nWhen it comes to fighting, experience speaks for itself. I want you to gain all sorts of experience, hone your skills, and successfully attack Moon Oinu's castle. And bring back a peaceful world to us again.", "summary": "Little Magic is a Strategy game, developed and published by Data East, which was released in Japan in 1990.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/little-magic--2"}
