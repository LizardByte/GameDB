The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called \"juice meter\": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a \"learning by doing\" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aggressive-inline", "videos": [{"id": 52192, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Bn6kplwxOe0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn6kplwxOe0", "title": "Aggressive Inline (PS2)(Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bn6kplwxOe0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
