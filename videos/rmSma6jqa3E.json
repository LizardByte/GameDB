Inspired by children\u2019s book illustrations, risograph prints and screen printing techniques, its beautiful visuals convey the warmth and personality of hand crafted pictures. You follow the story of a group of ghosts looking to discover who they were and why they are still here, through a family friendly tale of loss, how to deal with it, and acceptance. Navigate an intricate world filled with mind-bending yet fun puzzles, find clues about the identities of our spirit friends, and help them reach the other side.\n\nhttp://florian.games/theotherside/\n\nFlorian on twitter https://twitter.com/FlorianVltmn\nBaptiste on twitter https://twitter.com/baptisteworks", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rmSma6jqa3E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rmSma6jqa3E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rmSma6jqa3E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rmSma6jqa3E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rmSma6jqa3E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Other Side - Early Teaser", "description": "The Other Side is an upcoming mobile puzzle crafted by Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix.
