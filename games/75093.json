Build up your menu, prepare your recipes on all manner of cooking equipment, and frantically serve up to 4 customers at a time. You, the player, will be graded on how well you cook, and how quickly you serve dishes- the food critics can be especially demanding! \n \nCustomize your restaurant and serve the types of dishes you want, but remember to keep your customers happy, or they won't want to come back! \n \nThis game is currently in Early Access as we seek funding for our passion project. We've chosen to make the existing base game available for your enjoyment; your support will allow us to keep adding all of the fancy features that are still on our road-map. We have BIG plans for Order Up VR. With your help we can see those come to life!", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "videos": [{"id": 16523, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1KtwX2IUQOY"}]}
