Gaia created this land so that she could live with her children. As time passed, an unknown evil blemished it all. \nThus, Gaia disavowed the disobedient humans and abandoned the world she created. From that day on, she was referred to as \u201cTerra\u201d.  \n \nWithout a primary ruler to oversee her children, Ateon soon fell into chaos and the First Valkyrian War was recorded in history. \nThe Valkyrie were sacred creatures that would fuse themselves with warriors, imbuing the chosen ones with fantastic powers to defeat true evil. \nFrom the ashes of war, the Kingdom of Rose was born. The tenacious people sought to unite the world under one rule. They aimed their blades at any who would go against them. Purging the world of imperfections in hopes that it will summon Terra back to their world."}
