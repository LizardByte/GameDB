You will be escorted by a team of trained police and special vehicle escorts who will communicate and guide you throughout your journey. The drive may be tough, but if you drive with care and listen to your escort drivers advice, you will get these enormous cargoes to where they're needed safely.\n\nMaster these cargoes and become a true master of truck hauling!", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/american-truck-simulator-special-transport"}
