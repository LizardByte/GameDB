Each number corresponds to the order in the real course. It has the usual modes, such as Strokeplay, Matchplay, Stableford, Tournament and Skins, two swing methods (hold, release, click and triple click) with three difficulty levels and the usual options such as fade or draw the ball. It is possible to edit and create new golfers, although options are limited to selecting one of six digitized animations, the shirt colour, swing method and difficulty and the starting tee."}
