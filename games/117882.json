Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army.", "summary": "A remaster of God of War II, an action-adventure hack-and-slash video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). The game is rooted in Greek mythology and unfolds in ancient Greece, revolving around the theme of vengeance. The protagonist, Kratos, is the new God of War, having defeated the former, Ares. However, Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian gods, who not only strips him of his godhood but also kills him. Dragged slowly to the Underworld, Kratos is rescued by the Titan Gaia, who guides him to seek out the Sisters of Fate. These entities have the power to enable time travel, allowing Kratos to prevent his betrayal, and ultimately seek revenge on Zeus.\n\nThe remaster features full HD resolution complete with 2X anti-aliased graphics running at 60 frames per second.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-ii--1"}
