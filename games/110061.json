It also includes Knuckles' version of the game, Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, originally accessed by connecting Sonic the Hedgehog 2 with the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-ages-sonic-the-hedgehog-2", "videos": [{"id": 35535, "name": "Japanese launch trailer", "video_id": "WfIJstnJQ08", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfIJstnJQ08", "title": "\u300eSEGA AGES \u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30d8\u30c3\u30b8\u30db\u30c3\u30b02\u300f\u7d39\u4ecb\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WfIJstnJQ08/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35536, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "Liixw0tBkJw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Liixw0tBkJw", "title": "SEGA AGES Sonic The Hedgehog 2 & Puyo Puyo 2 | Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Liixw0tBkJw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
