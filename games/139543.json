By the time Riela arrived, Aslone had already been occupied by imperials and Riela was discovered. In order to move more swiftly, Riela had left her Valkyrur weapons behind, and therefore had no way to defend herself against the overwhelming odds. Fortunately, Riela discovered that the knife she always kept with her possessed a power similar to that of the Valykrian lance and shield. Armed with this new knowledge, Riela managed to fend off her attackers. When Kurt and the others arrived, Riela had already cleared the imperials out of Aslone. As a reward, Riela was treated to a relaxing vacation on the beach with Kurt.", "summary": "The Secret of Her Powers is a downloadable content for Valkyria Chronicles 3.
