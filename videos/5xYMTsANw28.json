But apparently, ATI ported Bubsy (of all things) to Windows 95 -- and completely redrew the graphics at 2x resolution in the process!\n\n(Please note that this is NOT the version that's just been put on Steam\u2014that's just an emulator running the low-rez SNES version, for some reason.)\n\nNow, let's be honest, it's still the same game and it's still awful... But the new art is actually surprisingly good if you ask me; this is one of the few up-rezzings I've ever seen done to a sprite game that actually looks as good as the source material if not better! And since the art was just about the only thing Bubsy had going for it (thank you, Ken Macklin) I figured it was worth at least preserving a bit of it! (There are a few other videos of it online, but they're mostly far too low-resolution to actually show off the difference between this 480p version and the 240p console versions\u2026)\n\nOne thing up front: Yes, this video is 1440p, because that was the only integer multiple of 480 that Youtube will actually show without scaling up or down, and with a sane amount of compression. It drives me crazy that I can't just post it at 1:1, but for whatever reason, Youtube's kbps on HD video is *proportionately* way higher as you turn the resolution up. So, redundant pixels it is. :P\n\nAlso, the game is not meant to be so silent: the CD comes with full redbook audio tracks for the background music, but unfortunately, this didn't actually work in VirtualBox. But anyway, they're just mediocre MIDI renderings of the same songs from the console versions, so, you can use your imagination there. :P\n\nThe Bubsy cartoon on the CD-ROM can be seen elsewhere on YouTube in higher quality, but I included a bit of it here so we can all enjoy its dithered, postage-stamp glory.\n\nThe slow fade-out whenever Bubsy dies seems to just be a VirtualBox bug; it doesn't happen in the other videos I've seen of this game.\n\nI was hoping to get more than one tileset featured in the video, but, one can only stand so much Bubsy before giving up. :P If you'd like to see more, I think there's a few abandonware sites out there that have it, and Win95/Win98 emulation in VirtualBox is tricky but not impossible to get right.\n\nIn case you can't get enough of these atrocious cat puns on the loading screens, GOOD NEWS, there's even more that didn't make it into the game: https://tcrf.net/Super_Bubsy", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xYMTsANw28/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xYMTsANw28/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xYMTsANw28/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xYMTsANw28/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xYMTsANw28/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\"Super Bubsy\" - Bubsy Windows 95 CD-ROM high-res port", "description": "TIMESTAMPS:\n0:00 - Intro Narration\n0:46 - Intro Cartoon\n1:37 - Title Screen\n8:53 - Level 2\n17:48 - Level 3\n23:50 - Game Over and Cartoon Bonus\n\nSo, I had no idea this existed until a couple of weeks ago?
