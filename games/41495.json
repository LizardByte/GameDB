You're the only one we have left for the job. Mr. Andreas Skarfos, alias 'Scarfinger',has seized an island and set up a fortress there. He has a number of missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads to any part of the globe, and unless we answer his demands, he will destroy us. His installations are all but invulnerable to surface attack, but we've discovered a tunnel which leads under the island. If one man could somehow reach the tunnel, they could stop Scarfinger!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scarfinger"}
