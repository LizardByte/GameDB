It's quite well put together. Stage design in the later stages isn't too shabby either. Very fun game. \nIt also has quite a bit of content. Besides the standard four difficulties and Extra, it also has a fifth difficulty and two different difficulty modes for Extra. There are also a whole bunch of secret spellcards and Last Words that you unlock by doing certain things in the stages. \n\nDifficulty\nUra is a hidden difficulty that is way above Lunatic difficulty. A lot of stuff in it is pretty unreasonable, so you have to do some resource management to get through it. \nYou access Ura by pressing shift ten times while you have Lunatic selected. \n\nSystem\nThe system this time is centered around the Harvest system. \n- Harvest items get dropped when you speedkill and pointblank enemies and when you graze bullets. \n- These items fill up the harvest meter on the right side. \n- When the meter is full a border gets activated.\n- During the border you can fill it up to 300% by collecting harvest items during it. \n- You can cancel the border manually by pressing bomb, the cancel radius is dependent on the percentage.\n- When the border naturally runs out you get a certain number of bomb pieces depending on your percentage (100% is one bomb piece, 200% is two, 300% is three).\n- You get like a full second of i-frames when the border runs out, you can abuse this in certain places. \n- You get extra lives through certain point item thresholds. \n\nLast Words\nCollecting enough harvest items during a stage unlocks a Last Word, meaning the boss gets a bonus spellcard at the end. The yellow number next to the harvest meter indicates how many you need. \nYou don't lose anything for failing Last Words. \nNot to be confused with the Last Words that are separate from the main game. \n\nAnomaly spellcards\nUnlocked after you 1cc the game once, these replace certain spellcards if you do certain secret things in the stages. These cards are quite a bit harder than the ones they replace. \nCapturing these anomaly cards unlocks the Last Words that are separate from the main game. \n\nUsed ReimuA for this run because she's probably the best for Ura survival. She does decent damage, has a -very- strong bomb, a small hitbox and with the biggest thing being the extended deathbomb timer. You have like a second or something to deathbomb, it's basically an autobomb lol.\nThe A shottypes also have some easier spellcards in stage 5. \n\nPatterns in Ura can be differentiated in two categories: doable and very not doable. You want to do well enough on the doable parts so that you have enough resources to get past the rest.\n\nYou basically want to stall every midboss to skip enemy waves in Ura. The enemy waves you get if you speedkill a midboss are all very horrible. \n\n2-miss to stage 6 was really good but stage 6 was pretty messy. Could have easily been 4-miss or even 3-miss. \n\nThe dual boss in stage 5 is quite good. It really feels like they're both fighting you at the same time rather than them just being two bullet spawnpoints. \n\nDownload the game here: \nhttps://www.bulletforge.org/u/team-dreamcatcher/p/dong-fang-cui-hu-tan-servants-of-harvest-wish\n\nWorth pointing out that the developers are running a fundraiser for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res for the release of the game.
