First the player chooses from one of nine female pornstars. Each porn actress has a picture and a video clip related to her. This picture can either be made into a jigsaw puzzle, a slider puzzle, or a memory match game where when each card is matched and disappears more of the background picture is revealed. Completing any of these three puzzles unlocks a softcore pornographic clip from a Vivid Video movie.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mind-teazzer"}
