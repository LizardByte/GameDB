So then, let's make some runs.\nTo be fair, I was aiming for LNNN, but when making 1.02a update, Gore though it would be a great idea to uncomment some code for the ultimate spellcard, and make it ultra difficult compared to the rest of the game. Good job man, I feel betrayed lol.\n\n----------\n\u6771\u65b9\u9580\u6b8a\u92ad \uff5e Bubbling Imaginary Treasures is a third... I guess? Touhou fan-game made by Gore/Corey. Full game was released at 11 November 2021. As with the other of their games, this one also mixes several Touhou games by partially imcorporating their mechanics or boss' patterns. There are many references to Touhou 11 SA and Touhou 12 UFO, even as to tell that Extra stage is a kinda reproduction of one known from Touhou 11 (at least stage-portion-wise).\nTwo updates were rolled out, improving performance a little, as well as changing some patterns, like ultimate spellcard.\n\nThere are four playable characters to choose from: Reimu, Marisa, Sanae and Komachi, each with three different shot-types, bombs and special abilities (aka Skills or Assist Spirit Strike). Gathering enough money enables the player to use a skill, and depending on player character it can have various effects.\nFor the record, there is an achievements/trophies system known from recent Touhou games.\n\n----------\n[ HP system ]\nAs with Gore's previous game - Franticallt Forbidden Fruit - here we also get HP bar. Once you get hit, your HP decreases. If by any chance your HP would be decreased to zero, it will be set to 1 HP, but then the next hit will result in a miss and losing a life.\n\nHP taken from a hit is not random. It depends on a hitbox of a bullet (in pixels I assume) x4 + skills level x2. When it is a laser, it is fixed to 100. When player is not in focus mode, damage is doubled up.\nSanae can halve the damage when in skills mode.\n\n----------\n[ Mechanics of the game ]\nGame borrows mechanics known from Touhou SA and Touhou DDC, and it's very apparent. The multiplier from gathering items can go from x0.50 to x5.00, eventually getting much higher when PIV multiplier is applied, up to x9.99.\n\nIt has several thresholds, at which selected number of resources are dropped (from 1 to 4) depending on items collected and multiplier achieved. It will also make clearing circle bigger. At x5.00 and higher, it will cover nearly all the screen, even with the player at the very bottom of the screen.\n\nPlayers' skills can be activated once one gather enough money. They can be collected through grazing, clearing the bullets, dropped from killed enemies and at the end of stages when your performance is calculated. The effect of skill depends on shot-type chosen.\n\n----------\n[ My thoughts on BIT? ]\nHonestly? I expected some better fangame coming out from them. I mean, this being half a rip-off of patterns from official games is just a part of the problem. I mean, we still have Stage 5, 6 and Extra stage bosses with more unique patterns. Notice I have said \"half a rip-off\".\n\nFor the biggest problem out there: there is no survival play here. Not in this game. Seriously. Since the only option is a HP system (no insta-death mode), plus one is provided with \"Assist Spirit Strike\"/skills system which is powerful on its own, and pretty much unbalanced characters that can take off most of bosses in an instant... well, where is a difficulty in it then, when anyone can beat this game effortlessly?\n\nSure, I have taken some hits here and there (guess I had enough of the game already), it's not like it's ultra free so anyone can pull off a perfect run instantly. And yet, it is that easy given that system. It's horrible.\n\nAnd the second biggest problem: performance. My 7yrs old PC and Win10 system cannot handle it such that it wouldn't lag every so often. So, I had to use my Win7 build from TWC to handle it, and even then there were lags during recording, even with some effects cut. Plus, memory leaks all over there, which eventually slows down the game dramatically. Like, please, it's the first thing you should have fixed instead of the ultimate attack...\n\nOtherwise, the game would be fine. Quite average, compared to the rest of Touhou fangames out there, even some Western ones. But still a fangame :V\n\n----------\nDownload Bubbling Imaginary Treasures here (Mirror):\nhttps://mega.nz/folder/kcJnQSKR#Ijf-o7NyDPsy384fnFX6eQ\n\nFor more fan-made goodies - check out Touhou Fangames List\nhttp://bit.ly/FangamesList\n\nLink to my Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/CreepyNinja_\n\nDiscord - Fanworks 'n Chill\nhttps://discord.gg/wBVwcxU", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lcPhviBD4UA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lcPhviBD4UA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lcPhviBD4UA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lcPhviBD4UA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lcPhviBD4UA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou: Bubbling Imaginary Treasures (v1.02a) || Lunatic 1 Miss No Bomb No Special Clear", "description": "Touhou BIT is out for some time, and I have finally some spare time to jump into Touhou universe again!
