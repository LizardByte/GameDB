{"id": "GMsZBDLnXVI", "snippet": {"title": "Barver Battle Saga: Tai Kong Zhan Shi\u2013Mo Fa Zhan Shi (1996, English, SEGA MD/GENESIS Gameplay 2020)", "description": "Barver Battle Saga: Tai Kong Zhan Shi (Chinese: '\u592a\u7a7a\u6230\u58eb \u9b54\u6cd5\u6230\u58eb') (Brave Battle Saga - The Legend of The Magic Warrior) is an unlicensed Jrpg game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis/PC. It was released initially in 1996 for the Sega Mega Drive.Genesis. It was developed by Chuanpu and this version published by NT.\n\n\nNOTE: There were some slight changes in this version to the PC version but nothing dramatic, I think the translation is much lower quality in this English patch which is why Translation is marked lower, and it seems the patch causes issues with the sound a little too, a few marks off for that. I think the PC version is the better one to play for this game.\n\n\nSTORY: 15/20\n*SPOILER* The game centers on an ancient space station that is buried beneath the earth centuries ago after it wipe out a previous civilization during a war for world domination. You play as Tim, where him and his friends end up the only ones who can prevent the Zak Empire from collecting four plates that can reactivate this space station, (which so happens to be an ancient weapon), and stop them from using it to take control of the entire world.\n\nIt's a very generic story, clearly ripped from some of the best RPG games ever created BUT then.. how many Jrpgs from the 16BIT era can boast it has an original story that has never been done before? not many I wager.\n\nGRAPHICS: 18/20\nThe graphics for this game are just amazing for a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis game, if Capcom and Squaresoft had a kid.. this would be it. The game's towns and general world locals graphically reminds me of the Wonderswan/PS1 versions of Final Fantasy 1 & 2, whilst the battles graphically remind me of Breath of Fire 1 & 2.\n\nThe monster sprites are not so great, they look very dated now but you can easily make out what they are supposed to be, so no guessing if a slime is meant to be something else, or a skull is meant to be a rabite here. All the spells are okay I guess, nothing like S.o.M. spells, i'd say more like B.o.F spells in way of look.\n\nThe game makes use of some very nice detailed cutscenes with use of art that looks just amazing, even portraits of your characters look real nice also. Your characters in battle all look unique and animate when standing or attacking, same with the enemy. The pop-up notices for when you find an item kinda looks odd and could have looked better, I dunno, it just looks out of place.\n\nMUSIC: 13/20\nThe game has some very nice music, a pretty good OST to fit the game. Each area's music fits the location and the battle music is pretty awesome once it kicks in. Sound effects for spells and attacking are okay, probably nothing you haven't heard before though, very generic. There's no tunes you will be humming along to here.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 16/20\nThe easiest way for me to explain this is to compare it against other games I have mentioned already. SO! this game plays like Secret of Mana when you are moving around in towns or the world, and the battles play out more like Breath of Fire 1 & 2. navigating the menu system is pretty easy and you have access to saving whenever and wherever you want, but not in battles, obviously. Each character have their own unique sets of skills to use, all with their own animations when using them in battle. You actually see the monsters roaming around, you need to bum into them to start off a battle.\n\nThis game has it's own built in hidden cheat system but you can only activate one at a time for a single playthrough, so.. you can activate Max Gold or have you characters start at level 99 with stats maxed out. This type of built in cheat system ruins it for gamers but then they don't have to use the cheats if they don't want to. I suppose they could be used for a 2nd or even 3rd playthorough just to make things easier and less time consuming, by the way, this cheat system is on both versions of this game.\n\nTRANSLATION: 18/20\nThe translation for this version is absolutely top notch, no spelling or grammar errors to what I could see, but then the way I write my reviews I probably missed them.. LOL!\n\nOVER ALL: 80/100\nThe story sounds a lot like Secret of Mana, that's cos it effectively is without the Sword of Mana and Elementals placement, even though there is magic to use, and a different battle system, more like Breath of Fire. Should you let this turn you off from playing it? certainly NOT! it's actually a fantastic game that deserves to be noticed more. Would I recommend this game to play now? OF COURSE! it's a fantastic old-school Jrpg that ANY pixel art fan should play. I think however, i'd go for the PC version over this one.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you played this game? What did you think?
