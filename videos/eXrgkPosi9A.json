Yes, I really love the game Killing Floor and I as a fan and game developer, found my self on this new challenge, to make a co-op game with a lot of references from the Killing Floor franchise.\n\nThat is not my first experience developing games, I made my first game in 2016, a f2p game called Clown2Beat, in 2019 I travelled to GDC to find investor for my project called Shadows of Kepler, so we finished just with a demo, you can play it on Steam.\n\nIn 2022 I launched the game called Parallel, a very mysterious and different game. And now here I am, doing a game that I really enjoy... shoot, explosions, action and the best of all for me... a co-op game to play with friends.\n\nYou know guys, for me this is a unique experience once again and I hope you enjoy this type of game and can support me so I can continue creating more planets, more weapons and more enemies. Why not a customizable cyborg? Only time will knows.\n\nThank you very much for any comments, you can find the game here and put it on your wishlist or follow if you wish: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2516430/Cyborg3003/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXrgkPosi9A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXrgkPosi9A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXrgkPosi9A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXrgkPosi9A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXrgkPosi9A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cyborg3003 - Early Access Trailer - a game made by one person, inspired on Killing Floor game.", "description": "Greetings all.
