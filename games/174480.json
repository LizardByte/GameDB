Enhance your units with powerful artifacts that increase attack, defense and speed.\nPlay against family and friends on a single device!\n\nShoot thunderbolts with Zeus, petrify opponents with Medusa, devour the enemies with Minotaur or use invunerable Achilles and three-headed Cerberus to defeat your foe. Use Catapult to pick on opposing troops from the distance or a Dragon with devastating attack from above. Assign Hercules or Theseus to slay the Phoenix, which would rise from the ashes. Use Athena's Aegis to protect your troops and Hades to reap the souls of the dead and increase your power. This game is not a CCG. It's completely different from Magic The Gathering or Heartstone. There is no collecting of cards, only the battle and strategy.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gods-of-sparta"}
