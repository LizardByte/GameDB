The sentinels pick the best warrior from each universe and invite them to the contest.\n\nYou represent one of these warriors, provided with a high-end skating device, a helmet, and a trail generator to compete. Each universe gives you unique skills (one) which distinguish you from the rest and gives advantage. The battle arena contains highly sophisticated features and power-ups. You can team up with other warriors to eliminate the rest but eventually, you will need to fight for the rune in the final 1x1 battle to decide your universe destiny.", "summary": "A sci-fi MOBA with unique ice-skating locomotion and a trail generator device to catch your enemies.
