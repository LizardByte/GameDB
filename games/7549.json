You'll encounter dinosaurs, volcanoes, and man-eating sharks, as well as a tribe of cavemen to save. Your mission is to save the Forgotten Island.\n\nThere are 9 interconnected tables included for you to conquer. They have to be unlocked during the game and offer 2 or 3 settings per table. In comparison to most other pinball simulations the goals on a table are mostly not to get a high score but to solve missions like chasing away sharks. Also unusual are the 3D graphics: instead of a static top-down view the camera follows the pinball ball.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adventure-pinball-forgotten-island", "videos": [{"id": 2767, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "e_sdFV5mMs8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_sdFV5mMs8", "title": "PC Longplay [214] Adventure Pinball - Forgotten Island", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_sdFV5mMs8/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 2766, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jrAAB5vkkow", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrAAB5vkkow", "title": "Adventure Pinball: Forgotten Island - Trailer (2001)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jrAAB5vkkow/sddefault.jpg"}]}
