Ad Wars is a multi-genre adventure with different difficulty levels that welcomes newcomers and hardcore players alike.\n\nDivided into 3 episodes, you'll find yourself jumping and shooting the mischievous yet endearing Gengens in Super Freemium Lands, taking on all sorts of monsters RPG-style in Clickbait Kingdom, and unearthing the mysteries of Download Highways, a screwball Maze Crawler section. Oh, and did we mention there's also bullet hell mania?\n\nIf there's one thing we encourage the player to have to fully savor Ad Wars, it's an open mind.
