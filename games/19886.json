As in most lightgun games, the objective is to make it through an environment while shooting enemies. It is somewhat less typical in that you have full roaming control over your character rather than being stuck on rails. More unusually, a timer begins as you enter each area. If the timer runs out before you leave, Nemesis will appear and chase you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-survivor-2-code-veronica", "videos": [{"id": 8796, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "G-SvZ0-11D4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-SvZ0-11D4", "title": "Resident Evil Survivor 2 CODE: Veronica", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-SvZ0-11D4/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8160, "name": "Gun Survivor"}]}
