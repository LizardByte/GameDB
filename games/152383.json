A moment in time for yourself, a magick circle, to freely explore your inner world. Walk around a desolate town in search of the 12 dioramas where you will be asked a question.\n\nAnswer truthfully, with the answer that best corresponds with how you are feeling. There is no right or wrong answer. Then you will be shown an ending and given a personalized reading based on your answers.", "summary": "This software is not a game. A cross between a walking sim and a tarot card reading, TSOTG asks you to find 12 evocative dioramas and answer a single question: What do you see?
