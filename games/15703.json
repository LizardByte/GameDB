The Game", "summary": "Dedicated to the authors of the original Boing! demo.\n\nSeymour Greene is a disillusioned employee of CBBM (Cute Beach Ball Manufacturers- arch-business rivals include IBBM and AppBall). No one there will listen to Seymour's great ideas. You must help Seymour snap out of his daydream. He has already been warned and this time he is sure to get fired.\n\nYou must guide Seymour to the exit of his imaginary under-ground cave system. Watch out for the evil green Boing! balls for they like Seymour as a snack. Collect the red Boing! balls for points and use the scattered needles to pop the evil green Boing! balls. Maneuver Seymour up ladders, down slide-poles, and through teleporters. Watch out for falling rocks and flame-geysers.\n\nBoing! The Game has 30 levels with up to 24 screens for each level. Includes a Level Editor so you can make your own games.\n\nThis package is sold by weight, not by volume. Packed as full as practicable by modern automatic equipment, it contains full net weight indicated. If it does not appear full when opened, it is because contents have settled during shipping and handling."}
