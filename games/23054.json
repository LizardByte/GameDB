Each house's dustbin must be collected, emptied and replaced within the time limit, which is indicated by the Bonus timer at the top of the screen. If this reaches zero, you receive the first of 3 warnings - a third sees you out of a job.\n\nSetting foot on the grass causes the bonus to drop more quickly, and there are additional hazards to avoid, including the local cars, which appear to be driven by maniacs, and cyclists and barking dogs, which can both injure you and cause your movement to slow.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trashman", "videos": [{"id": 109149, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "j6KrfK3yaKI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6KrfK3yaKI", "title": "Trashman for the Commodore VIC-20 / Commodore VC-20", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j6KrfK3yaKI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
