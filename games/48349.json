Like that wasn\u2019t already obvious just by looking at \u2018em. All of the four characters that you have the choice of controlling have the amazing ability to fly in an amazingly awkward fashion. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any difference in who you want to pick though. What\u2019s awkward about flying is, if you\u2019re flying Up and want to go Left, you don\u2019t just automatically go Left when you hit the control pad\u2026 you go diagonally, then you go left. And you don\u2019t sit still if you let go of the control pad, you have to hit A to stop. And then you have to hit A again to fall to the ground and walk around like normal. Which is all very weird. But you can jump REALLY high, so that\u2019s cool.\n\nThere\u2019s a side view, where you can fly, like what I was just talking about, and there\u2019s a top view, where you walk around inside of buildings and stuff. You can\u2019t fly though, but you can jump, which is pretty useless. What\u2019s cool about this game is the sheer amount of fun crazy bonus rooms you can go into. I\u2019ve found the \u201cfly-around-and-break-crates-for-a-while\u201d fun bonus room, and the \u201cjump-around-on-these-tiles-but-they-break-after-you-jump-off-so-you-can-only-jump-on-each-tile-once\u201d fun bonus room. And sometimes at the end of these rooms you can earn neat stuff, like new weapons or weapon upgrades. Sure beats your crappy punch.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/perman-part-2-himitsu-kessha-madoodan-wo-taose", "videos": [{"id": 111342, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iJ6gGWYXIiQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ6gGWYXIiQ", "title": "NES - Perman Part 2 - Himitsu Kessha Madoodan o Taose! \u00a9 1991 Irem - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iJ6gGWYXIiQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4156, "name": "Perman"}]}
