These versions were also the only ones to contain alternate endings when winning on the \"Easy\" or \"Difficult\" difficulties, in which a narrator rambles on about many (false) facts about worms or congratulates the player in a similar absurd manner respectively. The Special Edition was later ported to Windows 95 by Activision.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 41846, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Rz-GHaQfdto", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-GHaQfdto", "title": "Earthworm Jim - Special Edition (SEGA CD) - Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rz-GHaQfdto/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 41847, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "RQhLS5sOVnY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhLS5sOVnY", "title": "Earthworm Jim Special Edition (Sega CD) - Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQhLS5sOVnY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
