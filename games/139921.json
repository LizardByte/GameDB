The series is known for some mistranslations from its original Japanese language to western language. The title of the series is portmanteau of the words \"onee-chan\" which means \"big sister\" and \"chanbara\" which means \"sword fighting\" which the story follows the eldest sister Aya from the start of the series accompanied by her younger sister Saki as they attempt to bring back their mother Tsubaki but learn their Baneful Blood clan heritage and the truth behind it. Onee Chanbara Origin is prequel to the events of Bikini Samurai Squad long before the events of Z2: Chaos story long and the ZPF was formed.\n\nOnee Chanbara Origin is a remake of the story from the first two games in the series which were never published to the western audience within a new engine and new art style to accompany multiple returning features from the previous games redone and tailored to the games improved experience on the series formula.\n\nReturning features to the series is:\nWeapon degradation in which they become covered in blood and start losing their effectiveness until wiped clean.\nBlood Lust/Blood Frenzy makes a return with some slight changes that improve character damage and speed when activated but also comes with a draw back that can punish players by lowering their defensive capabilities by increasing how much damage they will take if hit.\nBerserk mechanic which takes the effects of Blood-Lust even further but also bring one more draw back being that your life force drains at a constant rate and can be replenished by dealing damage and spilling the blood of enemies in combat during this enhanced transformation.\nParry mechanic has received some changes since the previous games and becomes far more useful with being able to nullify an incoming attack and potentially stun the target allowing for quick counter attacks if timed well, parrying to soon or to late will result in being put into a recovery state where you become vulnerable for a brief time.\nDodge/Run mechanic has been improved to recover energy when dodging attacks to allow faster charge up of your Special/Signature attack, Running speeds up your movement while allowing you to re-engage enemies with gap closing attacks that blend into your combo chains this also works with dodging attacks to extend combos or modify attacks.\nInfinite Mode makes a return from Bikini Samurai Squad where you can level up and test your skills in increasingly difficult fights as you climb the supposed endless number of floors.\nRe-recorded signature OST tracks as well as brand new tracks just for this release to really put the emphasis on the action for the series.\nFamiliar control scheme that has been very much the staple of the series but with vast improvements with responsiveness and tighter control over movement and combat while keeping this fast and fluid.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 42251, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ssPr4whdZ4c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssPr4whdZ4c", "title": "\u3010PS4\u3011\u300e\u304a\u59c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9ORIGIN\u300f1st\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ssPr4whdZ4c/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 42252, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "j6FGVTXW0yA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6FGVTXW0yA", "title": "\u3010PS4\u3011\u300e\u304a\u59c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9ORIGIN\u300f2nd\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j6FGVTXW0yA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 42253, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rExzS104lA0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rExzS104lA0", "title": "\u3010PS4\u3011\u300e\u304a\u59c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9ORIGIN\u300f3rd\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rExzS104lA0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
