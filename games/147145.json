This mobile app version of the game recreates the original game, including hidden elements. The game system has been rearranged to make it easier to play. In addition, this title has been improved with the G-Mode archives. The \"Arrange\" mode allows you to fly through the air more intensely and smoothly. The game includes two modes: \"Arrange\" mode, which is more intense and smoother, and \"Original\" mode, where you can enjoy the nostalgic graphics of the time. There are eight types of special weapons. Each weapon has its own unique characteristics, and the power of each weapon increases with successive attacks. The thrill comes from the large number of bullets that the enemy attacks with. Use the special attacks to your advantage to defeat the final boss!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/g-mode-archives-29-zanac", "videos": [{"id": 109372, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TBb1PjritCQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBb1PjritCQ", "title": "G-MODE\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u30b929 ZANAC\u3000\u7d39\u4ecb\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TBb1PjritCQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 5127, "name": "Zanac"}, {"id": 7579, "name": "G-Mode Archives"}]}
