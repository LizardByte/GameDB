Earn money for every successful shipment and invest in new vehicles or upgrade and customize your existing locomotives. Plus: build stations, yards, and other infrastructure along your routes to service your trains with fuel, water, and sand.\n\nEnjoy a realistic railroad experience with the advanced Unreal Engine physics system for deep railroad simulation. All collisions and forces are rendered dynamically in real time, making the train driving experience much more immersive. So, be careful about derailing your train! And to top it all off, you can play Railroads Online with up to 16 players on a server and enjoy the ultimate train simulation in multiplayer sessions with your friends. Lay tracks together and cooperate to move trains seamlessly or share the work while you play independently.
