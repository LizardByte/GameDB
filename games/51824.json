After weeks of fierce battles and heavy losses, an opportunistic alien force emerges from the depths of space and threatens to take over the solar system - just when humanity is in its weakest and most divided state.  \n \nYou will have to explore and conquer the galaxy as the head of your fleet, planning colonization, terraforming planets, managing your resources and deciding on the appropriate technological research to lead mankind where you want it to go. Research, combined with a top-notch spy network, will enable you to survive in a stellar system which is much more dangerous than it would first appear to be. Who says that space is empty? Black holes, asteroid fields, nebulas, cosmic clouds and wormholes as well as alien races make each fleet sortie a perilous affair. \n \nCan you stand up for the challenge?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/haegemonia-gold-edition"}
