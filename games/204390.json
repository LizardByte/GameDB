Your job is to scrap the animatronics and collect this remnant to fuel Afton's return.\n\nIn these locations, the last remainders of Fazbear Entertainment, will you uncover the truth about Afton. His life, his history, his acts and misdeeds as well as his relation to Henry Emily and the start of Fazbear Entertainment.\n\nThe story is Non-linear and adjusts character dialogue and sequences based on the order you play the levels and find certain lore clues in, adding to replay value and making sure your playthrough is unique.", "summary": "Aftonbuilt was a dark new take on the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise.\n\nThe player is tasked with surviving four of the most harrowing locations in Fazbear history using only their wits, movement, and a set of handmade tools.
