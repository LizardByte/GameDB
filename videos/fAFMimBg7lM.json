Whoo! Unfortunately, I ran into a small issue. See, the game runs at 50 FPS (actually, 48 FPS for some reason). I originally had CamStudio capture at 50 FPS, but for some reason the timing code it has is awful and so it only went at 40 FPS. To reduce the nasty effects of framerate conversion, I instead opted for 100 FPS capture, which in reality captured at around 70 FPS. I imported the footage into VirtualDub, where I changed the source framerate from 100 FPS to 100.004 to resync the audio. I then sent the resulting videos to YouTube which finally converted to 30 FPS. So basically, 50 FPS to ~70 to 100 to 100.004 to 30. Thus you might find that the framerate is a bit jerky in certain parts of the video (only in High Quality for some reason). Not sure if this has to do with the player itself, but it's an unfortunate side-effect that I don't have any control over. Sorry.\r\n\r\nPlot (taken from the game's help program):\r\n\r\nMr Stump likes drinking. In fact, you could say he is a bit of an alcoholic. Every night he goes out to the pub, and normally purchases the stiffest ale he can buy.\r\n\r\nHowever, on this night, something has gone drastically wrong!\r\n\r\nHe's become immune to alcohol! NOOOOO!\r\n\r\nNo matter how much he drinks, Mr Stump simply cannot get sloshed. After twenty pints of ale, he finally comes to the conclusion that he's wasting his hard earned cash (actually it's not that hard earned, as he has no job and relies on Jobseekers Allowance). So Mr Stump decides to head off home, to the wife.\r\n\r\nOn his way back, he passes a brand new shop. He's never seen it before in his life, so he goes to investigate.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he emerges from the shop, carrying a bottle of battery acid. Quite how the acid doesn't eat away at the bottle defies the laws of reason, but nonetheless, Herr Stump continues his journey home.\r\n\r\nOnce there, he decides to drink the battery acid, hoping that its effect would be far more potent than even the most alcoholic of beverages, and which would lead him into the world of dizziness and nausea.\r\n\r\nBut no. Denied. Nothing happens. Giving up, Mr Stump goes to bed. However, during his sleep, the acid begins its work. Mr Stump's Dentures start to loosen, and eventually they fall away into the dark jaws of hell they call the mouth.\r\n\r\nGagging, Mr Stump wakes up, and realises the predicament he's in. So he separates his mouth from his body, and jumps into it in the hope of recapturing his dentures. Not wanting to buy a new set, of course, because he's a bum. Let's face it.\r\n\r\nHowever, somehow Mr Stump's dark side also managed to find a way into the mouth. Mr Dump intends also on capturing the dentures, so he can build a magnificent tower to call upon the Tooth God and wreak havoc on the world, giving everyone plague and gum disease, and destroying the world's toothpaste!\r\n\r\nMr Stump must find Mr Dump and perhaps murder him!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fAFMimBg7lM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fAFMimBg7lM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fAFMimBg7lM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mr Stump's Dentures - Playthrough Part 1", "description": "Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgExHoGc9Mw\r\n\r\nRecorded my entire playthrough of this freeware game at once using CamStudio, which means no jump cuts!
