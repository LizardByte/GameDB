Another syndicate mech driver so out of his mind on propaganda and combat stims he probably doesn't even remember his own name. Another kill tally for you. The coalition doesn't pay well. But compared to the alternative? You've seen first hand the labor camps and the mass graves. You've seen how the syndicate treats people: not as humans, but as economic cogs to be disposed of when they malfunction. Now the word is out: the big push is about to begin. Everyone knows what that means. Even the greenest-of-green boots know what's at stake and what it's going to cost. No, the coalition doesn't pay well at all. But freedom is its own reward. The syndicate must be destroyed.", "summary": "Iron Assault is a mech action game, designed specifically for GZDoom. It is based loosely on an obscure shooter released by graffiti studios back in the mid nineties. Note that Iron Assault is a re-imagining, not a 1:1 remake of the original.
