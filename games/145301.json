We decided to abandon the standard MMORPG systems and want to show a new vision of game mechanics and interaction with the world. We want show that players completely influence the outcome of the world, where every action, has a consequence, for example, if this is a quest or killing a monster, then the world can change and transform. Only the players decide what the world will be like. You yourself decide to kill someone or make an alliance. In the world of Dragoneila, all animals and monsters have their own thoughts, their views on the world, you can get along with them or start a war, they will become your allies or you want to completely destroy their existence - you decide. We've also removed the usual quest system, making it more interesting. You don't need to complete normal quests or kill monsters to achieve anything in Dragoneila.
