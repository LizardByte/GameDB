Boom format maps that sets out to do exactly what it says on the tin - provide you some fun in an easy, stress-free environment. No evil archvile closets here (although my memory might fail me, it's been a while since I cleaned out those closets); no nasty obstacles to your carefree circlestrafing (watch your step though, I'm not insured); and certainly no revenants (skinny guy in red pants told me, how could he be wrong?). Take a stroll through techbases, temples, aquatic environments and out-there voids, always knowing that even on UV you'll never face anything worse than a slightly spicy HMP Plutonia. Small maps with low monster counts, a restrained texture choice, and occasionally a dash of my personal foibles - puzzles and platforming.
