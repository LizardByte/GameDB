Once the stick is released it will drop to the ground and fall to the other side. If you drop it on top of the previous fallen stick it will slide to the end of that stick then fall. To make things more interesting the sweet spot on the other side is a chicken walking back and forth. Hit the chicken with the end of the stick and you get an additional 2 points plus 1 chicken will be deposited into your account, use those chickens to barter for special characters like Hansen the mischievous boy ninja, black kitty who is simply naughty and does not take losing lightly and the soft hearted panda who cries at the drop of a hat. Before you barter for one of these 3 special characters take them out for a free spin."}
