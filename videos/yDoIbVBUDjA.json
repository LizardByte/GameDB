If you're familiar with the American or European version of this game, you'll notice there are actually quite a few differences from those here in the original release.\n\nThe most obvious change is that text and audio are in Japanese of course, but Orphen's brief intro on the title screen before the game starts is also cut from the English release. The game's title screen features a 3D render of the JP title instead of a flat image, and \"PRESS START\" is also diffrent. The English release also removes subtitles completely and auto-progresses dialogue, while this version has sections where the player is required to press a button to continue conversation. Also, my favorite most ridiculous difference, is that before every battle featuring Orphen, the game's logo appears on screen and then flies away. Very stylish lol\n\nI recorded this playing the game on PCSX2 in 4K with 8x Anisotropic Filtering, Blending Accuracy set to High, and an FXAA shader. It's not all emulation boosts though; this was a good looking game, and still looks great running natively from a PS2 on a CRT or with an upscaler on newer displays.\n\nSorcerous Stabber Orphen (\u9b54\u8853\u58eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3, Majutsushi \u014cfen), also known as Orphen: Scion of Sorcery in NA and EU, is an action role-playing video game for the PlayStation 2. The game was developed by SHADE Inc. co-published by Kadokawa Shoten and ESP in Japan, and released abroad by Activision. Its lore is based on the light novel series Sorcerous Stabber Orphen by Yoshinobu Akita.
