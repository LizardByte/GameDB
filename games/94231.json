Power interests could not be pursued militarily from then on.\n\nThe UFSC's first major operation was the destruction of an asteroid that threatened the planet Earth on August 21, 2018. On that day, the Federation launched a modified long-range missile and successfully destroyed an asteroid threatening a major catastrophe. The rescue served as a demonstration of the UFSC's strength and unity, increasing public confidence in the Federation.\n\nOver the next few years, the Federation built a global defense network known as Overmind. At the core of the network was an intelligent supercomputer - the unique creation of hundreds of the most gifted scientists on the planet. The central computer was under the control of artificial intelligence, and the entire Overmind system consisted of 22 military bases located around the world far from populated areas. The system was self-determining, requiring only the formal approval of each UFSC official to trigger military action.\n\nThe global community, however, bore a heavy burden. People suffering from spiritual emptiness sought refuge in organizations that offered them salvation. The most influential among them was the BEHO-SUNNS sect.\n\nThe charismatic cult leaders used their personal charm and rhetorical skill to lure the standing.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/state-of-war", "videos": [{"id": 102391, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "ZE_1t94Uhh0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE_1t94Uhh0", "title": "State of War - \u010desk\u00e9 intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZE_1t94Uhh0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 102392, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "YmTxN3jaRRI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmTxN3jaRRI", "title": "State of War - slovensk\u00e9 intro hry | SK dabing (2001)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YmTxN3jaRRI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
