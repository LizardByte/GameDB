Game title is in the end of the video.\n\nTnavigator is a emulator app designed for Xbox One/Series models, and Windows 10 PC's. \n\nNot so well know worlwide yet, it has a big base of users in Brazil and Latin America. Started as a personal project from a Brazilian developer who wanted to run PS1/PSX games in his Xbox One.\n\nToday Tnavigator can run up to 52 systems, from Arcade up to Playstation and N64 on Xbox One Models*, and up to Dreamcast, Playstation 2, PSP, Game Cube and Wii on Xbox Series S/X Models and Windows 10 based PC's.\n(*Despite XBox One models cant handle more powerful systems like Dreamcast, PSP, PS2, GameCube and Wii, still some games from these systems can run surprisingly well. I tried Def Jam (PSP), Capcom vs SNK 2 (PS2) and Carrier (Dreamcast) with good performance.\n\nTnavigator currently has more than 24000 game roms available to download and play in less than a couple minutes. You basically just download and play, no need to spend time importing roms, or setting up anything. And if you cant find a specific rom in Tnavigator, you can import by Flash Drive from your Xbox USB using File manager and import feature in Tnavigator.\n\nPlease check it out the demonstration and users reviews here: https://youtu.be/kIq8Y9hTFRw\n\nYou can see how the installation works here: https://youtu.be/WXIds986Mfw\nCheck it out the Playstation Library available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2BYu2wZRhg&list=PL6DWP4mBc8pSfvgCbgSvB1eEoU68AWBrF&index=12\n\nCheck it out the Nintendo 64 Library available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnOxoIYYSg4&list=PL6DWP4mBc8pSfvgCbgSvB1eEoU68AWBrF&index=11\n\nSee more Tnavigator videos and performance tests here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\nYou can reach us by the email below if you want to purchase the Tnavigator: thevideogameclerk@gmail.com\n\nAnd if you have any questions, let us know in the comment section below :)\n\nCheck it out more Nintendo Wii Games here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOfEpnLFkJIap1sr-kGaURlgFUaoMCHRV", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qfXfP8H3sjI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qfXfP8H3sjI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qfXfP8H3sjI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qfXfP8H3sjI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qfXfP8H3sjI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hooked!
