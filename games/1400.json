The game includes over 170 puzzles. \nProfessor Layton and the Last Specter also includes an additional role-playing game entitled Professor Layton's London Life, available from the start of the game. London Life, in which players interact with various characters from the series in a town called \"Little London\", was advertised to contain over 100 hours of content. London Life was removed from the European versions of the game in order to prevent a significant delay of the game's release for translation.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "characters": [{"id": 1640, "name": "Voice Actor"}]}
