They knew it had to be a first-rate story with sophisticated graphics. The result was Dragon Wars.\n\nSailing across uncharted seas, you and your party are in search of a legendary paradise called Dilmun \u2014 a place where the streets are paved with gold and no one wants for anything.\n\nHowever, King Drake of Phoebus has declared all magic illegal - magickers have been slain or fled into exile. In retaliation, enemy islands have threatened to unleash their guardian dragons, the most destructive force in the world. While docked at a harbor in Dilmun, you are arrested on suspicion of spellcasting.\n\nImprisoned and stripped of everything but your wits, you are sentenced to life in a cesspool called Purgatory. Magic is your only salvation - a worldly possession in a world possessed.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 30956, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "lpsOP9rFeiQ"}]}
