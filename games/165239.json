Recommended to unwind and for stress relief.\n\nWatch the sparks, little arrows, dash around and transform the colors of geometric shapes as they collide with them. Create more, merge them into stronger ones, purchase upgrades and unlock more stuff as the game gradually unfolds, while numbers rise into the gazillions and beyond.\n\nRelaxing and stress-free. There is no competition and no direct challenge, you will explore and progress in your own pace, at your own time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zen-shards"}
