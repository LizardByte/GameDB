The expansive world tour features an in-depth leader-board and sports commentary, or if you prefer to free surf, you can just cruise the massive locations instead. Pump control uses the wave\u2019s power so you can surf faster and unlock more moves. More speed = more moves! Pump, smash that lip, get sooo barreled and launch airs from waves that barrel, peak, break left, right, or just foam crumble. Control the weather! Use your sick weather tool to directly impact how you play. So create any surf conditions you want using the amazing weather tool that impacts conditions in real-time. A legit soundtrack including Smoking Martha, Kilns, Oly Sherman, Wing Defence, Mesmeriser and Bad Pony - distinctive music that blends well with BL Pro Surfing\u2019s worldwide vibe and fluid physics-based control mechanics. Tour Modes, Free Surf, Trick Challenges \u2013 endless hours of challenges and replay-ability.
