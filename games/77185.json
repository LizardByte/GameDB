The player controls a small man (or creature?) that does not stop rhythmically bouncing, though the player can control the height of the jumps. The object is to collect the correct musical note, displayed at the bottom of the screen, while avoiding floating musical instruments. Once the correct notes have been collected, a large note must be acquired near the top of the level. Grabbing that large note starts a song, during which the player can collect the remaining musical notes and instruments on screen for extra points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thwocker", "videos": [{"id": 45095, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JoRZowl0d68", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoRZowl0d68", "title": "Thwocker - Activision Anthology - Sony PlayStation 2 - VGDB", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JoRZowl0d68/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
