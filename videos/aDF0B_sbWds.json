After having joined the Extra Coin program, they both permanently connected to the virtual world, abandoning their earthly existences. Mika unwittingly discovers that the medallion given to her by her grandfather before his death has the power to reveal the identity of users in The Arcade, violating one of the three rules of the social network but bringing obscure secrets to light. \n\nExtra Coin will allow players to not only to experience the events facing Mika inside the social network, but also to live and explore the dynamics of The Arcade by building your own character, with hundreds of possibilities for customization in appearance and features, and by forging different individual game styles. Every user inside the social network will have their followers, who will act like in-game currency (spendable only after having satisfied certain quirks and needs) and will inevitably affect your decisions.\n\nExtra Coin will be available within the first half of 2021 on PC and consoles. Follow its development right away on Steam, or by joining the Discord server, to get the chance to play an exclusive beta version that will be available soon.\n\nFollow CINIC Games:\nhttps://twitter.com/CINICGames\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cinicgames/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cinicgames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDF0B_sbWds/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDF0B_sbWds/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDF0B_sbWds/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDF0B_sbWds/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDF0B_sbWds/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Extra Coin - Announcement Trailer", "description": "Wishlist now: https://bit.ly/2RTPZWr\nJoin our Discord Server: https://discord.gg/5Kb7ZYR\nOfficial Website: https://bit.ly/33W1MsR\n\nYou are invited to join The Arcade, the virtual existence where you can finally become someone.\n\nExtra Coin is an adventure game set within a virtual social network called \u201cThe Arcade\u201d, following Mika's journey through its mysterious places in search of her lost parents.\n\n2066, city of Hangzhou \u2013 Mika Wattson, left alone in the world after the death of her grandfather, decides to register at The Arcade, the hated social network that ripped her parents away from her.
