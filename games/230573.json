The sequel includes tougher enemies, multiple paths, and new hats. In addition to wanderers, players can now use Play Coins to hire up to three previously encountered Miis. In battle, similarly colored Miis can form teams to perform stronger combo attacks and spells. Play Coins can also be spent to use potions for various uses, such as clearing a room of gas. There is also a third secret quest that adds more difficulty to the StreetPass Quest II / Find Mii II maps that provides an additional set of hats that the player can win.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
