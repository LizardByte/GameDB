After winning a \"Galactic Bishoujo Contest\", she becomes \"The Savior of Light\", a magical girl charged with defending the universe from evil. After becoming \"The Savior of Light\", Yuna gains an impressively powerful armored suit. Her greatest strength, however, lies in her ability to befriend anyone, even her enemies. Her group of comrades (which is extensive) is comprised almost exclusively of former opponents.\n\nGalaxy Fr\u00e4ulein Yuna is digital comic game (visual novel type). The game has no game over (can infinitely continue) or bad ending, similar to story-telling digital comic books or interactive movies. Move somewhere, talk with somebody, then fight against the 13 Fr\u00e4uleins of Darkness. Combat scenes are played out in turn-based RPG style, but there is no EXP or items \u2013 only attack or defence.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzxHKbKxYksgRJbG8-w59E7Q9R-lIPfDa\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Game_Curiosity", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2VWr4dQXXUU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2VWr4dQXXUU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2VWr4dQXXUU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2VWr4dQXXUU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2VWr4dQXXUU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna (PCE CD) \u2014 Playthrough (\u9280\u6cb3\u304a\u5b22\u69d8\u4f1d\u8aac\u30e6\u30ca)", "description": "Galaxy Fr\u00e4ulein Yuna | \u9280\u6cb3\u304a\u5b22\u69d8\u4f1d\u8aac\u30e6\u30ca\nDeveloper: Hudson, Red Company, Will\nGenre: Adventure\nReleased: 1992\nPlatform: PC Engine Super CD-ROM2\n\nDescription from Wikipedia/Mobygames:\nYuna Kagurazaka is a somewhat ditzy 16-year old girl.
