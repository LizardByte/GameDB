The project was about to be scrapped, but the Blackwood corporation offered to help. They proposed using one of Ariadne\u2019s clusters to calculate a more efficient design.\n\nBoson Shipyard enthusiastically accepted the offer, and after the revision performed by Ariadne, the \u201cShrike\u201d ship performed at the level of modern cover frigates. Instead of the usual phase shield, the ship was fitted with a unique special module that creates a plasma field around the ship and pours energy into it to the point of reaching instability. The collapse of the plasma field at this point causes massive electromagnetic damage to all targets in the vicinity.\n\nOfficial website: https://star-conflict.com\nTwitch channel: https://www.twitch.tv/starconflicten \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarConflict/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/starconflicten \nSteam: http://steamcommunity.com/app/212070", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_UE5UxB7MAQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_UE5UxB7MAQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_UE5UxB7MAQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_UE5UxB7MAQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_UE5UxB7MAQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Star Conflict: Shrike", "description": "By 4622, a prototype frigate with a code name \u201cShrike\u201d had been developed.
