You can battle these creatures by shooting ' Burper Sparkies' and 'Blaster Sparkies' at them. These projectiles can be replenished by eating 'Spindles', of which there are 50 scattered about the map. The ultimate goal is to find a Disk Drive which will allow Fat Worm to create a clone and end the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fat-worm-blows-a-sparky"}
