Together with advanced genetic engineering, this central birthing canal is capable of producing an army of lethal genetically mutated insects.\nNitrous Oxide, a pollutant by-product emitted inside The Torus, provides a high octane fuel for your Tunnel Runner, but unfortunately it also provides the perfect breeding environment for the secretly incubating species.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/n2o-nitrous-oxide"}
