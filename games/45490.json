The player is part of the crew sent to the Amazon's last known location to find out what happened.\n\nCreature Shock is a first-person shooter with Full Motion Video and arcade-like elements. Aliens of all sizes and types will try to destroy the team, but each one has a weak point that can be exploited. The fighting takes place on the surface of asteroids and within mazes of passageways underground.\n\nThere are also two 3D sections where the player gets to pilot the ship.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/creature-shock-special-edition"}
