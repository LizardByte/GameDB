Hundreds of years have passed, so much time that no one really knows how old the Mother Hub is. Generations have been born and died, over and over again. Wars have been fought, technology has been created and lost. A dark age is upon us, one in which the scraps of humanity must hold together or be extinguished.\n\nA mysterious illness has effected a large majority of the population including your mother. As each day passed she becomes weaker. A glimmer of hope is shown to Thea of a potential cure developed in the distant past. That hope is shrouded in shadow, within the depths of \"Dark Zone\"; the unfinished horrifying sections of the lower Mother Hub that were never fully developed and remain as a skeleton holding secrets of the past.\n\nDescend and find out what happened to the Hub, figure out and master unique weaponry. Make choices and choose your own path, survive and save your mother, as well as all of humanity.\n\nInspired by: Deadspace, Half-Life, Fallout, System Shock, Halo, Doom 3.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqgERzlWvrU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqgERzlWvrU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqgERzlWvrU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqgERzlWvrU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nqgERzlWvrU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mother Hub Official Trailer", "description": "If you like wishlist here: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1480990/Mother_Hub/\nBeta in February 2022\n\nThe Story: \nAll humanity is diminished to a single vault.
