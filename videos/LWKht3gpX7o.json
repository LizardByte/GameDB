{"id": "LWKht3gpX7o", "snippet": {"title": "Aztech Forgotten Gods -  Official Announcement Trailer", "description": "Aztech: Forgotten Gods, the Latinx-Futurism cyberstone colossus fighter from award-winning Mulaka developers Lienzo, debuted at Nintendo\u2019s Indie World. Aztech: Forgotten Gods will launch on Nintendo Switch, Xbox One + Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 + 5, and PC later this year.\n\nIn Aztech\u2019s alternate history, European powers never arrived on the shores of ancient Mesoamerica. The Aztec Empire\u2019s capital Tenochtitlan has thrived for centuries as a stone metropolis, technologically advanced yet heavily rooted in the ways of those indigenous to the land. Yet the gods of their past, like the feathered serpent deity Quetzalcoatl or Mictlantechutli, Lord of the Underworld, faded into distant memories. Until now.\n\nSoon-to-be heroine Achtli joins her archeologist mother Nantsin on an unsanctioned dig. While searching for ancient knowledge that could help all of society, they inadvertently cause an explosion and awaken stone colossi hellbent on destroying the city. Achtli crawls out of the rubble to discover two new things: her prosthetic arm\u2019s been replaced with a stone artifact, and there\u2019s someone in her head named Tez claiming his own divinity.\n\nJoin the unlikely duo on their quest to crush colossi and discover why the gods disappeared so long ago. Battle massive bosses while wielding Achtli\u2019s new gauntlet as a makeshift jetpack and devastating weapon all in one. Soar through the sky, run on walls, grind on rails, and bring the pantheon to their knees with stone-crushing strikes. Upgrade the gauntlet with Nantsin\u2019s help to earn new abilities from plasma-based projectiles to energy shields. \n\nExplore Tenochtitlan with Achtli\u2019s incredible newfound agility and strength. Encounter optional side stories, unlock new outfits, and upgrade passive abilities by completing secondary challenges in the hub-world. Become the city\u2019s savior with an adrenaline-fueled soundtrack that fuses metal with traditional Aztec instruments.
