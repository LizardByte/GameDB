It was certainly one of the most exciting times in American history. Gold Rush! includes the three routes tens of thousands took to the gold regions. Become Jerrod Wilson and experience each trek as you travel from New York to California.\n\nWhichever route you decide to take, you will see many historical sights. Try going overland across the Great Plains and huge mountain ranges, crossing the Isthmus of Panama, or rounding Cape Horn on the tip of South America. If you survive and arrive at Sutter\u2019s Fort, the adventure is still only half over! Many other puzzles remain to be solved before you achieve your goals in California.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
