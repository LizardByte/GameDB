You can play either as a teenager boy or a teenager girl, named by the player. The two scenarios are very similar and basically follow the same story: you live in modern-day Tokyo and one day discover a strange symbol in an old storehouse. As a result, you are transported to medieval Japan. You encounter the half-demon Inuyasha, who introduces you to Kagome Higurashi, the heroine of the anime series. Together you embark on a journey to retrieve scattered pieces of the Sacred Jewel and to find a way to get back home.\n\nThis is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from over-the-shoulder perspective. You can attack physically, use special techniques, and power up to combo attacks with multiple characters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 81032, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ksTI73ZpDHI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksTI73ZpDHI", "title": "Inuyasha: The Secret of The Cursed Mask (PS2 Gameplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ksTI73ZpDHI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
