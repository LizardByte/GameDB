A robot whose mission is to bomb the maze to its foundations; a time-stopping time traveller that seems haunted by its past; a talented escapist that will force you to think with portals; a psychic girl willing to prove to her tribe that she\u2019s just as capable as the boys\u2026 but at what price?\n\nAll of the characters add their own twist to the game experience thanks to their unique abilities. A specific floor may be almost impossible with one character and incredibly easy with another. So you can strategize which character may be the best fit for each level... or just play with the one that fits your playstyle the best!\n\nBut be prepared for a Maze that\u2019s dangerously equipped to destroy you, as it packs a myriad of creatures, bosses, and mini-bosses. You must traverse all the mazes with their unique architectures and visual styles, fighting or avoiding the monsters while looking for the key that will open the door to the next maze. Luckily, the Maze holds some helpful power-ups too!", "summary": "Mazeman is a game that will challenge you big time thanks to its frantic pace: enter the maze and look for the key while avoiding all kinds of dreadful monsters.
