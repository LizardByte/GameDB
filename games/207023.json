The frantic action takes place in a candy factory filled with twisting conveyor belts transporting a mix of 14 confection types. The goal is to eliminate groups of three or more by launching specific candies toward matching treats. Twists on the familiar theme include ricocheting candy off barriers and firing the sweets from a choice of launchers within each stage. Two play modes (Arcade and Story) offer slightly different objectives as you attempt to clear 70 luscious levels and save the fructose-filled factory from closing down.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sweetopia", "videos": [{"id": 118121, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1KUOJsW8iws", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KUOJsW8iws", "title": "Sweetopia", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1KUOJsW8iws/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
