Featuring the character design of Akira Toriyama, the Father of \"Dragon Ball Z\", and music by Nobuo Uematsu, the composer for Final Fantasy, Blue Dragon is an epic role-playing game (RPG) centered on five youngsters who possess miraculous strength and magical power to control shadow creatures that mirror the actions of their masters.\"\n\nBlue Dragon follows the story of five friends (Shu, Jiro, Kluke, Zola, and Marumaro) as they travel across the world to confront Nene, the evil ruler of the Grand Kingdom. The setting inspired separate anime and manga adaptations, although these follow the story to different degrees and feature a different cast of characters. The game follows a traditional role-playing design, based around exploration and turn-based combat.\n\nThe gameplay of Blue Dragon uses turn-based gameplay elements seen in older Japanese role-playing video games. The game world contains two major types of areas: towns, in which the player can rest and purchase items, and dungeon-like areas, with numerous foes to be defeated.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blue-dragon", "videos": [{"id": 32196, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sdcpc8zSsGk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdcpc8zSsGk", "title": "Blue Dragon Xbox 360 Trailer - TGS Trailer (High Quality)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sdcpc8zSsGk/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119188, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rb1hay7E2JI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb1hay7E2JI", "title": "Blue Dragon Xbox 360 Trailer - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rb1hay7E2JI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
