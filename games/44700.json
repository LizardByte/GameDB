I features 30 German songs which are meant to be consumed along with a lot of alcohol. There are no changes to the gameplay formula: player(s) sing into a microphone and the game gives points based on the performance. The only basis of assessment is if the correct note is hit with the correct timeing; the sung words or octave does not play into the result.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/singstar-mallorca-party", "collections": [{"id": 592, "name": "SingStar"}]}
