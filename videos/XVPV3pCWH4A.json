The initial release pre-dated Schmalz' Digital Extremes name. The game is played seen from a 2D top-down view within a scrollable window with plain raster graphics in 320x240. It was noted for being programmed entirely in x86 assembly language for MS-DOS systems. The music was composed with Scream Tracker 3 and was converted to the custom PSM format.\n\nThe game was originally distributed on floppy disks in 3 separate packs of 4 tables each. The original shareware version (and an early retail version) included only the original \"Android\" table. Later shareware versions and retail versions contained an updated version called \"Super Android\" (although it's still referred to as \"Android\" in the game, the table was changed to say \"Super Android\")\n\nIn 1993, the first registered game included only the first two pinball packs. The following year, xLand Games distributed that very version under the title \"Fliper\".\n\nIn 1994, the \"Crash & Burn\" and \"Deep Sea\" tables were released as individual games by B&N Software and it's child company Strange Ranger.\n\nIn 1995, all three packs plus the exclusive \"African Safari\" were released on CD.\n\nIn 2011, the game was partially re-made by Fuse Powered Inc. for Apple's iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad platforms. The game, re-titled as \"Retro Pinball\", features updated versions of the Super Android, Crash and Burn and Pangaea tables.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNostalgic value for retrogamers in the Highest HD quality you can find on Youtube!
