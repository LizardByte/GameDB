The project was led by Bridgeburner56 and based around the idea of pairing up mappers for each of the levels in the set, but also having the pairs be randomly chosen: the result was a total of 30 mappers, for 15 regular maps + 1 hub map. Each mapper was given free reign on what to build and what settings to utilize, the only rules being that the project had to be tested in GZDoom and that only a handful of liquid fall textures and new skies would be used as far as new graphics go, with everything else being stock Doom 1 and Doom 2 assets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-mapwich"}
