This lasts for about 15\u201320 seconds. The player has three lives and accumulates points for each furry killed. There are also OpenFeint and Game Center leaderboards and achievements.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/minigore", "videos": [{"id": 17006, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "k1OL_zrENbg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1OL_zrENbg", "title": "Minigore Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k1OL_zrENbg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
