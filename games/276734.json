In a land ruled by a monarchy for generations, humans lived in peace and tranquility. That is, until the dawn of the day the world was dyed red.\n\nOn that day, vampires laid waste to Hemeria. They preyed on, devoured, and devastated its inhabitants. A great many people would go on to mourn their loved ones, their families and friends, for the rest of their lives. One particular town of Hemeria bore such a tragedy. A single girl was left alone in despair and disgrace. She vowed revenge, and grew into one of Hemeria's finest vampire hunters.\n\nAnd one day, she became a member of the Elpis 7; those who inspired a light of hope in its people.\n\nOne day, she receives a letter from an unknown sender. Upon her arrival to the mansion indicated inside, she finds vampire hunters and a royal knight awaiting her. The hunters assembled receive an order from the monarch.\n\nThey are to form a squad and invade Nyx, the world of vampires. A shiver of anticipation crackles through her at the opportunity she's been waiting for her whole life. However, this is but the beginning of a game wherein the fate of her world is at stake. Pawns are sent forth, discarded, hidden out of sight...\n\nAnd just how many will remain when this all comes to an end?", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-red-bells-lament--1", "videos": [{"id": 133782, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "anyE3Mhwh0s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anyE3Mhwh0s", "title": "Project Code Vampire Hunter Nintendo Switch\u2122 Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/anyE3Mhwh0s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 133783, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "xaQANU4VNUM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQANU4VNUM", "title": "The Red Bell's Lament for Nintendo Switch\u2122 - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xaQANU4VNUM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
