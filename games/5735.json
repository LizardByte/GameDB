The licensed soundtrack includes music by Andrew W.K., Kool Keith, the Insane Clown Posse, Bad Brains, Body Count, Six and Violence, Mudvayne, Saliva, Fall Out Boy, and Hoobastank. It was developed by Paradox Development, now owned by Midway Games, and was published by Eidos Interactive.\n\nThe television commercial included Insane Clown Posse, Vampiro, New Jack, and Major Gunns. Despite promises of an improved gameplay experience, the game was a critical flop when released in 2004. Its sales numbers remained respectable, however, moving nearly 300,000 copies through 2005.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/backyard-wrestling-2-there-goes-the-neighborhood"}
