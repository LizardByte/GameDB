It is the sequel to Wow Entertainment's Racing Game Sega GT, released in 2002. The game was originally intended to be released for the Dreamcast, but when the Dreamcast was discontinued in 2001, the game was reprogrammed for the Xbox. Following its initial release as a retail game, it was given away on a disk with Jet Set Radio Future in specially-marked Xbox console packages. Sega released Sega GT Online for the following year, with extra cars and an online facility to be used with the Xbox Live. Despite being an Xbox exclusive, the franchise would later die off and as a result, the Forza Motorsport series would later come to Xbox starting in 2005, and would later have sequels to counter the Gran Turismo franchise.\n\nSega GT 2002 introduced plenty of innovative features, many of which were later adopted by future games of its kind.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-gt-2002", "videos": [{"id": 47251, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jykcA1ELkVA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jykcA1ELkVA", "title": "Sega GT 2002 - Trailer - OXM 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jykcA1ELkVA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47252, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Xop0oQiGPxM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xop0oQiGPxM", "title": "Playthrough [Xbox] Sega GT 2002", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xop0oQiGPxM/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4591, "name": "Sega GT"}]}
