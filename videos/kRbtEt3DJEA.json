In each scenario, both success and failure both progress the story, meaning you've got one chance per day to try and lead a normal life. However, when reexperiencing these days again, you may find that the house is not the same as it once was and may have more secrets and trials to throw Wicke's way than what was once thought...\n\nI've been hard at work on this solo project, and I'd love if you played it and tell me if you enjoy it!
