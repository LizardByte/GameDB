Somewhat of a sequel to \"Village of Dread\".\n\nThis is considered Steve Rescoe's finest map by many.\n\nThe map was featured on the RockPaperShotgun's \"Quake Renaissance: a short history of 25 years of Quake modding\" article.\n\nThe map name is taken from a horror-occult short story by author H.P. Lovecraft, main inspiration for the Quake game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 66355, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tzLsP2TFxP8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzLsP2TFxP8", "title": "Quake - Shadow over Innsmouth", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzLsP2TFxP8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
