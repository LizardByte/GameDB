But no one knows that a catastrophe could happen that day. An evil, tyrannical, purple tentacle wants to take over the world. On this seemingly wonderful morning, our well-known protagonist, Bernard, renowned physicist and chemist, wakes up muddled. He still doesn't know that on this day he has to prove that he is a genius and has not, like so many others, studied in vain. But he's starting to remember the Purple Tentacle's visit and their argument about world domination, which ended with a cup of tea, his heavy, drooping eyelids and Purple Tentacle's malicious grin.\n\nHe is locked in his bedroom with many puzzles provided by Purple Tentacle to challenge and prevent him.\n\nHelp Bernard to solve these challenging puzzles, because with each solved puzzle he gets a little closer to the key that opens the door and thus also to the means created in his laboratory with which he can save the world from conquest. Solve logical, amusing and motivating puzzles that challenge not only Bernard, but YOU as well.\n\nInspired by Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle and Maniac Mansion Mania.\nHumorous game that combines point and click adventures with escape room tasks.\nWith many allusions to all adventures by LucasArts.\nVarious types of puzzles, from classic inventory usage to brain teasers.\nYou will find out the result of your performance at the end of the game: very good, good, satisfactory or bad.\nAnd the best at the end: it costs nothing! It helps curb inflation!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/challenge-of-the-tentacle", "videos": [{"id": 74857, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HWlRWg3jFB8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWlRWg3jFB8", "title": "Challenge of the Tentacle - Trailer [English] Point and Click Adventure Puzzle Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWlRWg3jFB8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
