You soon realize that you're wrong, however, and you'll need all of your skills to deal with 384 screens of spookiness. \n \nIt's an arcade adventure, with ghosts to avoid as they cause your character to fall off course, sometimes down a screen or two. Collecting bugs and beetles allows you to use one of the cauldrons to produce spells to kill enemies. You have 4 minutes on each life, although more can be picked up from the many egg-timers around the screens. The game keeps track of your 'Scaredyness factor' and adjusts the game difficulty to help struggling players accordingly. \n \nThe eventual target is to collect items to turn into letters - earning enough of these allows you to play a Hangman game against the 'spooky old man'.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
