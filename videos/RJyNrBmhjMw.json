The new character was on display for the first time this past weekend inside the DEAD OR ALIVE Festival in Tokyo.\n\nNiCO, known as \u201cThe Lightning Technomancer\u201d is a practitioner of Pencak Silat, a historic martial art of Southeast Asia. She employs powerful plasma discharges in her attacks, boosting her Pencak Silat strikes to another level, while at the same time using her EMF Rings to move at ultrahigh rates of speed.\n\nJoining NiCO in the latest reveal is Helena\u2019s half-sister, Kokoro. A master of Ba Ji Quan, Kokoro uses a combination of elbow and palm thrusts to compliment an array of throws aimed at destroying her opponent\u2019s balance. Graceful, yet powerful, Kokoro\u2019s fighting style incorporates the hard and soft elements that represent the spirit she has refined through her maiko training. \n\nAlso returning is La Mariposa, who excels at aerial attacks, also known as \u201cThe immortal butterfly\u201d. Under the mask, however, the professional wrestler is really Lisa Hamilton, who was a DOATEC researcher, at one time conducted experiments on the ninja Hayate, and although it was rumored that she had retired after the 5th Tournament, La Mariposa is back, deadlier than ever.  \n\n[New Stages]\nZero - A research facility built by M.I.S.T. highleted by shattered glass and freefalls.\nMIYABI | The Hidden Garden - A quiet Japanese town surrounded by bamboo.
