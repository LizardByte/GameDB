Discover a myriad of randomly chosen stages, from the desolate forest to the frozen tundra. \n\nGames with roguelike elements have recently had a large jump in popularity. However, most players find roguelikes hard to jump into: it is usually exceedingly complex in UI and game rules. Risk of Rain aims to revitalize the genre with stylized graphics and an intuitive gameplay scheme that teaches itself, rather than having to be taught. \n\nThe three main goals for our game are simple: \n\n1.
