It is said that the Sword of Dynasty has fallen into the hands of a cruel and ruthless fighting warlord known only as S. Geist and that he seeks to gain full control over the world by releasing an ancient sealed beast known only as the Earth Dragon so that he can harness its tremendous yet terrible power and become an unstoppable force. Eight warriors have set out to find the Sword of Dynasty for their own personal reasons, having no idea that their paths will cross with each other and that their own battles will determine the fate of the world itself.", "summary": "Asura Blade: Sword of Dynasty is Fuuki's first of two attempts at making a one-on-one 2D fighting game; its sequel, Asura Buster, is the second. The story revolves around the search for the eponymous Sword of Dynasty in a war-torn world.\n\nThe game features eight playable characters, as well as two boss characters, only briefly usable in single-player mode using codes. It uses a simple three-button control scheme and sticks to more basic motion inputs for its roster's special moves, for greater accessibility. Its colorful visuals and detailed background art take inspiration from contemporary entries in the Darkstalkers and Street Fighter Alpha series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/asura-blade-sword-of-dynasty", "videos": [{"id": 89880, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XcFIwA4GMOg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFIwA4GMOg", "title": "Asura Blade - Sword of Dynasty (Japan) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XcFIwA4GMOg/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8793, "name": "Asura"}]}
