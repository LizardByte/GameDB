If you lose your sanity and get distracted by some beautiful landscape... Ah, your days are numbered. Find the exit, and preferably be alive.\nExplore a Lonely World, Alone. Or with Unpleasant Company.\n\nALP makes the world of Backrooms more solitary, and a little relaxing.\nRun Wherever You Want, Even To Secret Places.\n\nNo one will disturb you, unless you go where you shouldn't.\nAbout Our Game.\n\nALP (A Liminal Place) is being created by only one person, Hazard. I was inspired by several creators, such as Vini Cortez, DCE, Valentin, and Many others. I've always dreamed of creating Backrooms games.
