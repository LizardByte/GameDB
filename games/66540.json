Room Zoom puts you in the driver's seat of toy cars to race through every room in the house, including a spooky lab and a hidden tomb, both online and offline. In each room you'll find objects to push, bump, or blow up; power-ups to defend against aggressive drivers; and secret passages. Eight interactive environments, with unrestricted driving areas and hidden features, make each race an adventure."}
