Thanks to everyone who's played the sim, given feedback and helped Tom as he's gotten things to this point. Here's the release trailer.\n\nYou can wishlist Ecosystem on Steam now, and play the demo: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133120/Ecosystem/\n\nWe will soon be running a short beta (with limited functionality) for it for performance /crash feedback. If you'd like to participate in that, you can register your interest to do so using the below form. Sign up here: https://forms.gle/3QGLvcwtETCdsoMS7\n\n======================================\nEcosystem is a god-game/simulation hybrid in which players design aspects of their underwater ecosystem - from the terrain composition and where the currents run to the placement of individual species of plant and fish within the world. Once the player has made these choices, the simulation takes over to help the plants and fish grow and evolve over time. \n\nThe underlying technology of Ecosystem means that it isn't just a video game version of the laws of ecology with pre-made fish models. The simulation actually determines the creatures in the game: their bodies, how they swim, and how they think and behave. All the creatures in the trailer evolved on their own in the game; none were hand-edited!\n\nWebsite: http://www.ecosystem-game.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ecosystemgame/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/EcosystemGame\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/dyHnugt", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diOH8eEhHtk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diOH8eEhHtk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diOH8eEhHtk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diOH8eEhHtk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/diOH8eEhHtk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ecosystem - Launch Trailer", "description": "Ecosystem now has a date for its early access release - March 16th 2021!
