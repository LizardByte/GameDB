Wake up Pikachu each day by shouting \"Good Morning!\" and decide what games to play and activities to engage in. You can play Pok\u00e9mon trivia on the in-game TV, gather food, hunt for treasure, collect seemingly endless goodies, go fishing, baby-sit Caterpie, and much more.

As you bond and converse with your cartoon pal you'll investigate the Ochre Woods, head for the campground, check out Bulbasaur's picnic, and even solve clever puzzles.
