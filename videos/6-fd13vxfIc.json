We got you covered.\n\nSaddle the horses! See your kingdom come to life, fight gripping battles to defend it and still be done in time for lunch.\n\nWith Thronefall we tried to strip a classic strategy game from all unnecessary complexity, combining it with some healthy hack and slay. Build up your base during the day, defend it til your last breath at night.\n\nWill you be able to strike the right balance between economy and defence? Do you need more archers, thicker walls or an additional mill? Will you keep the enemies at bay with your longbow or charge your horse right into them? It's going to be a tough night, but nothing beats seeing the sun rise above your little kingdom to live another day.\n\nEnjoy! :)\n\n#thronefall #indiegame #trailer", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-fd13vxfIc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-fd13vxfIc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-fd13vxfIc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-fd13vxfIc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6-fd13vxfIc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Thronefall - Official Trailer (Coming Summer 2023!)", "description": "\u27a4 Play the Demo on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239150/Thronefall/\nWishlist Thronefall on Steam so you get a reminder when the game comes out! :)\n\nMore links:\n\u27a4 Join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/gVYctptyg8\n\u27a4 Watch the full development on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4mYGYhyS-A&list=PLgsD7taGtaBhNaErAOaiEiTzt6-lOpVp0\n\u27a4 Press Kit: https://press.futurefriendsgames.com/thronefall\n\nThronefall is a minimalist game about building and defending your little kingdom.\n\nYou're looking for a strategy game without all the headache?
