If it had been released before Midway Games' Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed, it would have been the first officially licensed indoor american football game by the Arena Football League. Adopting the more faster and frantic style of play from the sport compared to american football, players would have the choice of playing across any of the game modes available against with either CPU-controlled opponents or other players, while including all the rules and teams from the 1995 Arena Football League season including the Miami Hooters, who make their only game appearance in the title and were not included in Electronic Arts' Arena Football. Originally conceived in 1993, the game was announced in early 1994 and showcased at SCES '94 but the project would be later cancelled in 1995 after various delays and expenses, despite being close to completion. Although unreleased, a playable prototype has since been released and sold online by independent groups such as the defunct Jaguar Sector II website and later B&C Computervisions.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arena-football-95"}
