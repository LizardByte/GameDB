The player drives a sports car which must reach various checkpoints without running out of fuel. A turbo mode (activated by the gear shift) increases the car's speed but uses more fuel and puts the player at a higher risk of hitting an obstacle. Fuel power-ups can be found on the road which the player must pick up to make it to the final checkpoint.\n\nThe original title RF2 is a reference to Konami's 1984 arcade game Road Fighter, and thus this may be considered an unofficial sequel. RF2 was a commercial success in Japanese arcades. The series was followed in 1996 by official sequel Midnight Run - Road Fighter 2.\n\nKonami GT was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on October 6, 2010.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/konami-gt", "videos": [{"id": 104755, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "YpVxqr5247I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpVxqr5247I", "title": "Konami RF2 - Red Fighter (Konami 1985)  Attract Mode 60fps", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YpVxqr5247I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
