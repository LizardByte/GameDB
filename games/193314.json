A new area has been added in the Woods of Light called Globox Village, where the player can access new minigames by collecting Globox Crystals. This is the first version of Rayman 2 to allow for widescreen and the only version where the aspect ratio can manually be changed. The Hall of Doors has been replaced by the Isle of Doors. Several more Robo-Pirates have been added as well as a new type which shoots bombs. This is also the first version to have the cutscene in the Prison Ship where Rayman frees the prisoners, which was cut from the original versions due to time constraints.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-2-the-great-escape--2", "videos": [{"id": 88381, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kCdO5KBbEuA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCdO5KBbEuA", "title": "Rayman 2:  The Great Escape - Trailer (1999)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kCdO5KBbEuA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88382, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "anfcXWML24w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anfcXWML24w", "title": "Longplay of Rayman 2: The Great Escape", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/anfcXWML24w/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 206, "name": "Rayman"}]}
