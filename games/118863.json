Command a force of Blood Angels Space Marine Terminators through the winding corridors of The Forsaken Doom in Space Hulk: Tactics, or get closer to the action in first-person shooter Space Hulk: Deathwing - Enhanced Edition. \n \nTactics updates the classic Space Hulk board game, adding new rules, mechanics, units, weapons, and more to give a deep, strategic experience in this turn-based tactics game. Face off against other players in multiplayer, create your own maps and customise squads, or experience an original story in massive single-player Genestealer and Blood Angel campaigns. \n \nDeathwing is a violent, merciless, and action-packed squad-based FPS. With your allies in tow, battle through endless Genestealer swarms as you clear deck by deck, room by room, and bloody battle by bloody battle. Choose your class, weapon, squadmates, and much more in single-player or co-op."}
