Lured by the promise of delicious Willow, help Cotton confront the wicked demon, Tweed, and his legions of followers who have stolen the Legendary Willow from the enchanting land of York Country. Hop on your broomstick and go to town in this wacky adventure!\n\nRainbow Cotton features exciting gameplay reminiscent of its predecessor, the classic game Panorama Cotton. The game takes you on an arcade-inspired journey through a fantastic world full of surprises and challenges. Every stage in Rainbow Cotton is guarded by peculiar bosses that puts your skills to the test. Collect power-ups, build up your flashy projectiles, and hurl them at colorful enemies. Use powerful magic attacks to clear the screen with fireballs and lightning. Only the most courageous (or stubborn, Willow-obsessed!) witches will prevail!\n\nThe charming 3D graphics will leave you mesmerized as you travel through, for example, a cozy moonlit town draped in Christmas lights, a mysterious sunken forest, and a magical castle above the clouds!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rainbow-cotton--1", "videos": [{"id": 110415, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bExfpAE0Lcg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bExfpAE0Lcg", "title": "Rainbow Cotton: A Mini-Guide to Re-Releases!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bExfpAE0Lcg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
