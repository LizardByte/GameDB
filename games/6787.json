It is the first title in the Double Dragon franchise.\n\nThe player character has a repertoire of martial arts techniques which they can perform using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques range from basic punches and kicks to more elaborate manoeuvres like hair-grabbing moves and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. Caution should be taken, though, as some enemies can do the same thing to the players. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.\n\nThere is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face through the course of the game. Certain enemies carry melee weapons, which can be knocked out of their hands and picked up to use against them. Available weapons include baseball bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite; in addition, rocks, oil drums, and boxes can be found in certain places.\n\nThe game is divided into four stages or \"missions,\" consisting of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the gang's hideout. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players complete the game together, they are forced to fight each other to determine who will win Marian's affections.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dragon", "videos": [{"id": 2422, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "cy5f9ayBHbM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy5f9ayBHbM", "title": "Double Dragon gameplay HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cy5f9ayBHbM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
