The game would have been the series second MMORPG, aiming to bring Ultima to the Everquest crowd. It was set in a new world created within the mind of the now ascended Avatar, where several heroes would find themselves as splintered aspects of that heroic figure.\n\nThe game was announced in 2003 with a 2004 release date. Despite being playable at E3 2004 and still set for launch that fall, Electronic Arts cancelled the project to focus on supporting Ultima Online instead. This also led to EA closing the doors on Origin Systems, the studio behind the Ultima series.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultima-x-odyssey", "collections": [{"id": 498, "name": "Ultima"}]}
