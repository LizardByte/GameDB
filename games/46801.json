It is a rhythm game where the player uses a controller to simulate the playing of an electric guitar. The game consists of music predominantly from the rock music, rock and roll and J-pop genres. It is considered one of the most influential video games of all time, for having laid the foundations for popular guitar-based rhythm games, such as the Guitar Hero series. Working Designs attempted to bring Guitar Freaks PlayStation 2 games in the U.S., but patent problems with the guitar controller prevented the project from moving forward.\n\nThe game is now in its nineteenth version, GuitarFreaks V8, which was released in March 28, 2011. It was speculated to be the final release of GuitarFreaks V. A spin-off series, GuitarFreaks XG was released in Japanese arcades on March 10, 2010,[4] which added two more buttons to the fret bar. A sequel, GuitarFreaks XG2, was released on March 9, 2011. Another sequel, GuitarFreaks XG3, was released on Feb. 23, 2012.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/guitar-freaks", "videos": [{"id": 125013, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IsRhF7S6lGA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsRhF7S6lGA", "title": "HAPPY MAN [ GUITAR FREAKS, PSX ]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IsRhF7S6lGA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 125014, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8DpMiD4244U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DpMiD4244U", "title": "Guitar Freaks Arcade Gameplay (MAME, Guitar Hero Controller)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8DpMiD4244U/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 125015, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "iL6fyBTF1j4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL6fyBTF1j4", "title": "Guitar Freaks Arcade Mashine", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iL6fyBTF1j4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
