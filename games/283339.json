So he uses Gui to destroy the house of a streamer called ORIGE in the middle of a stream, which prompts a close friend of ORIGE called Gahbye to go to his house to see what happened, ORIGE says he recognized who destroyed his house as Gui before he flew away, and asked Gahbye to alert people on their discord server.\nAfter that, a follower of ORIGE called JC, calls his friend Mateus, who knows about a superweapon that can destroy Gui, Mateus says that it's in Pietro's house, so they go there, to find out that Gui destroyed it too, and that Pietro fled the city afterwards. So ORIGE shows up and tells JC and Mateus to go to the Temple of Origens so they can use the tracker in the temple to locate Pietro, who should have the superweapon, but halfway to the temple, Gui shows up and injures Mateus, leaving JC to go to the temple on his own. After getting there, he uses the tracker to find Pietro, who had fled to the brazilian state of Cear\u00e1, and goes to his provisory hut, only for him to say that the superweapon wasn't created yet. So Pietro prompts JC to go to the house of Jo\u00e3o Natan (aka Jhonatan), to get the final piece of the superweapon, while Pietro goes and rescues Mateus, so JC goes to Jhonatan's house, gets the piece, but on the way back, Gui shows up again and destroys it, so JC comes back empty-handed. Luckily Pietro has a weaker, but working backup, so they go back to the temple to track Gui, and find out he's coming for them. So ORIGE, who came to the temple with them, grabs the superweapon and defeats Gui, who then turns into Sr. Confi\u00e1vel, who turns out to be dream, another one of ORIGE's followers, so they defeat dream too.\nThen the game skips 10 years ahead into 2034, where JC turns on his windows 13 PC, and goes to turn on his time machine, which he uses to go back to 2024. So JC talks to past himself, who says he's leaving to get the superweapon to destroy Gui, so future JC gives the idea to bring the superweapon from the future, which 2024 JC accepts. So he goes back to the future, grabs the superweapon, and goes back to 2024. But after 2034 JC goes back to the future after giving the superweapon to 2024 JC, He finds out that giving the superweapon to past him changed the timeline so that ORIGE failed to defeat Dream, and finds himself trapped in a underground prison along with Gui, Jhonatan, Pietro and Mateus. They tell him how things really went, and that Dream took over the world, so JC has an idea to use the time machine as a teleportation device to get out of that prison, but when they try it out, everyone gets teleported into deep space because JC made a mistake while modifying the time machine. So JC activates the machine's debug mode to see where they were, turns out they were in between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, on a collision course with Earth, but it would take 3.5 years for them to get there, and each one only had 3 days of oxygen. But then a satellite appears, everyone grabs onto it, and JC finds out that it has a warp drive, which they use to get to low earth orbit, and then they get into an empty space station, which has a spacecraft they use to get back to Earth. Back on the surface, they face Dream again in the middle of New York City, who gets defeated, so they have one last quest: find ORIGE. They go search in the remains of ORIGE'S house, where there's a TV showing a video recorded by Dream explaining that he trapped ORIGE in a underground prison below the surface of the atlantic ocean, right above Earth's mantle, and that 10 years from then, the mantle's magma would rise to his cell, burning the place down. So everyone hurries to JC's house to use the time machine again, this time to teleport to the ORIGE's cell, where they free him, but then the time machine stops working, until JC fixed it, and they get back to the surface. The game ends two years later with the characters watching a movie about the game's story on the cinema.", "summary": "3D story game", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/origens-story-mode"}
