The Justice Department, created by the pre-war United States government, was an agency to assist the overburdened law enforcement and judicial system to sentence the criminals on the spot. Judges can act as police officers, prosecutors, judges and, if necessary, executioners.\n\nWhen the last president of the United States starts a global nuclear war, the Judges mutinise and sentence him for crimes against humanity. With the nuclear weapons annihilating billions and reducing the cities around the world to dust, the Judges become the only power in Mega City One, which is what is left of the United States of America. Ruling the city and keeping the peace with cold, machine-like adherence to the law, the Judges are uncompromising enforcers of the law, maintaining the order in an overcrowded city filled with unemployment, recycled food, criminals and soon-to-be criminals.\n\nAnd even among them, there is one most respected, one most feared... His name is Dredd. He IS the Law.", "summary": "\"Judge Dredd\" is a 1995 action-packed video game that expands on the dystopian world of its namesake film and comic book series. Released for SNES, Sega Mega Drive, Game Gear, and later PC, this Probe Software and Acclaim creation surprised critics with its positive reception. The game cleverly extends beyond the movie's plot, introducing a thrilling new story arc featuring the Dark Judges. While the Game Gear version offers a more streamlined experience, other platforms deliver a richer, more expansive journey through Mega-City One's crime-ridden streets, allowing players to dispense justice as the iconic Judge Dredd.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/judge-dredd--6"}
