Everything was recreated with as much detail as possible through hours of reading of multiple Pac-Man guides and playing the original game. Being a conversion, some concessions were made to work around the limitations of the 48K but the overall result is still pretty close. The game runs at a silky smooth 50fps with game sound and no tearing or flickering.\n\nAll the level progression, logic, rules and timings are implemented exactly like the arcade. All the intermissions are included at the end of the right levels. All the ghost logic was replicated exactly as the original. A fix has been made to Inky's logic which had a bug in the original. Game does not \"crash\" like the original arcade at the end of level 256. It simply ends with a Game Over. It also supports a 2 Players game like the arcade.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zx-spectrum-pac-man-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 104141, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-CkThVCW5tI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CkThVCW5tI", "title": "ZX Spectrum -=Pac-Man Arcade=-", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-CkThVCW5tI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 104142, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "B-8y8NNZo5E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-8y8NNZo5E", "title": "PAC-MAN 2023 ARCADE CLONE - *NEW* ZX Spectrum 48K 2023 game!
