It said that...\nWorld was divided by sky to Bressigland on Heavens and Gortrock on Earth. Every race in Gortrock united and chose their own hero. The eight heroes fought the No-Life King and defeated him. Therefore, God granted great glory to them.\n\n...Two thousand years have passed since then.\nThe industrial revolution occurred, democracy was established, swords were replaced by guns, and magic was united with science. Monsters are protected as endangered species. Elves and dwarfs, goblins and orcs accepted human culture, forgot their natural way of life and settled in the cities, where buildings, constructed from stone and metal, stand in rows. Ocelot City is the city where the most diverse races live.\n\nThe protagonist is half-elf Rick Arrowsmith, serving as butler to Selma Fortenmayer, stepdaughter of Land, who has the right to succeed him as a Mystic One. He always defended his master from enemies, holding in his hand Bale Hawter, a gun with its own will, and occasionally nostalgically thinking about his master's past. Due to a past accident, Selma became \"rakka\", an incomplete dragonith, who is unable to fully transform into a dragon, only able to grow wings. Since then, it has taken great pains for Rick to see her live in a despondent manner.\n\nYet one day, a sworn enemy of the Mystic Ones, the Council of Divine Guidance, assassinated Land. Furthermore, the Divine Crest, which verifies one's being a Mystic One, showed in Selma's body. Sid Fortenmayer, a native son of Land, objected and became enemies with Selma. She had no self-awareness of being a successor, but was swallowed in battle and became isolated. Rick, who had served her since she was a young child, nevertheless continued to be on her side and serve her. And so many events took place\u2014Rick and his comrades were to stand against the conspiracies of the Council of Divine Guidance and corporations, as well as the secret of Rick's own origin.\n\nWill Selma really see her true awakening as a Mystic One?\nWill Rick really be able to break free from his natural brother, Alfred, butler of Sid, as well as other various chains binding him?", "summary": "A PSP version Bullet Butlers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bullet-butlers-juudan-no-kanata", "videos": [{"id": 94718, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "MDST8MpVzGo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDST8MpVzGo", "title": "Bullet Butlers -\u9283\u5f3e\u306e\u5f7c\u65b9-\u3000\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MDST8MpVzGo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
