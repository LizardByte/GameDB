This often leads to fun moments, when things are not going as planned.\n\n- Enjoy!", "summary": "FIREWORKS MANIA is an small casual explosive simulator game where you can play around with fireworks, create beautiful firework shows or maybe just blow stuff up.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fireworks-mania", "videos": [{"id": 66465, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "g-vlB8R6b9Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-vlB8R6b9Q", "title": "1.5 Years of Unity Game Development in 10 minutes | Fireworks Mania", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g-vlB8R6b9Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 136836, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aDYBJKneOsk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDYBJKneOsk", "title": "Fireworks Mania - Multiplayer Release Trailer Nov. 2024", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDYBJKneOsk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
