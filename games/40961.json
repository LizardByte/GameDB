Now, the Zzyaxians are back, and the 90-foot camels must defend a planet no longer accustomed to warfare. \n \nThe Zzyaxian hordes consist of typical Minter zaniness. Postboxes and letters, Pacman ghosts and microchips are all out to get you. The game allows you to fire in any direction, by moving the joystick while holding down the fire button. Additionally, you can drop miniature versions of yourself, as bombs. \n \nAfter completing a level or losing a life, the player can move to a level adjacent to the current one within a 10x10 grid. You can also purchase improved shields, energy recharges, or improved weaponry such as bigger or 'smart' bullets.\" --mobygames.com", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/return-of-the-mutant-camels"}
