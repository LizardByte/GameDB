The plot is fairly simple, but not nonexistent. The story opens with Sonic racing Dr. Eggman to one of the Chaos Emeralds. Just as Sonic is about to claim the gem, Eggman overtakes him, violently knocks him aside, and claims the Emerald for himself. Sonic spends some time unconscious, and dreams of Eggman attacking and capturing his best friend, Miles \"Tails\" Prower. Sonic wakes up at his and Tails' home, and walks outside to find Tails making some adjustments to the Tornado before setting out on a casual flight. Sonic attempts to follow Tails, only to be confronted by Eggman, who promptly knocks Sonic off a nearby cliff. Sonic and Tails are quickly caught up in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse against Eggman and his many contraptions, fighting for their very lives.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 73136, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "48ShWo-ua28"}]}
