I ended up reusing old, long-abandoned assets and concepts to be able to complete something in 7 days.\n\nGameplay Tips:\n\n* The goal is to get to the 25th floor and defeat an enemy there, so plan accordingly.\n* Your starting equipment will very quickly need to be upgraded.\n* Passive effects for weapons may be more useful than additional strength.\n* Some passives affect positioning and can help you from getting cornered.\n* Get a sense for the room before running straight in. Some enemies can kill you pretty easily in 1x1 hallways.\n* Explore the room carefully for easy enemies that drop edible items and items scattered around.\n* Falling down a hole will damage you and also let the enemies take a turn. On harder floors this can do a lot of damage.\n* Move slowly.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tower-noire"}
