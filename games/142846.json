Utilizing this new alloy, Lerman Matsunaga developed a new clean energy engine called the Buster Engine, which was globally adopted and quickly replaced fossil fuel and nuclear-based engines. With nearly all of the world's engines now being centrally powered and controlled by a fully automated computer system called BAC, the unthinkable has happened: BAC has gained intelligence and has turned against humanity.\n\nWith humanity on the verge of extinction, a secret internal division of Lerman Matsunaga had the foresight to design a special weapon against BAC: the Rolling Gun. Operated and controlled via a brain implant, humanity's fate now rests in the hands of a courageous RF-42R STORK pilot who must set out to destroy BAC at the old Lerman Matsunaga building, which has been turned into a near-impenetrable BAC fort. This is the last hope for humankind.", "summary": "Navigate across 6 stages blanketed in a hail of bullets from an unceasing onslaught of enemies and screen-filling bosses\nChoose from 3 different STORK ships to pilot, each with unique attributes and firing patterns\nMultiple difficulty settings allow players of all skill levels to jump in and enjoy a true bullet hell experience\nSave Replays and use Training mode to master the Rolling Gun and learn the intricacies of each stage\nA pulse-pounding, high-energy original soundtrack composed by COSIO (Space Invaders Extreme, Groove Coaster) perfectly complements the gameplay\nBeautifully animated cutscenes marry gameplay and story\nA challenging risk v reward point system will have seasoned players shooting for the top of the in-game leaderboard", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rolling-gunner-over-power"}
