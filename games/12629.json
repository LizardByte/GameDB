Despite its mainly action-oriented gameplay, the 32 levels often involve support, transport and rescue missions. For example, dropping or refueling friendly units in the combat zone. In exchange, other units serve you as rearming points or help you fighting the enemy. Mission objectives include destroying enemy units, rescuing P.O.W.s and dropping them off at an aircraft carrier, escorting a reconnaissance plane, re-taking a captured base, dropping off a spy and more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zeewolf"}
