The goal is very simple: you need to destroy the enemy's fortress with the help of cannonballs. However, behind the simplicity, a far more intricate process is hidden.\n\nThe Castle allows the player to customize the game settings to diversify each duel: you can change the curvature of the landscape and the height at which the fortresses are relative to each other; you can change the degree of influence of the wind on the shots; you can even choose the magnitude of the gravitational force and the number of hits after which the fortress is considered defeated.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-castle--2", "videos": [{"id": 77282, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "km6j617pLq4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km6j617pLq4", "title": "The Castle (Sami Tammilehto) (MS-DOS) [1991] [PC Longplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/km6j617pLq4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
