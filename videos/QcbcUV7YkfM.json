I decided to leave the standard bike until last, which proved a stupid idea, as it was the only bike i used that made the game playable. The controls were horrible and i found myself unable to turn any corner without going off track and resetting me back a few foot. Using the brakes just made me so slow there was no chance of catching up with anyone else. However..... after choosing the standard red bike everything changed and the game seemed like it could entertain you for a week, so its going on the playthrough list, and a full tournament/championship video will be coming soon. \n\nPlease subscribe to my channel for more retro gaming videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\n\nMoto X Maniac was recorded on a Sony PS2 console using the Hauppauge hdpvr2\nRecorded by SHLIMPOLE\nmoto-x-maniac ", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcbcUV7YkfM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcbcUV7YkfM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcbcUV7YkfM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcbcUV7YkfM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Moto X Maniac PS2 gameplay [ Phoenix Games ] 720p ( Playstation 2 )", "description": "In this video im testing the first 2 levels, and first 3 bikes in single race mode of Moto X Maniac by Phoenix games on the sony Playstation 2 console.
