Afterwards, it becomes a series of sexual encounters, which proceed depending on the player's choices.\n\nBeing a visual novel, the game can develop into different directions story-wise. The only gameplay consists of deciding where to go and/or what to do. Depending on the player's decisions, the story will be concluded with various endings, \"happy\" as well as \"bad\".", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shinsetsu-shiawase-usagi-f-yuujou-yori-mo-aiyoku"}
