Are you really ready for this one? Have you got the courage to load up the experience that makes all other games you've played seem prehistoric? \n \nBecause Blood Money is simply the best arcade game you've ever seen. It has staggering graphics, amazing sound effects and music and the most gripping gameplay you've ever tackled in your life. Blood Money just leaves the competition for dead and takes you into new realms of arcade action. \n \nBut it's going to be tough. From the instant you hear that driving soundtrack you'll be plunged into a maelstrom of sheer destruction, as you plunder the four Outer Planets in a kamikaze quest for gold and glory. The aliens in Blood Money set some vicious traps, and it will tale all your skills just to survive. \n \nUse your awesome firepower wisely and you'll turn those aliens into blood money that can earn you extra weapons and equipment. And you're going to need them, because there are no easy screens in Blood Money. It's a life and death struggle that demands all your tactical genius and shoot-em-up know-how before you battle through to confront the four planetary Guardians. \n \nWith its vast bit-mapped graphics, superb animation, blistering sound, devilish obstacles, awesome firepower and 1 or 2 player options, Blood Money is the greatest challenge yet faced by any games player with a passport to outer space. \n \nBlood Money, It's here. It's in your trembling, sweaty hands. It's ready and waiting for you. But are you sure you're ready for Blood Money?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blood-money", "videos": [{"id": 40581, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qxciUa4YmeY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxciUa4YmeY", "title": "Amiga Longplay  Blood Money", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qxciUa4YmeY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40580, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "1GvyoHfku5U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GvyoHfku5U", "title": "Blood Money - Amiga Intro and Music", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GvyoHfku5U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
