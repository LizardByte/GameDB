{"id": "SrYCxojNQ5U", "snippet": {"title": "Persona 5 Funkin' In Starlight [Full Mod Showcase]", "description": "DOWNLOAD THE MOD: https://gamebanana.com/mods/566581\n\nHello! It's been a lil' bit but I'm finally able to show off this mod. It's been in on and off development for like a year or so and it's been something I've really been looking forward to getting my stuff out for. Originally I was brought on by Ito to do the Persona 3 styled song and ended up not only doing 2 more songs for the mod (the Persona 4 one and the menu music) but also helping out with coding, UI, and animation stuff. Most of the menu stuff that replicates the style or certain menus from Persona 5 was done by me and it was really fun figuring out how to recreate this stuff and make shaders for all the effects. I've always been a big Persona fan and I've haven't really seen a Friday Night Funkin' mod that was mostly original music as opposed to covers of pre-existing Persona music yet. Anyways, I hope you all enjoy this lil' mod and I look forward to showing off everything else I've got planned for this year in due time. \n\n:]\n\nChapters:\n0:00 - Title\n0:13 - \"Facade\" by Case\n3:39 - \"Full Moon\" by Rozebud\n6:11 - \"Mayonaka\" by Rozebud\n8:58 - Results\n9:15 - Extras\n\n#fnf #persona", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrYCxojNQ5U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrYCxojNQ5U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrYCxojNQ5U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrYCxojNQ5U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrYCxojNQ5U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Persona 5 Funkin' In Starlight [Full Mod Showcase]", "description": "DOWNLOAD THE MOD: https://gamebanana.com/mods/566581\n\nHello!
