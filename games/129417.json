Both families had for generations claimed to produce the best wine in the kingdom.\n\nIt's unclear if common folk around the kingdom actually cared who deserved such an unimportant recognition, but for Lord Frederick Ashlyn and Lord Eldan Swayne this was a dispute about honor.\n\nAt Arms\nWords turned to shouts and soon sabotage followed. It was to no surprise that a local war broke between the two provinces. King Frey had no time for petty disputes and he allowed the two lords to resolve their differences once and for all.\n\nLord Eldan Swayne, overpowered by the guards of lord Frederick Ashlyn had nowhere to turn but exile. In accordance to the law, this meant that Swayne Province had just become a land owned by Lord Frederick Ashlyn.\n\nPeasant Uprise\nOn the far south end of Swayne lay ground to Donnington; a small farmer's village loyal to Lord Eldan. In fear of what was to come from Lord Frederick rule, the inhabitants of Donnington gathered to listen to a commissary sent by Frederick.\n\nIf news were not favorable, how would they master the bravery and foolishness to rebel against a noble lord? How would the good King Frey view this act of treason? How would the nearby folk feel about this journey? Would they join the cause or result to mockery at the craziness of this march?\n\nAnd so our story begins as news of the arrival of Ashlyn commissary reach this remote village...", "summary": "Peasant Uprise sets a group of peasants on a deadly quest against the new lord that has taken over their province.
