Each game is different because the map is random (the cards interact with the map), and the cards you get during the game are also random, generating different strategies for each occasion. In addition, the cards and spells have synergies with each other, as well as upgrades that you acquire and that change the way you play the game. At the end of a game, you earn gold to buy card packs and thus improve your cards for the next game, and acquire new cards.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cards-of-prophecy", "videos": [{"id": 118059, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "GRHOAK_wpUk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRHOAK_wpUk", "title": "CardsOfProphecy GameplayTrailer v1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GRHOAK_wpUk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
