Set in a series of procedurally-generated labyrinths, Loot River is a dungeon-crawling action-roguelike that combines the tense, real-time combat and dark fantasy stylings of Dark Souls with the spatial block-shifting puzzles of Tetris.\n\nArmed with the power of the Relic, players can shift the ground beneath them, sliding floating ruins together in a series of tile puzzles. As players venture through these endless catacombs, they\u2019ll encounter beasts, lost travellers, and bosses. These cosmic grottos offer a wealth of new weapons and gear to discover, as well as unholy knowledge to unearth for permanent upgrades.\n\nDrawn to shards of an unholy relic, wandering nomads have found themselves in a perpetual cycle of life and death, losing their sanity as they journey through endless parallel realities, devouring each other to absorb the knowledge of their fellow travelers. No two journeys are ever the same as countless lost souls float through the Loot River.", "summary": "Set in a series of procedurally generated labyrinths, Loot River is a dungeon crawling action roguelike that combines tense, real-time combat and dark fantasy settings with spatial block-shifting.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/loot-river", "videos": [{"id": 50769, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cRrZpdo_LIM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRrZpdo_LIM", "title": "Loot River - Gameplay Overview | Summer of Gaming 2021", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cRrZpdo_LIM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 50648, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gzTsXKAeVU4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzTsXKAeVU4", "title": "Loot River - Official Gameplay Trailer | Day of the Devs 2021", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gzTsXKAeVU4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47063, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "izvucMSln7w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izvucMSln7w", "title": "Loot River - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/izvucMSln7w/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 66848, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "WMXi4QG19aA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMXi4QG19aA", "title": "Loot River - Release Date Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WMXi4QG19aA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
