Platform throughout various levels, while you fall on, slide off, or otherwise touch every block on the level. Every level is part of a larger spaceship, which has broken down in one way or another. It's up to you to get them back up running as part of your training for the Mobility, an elite-class league of master repairmen. In an age of starships and public space travel, they're often the saviors when major problems occur. Mobility is designed to appeal to a large range of players: it's not as punishing as your usual precision platformer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 44852, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "PzsD8967SqE"}]}
