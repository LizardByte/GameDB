This is a fan translation as it was never officially released in the west. I produced a playthrough for this version to serve as comparison for the Nintendo DS remake which was officially released in the west but with several differences.\n\nAs usual, this is segmented and edited. I'm using the higan emulator here and this emulator is focused on being as accurate as possible and thus the slowdown and visual issues you would experience when playing on a real SNES are accurately reproduced. As far as I know.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that combat is heavily influenced by RNG and there are several layers of RNG present. \nWhether or not you hit is based on a percentage chance and there is a check for each shot a weapon fires.\nIf you hit, the part you hit is based on a percentage and again, there is a check for each shot.\nThe damage you do per hit also scales based on your skill level.\n\nEarly on, combat can easily be a total disaster. An example of this is in mission 3, where I attempt to use a single unit to save the NPC and this goes extremely poorly due to a series of bad rolls.\nLater on, hitting is pretty much guaranteed and your damage sky rockets due to skill levels being in the thousands and the game becomes much, much easier.\n\nI don't do anything off-screen aside from filling inventory with repairs near the end of this part. I did no arena matches beyond what is required.\nThe game probably would have been much easier if I had spent time grinding in the arena but I didn't want to. \n\nI sped up the shopping process and this saved quite some time between the two videos. So tedious.\n\nThe shop theme is subject to some copyright abuse. I had to replace the audio during shopping sections due to this. I would have replaced the audio anyway for shopping as the menu sounds are not pleasant and the music stops being music when sped up by 400%. I just couldn't use the shop theme, which sucks.\n\nI really don't like doing this but I can only work around Youtube's copyright system. I can't change it.\n\nNotes\nThe only penalty for losing units is a money cost at the end of each mission. They do not permanently die nor do you lose the Wanzer.\n\nI think the game relies too heavily on missilers for difficultly.\n\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:32 Mission 1\n16:49 Mission 2\n33:56 Mission 3\n1:00:31 Mission 4 \n1:23:00 Mission 5\n2:05:07 Mission 6\n2:35:50 Mission 7\n3:21:27 Mission 8 \n3:56:42 Mission 9\n4:27:26 Mission 10\n5:03:18 Mission 11\n5:53:28 Mission 12\n6:23:51 Mission 13\n6:48:54 Mission 14\n7:23:39 Mission 15", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XieNGBnkaFo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XieNGBnkaFo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XieNGBnkaFo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XieNGBnkaFo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XieNGBnkaFo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Front Mission (SNES) Playthrough #1 - First Half (No Commentary)", "description": "Front Mission Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPO56tlewLYRsv2QRdkt1Vb2WAoH_RPWR\nThe 1995 version of Front Mission.
