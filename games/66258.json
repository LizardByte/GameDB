The actual scoring is a bit more complex than that, but that's basically it.\n\nYou can't die, because dying's not fun.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/runman-race-around-the-world", "videos": [{"id": 127912, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "I5YDDNcto2M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5YDDNcto2M", "title": "RunMan: Race Around the World Steam Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I5YDDNcto2M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
