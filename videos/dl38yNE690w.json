Most people have never heard of this 1998 PC game, but it is a very cool flight simulator.  The game is set in a series of craters called \"Misplaced Optimism\" on Titan, Saturn's biggest moon.  You fly around vehicles called \"Moths\" and can play many roles such as Trader, Dealer, Corrupt Cop and more!  The people of Misplaced Optimism have been abandoned on Titan so trading valuable resources is a huge part of the game.  The soundtrack is another highpoint of the game, with music from Autechre, LFO, Squarepusher, and Black Dog. Very cool game, shame it never took off in the States like it could've.\r\n\r\nVideo Game News, Reviews and More! http://www.gametoker.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dl38yNE690w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dl38yNE690w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dl38yNE690w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dl38yNE690w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dl38yNE690w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hardwar Gameplay", "description": "I was going through my old games collection and came across my copy of Hardwar.
