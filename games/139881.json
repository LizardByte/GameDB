Call upon the power of the Viking deities Odin, Hel, or Thor to bless your quest to take down a God. Explore an expanded Midgard world with buildable villages and loot-filled dungeons. Battle savage hordes of enemies from Norse legends alone or online with friends. Experience brand new gameplay features including a skill tree system, improved combat mechanics, and a revamped quest system.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rune-ii-decapitation-edition", "videos": [{"id": 42628, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9P9NAz_o7_U"}]}
