Near-space vessels, heavy industry on the moon and thriving colonies on Mars extend humanity's empire into the great blackness of space.\n\nWith the earth's mines nearly spent, industrialists rely on the wealth of the heavens. Our solar system's massive Asteroid Belt is a mother lode of resources, just waiting to be torn free and shipped home. \"The Belt\" is the humanity's newest frontier, as wild and untamed as any that man has faced.\n\nAmbitious prospectors blast off with little more than an Outpost Module and a Mining Tool, to tear the hide off these asteroids and find their fortunes. This bonanza doesn't come without risks. Mere survival is a daily struggle. Asteroid storms bombard the surface, destroying Outposts, and hostile claim jumpers can appear at any moment.\n\nFor the brave, there is a fortune to be made. For the foolish - there is only death.
