The ship was found to be of Martian origin, making it over ten thousand yeras old. This alone would be enough to make it of great archelogical value; however this particular vessel is believed to be the near legendary \"Queen of Phobos\", lost somewhere near the Triffid Nebula approximately 9450 B.C.\n\nChief among the list of the ship's illustrious passengers was Rankh III, then Pharaoh of the now extinct Martian race. More importantly, the ship was carrying in it tightly guarded hold the mask of Kuh-Tuh-Lu, symbol of the Pharaoh's strength and power (there are those who contend that the mask was more than a symbol, that it was the source of the Pharaoh's power, but has never been proven). It is not known why the Pharaoh chose to travel on a commercial passenger liner, or why he deemed it necessary to bring the mask with him on a decidedly hazardous journey. All that is known for certain is that with the lost of the mask, the Empire of Mars was plunged into a state of chaos and civil war that brought about the extinction of the Martian race in less than 1200 years.\n\nAs Mars' nearest living relative (there is some inconclusive evidence that Homo Sapiens are directly descended from the Martian race) the government of Earth war awarded exclusive salvage rights to the \"Queen of Phobos\" by the Federation of Planets, and a tight security net was thrown up around the derelict. However there are holes in even the tightest of nets, and four thieves are after the Mask of Khu-Tuh-Lu, as it is reputed to be of Martian soapstone and will fetch a handsome price on the Black Market. These are four ruthless thieves who will stop at nothing to obtain it.\n\nYour mission then, is to recover the Mask of Kuh-Tuh-Lu before the looters do and return it safely to base. You should within sight of the derelict now.
