After Sin betrays Hydra, steals the Magna Corrigo, and unleashes a group of infected \"vampyres\", the Hunter offers Deadpool sanctuary at the Abbey to protect him from Doom over the heroes' protests. With the Magna Corrigo in their possession, the emboldened vampyres publicly attack innocents and establish nests across Manhattan. With Deadpool's help, the Midnight Suns eventually track Sin to Transia, where she intends to use the Magna Corrigo in a ritual to empower the vampyres until Deadpool destroys it. Sin escapes and reports back to her master Dracula, who assures her the Magna Corrigo was not vital to his plans.", "summary": "Marvel's Midnight Suns: The Good, The Bad, and The Undead is the first DLC expansion for Marvel's Midnight Suns, released in January 2023.
