The player controls one of four heirs with an equal claim to the throne of the Greek hero Achilles. The latter sends the four to procure a magical stone that confers omnipotence to the user, originally left behind by the Greek gods. Through warfare, the player-chosen hero must defeat the armies of their three rivals and claim it for themselves.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/19-neunzehn"}
