When Uncle Henry starts thinking, something bizarre usually follows. \nAnd it did! After six months of brainstorming, Uncle Henry celebrated the grand opening of his Nuclear Waste Dump. Hidden behind the local Sloppy Joe Hut, the waste dump was designed to handle vast quantities of discarded radioactive material. \n \nSoon Uncle Henry was rolling in dough, but there was too much waste for one man to handle. So he put an ad in the local paper-which of course you answered.", "summary": "The Nuclear Waste Dump employs the most advanced method of waste disposal known to man- dumping the stuff in a pit. You stand on the edge of the pit. Uncle Henry hands you a container of nuclear waste, which you maneuver above the pit with the joystick. Press the button to drop it. The can falls into the pit and bounces along the pile of waste until it comes to rest. Simple, right? Well, almost... \n \nThere are three types of waste containers, each having its own distinct shape and color. The catch is that a container may not end up on or next to a container of the same type. If it does, POW-the end of your little corner of the world! \n \nMomentary contact between containers of similar waste is allowed. For example, a container of Type 1 waste may be dropped onto another Type 1 container as long as it bounces to a different location and does not come to rest in contact with Type 1 waste. \n \nAlso, you can only hold a can for a short time (depending on which speed you selected). When you are handed a can, a timer in the upper right-hand corner of the screen counts down. When it reaches zero, a buzzer sounds and you must drop the waste in your tracks. Needless to say, this could be disastrous. \n \nYou get 10 points for every container successfully dumped. If you manage to fill the pit by placing just one container of waste as high as the pit's rim, you get a 1,000-point bonus, some neat special effects and an early retirement.
