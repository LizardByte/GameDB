The objective is to clear each stage within the planet's three areas: the lush and tropical Atoll, the glacial and snowy Northpole, and the toxic and jungle-like Swamps. Within each step lies a set number of solar cells, many scattered about and some hidden, that Jett must collect to unlock each stage and gain access to the following areas. Additionally, Jett must defeat a general of the PPP at the end of each site. As with classic platforming games, Jett is capable of jumping but can briefly hover when using his jet pack. Within certain stages, he can also paraglide and ride a hoverboard or a jet boat. In addition, Jett can defeat enemies, clear obstacles, and activate switches with his \"Dash\" attack, which can be executed by shaking the Wii Remote while he is standing (which sees him perform a somersaulting tackle) or after a jump (which sees him perform a diving hammer fist). The game also features an achievement system that can be completed either during or after the completion of the main story.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jett-rocket"}
