The ships' computers attempt to recreate the planet in the image of Earth, but due to bugs, they end up creating strange monsters.\n\nThe game begins 1,000 years after the crash landing. You'll have to team up with the planet's native residents, known as Guardians, to combat the monsters created by your ship. The Guardians aren't too fond of you because of what your ship did to their planet, but they're willing to work with you in exchange for booze.", "summary": "Earth Seeker is a Role-Playing game for the Nintendo Wii.\n\nThe battle system for facing off against these beasts is known as the \"Time Stop Battle\" system. It combines real time and command based elements. As you move about the battle field, you'll be able to lock on to enemies.\n\nThe camera will then set itself to keep the enemy in your sites. You can press A to pause the action and select commands from a command menu. Commands shown in the screenshots include such things as \"Blade Rush,\" \"Air Strike,\" and elemental attacks like \"Flame,\" \"Ice,\" and \"Thunder.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/earth-seeker"}
