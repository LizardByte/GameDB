Each level also has a number of bombs placed at various points; the chameleon can hit these with its tongue to send them crashing towards nearby chickens. The player must keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by the chickens, such as flashing eggs.\n\nIf the nesting eggs are left for too long, they will hatch into a baby chick. The player can eat the chick for bonus points, but if the chick is left alone for too long, it will grow into an adult chicken and start attacking the player.\n\nA level is over once all of the eggs have been collected and all of the chickens killed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
