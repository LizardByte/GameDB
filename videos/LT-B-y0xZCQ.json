The game requires you to get five power medals, but as you may notice, I have seven of them. Two power medals are not needed to complete the game and they are sidequest items. I use four of the seven power medals in this video and the end of the video just has a short segment with Madoka turning Mui into a rocket using a cookie and riding him around.\r\n\r\nI think this is a nice game for a budget title...the game can be had for ten bucks or less. I uploaded movies for this game over two years ago...and a game sample has been LONG overdue, but it is here. The visuals aren't fantastic, but the characters are cute and there is a little bit of sparkly special effects. The gameplay is relatively basic, but also charming. You play as Madoka (as I've said a dozen times in the introduction videos), a girl who must act as a chef and cook up magical snacks. She travels with a creature named Mui, who can change his shape in various ways depending on the magical snacks that Madoka feeds him. Together, Madoka must retrieve \"Power Medals\", magical items that possess enough energy to help Madoka stop a terrifying space fortress known as the Dreadnought. The Dreadnought, if not stopped soon, will scorch the land of Fillip Side and destroy everything in its path.\r\n\r\nWhile transforming Mui with snacks is pretty neat, they don't necessarily give him the power needed to save Fillip Side. However, Madoka gets a sacred Pendant from an Angelic woman named Arnise (Aanisu) that will help her and Mui save Fillip Side. With the pendant, Mui can also transform with the power of the Power Medals too and his transformation differs depending on the medal. With the cost of Star Points, Madoka and Mui can merge together and become a super being for a limited time.\r\n\r\nThe game has various puzzles and items to collect, things, to do, etc...but it's pretty short. Still, for ten bucks, I think it's a nice game. The game also has some nice music and overall, I highly reccommend it to anyone who can find it.
