First the player picks an avatar of a gender and age group. Using the selected avatar as a template, the player can customize the hairstyle, brows, eyes, nose, mouth, head shape and clothes. The parts of the face can be repositioned and resized. Additionally, paint tools can be used to further accessorize the caricature with colors, objects and speech bubbles. To finish off, the caricature can be placed in one of many sceneries provided. The player also has the option to paint their own pictures from scratch or make use of one of the ready made caricatures.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/caricature-artist"}
