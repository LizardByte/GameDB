Temple or fortress? Warband or family? Hope or fear? As the Winterfall\u2019s deadly frosts approach, each choice we make will shape this haven. \n \nSo that we may rebuild our Sanctuary, each of us will venture into the wilderness of the Old Kingdom, in search of lost knowledge. How far will we go in our quest, and what bargains will we strike with the hidden forces of the wild? \n \nWarrior, wanderer, poet, craftsman, treasure-hunter\u2026 The wilds sing a special song of temptation for each, seeking to cloud our hearts in forgetfulness. We must persist: every successful return to the Sanctuary will bolster it in the face of the cold onslaught. \n \nGeneration after generation, through battle, diplomacy, and adventure, we shall forge our legacy and test it against the Winterfall.", "summary": "Winterfall is an open-world RPG set in the awe-inspiring ancient wilderness of Anor, the Old Kingdom.
