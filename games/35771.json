Snail Bob 2 is a puzzle game for all the ages. It'll make you think and smile.\nLike Snail Bob 1 (2012), this game collects the rest of the original Snail Bob parts, but unlike the first, the fourth part (Love Story) has been replaced by an exclusive chapter titled (Jungle Story), while keeping the sixth, seventh and eighth parts. Additional stages have been added to these parts and their order has been replaced (the forest story, then the fantasy story, then the island story, and finally the winter story) and a puzzle piece has been added in some stages that the player must find (such as the star) and finish the color for each chapter", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snail-bob-2"}
