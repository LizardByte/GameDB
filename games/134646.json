It is studded with ancient ruins left behind by a long lost civilization. It had always been a peaceful realm.\nThat was until about twelve years ago when the Legion came down from the stars and began to colonize the planet. Their expansion was swift and brutal. Caught on the back foot, the kingdoms of Rathael gathered all of their most powerful magic users\u2014called Princepts\u2014and forged the first Princept Accord. Unified, they were successful in beating the Legion back to their stronghold. Sadly, their final assault ended in tragedy. The Princept Accord shattered and the Kingdoms turned to isolation.\nIt has been twelve years, and a new generation of princepts is beginning to see the need for another Accord. The Legion has been attacking towns again. The Kingdoms are sending out dance invitations. And the Tangled Woods have been getting stranger and stranger.\nYou, the princepts and warriors of factions at odds, will fight, quarrel, and flirt in your efforts to sway Rathael in your favor.", "summary": "For The Honor is an anthology game inspired by She-ra and the Princesses of Power.
