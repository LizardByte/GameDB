{"id": "RJu0oayoeAs", "snippet": {"title": "VIC-20 Longplay [001] Ultima: Escape from Mount Drash", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Georgc3\n\nAn RPG like Maze game where you have been imprisoned by Garrintrots in the mountain stronghold of Mount Drash. There are 15 levels throughout the tunnel inside the Mount Dash and you must find a way to exit to finish the game. Some of the later levels has gems that must be collected before advancing to the next level. Throughout the game, there are enemy creatures you must kill in order to survive in combat throughout the game. This game is a spin-off of the Ultima series. It has little or no connected to the main ultima series. Richard Garriott did not know about this game. So this game is released exclusively for the commodore vic-20. Here's a way to beat this game:\nTo escape from Mount Drash, you need to beat 15 levels. Each level is similar, but gets harder as you go along. Level 1-4 - All the same and easy to overcome. Level 5-12 - Gems appear and you must get one before you enter the next level. Level 7 - Overhead view of the maze disappears. Level 9 - Monsters can no longer be seen. Level 11 - Direction indicator now absent. Level 13 - Use your instincts and get both gems. Level 15 - This level is your only obstacle left.\nThis game is tough. Impossible to beat without save states. This game took me almost 1 hour and a half to beat it. Recorded with Fraps and edited out all the failures with Virtual Dub.\nThis game was ported to windows PC but I cannot get it to run on my PC so I had to play in on an emulator.\nYou can play this game on a commdore vic-20 emulator and you need the tape image file to play it on the emulator. \nThe original resolution was 176 X 184. But the problem is by default, the emulator is showing the resolution of 800 X 506 at PAL or NTSC video modes. I tried resizing the window but it losings more than half of the picture on the screen and even recorded with fraps. So I had to record it as it is and crop the extra borders to 704 X 504 to match the resolution as shown in the screenshots at Mobygames. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJu0oayoeAs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJu0oayoeAs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJu0oayoeAs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJu0oayoeAs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "VIC-20 Longplay [001] Ultima: Escape from Mount Drash", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Georgc3\n\nAn RPG like Maze game where you have been imprisoned by Garrintrots in the mountain stronghold of Mount Drash.
