{"id": "1J1Hvw6AtRU", "snippet": {"title": "Zenohell - Arc Mode EX-ALL Clear", "description": "Here is a little preview clear for an upcoming game on Steam that has been developed by several members of the shmup community. \nThe game focuses on fast bullets and fast patterns with relatively simple scoring. \n\nThe game consists of 6 stages and there is a secret 7th stage if you 1cc up to that point. This stage is very long and has the TLB of the game at the end of it. \n\nThe ship I'm using is very good but also tricky to use. Focus is the wide shot and unfocused is the powerful forward shot, so to deal good damage with the forward shot you will have to dodge a lot of the patterns unfocused. \n\nTo score in this game you collect medals by killing enemies which in turn also increases the value of the next medals you collect. Collecting powerup items also converts all bullets on screen into medals but this trick is fairly minor. Dying makes you lose a big chunk of your medal value. \n\nBesides that there is an overkill mechanic on bosses and midbosses where you can shoot them when they are exploding to increase the number of medals that pop out of them when they die. Additionally, using bombs during this time will increase the multiplier of said medal amount. \n\nYou can only hold 5 bombs at once and bombs come pretty frequently so you should always use bombs on boss overkills whenever you are maxed out. \n\nBy standing on top of the boss when they explode you can collect all the medals at once. For some phases however you have to use a bomb for invincibility because otherwise you will ram the next form when it spawns.\n\nThere are a couple of secrets:\nFirst is that if your medal count is high enough you will trigger a secret phase for the stage 2 boss that will drop a extend if you beat it. \nSecondly on stage 3 if you destroy both midbosses at once they will drop a double extend.\nFor the stage 5 extend you just have to kill the midboss enemies. \n\nSteam store page: \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/402030/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1J1Hvw6AtRU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1J1Hvw6AtRU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1J1Hvw6AtRU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1J1Hvw6AtRU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1J1Hvw6AtRU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Zenohell - Arc Mode EX-ALL Clear", "description": "Here is a little preview clear for an upcoming game on Steam that has been developed by several members of the shmup community. \nThe game focuses on fast bullets and fast patterns with relatively simple scoring. \n\nThe game consists of 6 stages and there is a secret 7th stage if you 1cc up to that point.
