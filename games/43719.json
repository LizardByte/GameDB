In the original game, the emphasis was on an arcade look and feel. NBA IN THE ZONE '98 advances the series' evolution by leaning towards more of a basketball simulation. New options include an on-the-fly play-calling system as well as statistical tracking, which not only keeps season stats but also charts league leaders in various categories. You can also take on a friend in Versus mode and see who is really in the zone; with two multitaps, up to eight people can play at one time.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-in-the-zone-98", "collections": [{"id": 5110, "name": "NBA In the Zone"}]}
