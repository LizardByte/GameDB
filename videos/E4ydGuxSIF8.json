Through some heavy programming I designed a chunk loading engine in 6502 assembly. But because there weren't any great tile designing tools for the X16, like YYCHR for the NES, I had to make them myself. The links to my tile maker is available below. However, after designing a chunk rending engine with tiles, I realized that it looked terrible. I tore it out and replaced it with a new method of rending using the X16's bitmap mode. Although it uses more video memory, the isometric blocks look much better. And most of the code from my first attempt could be recycled, so nothing ended up being a waste. More updates are soon to follow so stay tuned. \n\nShare your ideas and be first in line for the Beta test at https://reddit.com/r/inkboxAthenaeum\n\nAdditional Resources:\n X16 4bpp and 8bpp tile and palette editor:\n  https://notin.tokyo/X16tiles\n\n3D ant attack footage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va5SKaYL3r8&ab_channel=RZXArchive\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E4ydGuxSIF8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E4ydGuxSIF8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E4ydGuxSIF8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E4ydGuxSIF8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E4ydGuxSIF8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Is 8-Bit Minecraft Possible?", "description": "What would Minecraft look like if it was programmed for a 1980s 8-Bit computer?
