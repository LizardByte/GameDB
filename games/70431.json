The game now got some different part since the player has to manage the eatery and the waitresses, all of whom are lovely and potential love interests. During each week he has to decide about the coffee shop menus, the prices, what will be the waitress duties during that week and also what he is going to do that week (he can study management, rest, etc.). There are some times during each week that the player is giving some choices (like in all visual novel adventures) and depending of them the game ending will be different. If he got success he can buy new coffee shops, new waitress dresses, etc.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simple-2000-series-vol-19-the-renai-simulation-watashi-ni-oma-cafe"}
