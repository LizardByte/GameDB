This year the main battles were around Leningrad in the Stalingrad in the South. While the summer campaign was another series of German victories the year would end with the surrounding of the German 6th army at Stalingrad. The mass of obsolete Soviet tanks had been destroyed in 1941 with only the T-26 still appearing in any numbers. Now the main Soviet tank is the deadly T-34. The Germans struggled to match this until later in the year with the arrival of the Panzer IVf2 with a long 75mm gun and then the deadly Tiger Tank.\n\nMissions vary from straightforward wipe out the enemy missions, to capture key objectives, to protect vital supply convoys. There is a whole range of missions to reflect the tactical complexity on warfare on the Eastern Front.", "summary": "Tank Battle: East Front 1942 gives a unique wargaming experience on iPhone and iPad.
