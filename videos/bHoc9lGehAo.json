{"id": "bHoc9lGehAo", "snippet": {"title": "Tobarinker [\u3068\u3070\u308a\u3093\u304b\u30fc] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Rare off-shoot of Ruminant Whimper's \"Hellsinker\" (which is a spiritual sequel to \"Radio Zonde\") like D.N.A. Software's \"Shaftdiver\", this is a simple single-screen action game with the goal of protecting allies and defeating bosses. It had a very small production run released back in 2010 as Trickster Jam's first game project, the creator disappeared shortly afterwards.\n\nFeaturing Deadliar (Tsumura Akihiro), Lost Property 771 (also dubbed \"Unnamed\", the true final boss of HS) and Tobari-maru (DL's Misteltoe, an artificial humanoid weapon nicknamed Tobarin here), the goal of the game is to defeat all the incoming enemies while you KEEP YOUR DIGNITY. The game isn't nearly as complex as Hellsinker, but it has a few elements derived from the main game such as Stella, S.O.L. (SIGN OF LOVE) and a modified use of Stella encompassed in the \"Tsundere\" gauge. The player must protect 771 and Deadliar while playing as Tobarin who is immortal as she goes swinging on enemies with rapid punches, haymakers (Radiant Spear) that send enemies flying or an spinning lariat that sends nearby enemies in her vicinity flying with high damage. These attacks can be switched by holding the attack button and reaching different attack levels, though she can also dash which automatically activates attack level one when you swing, so a very useful strategy is to dash constantly and attack to send enemies flying.\n\nWhen enemies are sent flying, they can collide with other enemies and deal additional damage, and it's also a great way to create zoning. Deadliar moves automatically and will rarely do a level two attack, but don't rely on him to help you when you actually need it; he will sustain significant damage if he is hit by an enemy bullet. 771 can't be hurt by bullets but will have her lifeforce shaved away if enemies touch her. Tobarin can absorb bullets and is impervious to everything barring temporary paralysis from one of the boss' attacks, and you have to defeat almost 800 enemies in the Normal Mode or as many as you can in Endless Mode. The main enemies to look out for are those that shoot projectiles, as you'll spend most of your time protecting Deadliar (a single hit to him results in a 100 point loss to your stockpile or HP).\n\nAs this is a score attack game, you'll want to get the most use out of your Stella, Tsundere and S.O.L. attributes. Tsundere in this game incorporates the red / blue elements found in HS but with a caveat; when it is blue, your Stella rank accumulates faster and when it is red, your S.O.L. accumulates faster. When your S.O.L. is full, you can initiate a screen-clearing bomb attack, but this will drop your Stella several levels (and is used in this video only for illustration purposes). Your Stella level impacts how dense enemy waves are and increases your scoring potential the higher the level is -- if it is above seven or higher after you defeat a boss, Rust Dragons will appear who give hefty point bonuses but are tough to defeat. Many food items will appear which will slowly restore your stockpile as you sustain damage.\n\nLastly, you have \"Distance\", which, when empty, will cause a random boss to appear. If you've played HS, you'll notice some familiar faces whose abilities have been adapted to work for this type of game. When all the enemies are defeated, the game gives a brief congratulations, logs your score and simply ends. It is worth noting that there is a known bug that will cause the game to not initiate the victory screen if the counter reaches zero while fighting a boss as well as a few other variables, but there is nothing worthwhile afterwards anyway. If the congrats pop up, consider yourself lucky. The game is actually fun with simple sprites and a few great tracks... would've been better with some more meat on the bones, but it's a rarity that came and went right away, so we can only appreciate it for what it is.\n\nThis is a video of the game in action.
