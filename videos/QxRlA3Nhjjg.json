{"id": "QxRlA3Nhjjg", "snippet": {"title": "Aclla [\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30e3] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "This is a video of the \"Winter 2009\" version of Aclla, an \"original\" shooter based around an original doujinshi. The game seems to be an ongoing project. The way the creators are handling the project is pretty sloppy; they have ONE patch that I know of for the game and the link doesn't even work and they've been selling this game at various comikets and each time, the game seems to be at different levels of completion... In this video, you'll notice that the first level plays like a typical shooter, but the others are just boss runs...that's because only the first level seemed to have any real effort in it. To be fair, the game states that it is more of a boss run game, but that makes the design of the first level more curious.\r\n\r\nThere was a demo movie for a summer 2011 version known as \"Aclla ~inti raymi~\". Despite the new name, it's mostly the same game expanded from past comiket versions...I'll find out later when I play it soon. I think the game was sold ONLY at comiket; meaning, you had to actually be at comiket and buy it at a booth. It was not distributed by any third or second parties that I am aware of (W-Canvas, Melonbooks, etc.). In any event, this video shows some gameplay and you will generally know what to expect. Summer 2010 and ~inti raymi~ are somewhat different. More info to come later.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QxRlA3Nhjjg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QxRlA3Nhjjg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QxRlA3Nhjjg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QxRlA3Nhjjg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QxRlA3Nhjjg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Aclla [\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30e3] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "This is a video of the \"Winter 2009\" version of Aclla, an \"original\" shooter based around an original doujinshi.
