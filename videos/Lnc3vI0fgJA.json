It was written by Bill Williams, known for his creative flair in his games (He also wrote Alley Cat and Salmon Run, among others).\n\nHere we have yet another of his unusual and surreal games. You are the Avatar, utilizing nature (namely, trees) to first destroy the eggs of the evil spiders, then destroying the headstones the Necromancer uses to enter the world.\n\nThe game consists of three phases of five levels each:\n\nPhase one is the tree planting stage. You utilize your Wisp to plant seeds while protecting the sprouts from the trolls that will damage/destroy them. You can gain more seeds by catching the.. jumping eyeball thing. As you successfully get trees grown, the level increases. At some point, a spider pops in and starts attempting to poison the trees (this is the crying complete with animation). You have to touch them with your wisp to cure them or else they turn into dead stumps.\n\nPhase Two is using the trees you just grew to destroy as many eggs as possible. The flashing one is the one next to hatch. To do this, you take direct control of the trees and plant them over the eggs, hoping they grow through the soil and smash the egg before it hatches, destroying the tree. If you succeed, you can touch the tree and return it to your inventory. You also have to watch out for the grasping hands which will permanently remove a tree (and sap much of your strength if caught yourself).\n\nIn Phase Three, the remaining eggs are turned into spiders which chase you as you attempt to remove headstones where the Necromancer can manifest. Once a level is completed, you continue to the next for 5 levels.\n\nI've not personally beat this game without massively abusing save states. It's very difficult to get lots and lots of trees successfully grown in phase one without them getting poisoned in the high levels. Then, it can be very difficult in phase two to not lose all your trees to spiders and arms (as I did in this game). If you have too many spiders left, it makes it essentially impossible to get the headstones without the spiders getting you.\n\nWonderful game and still holds up well all these years later.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lnc3vI0fgJA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lnc3vI0fgJA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lnc3vI0fgJA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Atari 800 - Necromancer gameplay Bill Williams 8-bit games", "description": "Here's me playing a particularly unlucky game of Necromancer for Atari 8-bit.
