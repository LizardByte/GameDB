This build was sent to me by a source who wishes to remain anonymous. There are some notable differences between this build and the one I received from a developer last year. The looking-around idle animation at the start is different from the previous PS2 build. It is the same idle animation used in the Xbox version. This build, and the build I received back in 2019 differ by four days, with the this one being the later build.  There are also a few changes in the binary for Matau that are not noticeable in-game that I have verified. This source who wishes to remain anonymous also sent me a pitch document for the game, which contains concept are among many in-game concepts. Both this build and the pitch document will be made public on BioMedia Project at a later date.\n\n\nDiscord server link: https://discord.gg/DyWpTjC", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DWz5KKDdeI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DWz5KKDdeI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DWz5KKDdeI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Yet another Bionicle 2: City of Legends PS2 build!
