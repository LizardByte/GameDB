Stunning visuals and true old school gameplay accompanied by the most metal soundtrack you've ever heard recorded by Curt Victor Bryant (formally of Celtic Frost).\n\nAbout Slain!\nPlayers control Bathoryn, a hero in a Gothic world, seeking to liberate seven great towers from 7 deadly overlords. \n\nBathoryn must battle his way through a doomed land packed with gruesome pixel art foes before ascending (or sometimes descending) each tower, defeating puzzles, traps and monsters alike. At the heart of each tower, he must confront a mighty overlord. Defeat it and Bathoryn\u2019s quest continues. Fail, and you\u2019ll die gruesomely \u2013 mauled by werewolves, disintegrated by floating monstrosities, squashed by great weights or torn apart by hidden blades. And you will fail\u2026 \n\nSlain!
