While being Single-Player oriented, Cyrgoth's Revenge can also be played in Co-op and Deathmatch modes, however due to the large map sizes, the latter is discouraged. Like in it's predecessor, there are numerous unmarked secrets throughout the span of the Hub, as well as a secret level, which isn't as easy to find as the one in Cyrgoth's Manor.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyrgoths-revenge"}
