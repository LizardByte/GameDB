There are also 2 new racers added: The messenger trio and 'fodder' racers! Fodder racers are a themed racer that will change their 3D mesh to reflect the common enemies present in the level. For example, in the Central Yharnam and Tomb of Oedon tracks they will take on the appearance of huntsman, but in the Research Hall themed track they will look like the research patients.\n\nAnd that's it for this update!
