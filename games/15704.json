A grim discovery confirms the worst- he's out there and he's hungry. In a bid to save the Island's failing tourist trade, Mayor Vaughn engages a professional shark killer from the mainland. Unfortunately, en route, a fierce storm wrecks his boat, and the means of Jaws' destruction is scattered throughout the caves and chasms of a menacing sea world. In desperation, Mayor Vaughn turns to you, Police Chief Brodie. With your two colleagues; Hooper the shark expert, and Quint the manic shark hunter, you set off to retrieve the lethal weapons from the sea bed and kill the unwelcome intruder. Unfortunately, Jaws has other ideas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jaws"}
