The last bastion of hope for Earth, E-CON operates out of vast militarised caverns and tries it's utmost to find a way to wrestle control of Earth back from the Insectron invaders.\n\nThe basis for all Insectron 'life' are two substances believed to be based on highly advanced nanomachines. The first substance, labelled 'Xenoaqua', is a quicksilver like substance which hardens to create Insectron structures and armour. It is highly adaptable and will self-repair by absorbing more liquid Xenoaqua. The second substance is 'Xenophy', a purple liquid, said to have the consistency of thick syrup. Xenophy is thought to be the 'brains' inside the Insectron machines and the most vulnerable to damage. It is unknown if the Insectron think with a' hivemind' or if they feel individuality, but both there is evidence to support both claims. The Insectrons follow a pack mentality to the point they seem to share their perceptions on the battlefield almost instantaneously, they also display fear and self-survival when in danger.\n\nHumans first settled on Mars midway into the 22nd century. Isolated for hundreds of years, the Colony on Mars grew into a religious order. While Earth burned for decades, the Insectron horde sent a much smaller force to occupy Mars; and while the Martians and Insectrons clashed, the Martian people were left relatively unhindered in their progress. Waiting for the perfect moment, the HTR have unleashed the full potential of their technology, wiping aside the Insectron occupation force. They now have their eyes set upon Earth, to reap revenge.", "summary": "In the year 2523, a large wormhole opened up on the outer limits of Jupiter's orbit. E-CON's Navy stationed on Jupiter's moon Titan were the first to witness as the vast Insectron horde spewed out of the rift torn upon in the Solar System.\nBattle across various worlds in this futuristic turn-based strategy game. Utilise a vast array of units to defeat your foes while minimising losses. Mission are varied and challenging and include objectives such as capturing an objective, defending a base and, of course, annihilating the enemy!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hex-mechs"}
