The challenges you are going to face are intimately linked with the faction you select and the geography of your location in the world. Whether you want to build a wealthy kingdom or become a famous conqueror, your subjects will expect you to take the right diplomatic and economic decisions. Maybe you covet a unique and precious resource produced from your neighbor? Then send a messenger to negotiate a trade agreement\u2026 or your army to seize this key region. Spies, treaties and solid alliances can prove to be better weapons than warfare. Still, recruiting military units, calling powerful heroes and learning new magic spells are always good ideas when other realms become too threatening.
