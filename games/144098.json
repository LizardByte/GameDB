As a farmer, miner, fisher, warrior, craftsman, and even a mage, you\u2019ll find that adventure awaits you here. Your hard work will let you upgrade your farm, restore shops in Sun Haven, and even bring in new neighbors! As you bring the hustle and bustle back to town, the EXP you earn from each quest will help you level up to advance through a main questline journey.\n\nThe main quest itself takes you through two captivating towns outside of Sun Haven. The mythical Elven town of Nel\u2019Vari rests deep in the forest where the Elves live in balance with nature. The rumored monster city of Withergate features a bustling nightlife that never ends - literally - since the city is covered in neverending darkness.\n\nYour experience in these places will grow your skills dramatically, but how you focus that growth is entirely up to you. If you prefer a sword in hand, then slash away by all means. But if a watering can is more your style, then there are nonviolent alternatives to overcome dangerous encounters - even with the final boss! Either way, it\u2019s up to you to wield your abilities and become the hero of your own story.\n\nFarm, Fish, Fight, Mine, Smith, Cook, and Craft to revitalize Sun Haven.\nTHREE Worlds to Explore: The Cozy Human Town of Sun Haven, The Beautiful Elven Village of Nel\u2019 Vari, and Urban Monster City Withergate.\n8 Player Multiplayer: Play with up to EIGHT total people in one game, make your own farm and story in online multiplayer.\nFIFTEEN romance-able characters: (humans, elves, demons, and multiple animal races) or woo your own partner in multiplayer!
