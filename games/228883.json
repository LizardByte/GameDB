Here you play as Nixon who thinks he's a regular tax collector in dystopian retro-futuristic Los Angeles, but actually a cyborg-assassin for one of the big corporations that gets his memory reformatted once in a while. The gameplay is centered around riding your hovercar and shooting your way through the various city locales destroying all sorts of vehicles, turrets, barriers and occasional boss in the process. There are five missions in total with their own sets of enemy units and level design.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hard-boiled"}
