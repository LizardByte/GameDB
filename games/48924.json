Bird and the three Battletoads, Rash, Zitz, and Pimple, are escorting Princess Angelica to her home planet using their spacecraft, the Vulture, for her to meet her father, the Terran Emperor. When Pimple and Angelica decide to take a leisurely trip on Pimple's flying car, they are ambushed and captured by the Dark Queen's ship, the Gargantua. The Dark Queen and her minions have been hiding in the dark spaces between the stars following their loss to the Galactic Corporation in the battle of Canis Major. Pimple then sends out a distress signal to the Vulture, alerting Professor T. Bird, Rash, and Zitz. Learning that the Gargantua is hidden beneath the surface of a nearby planet called Ragnarok's World, Professor T. Bird flies Rash and Zitz there in the Vulture to rescue them. Between levels, the toads receive briefing comments from Professor T. Bird, along with teasing from the Dark Queen.\n\nThe professor drops the toads to the first level, Ragnarok Canyon, the surface of the planet guarded by axe-wielding Psyko-Pigs and Dragons that the player can fly with if taken out first; its boss is the Tall Walker, which throws boulders the heroes must throw back at it while avoiding its lasers. The toads then enter the world by descending through a downward-vertical-scrolling Impact Crater, the second level named Wookie Hole, where they face threats of ravens that can cut off the toads' Turbo Cable, Retro Blasters that pop out of the wall and shoot electrical bolts, Electro Zappers that form a line of 2,000 volts of energy, and plants named Saturn Toadtraps that eat toads.\n\nRide levels include the third stage, the Turbo Tunnel, where the players dodges stone walls while riding on a Speed Bike and having to use ramps to get across long gaps; the fifth level, Surf City, where the player bounces on water surfaces on a \"Space Board\" while dodging logs, whirlpools, mines, and spiked balls; the seventh stage, Volkmire's Inferno, where the 'toads fly on the Toad Plane in a fire-y environment going through Force Fields and dodging fireballs and rockets; and level eleven, the Clinger-Wringer, where the toads ride on the stage's titular unicycles while being chased by a hypnotic energy orb, named the Buzzball. All of them include a section of beat 'em up gameplay, with Surf City being the location a boss fight with Big Blag, the chief of the Dark Queen's rat army that can squash the Battletoads with his weighty blubber slam, and Buzzball also serving as Clinger-Wringer's boss.", "summary": "In 1993, a Game Boy version of Battletoads was released, titled \"Battletoads in Ragnarok's World\". This version was missing several levels and featured single-player support only. The subtitle was given to separate the port from the previous Battletoads game for Game Boy, which was a completely different game altogether.\n\nOkay 'toads! Let's get EVEN! When the evil Dark Queen kidnaps both your best buddy and the best looking girl this side of the Mazallion Star Cluster -what are you gonna do about it? Are you gonna cry? Hide? Call the Starcops? No way! Because you're a BATTLETOAD and BATTLETOADS don't cry, hide, or call for help. BATTLETOADS get real MAD-and then they get EVEN!\n\nSo, strap on your Blaster, power-up the Toadster and get on downt o the Dark Queen's planet - but, watch out 'toad - this lady's bad, and she's got a whole mess of really nasty surprises lined up for you - like the Psyko Pigs, the Mutant Ratpack, Robo-Manus and the Saturn Toadtrap, to name but a few. You're gonna need all your fighting skills to defeat her - the Battletoad Butt, the Big Bad Boot and the Nuclear Knuckles. Hey, and don't forget to take along the Jet Turbo, the Space Board and the Speed Bike. Because you're gonna need 'em all, 'toad, if you're gonna rescue your friends and get the frog outta there with your green skin intact!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battletoads-in-ragnaroks-world", "videos": [{"id": 48560, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bbOmNTMTG6I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbOmNTMTG6I", "title": "Game Boy Longplay [124] Battletoads in Ragnarok's World", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bbOmNTMTG6I/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
