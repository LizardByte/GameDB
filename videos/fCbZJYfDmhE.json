{"id": "fCbZJYfDmhE", "snippet": {"title": "Undoing - Gameplay Video", "description": "The best games are the ones that get your blood pumping. You step into the game and you can really feel your foot hit the ground: there is a little something extra to the game that draws you in. Undoing is just such a game. Using the newest photogrammetry assets, this is a high-quality game created for teen audiences. In the game, humans and monsters do battle with each other in single player, multiplayer, and online modes. \n\nThere are five monsters in the game: Cyber, Devil, Skeleton, Troll, and Brute. One \u201cDude\u201d character represents all of humanity. You can do all sorts of things to advance in the game, including shooting, quick-time-event grappling, melee attacks, driving vehicles, getting kills, getting assists and points. There is even a spectator mode, so if you just want to watch others play, you have that option. This is a game that is rich with choices, and modes include free-for-all, team death-match, and survival.\n\nUndoing is to be sold on Steam with a dedicated server distributable tool that utilizes NAT punchthrough and STUN, so port-forwarding is unnecessary for 90% of users. We plan on integrating achievements, statistics, global leader boards, badges, trading cards, and profile backgrounds. You can customize weapons, characters, vehicles, and more to give our cinematic-style game a personal touch too! \n\nOur game will not use any of the DLC tactics that have become a scourge on the world of gaming. Everything will be virtual, making this a game that you can play without shelling out a huge monetary investment. Once you are playing the game, you are playing the game, simple as that. We are excited to bring something of such high quality to market right away!\n\n\nOutside of making a monetary contribution, you can help us by sharing our campaign with all your friends and family. Go ahead and post the campaign link on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, GooglePlus, Reddit, IndieDB, Discord and any other social media platforms you use. The more people are aware of what we are doing with Undoing, the smoother the game launch will go. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.

To that end, we are largely relying on word-of-mouth. Because so many of the people involved in the development of this game have such impressive pedigrees, though, we expect there to be a significant level of attention paid to the game from the get-go.
