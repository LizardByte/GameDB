However, this time player has only 13 levels (and a training) with no random geometry, plus challenges which are available upon completion of a level. Full Motion Videos, storyline and much bigger landscapes are present. The player has to collect special point to upgrade his armor, health, and weapons. A new feature is included: the ability to hack computer panels, doors and turrets. The game's levels are divided into three portions: Industrial Zone, Military Zone, and A.I.D.A. Core. The only step back (compared to the previous title) is the absence of ragdoll physics.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 9186, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ldmAf478AHU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldmAf478AHU", "title": "Coded Arms Contagion Sony PSP Trailer - E3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ldmAf478AHU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
