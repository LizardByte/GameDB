I get self-deprecating, so I\u2019m fun and smart, right? I\u2019m artsy and trendy, right? My drawings are pretty, right? I\u2019m a hidden diamond, right?~\n\nSo you\u2019d totally sacrifice me some of your time, right? So you\u2019d lend your hands, right? I mean, you\u2019d write something for me, right?
