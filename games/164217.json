Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes\u2026 dreams! You want a bigger kingdom, more pleasant, with more rivers, and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!\n\nIn all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn\u2019t be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother\u2019s side, would be delighted.", "summary": "This is a game of building a deck of cards. The deck contains your resources, victory points, and the things you can do. It starts out a small collection of Estates and Coppers, but you hope that by the end of the game it will be brimming with Gold, Provinces, and the inhabitants of your kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dominion"}
