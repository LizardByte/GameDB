No matter how much damage they take, they will never fall, making them the perfect undying warrior.\nIn Fight Crab, the countdown only starts when a fighter's back touches the ground, and they are finally knocked out once the 3 counts are over.\nNow it's time to mount your trusty crab and combine the invincible body of the Crab and the limitless wit of the Human. Use your weapons, spells, and skills to build your very own fighting style, and climb up the ranks to become champion!\n\nFight Crab 2 builds upon Fight Crab's control scheme by adding the \"Modern\" control option, which is closer to a typical third-person action game. Live commentary is also broadcast over every game as an extra way to keep players on the same page. Crabs can also now learn skills that let them perform certain actions automatically. All of these help make Fight Crab 2 easier to learn and play.", "summary": "Flip your opponents on their backs in this crustacean wrestling fighting game!
