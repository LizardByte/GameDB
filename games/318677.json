A villain named Zeo appears to command the monsters and send them across the land. Players control the Princess who along with her pet and her royal guard, go out on an adventure to save the land. The game is very similar to the first Monster Maker but with a greater emphasis on story and characters. Players must first purchase equipment for their character. The player controls a top-down perspective where they \"flip over\" facedown cards representing the unexplored sections of that area. Occasionally monsters will be shown on the map and encountering them opens up a first person RPG battle menu. Defeating them will earn gold and experience points. There is a limit of 3 monster cards on the screen at any one time, however encounters can include more monsters who will take the place of a defeated monster.", "summary": "Monster Maker 2: Uru no Hiten is an RPG licensed from the 1988 Card Game. As such, monsters, NPCs and even destinations on the world map are represented with a playing card aesthetic. Gameplay itself is similar to many other RPGs including Dragon Quest.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-maker-ii-uru-no-hiken", "videos": [{"id": 142704, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PaMBZoFvh48", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaMBZoFvh48", "title": "GB \u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u2161 \u30a6\u30eb\u306e\u79d8\u5263 (\u30dc\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PaMBZoFvh48/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
