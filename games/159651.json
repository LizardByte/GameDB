WEAR HATS. WITH 8 FRIENDS AT ONCE.\n\nEver wanted to be a purple pig and wear a mushroom hat? Now you can! Choose your pig\u2019s color and hat, and unlock more hats as you play.\n\nIT\u2019S LOWKEY COMPETITIVE\n\nTruffle Hogs is silly, colorful, and fun... but it's also competitive! The game itself is a fast-paced strategy game where you\u2019ll run around searching for buried truffles, stealing truffles found by other players, defending your own truffles, and grabbing some crazy powerups.\n\nDECORATE YOUR TREEHOUSE\n\nWhen you play the game with others, you\u2019ll invite them over to your treehouse. So, why not make your treehouse look absolutely sweet? There are thousands of combinations of roofs, floors, walls, and more. Want a super edgy all-black goth house? Or a pretty pink house with a hearts and rainbow floor? The only limit is your imagination (and me adding more decoration options into the game).\n\n100% INDIE\n\nTruffle Hogs is being made by one person (my name is Avi, hi!), with additional art and music produced by a few of his friends. The game is currently free-to-play, with no in-app purchases, and is only supported by optional ads that do not affect the game competitively. There are no lootboxes or other icky gambling mechanics here!\n\nCOLOR BLIND ACCESSIBLE\n\u2028Truffle Hogs relies on colors to distinguish between teams, but you can turn on color-blind mode to use patterns as well as colors to distinguish between teams. It also just looks cool, so you might want to turn it on even if you\u2019re not color-blind!", "summary": "Truffle Hogs is a free-to-play, mobile multiplayer game where you can hang out and play with friends.
