Please support the original I'm On Observation Duty series on Steam, iOS and Android.\n\nLike in the original games, you have to check live surveillance footage to detect and report anomalies by type and location, which can be anything from a room's door opening, to the sudden presence of strange intruders.\n\nThe difference in this game is that a lot of the anomalies are either generic memes or Cirno_TV community-related jokes/references. Originally a private project, the game became public after a significant amount of interest was shown from audiences.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
