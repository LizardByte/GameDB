The player collects the majority of the pieces and defeats members of Kane\u2019s Court as the game progresses.\n\nPresently, the game\u2019s finale is set in Valencia, an Italian Renaissance-themed world which is where Kane and the Armada originate. The world is dominated by an enormous floating machine, which Kane intends to use to destroy the Spiral. The player ultimately defeats Kane, though Queen is left alive.
