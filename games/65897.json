The game follows a musou-style formula in which you are pitted against hordes of enemies on a playing field and must defeat all enemies to advance, with battles in the mechas interspersed here and there. This game is technically a Gokaiger game, but as they are not the only ones you can play as, this is why the game is called Super Sentai Battle and not Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger. The teams you can play as are: Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger (2011) Samurai Sentai Shinkenger (2009) Tensou Sentai Goseiger (2010) Engine Sentai Go-Onger (2008) Himitsu Sentai Goranger (1975-1976) This would be the first time a non-Heisei era team would be playable in any Super Sentai game that was not a crossover with other franchises, as Goranger was the first season of Super Sentai. The other teams up to Go-Onger make appearances through the Gokai keys, but they are an extension of the Gokaiger team, and therefore are not truly playable.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-sentai-battle-ranger-cross"}
