Unfortunately, as the story begins forces of evil have taken away all the mice except for the one elder remaining.\n\nCan you become the hero of Micetopia and save your villagers from the dark minions?\n\nIn Micetopia you play as a brave mouse who must fight, jump and explore its way through a world of mystery. Overcome enemies, gain new powers, and rescue your compatriots from the clutches of their captors.\n\nI noticed that 13 out of 19 Steam user reviews are negative, while the Metacritic has two critic scores per platform. The Switch version got a 4.5 from Pure Nintendo and Pocket Gamer gave it 2 stars out of five. The Xbox One version (which the footage is from) seems to be pretty mixed: TheXboxHub also gave it 2 stars like Pocket Gamer did with the Switch version, while Xbox Tavern gave it a more forgiving 6/10. The PS4 version, out of the other three console versions, had a much warmer reception (though it's not saying much, as once again we only have two reviews, like on Switch and Xbox One). PlayStation Country gave it a kinda mediocre 5/10, while Gaming Age gave it a B-, which on Metacritic it reads as 67/100.\n\nTo be honest, I actually didn't mind the game. It was pretty cute and it was a simple, yet challenging platformer, but the backtracking and the fact you only have 3 hit points for the entire game are a bit of a turn-off. It's a pretty simple game to get all achievements and trophies, and it's not too bad of a metroidvania for a fiver.\n\nMicetopia (C) Ratalaika Games\nDeveloped by Ninja Rabbit Studios\nAlso on PC, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch\n\n#xboxone #xbox #ratalaika #ratalaikagames #micetopia #metroidvania #indies #indie #indiegame #indiegames #idatxbox #mice #mouse", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DY0VMnrD9q8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DY0VMnrD9q8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DY0VMnrD9q8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DY0VMnrD9q8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DY0VMnrD9q8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Micetopia - Xbox One Gameplay", "description": "Welcome to the medieval, magical kingdom of Micetopia, where mice live in freely an idyllic country village.
