The graphics are generally subpar and the music gets old fast (though you can turn it off), but the game somewhat effectively helps you learn how to play a few games and variants of Poker. The game has a convenient system where you can check your odds of winning and also has a book that gives you \"somewhat\" helpful advice. I say this and keep it open to show you that it can sometimes deny you the chance to win a hand or make your winnings lower than they should be. It works well enough where you will be able to make your own decisions and not rely on it.\r\n\r\nThe games include \"5 Card Draw\", \"5 Card Stud\", \"7 Card Stud\", and \"Texas Hold 'em\".
