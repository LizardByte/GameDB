Located in an eastern Asian town, find cover under falling cherry blossoms, hide behind training dummies and show the world who is the true sensei and master. \n\nEaster Egg Hunt - Two New Unlockable Characters\n\nThe update includes two new characters that can be unlocked via the new Zombie map. One character can be unlocked solo, the second requires a full squad and is quite hidden. We'll pick 3 people who found the second easter egg in the first 2 weeks to give an Alvo t-shirt to.
