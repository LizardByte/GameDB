In case that description sounds like some corporate gaming-industry gobbledygook, imagine if Nintendo produced a Hitman game.

Oh, and all of your assassination targets are based on real-life infamous people. \n\nThis game is a solo dev project. Expect to see improvements in animations and environments as development continues. Gameplay mechanics are mostly finished. Most of the levels still need to be built and filled.\n\n\nBlue Danube (by Strauss) by Strauss\nCreative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported\u2014 CC BY 3.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/...\nMusic provided by FreeMusic109 https://youtube.com/FreeMusic109", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G46fy4myP1I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G46fy4myP1I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G46fy4myP1I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G46fy4myP1I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G46fy4myP1I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "I AM A I Announcement Trailer", "description": "This is Pre-Alpha footage of I AM A I\n\nI AM A I is a cartoony, third-person, open level design, sandbox assassin game.
