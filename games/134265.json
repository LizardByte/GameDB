The gameplay is similar to the previous two games: it's a first person adventure game that consists of a number of static environments that the player can move between and interact with a point and click interface. At some occasions the player will have to fight against different monsters, and when that happens the cursor will be transformed into a crosshair allowing the player to aim and shoot. The shooting system is slightly different from previous games, each enemy has a weak point and when hit at the right time leads to extra damage.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 36513, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mKYSK2y5ZQQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKYSK2y5ZQQ", "title": "Shotgunas - Silent hill mobile 3 - Ep 5", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mKYSK2y5ZQQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
