{"id": "1GbLmYUAOZw", "snippet": {"title": "Little Big Adventure Longplay (PC DOS) [4K] [Gravis UltraSound]", "description": "Developed by Adeline and published by Electronic Arts in 1994\n\nRecorded using DOSBox (20000 cycles) and retail CD. I specifically wanted the original DOS CD version of the game - not the GOG edition - but the only copy I could lay my hands on was the US version (Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure). The only difference is the name on the intro screen, which is academic.\n\nThe game features a mix of CD audio and MIDI music, which obviously improves in line with the sound card installed, particularly wavetable cards. I opted to record this video using the Gravis UltraSound, and I have to say, I was hardpressed to tell the CD audio and MIDI apart on occasion.\n\nThe only problem with the MIDI music is you can't change the volume, so it often drowns out character voices. I try to wait for the music to stop playing before talking to certain characters, although it's not always possible. Fortunately, the game includes full subtitles.\n\n#littlebigadventure\n#adventuregames\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GbLmYUAOZw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GbLmYUAOZw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GbLmYUAOZw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GbLmYUAOZw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GbLmYUAOZw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Little Big Adventure Longplay (PC DOS) [4K] [Gravis UltraSound]", "description": "Developed by Adeline and published by Electronic Arts in 1994\n\nRecorded using DOSBox (20000 cycles) and retail CD.
