Similar to the first one, you have to collect 8 papers to win the game, but this time you must avoid the 8 fake papers which are scattered around the map. Every time you collect a fake paper, the clown rushes at you.\n\nEach time you collect a paper, the monster respawns back to the original position but gets a little angrier. The more papers you collect, the angrier he becomes. The key to complete the game is speed - collect the papers as fast as you can and avoid the monster.\n\nTIP: There is a faint path on the floor. Follow this to find the papers.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clowned-pro"}
