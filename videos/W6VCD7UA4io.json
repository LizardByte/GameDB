In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.\n\nThere are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W6VCD7UA4io/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W6VCD7UA4io/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W6VCD7UA4io/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W6VCD7UA4io/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W6VCD7UA4io/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Boulder Dash (\u30d0\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5) for the NEC PC-88", "description": "Came also out for:\n\nAmstrad CPC\nApple II, Arcade, Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit, BBC Micro, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, Electron, Epoch Super Cassette Vision, FM-7, Game Boy, Intellivision, iPhone, MSX, NES, PC Booter, Wii, ZX Spectrum\n\n\nGame description:\n\nYou are Rockford, and you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds.
