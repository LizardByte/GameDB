There are now rumours in town saying Fiona is a witch- Mejojo and Auger uses this to their advantage and arrest her, so that they can \u201cobserve\u201d her while she lives in the castle. Eventually, Fiona\u2019s half-brother (Nesso) and butler (Zara) rescue her and they escape together.\nThe emphasis of the story is on a dark/historical/political fantasy where humans, wolves, cats and other animals are being ruled by two very crafty feline tyrants.
