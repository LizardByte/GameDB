Having lead a sheltered life, Chise is doubtful and concerned about her worthiness of succeeding the house since she has never seen a Taima (banishment of malicious spirits) take place. One day, Chise's senior apprentice, Miyuki Akari, invites her to go to \"Koutarichou\" with him, saying that it will be the ideal place for her to resolve her worries.\n\n\"Koutarichou\"- a place between the mortal world (Shigan) and nirvana (Higan) in which strange things occur every night. It is a ruined town where humans with special circumstances and ayakashi drift and wash ashore. Chise and her Housoushi, Midori, venture towards Koutarichou.\n\nThere, they meet \"Mukoujima Ten'yuu\", a young man with a smile through which his true intentions cannot be discerned, and \"Hakua\", an ayakashi who always faces downwards as though she were afraid of something. They also meet many other humans and ayakashi whose various hopes and wishes live within their hearts. Though perplexed by the town's strange occurrences, Chise faces her own doubts head-on.\n\nThis is a story spun by a young girl in a mysterious town about the doubts of humans and ayakashi.", "summary": "The first of the 3-part \"Koutarichou Jin'youtan\" series.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/koutarichou-jinyoutan-mayoigo-no-shou", "videos": [{"id": 75796, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "semAdOKyA_0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=semAdOKyA_0", "title": "\ucf54\ud0c0\ub9ac\ucd78 \uc778\uc694\ub2f4 \ubbf8\uc544\uc758 \uc7a5 ~ \u795e\u8db3\u753a\u4eba\u5996\u8b5a ~ \u8ff7\u30a4\u5b50\u30ce\u7ae0~ Koutarichou jin'youtan ~Mayoigo no Shou", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/semAdOKyA_0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
