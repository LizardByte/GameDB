As a small group of designers, animators, musicians, and developers who spent their childhood creating music with friends, we wanted to re-create that experience for people of all ages. Meeting new people with different aesthetic styles and personalities made for great new experiences, memories, and ever growing friendships.\n\nMelody Jams was conceived, designed, and animated by James Bartley. Arbitrary coded and produced the app. Music was done by Nathan Mckee and Hani Zahra."}
