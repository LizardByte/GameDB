The FX notes have been made thinner as a result. Analog chains can start from anywhere and not just from the extremities of the chart lane anymore.\nAnalog chains can now extend outside of the chart lane as well.\nNew analog effects have also been added.\nYou can now change the colors of the analog chain lines. There are four available colors: Blue, Pink, Green and Yellow.\nBoth analog chain lines can be set to have the same color.\nEARLY/LATE indicators for timing judgment have been added. They work in the same way as in the beatmania IIDX and DanceDanceRevolution series.\nAt the song result screen, it is possible to see how many EARLY and LATE \"NEARs\" you have hit.\nYou can now change the Hi-SPEED value more accurately by pressing the START button twice.\nThe maximum Hi-SPEED value has been increased from 6.0 to 7.0.\nBy pressing the 6 button while holding the START button, you can permanently save your desired scrolling speed (the Hi-SPEED x BPM value), which will be shown in red below the current Hi-SPEED value.\nSongs can be sorted into additional new categories:\nSOUND VOLTEX game (BOOTH, infinite infection, and GRAVITY WARS).\nCleared songs.\nULTIMATE CHAIN cleared songs.\nPERFECT cleared songs.\nCharts by individual levels.\nPortions of certain charts will cause the entire chart to shake, zoom in and out, or be temporarily viewed from above.\nEach SKILL ANALYZER level now has three courses to choose from, instead of just one. New groups are added every month.\nSKILL ANALYZER courses can now have Nettou!
