There have been games where you command one ship, there have been others where you command a few or a fleet, and there have been 4X games in WWII, but never yet have we had the opportunity to build a base on one end of the map while we're simultaneously fighting a battle on another side and buying a new ship hoping we got it in time to get there and turn the tide of the battle.\n\nIn Flotilla WWII you will be building factories to increase your production, ships and aircraft to repel the enemy, ports to repair your ships, airfields to build your planes, and AA guns to protect your assets - all in the same map.\n\nThe game plays out as a turn-based strategy game, where you bring in your new units and assign them destination and target orders which they carry out when you end your turn. You will be balancing between building a strong economy and a strong military force, while your choice of ships will also be crucial. Will you try to gain the upper hand by rushing in small, fast ships, in an attempt to cripple the enemy's economy in a hit & run raid, or will you build up your forces silently, ready to unleash long-ranged carriers and cumbersome but powerful and durable battleships onto the enemy? Is investing in a port to repair your ships worth the resources, or are they better spent on more units? Will you firmly take over one island at a time, or will you go straight to the nearest enemy island, striking fast but hard from safety? You can test your strategies against your friends in multiplayer hotseat, or against a simple but very persistent and aggressive AI in noumerous randomly generated island maps, from 16x16 tiles (~5 minutes of play time) to enormous 256x256 tile maps (~2 hours of play time) as best you see fit.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flotilla-wwii", "videos": [{"id": 14089, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7hcjvjA6YI4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hcjvjA6YI4", "title": "FlotillaWWII trailer (graphics update)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7hcjvjA6YI4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
