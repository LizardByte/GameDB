The Geo Keys and Golden Bells will unlock new worlds to explore as you amass your strength in numbers (and your pile of goodies). \n \nMeet the Slimes! \nFly through the air with Winona, zip through water at high speed with Marsh, dash and jump farther and higher with Ash, and build up insane speed rolling around as Tuff. These four slimes hail from all around the world, but through their adventures will meet and fuse, allowing their powers to be used at the same time! \n \nChoose a Visual Style \nSome people prefer jaggy edges and scanlines, others prefer crystal clear sight. Play the game with Nostalgia Goggles set to On, HD Remaster, or Blinding! \n \nAdaptive Soundtrack \nCatchy tunes inspired by the style and tone of yesteryear combined with some smart programming help capture that classic exploration feel. \n \nAll sorts of challenges! \nDo you like platforming? How about puzzle solving? Speedrunning? As fans of all of the above, we're pushing Slime 64 to be the best it can be, and to offer something for everyone!", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 46119, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "aYr03L4iQNI"}]}
