It was going to be for the Nintendo 64DD, but was canceled early in production due to lack of progress and the commercial failure of the 64DD add-on. Only one demo level was ever made but was never publicly revealed. It is also possible that Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Galaxy, or Super Mario Galaxy 2 could have elements salvaged from the development of Super Mario 64 2, according to Nintendo during an E3 event. Luigi was also set to appear in this game, as was a rideable Yoshi. It can be assumed that Luigi would have been playable, as Shigeru Miyamoto had planned to make Super Mario 64 2 multiplayer \u2013 in fact, the first playable demo level was multiplayer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-64-2"}
