He had just been in a room with a beautiful girl, and then, after an unknown reboot, he woke up and realized that it was a simulation. Next to him stood the already rotting Scratch, who had clearly seen better days. He said that all this time the hedgehog was in a simulation created by his maker - Dr. Ivo Robotnik, who is known to this planet as Dr. Eggman. Unfortunately, not the best days have come and most of the remaining robots have disappeared, and Metal Sonic has completely gone over to the side of the enemy. Scratch had to wake up the last creation.
