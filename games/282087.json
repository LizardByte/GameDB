This allows the player 60 seconds to find the level exit. If the player fails this task, the landscape becomes consumed with glitching visuals and strange folkloric characters, telling stories of England\u2019s dark underbelly.\n\nThe game questions the English nationalistic love affair with politicized traditionalism and the toxic side effects this has had on individuals and marginalized groups.\n\nThrough storytelling and allegorical visual narratives, I wanted to explore my difficult past experiences of English nationalism and identity and the history and legacy of English environments and folklore.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-mallards-song"}
