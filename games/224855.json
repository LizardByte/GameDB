Power comes from a battery on the upper left of the screen and is represented by white characters with bolts on their heads called \u201cElectric-Kun\u201d. They will slowly make their way to the development room and once they reach it a programmer will churn out a program and Hudson will make some money and you\u2019ll get points! However if they run into an area without a line they\u2019ll disappear."}
