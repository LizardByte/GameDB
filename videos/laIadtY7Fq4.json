I play for roughly 45 minutes and explore some of the single player campaign. You'll get a look at the single play campaign and see how the power ups work. We don't jump into online battles, however we see how they work with a battle against Luigi.\n\nEvery Thursday I'll be doing an installment where I play a newly released game from the eShop and react to it live. I'll play for roughly and hour or so and try to let you all get a feel for how it plays and looks. Just a heads up, this is my first video so please bear with me as learn the ins and outs of how this works. It will get better and better as I get more comfortable doing these as well as improved audio and visuals (I want to avoid all that black background). Since I just received my 3DS with the capture card the other day I will continue to make this experience better for you guys and gals.\n\nPlease leave and comments or opinions below or via twitter, as they're always welcome to help improve what I'm doing here.\n\nTwitter: Case_Jets \nReddit: Stalfo14\nNintendo Network ID: Stalfo14 // Stalf014 \nPSN: Stalfo14\n\nwww.twitch.tv/stalfo14", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/laIadtY7Fq4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/laIadtY7Fq4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/laIadtY7Fq4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/laIadtY7Fq4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Dr. Mario Miracle Cure Gameplay and Impressions", "description": "In my first ever eShop Thursday segment (name pending) I tackle the newly released Dr. Mario Miracle Cure.
