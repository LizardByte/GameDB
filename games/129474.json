A former Samurai corrupted by the Entity and turned into a dark reflection of his inner angst, a hideous creature of rage, an embodiment of wrath and cruelty that reigns terror upon his victims. The new survivor is Yui Kimura. A rebel against traditions, a protector to those who cannot protect themselves, an exceptional motorcyclist who suddenly finds herself in an endless race for her life. The Cursed Legacy Chapter also features an exclusive cosmetic item: Yui's Pink Striped Top. \n \nWhat does it mean to be authentic? How does one follow one\u2019s destiny despite the pressures of family and tradition? Often following one\u2018s path is a strenuous, narrow struggle full of unexpected joys and difficulties. Ultimately it\u2019s about finding the balance between tradition and self-actualization. But as one struggles for identity, decisions are made and consequences, good or bad, must be faced.", "summary": "Cursed Legacy is a new Chapter for Dead by Daylight.
