The screen zooms out and the actions are slowed down, while icons pop up to show the different actions and objectives. The game comes with a full range of Ad Hoc settings for multiplayer, with co-op and competitive play modes included, such as Deathmatch, Assault and Capture the Flag for up to six players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/killzone-liberation", "videos": [{"id": 26546, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0RPFcXfh6Xw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RPFcXfh6Xw", "title": "Killzone: Liberation Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0RPFcXfh6Xw/sddefault.jpg"}]}
