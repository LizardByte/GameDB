There are multiple objectives to complete to accomplish the goal.\n\nThere is always an alternate objective to steal a Rambaldi device.  In this level, it is accomplished by finding and flipping four Rambaldi levers.  One of those levers are shown in the safe with the document to steal.

I have no intention of stealing that joy from you when you play this game.  \n\nThis was a free, no cost, downloadable game from the ABC TV website circa 2002.  It is no longer on that website.
