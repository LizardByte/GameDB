The game was designed very much as a standard third-person shooter, but used a world populated by cute little animals as its setting. As a result, the game's depiction of violence is very cartoon-like without losing any of its intensity. In 2001, an updated version for the PlayStation 2 was released as Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fur-fighters-viggos-revenge", "videos": [{"id": 109653, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5m6Zn5qAbIQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m6Zn5qAbIQ", "title": "Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5m6Zn5qAbIQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
