When Uchu asked Lara to share hers, she brushes the subject off fast. Jonah then asks about Uchu's face scar. Uchu tells them about a poison that could help the rebellion, and that the scars were from his ultimately failed attempt to get it. To obtain the White Breath recipe, one must take the Path of fear alone. Lara offers to get the recipe. Lara follows the path and finds a woman on it, who doses Lara with the White Breath. Lara hallucinates about her family, and friends getting killed, and finally sees herself as the cause of it. She overcomes the effects of the poison, and presses onward to the trial, which held the recipe for the White Breath. Lara returns to Paititi and gives the recipe to Uchu. Jonah still curious of the full story behind Uchu's scar asks about it, but Lara now knowing what the Path of Fear meant diverted the question.", "summary": "Journey through \u201cThe Nightmare,\u201d as Lara Croft faces off against familiar enemies and fallen friends. Explore Croft Manor in a harrowing trial unlike anything she has faced before. In order to obtain a powerful weapon, Lara must conquer, in either single-player or co-op, the latest challenge tomb, \u201cHowl of the Monkey Gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nightmare\u201d offers new customization options with the Scales of Q outfit, whose thick hide and solid bones provide twice as much resistance to melee attacks. The Grip of Fear axe possesses a primal design, optimized for climbing and fighting. When using the axe, enemies are more likely to be knocked down and stay down for longer periods. Finally, White Breath is the new skill that when fired, creates a cloud of hallucinogenic vapor on impact, poisoning enemies to fight against one another.\n\nAs part of the update, tombs from the main campaign, \u201cJudge\u2019s Gaze,\u201d \u201cUnderworld Gate,\u201d \u201cHowling Caves\u201d, \u201cPath of Battle,\u201d and \u201cTemple of the Sun\u201d are all now playable in Score Attack and Time Attack modes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-the-nightmare", "videos": [{"id": 40574, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8xyZfigxmQY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xyZfigxmQY", "title": "Shadow of the Tomb Raider - The Nightmare", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xyZfigxmQY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
