How funny.\nOne last drop, close your eyes.

What a strange last thought, but it's getting dark, too dark to think... Maybe... Maybe tomorrow will bring more answers...\"\nShe fell in the majestic nothingness of the night while the singer on the old radio player was whispering his quiet prayer: \"I'll take the fate the daylight brings\".\n\nFragments and details, rainy nights and blurry lights are all VOID&MEDDLER focuses on. A single night intrusion into Fyn's life and hopes. Tired of the last two years she spent wandering without a goal and without memories, among disenchanted strangers, and pitiless scavengers, Fyn decided to put an end to all of this. She\u2019ll have a few hours to make things right, and seek strong, pure and substantial memories. In a city where genders and species melt into each other, maybe she\u2019ll find the long lost touch of humanity missing from her life.\n\nThe idea behind Void & Meddler was to create a game that looks like its creators, two musicians nurtured by noise rock from the 80's, synthwave, road trips and cyberpunk literature. Together, we conjured the narration, we created No Wave, we tamed the weird, we fucked in an orgy of wires, neons and white noise. Distance doesn\u2019t corrupt anything. Amps were set aside for a while, and we dived head first into another sphere we loved, full of code, textures and pixel art.", "summary": "Fragments and details, rainy nights and blurry lights are all VOID&MEDDLER focuses on.
