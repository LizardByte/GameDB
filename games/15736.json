Players of the game have to escape from a mental hostpital.\n\nThe Gameplay is similar to LucasArts' early 90's games using the SCUMM engine. The player finds himself in a 2D world. At the bottom of the screen is a list of verbs to be used and combined for solving puzzles.\n\nThe game began as a university project in Germany (Wikipedia). Although that version received an outstanding reception, the English game merely received a mixed reception with both average and low review scores, mostly due to the sloppy translation.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/edna-and-harvey-the-breakout", "videos": [{"id": 81584, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xqQpOL_JKYM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqQpOL_JKYM", "title": "Edna & Harvey The Breakout Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xqQpOL_JKYM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
