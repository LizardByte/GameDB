Through the eyes of Giana, a young baker's daughter, you'll face the impossible choices that defined survival during humanity's darkest hour.\n\nWhen Giana's father falls ill with telltale signs of the plague, players must navigate a web of desperate decisions: stay by his side and risk infection, or flee to the countryside with the privileged elite? Every choice carries weight, from trusting a mysterious plague doctor to seeking sanctuary with the church, each path leading to distinct consequences that echo through Venice's plague-ravaged streets.\n\nThe game weaves historical authenticity with personal drama, bringing medieval Venice to life through illustrated scenes and atmospheric storytelling. Players will examine real medical texts, encounter authentic characters - from flagellant zealots to merchants profiting from others' misery - and experience firsthand how the pandemic transformed not just a city, but the human soul itself.\n\nFrom award-winning creator Dr. Spencer Striker and the team behind the Global Pandemics series, Black Death Interactive offers an intimate lens into one of history's pivotal moments. This choice-driven narrative adventure will appeal to fans of interactive storytelling, historical fiction, and games that explore the human condition when faced with impossible odds. Step into Giana's world and discover what choices you would make when survival hangs in the balance.", "summary": "Travel back to 14th century Venice during history's deadliest pandemic.
