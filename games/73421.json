The art is impeccably done and up to the standards of the release year (1998).\n\nUpon arriving on Mars, however, the landing module hits an unexpected force-field and crashes, and that's where the adventure begins. The first puzzles are quite easy; they consist of saving the module and the two other humans aboard from the shipwreck and the subsequent fire, all the necessary hints being given to you by one of your shipmates. However, after that point, puzzles are way more difficult, as they consist (at first at least) of exploring remains of an alien civilization, with thought processes \"alien\" to human players.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cydonia-mars-the-first-manned-mission"}
