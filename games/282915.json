Because you should.\nJust like its predecessor, this is a speedrun/race hack but much more ambitious.\n\nDefeat 5 main bosses in 5 distinct areas then head to the final boss as fast as possible.\nEach area can be completed in one run and in any order (no need to go back and forth between areas to progress).\nOnce the main boss is defeated, you must rush to the next area.\nYou don't have any time to spare as you usually do in most exploration oriented hacks as you instantly die when the timer reaches zero.\nIf you exit an area before beating the main boss, you're doing it wrong.\n\nIn case you're confused, look at the map - all area maps are available from the start.\nThe game is designed for veterans in mind and a few techniques may be required depending on your current equipment (mid-air morphing, crouch jumping, double bomb jumping, etc.) - nothing on TAS level rest assured.\nAreas feature varying degree of difficulty, if you keep dying or make slow progress, maybe start over with another area first - some areas are brutal when underequipped.\nThere is a good chance that it will take you a few tries before completing the game under the time limit.\nFrom the knowledge you gathered from your runs, try different routes and find the fastest one overall.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-metroid-y-faster-2-fast"}
