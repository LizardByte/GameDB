The girl has no recollection of who she is but she feels like she was a human and her name is Sayuki. Sadly her new master, Abeno Seimei, is pretty demanding and tells her that if she doesn\u2019t accept her fate as a shikigami, she will disappear. Seimei then brings her to Izumi at the capital to work, to do things like console quarraling married couples or deliver love letters. Unfortunately some of the jobs she has to do also require her to fight demons.
