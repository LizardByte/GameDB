She feels a very intense attraction to other girls, but has spurned love for the sake of her mission. In fact, she doesn't even think of herself as a human being, but as a machine with one singular purpose.\n\nOne day she stumbles upon a magic club at a local high-school. The club consists of a group of three girls obsessed with magic. One is a shy fortune teller whose predictions always go wrong, another is a graceful beauty who claims she can talk to ghosts, and another is a hotheaded tomboy who claims to be descended from a clan of magic samurai. All three of them are delusional, and don't understand anything about real magic. The very concept of the club enrages Minori, and she sets out to destroy the club and make sure they never discover real magic. But she slowly finds herself falling for the girls.\n\nWill she stamp out their magical ambitions? Or will it turn out that the real magic is love between two girls?", "summary": "Minori is a mage tasked with hiding magic from the world. She has spurned love in the pursuit of her mission.
