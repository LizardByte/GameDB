An emphasis on high challenge and non-linear progression means GunWorld: Xbox One Edition is not for the faint of heart. Players will be challenged to complete a series of levels in any order they choose, unlocking new weaponry as they do. With each new piece of equipment additional options present themselves, encouraging experimentation and repeated level runs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gunworld-xbox-one-edition"}
