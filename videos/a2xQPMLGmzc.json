Interact with four characters in visual novelesque dialogue. Choose which emotion you want to use in the conversations and watch the characters react. Be neutral, happy, sad, angry, frightened or flirty. The emotions you choose in conversations decide which of almost 50 endings you get. With a playtime of about 5-10 minutes per playthrough, reaching several endings in an hour is fully possible.\n\n#indiegame #visualnovel", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2xQPMLGmzc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2xQPMLGmzc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2xQPMLGmzc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2xQPMLGmzc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a2xQPMLGmzc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Emotions A Day In A Life Official Trailer", "description": "Emotions: A Day In A Life is a casual, free indiegame made by Pinefall Studios, a group of Swedish computer game design students.\n\nEmotions: A Day In A Life lets you take on the role of Jay during a potentially not so ordinary day.
