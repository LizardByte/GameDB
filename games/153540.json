Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing one\u2019s faith in the Goddess.\n\nOn the eve of another successfully completed mission, high-ranking member Father Kevin Graham is immediately assigned to retrieve one more artifact that rests beneath Grancel Cathedral. What\u2019s more, even though this is a task he could easily complete on his own, he must reluctantly do so in partnership with his newest recruit, rookie Gralsritter and childhood friend Sister Ries Argent.\n\nThus begins the start of a routine mission that becomes anything but, delving into a new and mysterious realm that follows an unnaturally strict set of rules: Phantasma. Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberl\u2019s future will be laid bare\u2026and some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.\"", "summary": "The remake brought many changes to visuals, presentation and gameplay including updated art, music and new voice acting.\n\nThe final game in the Trails in the Sky trilogy and end of what is considered the 6th story of the The Legend of Heroes series.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-the-3rd-evolution", "videos": [{"id": 51509, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "CunFj9LRWiM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CunFj9LRWiM", "title": "PSV\u300c\u82f1\u96c4\u4f1d\u8aac \u7a7a\u306e\u8ecc\u8de1 the 3rd Evolution\u300dOP\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CunFj9LRWiM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
