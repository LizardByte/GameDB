I think this is the current world record? ;)\n\nCaptured with  DOSBox SVN Daum (from ykhwong.x-y.net) and uploaded directly\n\nMy previous speedrun record: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owIigX2j_hI\n\nBugs I have found:\n1. at 3:22 in this video you can see me skipping the ladder. This bug seem to work on most ladders in the game, it's not always I'm able to do it right, but the idea is to press jump twice very quickly while jumping kind of on the side of the ladder.\n2. if you pick up a box and then while it's still in the air after you throw it you pick up another box the box will stand still in the air. You will now be in a mode where you are able to pick up a balloon on the first level and it will levitate you like the ballons do except there won't be any ballon visible and instead of the ballonn exploding as you hit the roof you just get stuck there. I tried using this bug to go left after picking up the ballons, but the ladder was in the way, otherwise I think it would have been possible to go straight up to the parachutes. BTW the bug works on parachutes too, you'll be jumping like if using a parachutes except it won't be visible.\n3. At the water level, if you die the same moment you reach the flag (there's a mob right next to it that you can run into and then the flag), you'll skip the loading screen and go straight to the next level, but you will never reach level 6.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qt7XN0lQgB8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qt7XN0lQgB8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qt7XN0lQgB8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Blues Brothers [PC, Titus 1991] Speedrun level 1-6", "description": "My speedrun on Blues Brothers PC.
