You might think it was just a straight Snooker game but you would be very wrong. As this game is packaged full of options modes and mini-games to choose from. The game itself is a port of the PC version of Jimmy White's 2: Cueball developed by Archer MacLean. The game includes three types of Pool in the form of Blackball (UK Pool) 8 Ball & 9 Ball and Snooker. It also includes draughts, darts, a slot machine and a port of the Commodore 64 version of Dropzone, another game by Archer MacLean.\n\nIt's a well rounded package and one of the better snooker & pool games from the era. Now the problem with Dreamcast port is that it only officially supports 50hz or 576i, it doesn't support 60hz or VGA directly. The lack of VGA support is an odd one as the game is a port of the PC version. Now for this video we used an Xploder disc to run the game at VGA, which in turn forces it into 480p, on the downside the frame rate becomes a bit unstable as a result and if you try to use the Bee option in the Snooker room while forcing the game into VGA it will crash. Do keep that in mind if you are a NTSC viewer who wants to import the game. However if you are a fan of the digital Snooker and Pool genre, this is a recommended pick up and can be had at a very cheap price. The fact this includes Dropzone also makes this a Dreamcast shooter title as well.\n\nTimestamp for chapters:\n00:00 Title Screen\n00:18 Hallway and Room Select\n01:28 Pool Room\n02:50 Drop Zone\n05:22 Pool Match\n21:05 Snooker Room\n22:20 Darts\n26:02 Snooker Match\n\n\u30b8\u30df\u30fc\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c82\uff1a\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306f\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\n\nRelease: 2000\nDeveloper: Awesome Developments\nPublisher: Virgin Interactive\nFormat: Sega Dreamcast (DC) / \u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 \n\nJimmy White's 2: Cueball was also released on PC & PS1, however it hasn't been re-released on any modern formats.\n\nRandomised Gaming blog: http://randomisedgaming.tumblr.com\nYouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/RandomisedGamingYouTube\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/rdmdgaming\nTwitch Channel: https://www.twitch.tv/randomised_gaming\nBuy us a Coffee or Tea at Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/randomisedgaming\n\nAll footage in this video is captured directly from the Sega Dreamcast console, via an Elgato Game Capture HD60 Pro using a VGA to HDMI upscaler.\n\n#JimmyWhite #Snooker #Dreamcast", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VGiw-7vto8M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VGiw-7vto8M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VGiw-7vto8M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VGiw-7vto8M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VGiw-7vto8M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jimmy White's 2: Cueball - Sega Dreamcast - Snooker & Pool gameplay [HD 1080p 60fps]", "description": "A showcase of the various modes in the European exclusive Dreamcast title Jimmy White's 2: Cueball.
