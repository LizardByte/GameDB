It has previously been released in Japan under the name \u307c\u304f\u306f\u822a\u7a7a\u7ba1\u5236\u5b98 (I Am An Air Traffic Controller), and later in Europe under the title Air Traffic Controller by DS. A video game demo was made available before its release for the Wii's Nintendo Channel.\n\nAir Traffic Chaos involves the player taking control of an airport control tower for a period. During this period the player needs to achieve a certain score based on orders given to planes and safe take offs and landings. The game has a total of 15 challenges.[1]\n\nThe airports in Air Traffic Chaos are all 5 international and domestic Japanese airports. They are:\n\nFukuoka Airport\nKansai International Airport\nChubu Centrair International Airport\nTokyo International Airport\nNew Chitose Airport\n[1] These each have 3 stages ranging from easy, medium and expert difficulty. Each stage increases in difficulty and brings with it a longer shift with more aircraft to safely land and depart.\n\nThere is no multiplayer gaming but the player can share his/her results and badges records with up to 7 other players through the ATC Library.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/air-traffic-chaos", "videos": [{"id": 30731, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Gq-d7AI_D4s"}]}
