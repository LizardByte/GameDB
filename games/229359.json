Just like the first part, this Multipath Movie uses the in-game engine to render a real-time, three-dimensional, digitally animated story. At certain predetermined points in the storyline the player gets to choose one of multiple plot alternatives or paths that, while influencing the story, never change the actual outcome. Each Multipath Movie episode - they were originally available as Webisodes as well - runs approximately 30 minutes.\n\nWe rejoin the team of rogue employees, introduced in the first episode, on Jupiter's moon Ganymede just as the Miller Western Corporate Conglomerate is moving to turn the mining base into a death trap. It soon becomes clear that the company will stop at nothing to secure its interests in the alien artefact discovered deep below the surface. Green, the facility sheriff and company henchman, receives orders to terminate any witnesses. All transmissions are jammed, company backup is on the way and that means there's only two options left to our heroes: death or a desperate fight for survival.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gravity-angels-part-2-the-betrayal"}
