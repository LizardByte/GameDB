Nothing else comes cross to the sheer sense of scale. The journey itself is great fun too: Utilising seemingly everything in the drake mod, there's tricky encounters throughout and even a couple of challenging bosses too. Ammo distribution is just scarce enough to make you think twice about spamming wildly, but not so punishing as to require a fixed route for success on nightmare. Ter uses drake as a base so gameplay is very far from vanilla. Here's a description of all of the insane stuff it adds: https://pastebin.com/raw/em9dyT9v\n\nThis map pushes the quake engine so hard that it only works in a handful of extended source ports and runs extremely slowly in a lot of the more open areas.  A lot of fights were made much harder because my framerate was dipping down to under 20, even with an I7-7700k. The demo I've captured here is choppy because that's exactly how it was for me at the time. As far as I know quakespasm lacks a timedemo & viddump feature like prboom, so you'll all have to do without a 60fps viewing experience, sorry!\n\nThis run is very slow. Like SHIB7, I had three or four failed attempts with missing monsters. The main issue seems to be imps getting trapped in weird places, notably behind scenery near the silver key arena. As a result, there's a lot of backtracking and double checking on my part to see if enemies have pathed into strange places. Combat is also really tricky at 15fps - timing getting thrown off for dodges and a lot of missing basic shots.  Oh, and i accidentally triggered the chaos armour which wasted a good 30 seconds of my time, blah! My 'best' attempt with one missing monster took 36 minutes, but I'm sure there are better players who could push it down a lot more. Oh and I didn't pick up the super backpack at the start so my ammo reserve situation was fucked up, didn't even notice until the bane fight.\n\nRecorded with vkquake-1.04.1, download Ter Shibboleth part 2 here: http://www.celephais.net/board/view_thread.php?id=61822.\n\nImportant note: The author has stated they're planning on working on this map a bit more, hoping to polish up a few issues and increase performance in places. If your computer can't handle the map or if like me, you get pretty nasty motion sickness from low framerates, it's probably worth waiting for the next release. The other two maps included are well worth the time and run better, so please go check this out anyway.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjX3vZXR8Bk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjX3vZXR8Bk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjX3vZXR8Bk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjX3vZXR8Bk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjX3vZXR8Bk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Quake] Ter Shibboleth Part 2 - SHIB8 \"With Deference in Eminence\" Nightmare 100%", "description": "++ expand for description, dl link, etc ++\n\nGargantuan level.
