FOnline: Reloaded provides you with a unique opportunity to revisit the ruins of California and explore the familiar locales from Fallout 1 and Fallout 2.\n\nFOnline: Reloaded is a player-driven, persistent world MMORPG that allows you to participate in a wide range of activities, which range from faction wars to exploration, mining, scavenging for resources, caravan raids and more. The game puts a lot of emphasis on team play and dynamic, unscripted PvP action, but there is absolutely nothing to stop you from focusing on PvE dungeons or role-play.\n\nFOnline: Reloaded is powered by the latest iteration of the FOnline Engine, which was created from scratch by Cvet and which is capable of utilizing assets imported from the original Fallout games, as well as Fallout: Tactics, Arcanum and Baldur\u2019s Gate. The development of this engine started back in 2004 and continues to this day.\n\nOur server offers several improvements over the traditional FOnline: 2238 formula. We believe in creating a fair, balanced and reliable gaming environment for all the players involved. This allowed us to present you with a game which is both perfectly stable and relatively bug-free.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fonline-reloaded"}
