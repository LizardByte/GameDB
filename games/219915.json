{"id": 219915, "genres": [{"id": 13, "name": "Simulator"}], "name": "Loose Nozzles", "summary": "Built by a veteran game developer around his young son\u2019s artwork, Loose Nozzles is a slapstick arcade game of flight and rescue. Use simple, two-button controls to pilot your rickety rocket and save endangered colonists over 25 levels of increasing intricacy and menace.\nThe child-like look masks a grown-up challenge; each collision risks losing a piece of your rocket, turning a mission of precision flight into a chaotic struggle to survive. Master the controls and learn to fly \u201csmooth\u201d \u2013 fast, close, and free of injury \u2013 to make your way up the leaderboards.\nLoose Nozzles is free to play to completion, and a one-time purchase unlocks: unlimited lives, restarting from any level, rocket upgrades, skins that look and fly differently, and alternate play modes for even greater challenge.\nLoose Nozzles is a labor of love from Foster and Family Games. We hope you like it!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
