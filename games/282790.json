For many years we did not know the name of this game since the label that once existed had long since fallen off. However in 2017 another copy of this game appeared on Ebay UK complete with a label. We now know that the game is called Hard Head. Hard Head plays somewhat like Atari's Save Mary. However this time instead of building a tower by dropping bricks from the top of the screen, you must bump blocks from the bottom of the screen.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hard-head--1"}
