Not out of any desire to hide things - you just don't want Shannon to be dragged into a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nMeanwhile, you haven't seen Lana in ten years; not since the death of your mother. Lana looks a bit different now with her dyed pink hair but she's still the same caring girl with a bit of a wild side that you remember from your youth.\n\nBook Two focuses on the reality of things, dealing with matters at a surface level. If you strip away fantasy and leave only belief in those around you behind, what answers will you be able to find?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heart-fragment-book-two-belief-fragments"}
