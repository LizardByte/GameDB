Gameplay is similar to other airplane racing games such as Plane Crazy and the flight mode of Diddy Kong Racing. The game features 33 single player challenge stages as well as online multiplayer. While the primary focus is racing, dogfights play a large part in some of SkyDrift\u200d '\u200bs game modes. Players are rewarded with boost, which provides a temporary burst of speed, by flying acrobatically, low to the ground, or by taking down opponents. Planes and their separate liveries are unlocked as players progress and complete specified challenges. As players progress on a given course they are sometimes presented with progressing environment hazards such as falling rocks or an avalanche.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/skydrift", "videos": [{"id": 4017, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xjc9HhORB3A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjc9HhORB3A", "title": "SkyDrift - Official Launch Trailer [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjc9HhORB3A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
