However, their maid, Julianne, was jealous of the little family's happiness and secretly dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers hidden deep within the manor that could be summoned by a ritual \u2026 although there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his beloved wife from her cursed world.\u201d\n\nYears have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: \u201cYour favorite fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is waiting in our old family home.\u201d\n\nAs a son, I must \u201cwrite\u201d the happy ending for my family\u2019s story.", "summary": "Stormhill Mystery: Family Shadows is a fantastic casual puzzle adventure game.
