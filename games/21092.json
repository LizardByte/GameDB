The game was developed by NetDevil and released on October 26, 2010, with an early opening (October 8, 2010) for the to-be Lego \"Founders\", which consisted of users who pre-ordered the game.\n\nIt was globally distributed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Its release was delayed from original estimates of 2009, Teasers were released by Lego in 2007 and late November 2008 to promote the game, and also in 2009 for one last promotion. The game was available in English and German.\n\nThe servers were shut down permanently on January 30, 2012 due to 'unsatisfactory revenue' from within the game's target audience.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lego-universe"}
