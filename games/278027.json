All living beings respond to this energy, and some humans can heal or even generate fire with it.\n\nHowever, this energy is also receptive to animals and plants. When a crystal, nearing the end of its life, shatters, it releases an abundant energy flow, triggering mutations in all living beings nearby. This is how the formidable creatures of the scourge come into existence.\n\nFaced with these monsters, humanity came close to extinction. Some individuals learned to harness this energy for defense and became known as the \"Conquerors.\" At one point, a Conqueror named Sarion managed to master such an enormous amount of energy that even some scourge creatures couldn't withstand.\n\nDriven by a thirst for power, Sarion deliberately shattered crystals to absorb their energy until the fateful day when he broke one crystal too many. His body transformed instantly into a monstrous, mutilated being, too weakened to regain reason. Only a part of his personality was preserved: his thirst for power and conquest. Wandering across the entire continent of Gila, he unleashed so much energy that his mere presence created powerful scourge monsters.", "summary": "An independent MMORPG, created by the company \"EC Games Studio,\" Elite of Conquerors is a multiplayer adventure game set in a fantastical world.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elite-of-conquerors--1", "videos": [{"id": 102227, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oitmOZ19N7Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oitmOZ19N7Q", "title": "ELITE OF CONQUERORS  TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oitmOZ19N7Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 102323, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZGXTZty3l4c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXTZty3l4c", "title": "Elite of Conquerors Gameplay: La Chute de la grande Liche", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZGXTZty3l4c/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 102324, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "09jpM1qOviI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09jpM1qOviI", "title": "Elite of Conquerors Gameplay : La chute de Typhon", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09jpM1qOviI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
