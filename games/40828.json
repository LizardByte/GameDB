No real box was made (it came shrinkwrapped inside a box insert), but the cartridge included a label and manual, along with a picture of what the overlay might look like. This is an action/battle game in which you must destroy enemy bases while in your Air Car, and it supports up to 8 players using CatBoxes or 2 players using a JagLink. Although better graphics can be found on the Jaguar and control is a bit sluggish, linking 8 players using CatBoxes can be a unique experience. The hard part will be finding those extra CatBoxes and copies of AirCars.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aircars", "videos": [{"id": 88543, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1t7AG2wlbcg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t7AG2wlbcg", "title": "aircars atari jaguar high quality s video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1t7AG2wlbcg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
