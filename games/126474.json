People eager to break free of their rule colonize other planets. On one of these colonies is discovered a powerful technology used by an extinct race. One of the corporate syndicates, DN, reverse-engineers the technology and uses it to design battle robots called Virtuaroids. While testing this new technology, the central computer at the test complex becomes self-aware and activates the Sun Cannon, intending to use it to destroy civilization. DN assigns their top personnel to take control of several Virtuaroids and use them to shut down the rogue computer.\n\nCyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram:\nThe game starts 20 years after the events of Operation Moongate. After the defeat of Z-Gradt, the mightiest VR and the final boss of the first game, humans continued to battle in their VR's, searching for supremacy. However an unknown AI known as Tangram has awakened and became self-conscious. With the directive to destroy humanity, Tangram infected Earth's mother computer with a virus called \"Tangram Virus\" and hacked into all VR systems, except for the player's VR. It plans to use the infected VRs to destroy the last human colonies that survived the previous war. The player begins the mission to defeat all VRs and destroy Tangram to stop its evil ambitions once and for all.\n\nAfter defeating all VRs, the player is teleported to the Earth's mother computer system to fight Tangram. Depending on the final battle outcome, there are two endings available.\n\nGood Ending: Tangram is erased from the computer and the player's VR is teleported back to Earth's stratosphere, where its armour is critically damaged during the fall but is saved by VRs that came on the Floating Carrier. Fei-Yen is saved by Angelan or the opposite and the others (Temjin, Raiden, Dodray, Bal-Bados, Specineff, Cypher, and Apharmd) are saved by the same model VRs.\n\nBad Ending: If the player's time counter reaches 0, Tangram hacks into the player's VR system and shuts it down, resulting in a Game Over screen.", "summary": "A compilation that bundles together ports of three Virtual-On games, based on their original arcade versions:\n- Cyber Troopers Virtual On\n- Cyber Troopers Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram\n- Cyber Troopers Virtual On: Force", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyber-troopers-virtual-on-masterpiece-1995-2001", "videos": [{"id": 53234, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jHnSDMZQI-U"}, {"id": 53236, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uhmLRMioTBE"}]}
