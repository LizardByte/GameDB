But magic is a double-edged sword\u2014while it has elevated civilizations, it has also ignited a battle for control over Catena\u2019s destiny.\n\nAt the heart of this struggle is Drath, a warlord consumed by the comet\u2019s dark energy, seeking to impose his vision of order through domination. Opposing him are champions like Centurio, the noble strategist of the Light Faction, and ViBu, a visionary alchemist who believes magic must serve all, not the few.\n\nAs factions clash for control of magical relics, territories, and influence, the fate of Catena hangs in the balance. Will you align with the disciplined protectors of light, the chaotic forces of darkness, or another faction with their own ambitions? In this world of evolving narratives, your choices and victories shape the future of Catena.\n\nStep into the conflict, claim your power, and decide Catena\u2019s ultimate destiny.", "summary": "WITS (What Is This Sorcery) is an immersive digital trading card game (TCG) that brings together the classic appeal of card collecting with the dynamic interactivity of online gaming.
