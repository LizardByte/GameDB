Or, at least it was until recent years. Now, Sun Haven is struggling, and while the citizens do their best to keep the town going, nobody has been able to return it to its former glory - and this is where you come in.\n\nWhile helping to revitalize the town, you can be whoever you want to be - a farmer, a miner, a fisher, a warrior, a mage - the decision is yours. Your skills will grow with whatever path you choose, whether you\u2019re raising crops and animals, engaging in RPG-style questlines, or even pursuing romantic relationships.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget to take a break and gather your strength! Between quests, there will be plenty of time to relax and nurture your farm within Sun Haven.\n\nA small journey away from Sun Haven is the monster city Withergate. Rumors about this city are spooking travelers away from outlying roads-- you\u2019ve often heard mentions of strange creatures flocking to the city and bringing unusual technology with them. Now, you must decide if you will heed the rumors, or seek the truth yourself\u2026\n\nRelease: Spring 2021", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhjCmObmXkM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhjCmObmXkM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhjCmObmXkM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhjCmObmXkM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Welcome to Sun Haven!", "description": "Farm sims just got a lot more interesting.\nSun Haven is a Fantasy RPG and Farm sim with Multiplayer up to 8 players at a time!\n\nPlease support us on Kickstarter\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sunhaven/sunhaven\n\nGreetings, Adventurer! \n\nWelcome to Sun Haven, a trading town in the height of its prosperity.
