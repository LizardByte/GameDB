But his near escape from death comes at a price, when he finds out he is cursed to turn into a werewolf himself. The curse must be removed before midnight, otherwise the transformation cannot be stopped. In order to do that, Axel must find the werewolf who bit him. The problem is that he doesn't know who that werewolf is. It could be any inhabitant of this quiet medieval town - and Axel is determined to find out which one it is.", "summary": "Wolfsbane is predominantly an adventure game, which plays for the most part similarly to point-and-click examples of the genre, despite the unusual side-scrolling perspective. The player must explore the town, talk to its inhabitants, and gather information and items in order to solve the mystery. The game utilizes a branching dialogue system. It also has action elements, present in the sporadic combat and a health meter for Axel.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wolfsbane--1"}
