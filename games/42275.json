The story concerns a newlywed couple who are accosted by Mad Max-esque highway bandits, leading to the death of the wife. The aggrieved husband spends the following year building a high-tech combat vehicle out of a sports car and is determined to make the bandits pay.\n\nThe game plays like a mix of a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up and a racing game, where the best means of removing on-screen enemies is by charging into them. Out-of-reach enemies, like helicopters, can be taken down with missiles instead.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gekitotsu-dangan-jidousha-kessen-battle-mobile"}
