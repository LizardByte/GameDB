Features new music by PRIMEVAL and James Paddock, as well as high-quality redone sound effects by Per Kristian Risvik. If the new music tracks are buggy in ZDOOM while using FMOD, updating to the latest non-official revision might fix the problem. I recommend using Fluidsynth, though. The first eleven maps are tech-base themed and are re-imaginings of the first eleven maps of Doom II. The next three maps are hell-themed, with the fifteenth map serving as an epilogue. There are two bonus Wolfenstein 3D themed levels in the two secret map slots, accessible via the epilogue.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flashback-to-hell"}
