At the eleventh hour before their awakening, three heroines have gathered and arrive at the fortress: Ariel, the chosen one; Billie, a dragon-slaying princess from the north; Celsia, a witch-turned-magician with stellar talent, but no temperament to speak of.\n\nA number of bosses stand in the way before the heroines can take on an ancient god. Strategic combinations of equipment and skills are required to stand a chance. After each battle, a new piece of ultra-legendary equipment is acquired which provides higher stats, a passive effect and a powerful skill. Only the most synergetic combinations may prevail against the power of an ancient god!\n\nFollow delightful conversations, solve puzzles, collect collectibles and listen to some self-written music. Find metroidvania-style items and upgrade your Celestial Tea while you\u2019re at it! Maybe you can even fill that fourth character slot with an unexpected, but powerful ally? There\u2019s a lot to do, all crammed into a 5-hour experience.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lv99-final-fortress", "videos": [{"id": 42308, "name": "Soundtrack", "video_id": "801J9Cr3tdc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=801J9Cr3tdc", "title": "LV99: Final Fortress \u2014 Soundtrack", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/801J9Cr3tdc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 42307, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aySewYbrbIo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aySewYbrbIo", "title": "LV99: Final Fortress \u2014 out now!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aySewYbrbIo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
