A map editor allowing users to modify existing scenarios or to create new ones is included.\n\nYou can take involvement at many levels of a battle. You can take direct control of either driving or gunning a tank, direct groups of 16 tanks and their support units, and create a combined overall strategy factoring in supply routes. Over 150 different vehicles from both sides are featured.\n\nIt's a hard-core wargame that will like mostly to the \"aficionados\" of the genre. The game package includes a lot of extras: a thick \"Equipment factfinder\" manual (170 pages), 2 huge posters, replicas of WW2 postcards and of a newspaper.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/campaign", "collections": [{"id": 1821, "name": "Campaign"}]}
