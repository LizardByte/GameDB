After each performance players will be able to spin the mashup wheel for a dance-off between two of the Geminose to unlock mashup superfans that will amplify the buzz around the world of your Geminose band. When not on tour the Geminose live in the lap of luxury at their popstar mansion. With hundreds of interactive decorative items, players can deck out each room in the Geminose mansion to suit their style or reflect the countries that the Geminose hail from. Each Geminose can invite their bandmates over for dance or music parties or play with all the items in the rooms to mine for coins. Coins can be used to buy more furniture, hundreds of outfits, and additional instruments. When taking a break from their world tour with the Geminose, players can hone their culinary skills in the mansion kitchen featuring an extensive cooking game. Players will learn to create the Geminose\u2019s favorite recipes featuring cuisines from all over the world.
