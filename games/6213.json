He never made it home, the tragic victim of an alleged 'overdose\u2019. Two weeks later, Ernesto's son, Ramiro Cruz is hauled out of jail by the DEA to be told his twin brother, Tommy, works for them as an undercover agent and has some new information about their father's death. But, Tommy has had an accident with a hand grenade and now Ramiro must take his brother's place in an undercover operation closing in on the ruthless drug cartel overlord Papa Muerte.", "summary": "Take control of Ramiro Cruz, a man on a crazy mission through Mexico's drug-fueled underworld. An amazing combat system keeps the action intense, mixing third person action with an incredible combo system for maximum carnage - and maximum replayability.
