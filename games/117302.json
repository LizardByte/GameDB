But what happens to others? \n \nNora, embarked despite herself in a raid that will go wrong, will find out at his expense. She, who is not a fighter, will have to cross the nine kingdoms and defeat the terrifying guardians of every world to restore her name to Odin. \n \nThis is the beginning of a delirious and thrilling epic through Nordic mythology. \n \n \nMixing platform, infiltration and enigma, Unspoken Chronicles: Nora makes you the exact opposite of a Viking warrior. Far from the usual brainless brutes, Nora is an agile, intelligent girl, but not brave. So you will have to cross the nine realms, avoiding your enemies or finding diverted ways to get rid of them.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/unspoken-chronicles-nora", "videos": [{"id": 26407, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nKyWI53X7eQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKyWI53X7eQ", "title": "Unspoken Chronicles : Nora - Guardians Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nKyWI53X7eQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
