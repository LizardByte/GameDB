Suddenly the Word Wizard appears and informs you that in order to leave his cave you must find four magic crystals which have the power needed to open the cave entrance. You have only a flashlight to help you find your way, and your batteries are running low.  \n  \nThe Wizard is a funny old fellow who causes lots of mischief for anyone who enters his cave. He will appear often and ask you to spell a word - you will actually hear the old Wizard's voice - and you cannot continue your search until you spell the word correctly, but each time you are wrong, he will draw energy from your light. When your flashlight runs out of energy, you will be doomed to roam through the cave in darkness forever.", "summary": "This edutainment game for the Commodore 64 required players to spell specific words in order to progress through the titular Wizard's cave. Successfully spelling words gives the player name-brand adhesive bandages useful for treating snake bites and scorpion stings. Failing to spell words correctly causes the wizard to drain energy from your flashlight. The game ends when you run out of bandages, run out of light, or if you can successfully collect all four crystals and escape the cave. \n \nThe game impressively relied on the Commodore 64's ability to produce recorded voice clips. Whether it did so successfully is a matter of debate.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cave-of-the-word-wizard", "videos": [{"id": 46866, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lQGTMu1aV3A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQGTMu1aV3A", "title": "Let's Play BLIND: Cave of the Word Wizard (C64)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lQGTMu1aV3A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
