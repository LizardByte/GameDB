In there, we found magical gems that held tremendous power that were named Kryxit by the founders.\n\nAfter hearing the news, every great empire on the continent sent groups of mercenaries across the globe to get a hold of the precious magical resource, at the same time lone adventurers tried their shots at glory, power and fame.\n\nSoon after, a city formed around the entrance of the mine \u201cKryxivia\u201d. The city is surrounded by mountains and a lot of people went there to live and find healtyness: Mercenaries, merchants, traders: everyone who thinks they could\npotentially live directly from the exploitation.\n\nThe mysterious mine, situated behind a huge door on the mountain flank, is a seemingly infinite source of Kryxit which are hodl and kept secret by guardians; some groups of monsters, dragons and other creatures living in the mine are\nprotecting the ecosystem.\n\nThere are three big factions that contest the possessions of Kryxit that are only at peace because war would disrupt the extraction of the magical resource, but be sure that the tension is constant between them.\n\nInside \u201cKryxivia\u201d, you will find a new and blooming city with all your needs to join into the fight and try to take Kryxits from the mine!\nThe city is built mostly by several different peoples, by small groups of adventurers and merchants.\n\nThe buildings of the city reveal the remains of the three different factions as well as other adventurers sent from other countries, which gives a very heterogeneous architectural mix. This is what makes \u201cKryxivia\u201d a unique capital", "summary": "Kryxivia is a fantasy 3D MMORPG game directly available on our website at kryxivia.io, a whole eco-system awaiting new adventurous players to collect Kryxit!
