Once the ships are ready, the survivors prepare to evacuate Earth. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport gets taken over by the demons, who place a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.", "summary": "Doom II: Hell on Earth is a first-person shooter developed by id Software and released in 1994 as a sequel to the original Doom. The game continues the story, with players battling through Earth after it has been invaded by demonic forces.\n\nGameplay remains similar to its predecessor, featuring fast-paced combat, maze-like levels, and an array of weapons, including the introduction of the powerful Super Shotgun. Doom II also adds new enemy types, such as the Arch-vile and the Mancubus, increasing the game's challenge.\n\nInitially released for MS-DOS, Doom II has since been ported to numerous platforms, becoming a cornerstone of the FPS genre.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doom-ii-hell-on-earth", "videos": [{"id": 49289, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BSKJ3NLhnug", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSKJ3NLhnug", "title": "Doom 2 gameplay (PC Game, 1994)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BSKJ3NLhnug/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 276, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "DowUYd43N2M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DowUYd43N2M", "title": "DOOM 2 Map 03", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DowUYd43N2M/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
