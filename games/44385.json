It is a Satellaview-compatible Slotted Cartridge game belonging to ASCII's Tsuk\u016bru series. The title of these games are portmanteau-word puns mixing the Japanese word tsukuru (\u4f5c\u308b), which means \"make\" or \"create\", with ts\u016bru (\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb), the Japanese transcription of the English word \"tool\". As the title suggests, this title is a music creation tool.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ongaku-tsukuuru-kanadeeru"}
