The game begins with the player character wounded and beaten up by the Kingpin's henchmen, and the story follows his thirst for revenge. Released shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, the game attracted controversy which led it to be dropped from various retailers, despite receiving moderate critical acclaim.\n\nThe soundtrack for Kingpin was provided by the rap group Cypress Hill, and featured three tracks from their album IV. They were:\n\n- 16 Men Till There's No Men Left\n- Checkmate\n- Lightning Strikes\n\nAlongside the full versions of these tracks, instrumental versions with the vocals removed were used as backing tracks. Cypress Hill also provided some of the voice acting for the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kingpin-life-of-crime", "videos": [{"id": 24942, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YO5yVJaw2pU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO5yVJaw2pU", "title": "Kingpin: Life of Crime - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YO5yVJaw2pU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 24978, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "6FL3DN8aTAE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FL3DN8aTAE", "title": "Kingpin - Life of Crime 1999 PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6FL3DN8aTAE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
