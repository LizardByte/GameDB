The only chance to get back to the top of the food chain is to destroy humanity.\n\nStart in a small town where you try to destroy literally everything, like people, cars or other birds. Indeed, you will have plenty of destruction options, in addition to using your own feces, you can also use other items such as a chair or a grenade. You can also carry things, including people. In addition to these insanities do not forget your needs, once in a while you have to eat or drink. Earn points and unlock other birds.\n\nWarning\n\nIf you expect a serious game, you better buy something else. This is pure bird madness.\n\nFeatures\n- You can unlock 6 more birds and change them during the game\n- Play multiplayer with friends or singleplayer alone :(\n- Get points for destroying cars, attacking people and killing enemies\n- Survival system - you have to look for water and food\n- Lots of items to destroy everything around. You can find them on the ground or steal them from other birds\n- You can also use your feces as an offensive weapon\n- Mini games like football or basketball even with a table of top players\n- Fun ragdoll physics\n- Or you can just fly like a bird ;)", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
