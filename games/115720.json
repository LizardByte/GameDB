The blazing sun has dried up everything, from the river to the grass. Even the big region plants struggle to find enough ressources to flourish. \n \n \nAbuchi, a nomad that travels through this desert has found a region plant seedling, and wants to find a place in which it could flourish. She must find a way to revive the desert and make it a place in which life springs. \n \n \nBut, in INITEN, life and sounds are closely related. Indeed, sound can be compared to a sort of life energy. This specificity is going to be very useful for our character Abuchi. Our hero has a very special and unique ability : she can see sounds. \n \n \nEach sound Abuchi can hear is visible as a colorful fluid shape evolving in the environment, near the source of the sounds. For example: imagine, a bird singing. Not only can you hear the sound, you can also see it. Those sounds can be used as a sort of special energy to revive lifeless vegetation!", "summary": "INITEN is a third-person exploration experience in which sound plays an important part!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/initen", "videos": [{"id": 25235, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SbWLfiW9PQ0"}]}
