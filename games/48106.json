The game is played through 12 levels, the first four in a backyard, the next four in a swamp, and the last four inside a house. There are traps and enemies added for each level, from ants, grasshoppers, and even dragonflies and \"venus flytraps\" in the later levels. The player must find and collect from many flowers scattered all over the sidescrolling level and return to the hive after three flowers are visited to add honey to the jar. The level is complete when the jar is full, in the case of levels 3-12, this requires every flower to be visited.", "summary": "You're about to find out just what's involved for a young bee with a day-job. Gigantic spiders, sneaky ants and loathsome slugs are just a few of the meanies who'll get in your way when you're bee number 52. You're hardly defenseless though, and with enough speed, skill and firepower you may get through the day - despite being heavily outnumbered. Let your nose, or rather proboscis, lead the way to the flowers and don't let anyone - or anything - get in your way! B52 - you're cleared for take off!\n\nBee 52 is a side-scrolling video game published by Codemasters for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.\n\nA Commodore 64 version was completed in 1993, but was not published due to Codemasters withdrawing from the C64 market. After reaching an agreement with Codemasters, the programmer sold the game himself via mail order.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bee-52", "videos": [{"id": 53505, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gnt9CIE84gs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnt9CIE84gs", "title": "Bee 52 NES - Real-Time Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gnt9CIE84gs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
