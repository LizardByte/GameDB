However, the network eventually gives birth (possibly by accident) to an A.I. entity called Innocent Cloud, which proceeds to take over the network, following it up with an attack on humanity by using a virus. In response, a team of warriors immune to the virus, nicknamed Synthetics, are developed to fight back against Innocent Cloud. The struggle proves to be a long-term stalemate, however, partially due to humanity having lost all their advanced technology to Innocent Cloud and having no means of contacting each other over long distances. This also means that they struggle to trust the Synthetics that were sworn to protect them.", "summary": "Black\u2605Rock Shooter: Fragment is a mobile title based on the popular Japanese IP \"Black\u2605Rock Shooter\" featuring a new setting and introducing new characters to the franchise.\n\nThe game will end its online services on the 1st of March, 2024.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/black-rock-shooter-fragment", "videos": [{"id": 103744, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "198JfVBK4Uw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=198JfVBK4Uw", "title": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u2605\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc FRAGMENT\uff5c\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/198JfVBK4Uw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 103745, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "ACmaz3pVFFk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmaz3pVFFk", "title": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u2605\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc FRAGMENT\uff5c\u30c6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u7b2c1\u5f3e", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ACmaz3pVFFk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 103746, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bFcG3OFdKR4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFcG3OFdKR4", "title": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u2605\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc FRAGMENT\uff5c\u4f53\u9a13\u7248\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFcG3OFdKR4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
