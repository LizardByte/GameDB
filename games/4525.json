Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a \"Skins\" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/andre-agassi-tennis", "videos": [{"id": 31444, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "MBpKpROtUKo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBpKpROtUKo", "title": "Andre Agassi Tennis - Sega Megadrive Gameplay - 1992", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MBpKpROtUKo/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 43193, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "h0aeDmq8SLQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0aeDmq8SLQ", "title": "Andre Agassi Tennis (SNES)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0aeDmq8SLQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
