Meen). The game is said to be based off of a Fred Levine Production video from 1991 that's also called \"Road Construction Ahead\".\n\nI just happen to have a physical CD-ROM copy of this game in my computer game collection that I've kept for so many years, and while I did try installing the game, it doesn't work, since I have a Windows 10 and this game was built for Windows 95 computers. Maybe one day when I have the time I could get VirtualBox to run it on there. So, I decided to do a little bit of file digging inside the disk to see if I could find anything. Then I came across the game's \"MEDIA\" folder. It contained a LOT of audio files, as well as a handful of video files. However, all of the audio files do not have a file extension, so I had to properly convert all of those audio files to .WAV through a specific converter that's able to support audio with no file extension. The end result is nearly 30 minutes of audio for the game.\n\nI don't think YouTube has documented much of the game, so here you go.\n\nVideo clips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0xQ7manQQk", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28B7VhvXNXg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28B7VhvXNXg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/28B7VhvXNXg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Road Construction Ahead (PC, 1996) - All Sound Files", "description": "NOTE: Each of the groups of audio are labeled by the respective folder names that they were stored in (such as \"GLOBAL\" and \"SIM\").\n\nRoad Construction Ahead is practically an educational PC game from 1996, published by Simon & Schuster Interactive (most known to YTP folks like me as the publishers of I.M.
