The objective of Erectus the Game is to create your own empire, build a powerful army and eventually defeat and capture the cruel king of the Erectus. The endgame is the final stage of a gameworld in Erectus. During the endgame volcanoes on the map will become active as the Erectus king starts his ritual. \n \n \nErectus version 2 utilizes the Unity engine which aligned perfectly with our vision for version 2. While the Canvas engine worked well for what we were trying to achieve with version 1, we felt that it was necessary to find something better suited to our desire to create something that would be an upgrade in every way. We've worked hard on improving the game's visuals, interface, stability and accessibility. We hope players will be pleasantly surprised with all of the improvements to their player experience in Erectus version 2!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/erectus-the-game"}
