In it, you'll adventure across an island that's begun to sink for mysterious reasons. The residents of the island's main village tell you that their legends say the power of the god of the island is what keeps the island afloat.\n\nThe god of the island lives in a shrine at the top of the mountain, but that shrine has been sealed off by a huge stone door for longer than anyone in the village can remember. If there was a way to open that door and speak with the island's guardian, the island might be saved, but noone on the island has been strong or courageous enough to brave the island's wilderness in search of a way to unseal the door...until now!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maple-forest--1"}
