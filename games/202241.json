It stars two characters, Nonoka and Kiribana. The point of the game is to sleep in the bed and collect effects while dreaming. You always start off as Nonoka but can switch characters at any point. In Nonoka's bedroom, there is a music box where the player can access a sound test with unlockable tracks. In Kiribana's bedroom there is a minigame on her bookshelf called Little RPG.\n\nMost of the time, it doesn't really matter which character the player controls, since the dream worlds are the same for both characters and effects are even shared in both of their inventories once collected. However there are a few situations where one character can do one thing where the other refuses or is unable to do the same thing.\n\nAlong with collecting effects, there are 3 additional menu types to be found hidden throughout the dream world.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blooms"}
