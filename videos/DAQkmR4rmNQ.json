{"id": "DAQkmR4rmNQ", "snippet": {"title": "(PC-98) Dragon Half - Microcabin - Gameplay and Card Battle System Explanation", "description": "A short gameplay sample showing the battle system of this crazy card-based RPG based on the anime and manga series by Ry\u016bsuke Mita. If you are a fan of the anime or manga, this game and the one for PC-Engine Super CD-Rom, also developed by Microcabin, are real treats to play.\n\nIn this video I get a chance to take on the following boss character battles: \n\nDamaramu\nGreen Demon Boss\nPrincess Vina and Summoned Golem\nRosario\n\nThe game is a lot of fun but I guess it does have a bit of a monster encounter problem. I noticed this a little later in the game in King Siva's castle that there are a lot of finding / pressing switches, so I can see how having a high monster encounter rate could be annoying for those puzzles. I can see how it can get annoying having to stop for a battle every few steps.\n\nCard Battle System:\n\nIt's kind of like Poker mixed with UNO as far as colors are concerned and being able to sometimes change all of your cards to a certain color. First you can only use the same type of card, and you can only use that card if they are next to each other. So if your hand was A A H A A, where A is attack card and H is heal card, you could do two A cards, the ones on either side of H\nHowever, if you used a Heal card during this turn, the next time you could do A A A A + new card that is dealt in place of the card you used. There are colors on the attack cards and a pair of these colors, triple or full house will do much more damage / critical hits. Bonus modifiers on damage and health depend on levels gained from EXP.\n\nThen they have Wild Cards that can be anything, and any color and Comic cards which are useful as they are funny. Comic cards will interrupt anything that the opponent is about to do, cancelling them out completely and making them trip on their own ass during an attack causing damage to them. It's great when you want to avoid an attack or cause them to not be able to heal.\n\nAlso, you can see what your opponent is choosing. So if they choose Comic, you should try to minimize your next action so your all out attack or heal is not cancelled. Also a Comic card will cancel out a Comic card. But the caveat to waiting is that they get to go first before you now if you wait it out to see what they do. You have 5 seconds to decide or one of the other party members will choose whatever card you happen to be highlighting. Like \"Hey choose one already, let's just use this one!\". They get impatient. :)\n\nAnyhow, I think this is a great game worthy of a fan-translation one day and it's on my list of games I want to work on. If anyone is a translator and a fan of Dragon Half, please contact me and maybe we can work together on it! I own a real copy of the game, so the manual could be scanned and translated as well so that all game mechanics are fully understood.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAQkmR4rmNQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAQkmR4rmNQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAQkmR4rmNQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAQkmR4rmNQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAQkmR4rmNQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "(PC-98) Dragon Half - Microcabin - Gameplay and Card Battle System Explanation", "description": "A short gameplay sample showing the battle system of this crazy card-based RPG based on the anime and manga series by Ry\u016bsuke Mita.
