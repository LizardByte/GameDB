Gameplay-wise, maps are mostly slaughter-y, with some of them on the side of macroslaughter and others being much more compact. Inspirations for my maps vary wildly, but mostly take from music and other art that I like outside of Doom.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/i-cant-give-you-any-thing"}
