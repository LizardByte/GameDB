Human civilization has been devastated by a malevolent force known only as the Darkness and only the last remnants of humanity remain. Playing the role of Locke, a young adventurer determined to save his people, you'll discover a world where your choices have consequences and every victory comes with a price. Can you discover the origin of the Darkness and stop it once and for all, or will you succumb to its influence, dooming Legionwood to destruction.\n\nHeroes of Legionwood consists of two separate halves, Age of Darkness and Resurrection. Either installment can be played on its own, but the two will combine to form one epic adventure.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heroes-of-legionwood", "videos": [{"id": 77906, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bFTpUndnItw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFTpUndnItw", "title": "Heroes of Legionwood - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFTpUndnItw/sddefault.jpg"}]}
