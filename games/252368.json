It was designed by Nigel Rowand (Enjay) and uses the music track \"Les Chants Magn\u00e9tiques Part 2\" by Jean-Michel Jarre, sequenced to MIDI.\n\nApart from a brief introductory scene at a train station, the entire map is set on a moving train which is on a collision course and going to crash in three minutes, giving the player limited time to get a key from one end of the train and return.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/runaway-train--1"}
