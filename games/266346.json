His eight tentacles swirled with hunger, and he swatted pirate ships by accident.\n\nOne day, a pirate ship sailed into view. Kiko's eyes gleamed, and he playfully tapped it. Pirates yelled, but the colossal cephalopod just wanted a snack. With a slurp and a gulp, he gobbled up their vessel!\n\nBut Kiko's hunger didn't stop. More pirate ships came, and Kiko's reputation grew and to this day, he is devouring the hulls of the ships (and yes, sparing the lives of the crew as he shakes them out first, like little seeds from an apple).
