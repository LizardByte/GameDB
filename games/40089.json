However, holding down the button will charge the pistol (much like Alice's bubble blower in M\u00e4rchen Maze and Apollo's sword in Phelios), and upon releasing the button the pistol will fire a medium or large cannonball; but even the smallest enemies take multiple hits to kill, so the small cannonballs are of little use.\n\nThere is also blue (and yellow) vases which can be broken open with a medium (or large) cannonball, and will leave Hanafuda cards behind, for Pistol Daimyo to collect - and once he has collected three of them, it will cause a Kusudama ball to come down into view from the top of the screen (which can also be broken open with a medium or large cannonball). If he manages to do that before it goes back up off the top of the screen again, it will leave a suit of wooden (or metal if you already have the wooden one) armour behind; once he has put it on, it will prevent him from being killed in a single hit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pistol-daimyo-no-bouken"}
