As its name suggests, it was made to teach second grade students. It was replaced by JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade in 2002.\n\nLike the previous JumpStart products, the game takes place in a school setting, but begins after school hours when a giant anthropomorphic frog named C.J. enters the classroom and frees a firefly named Edison. C.J. and Edison (Newton in the United Kingdom) form a double act of sorts with C.J. being an ardent, self-styled \"adventurer\" while Edison is the more pragmatic straight man, who frequently makes sardonic comments in response to C.J.'s grandiosity. The duo have appeared in many other JumpStart products, such as JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade; however, their looks and personalities have both undergone enormous changes throughout the years.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
