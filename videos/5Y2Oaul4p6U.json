Our next minor update 1.0.2 of Joumee The Hedgehog game is live and it brings even more shiny coins to collect! Also, today we introduce new and tricky - wrecked type of platforms with Magnet Power-Ups that are a bit harder to get as you will need to swoop down under the platforms and quickly jump out of them accurately to get them! We also squeezed some nasty bugs and did some minor optimizations and fixes to UI. Hopefully, without introducing new bugs :)\n\nFull list of improvements:\n\n- Two new wrecked platforms with Power-Ups\n- There are more coins now and they appear more often.\n- Bug when ground enemies were sometimes able to make double damage is fixed.\n- Some minor UI issues causing menu screens sometimes to overlap is fixed.\n\nOh and one more thing :) We want to thank all of you for support and valuable feedback! If you have any questions, suggestions or you just.. you know, feel a bit lonely, please don\u2019t hesitate to leave us a message in the discussions area. We would be glad to help and communicate :) Let us know what you think about this update!\nStay tuned - more cool things to come soon!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Y2Oaul4p6U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Y2Oaul4p6U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Y2Oaul4p6U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Y2Oaul4p6U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5Y2Oaul4p6U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Minor Update 1.0.2 \u2013 Tricky Wrecked Platforms!", "description": "Get Joumee The Hedgehog on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/673220/Joumee_The_Hedgehog/\n\nHey friends!
