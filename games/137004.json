There's a lot of Pokemon to meet and different things to try, so take your time and have fun with it! \n \nThis game is fun if you explore it and find some of the surprises for yourself. But there are also some things you might not understand. Be cautious if you choose to collaborate with other players in the comments below; you might find spoilers which make your experience less enjoyable. Happy puzzling~ \n \nYour game should save after every level, but this save file could be lost if your temporary files get deleted. If you want to make sure you don't lose your progress, I have included a password feature. On the Options screen on the main menu, you can view your name and password. When starting a new game, you can tell Grovyle your name and password to continue your progress. All of the Pokemon you've met will remember you, and you will retain any items you have purchased.\" \n- MonsterMind's itch.io page", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monstermind"}
