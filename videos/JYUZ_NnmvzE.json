Tough encounters throughout and constant attention-dividing pins. Resources are tight on higher difficulty settings and there are no quads to help you! Lots of secrets and a good amount of non-linearity packed into a small space but it never feels awkward or uncomfortably cramped.\n\nInterestingly, this map has different monster set-ups on all difficulties up to and including evil, which i've never seen done before. A great challenge blind and very fun to blitz through when you've got it all figured out.\n\nYoutube has decided to starve the bitrate on all my videos so they look really bad now. I think it's because I broke a rule last september. Oh well, who gives a damn.\n\nRecorded with vkquake 1.11.0\nDownload xmas jam 2021 https://www.moddb.com/mods/arcane-dimensions/addons/xmasjam2021", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYUZ_NnmvzE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYUZ_NnmvzE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYUZ_NnmvzE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYUZ_NnmvzE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYUZ_NnmvzE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Quake] Xmas Jam 2021 - xmj21_krampus \"Dichromatic Abomination\" Evil 100%", "description": "Another masterpiece of a map by the talented 'Krampus'.
