The Centipede moves across the screen and when it reaches the other side it moves down one place and moves back across the screen. You control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen shooting the Centipede whilst moving left or right, as well being able to move forwards and backwards a short distance. Shooting the Centipede a number of times splits it into two and the other parts split into two when shot a number of times.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
