There is some semblance of a difficulty curve, both within each episode and for the megawad in general. Certainly map 30 is a bit harder than map 1.\n\nAll difficulty settings are supported. UV is the primary difficulty for those who want a challenge, and HNTR was designed to be a more casual experience. HMP is somewhere in between and may not be as well balanced as the other two.\n\nPistol starts are enforced through MBF21 death exits. There are no secrets besides the exits on maps 15/31.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-slaughter"}
