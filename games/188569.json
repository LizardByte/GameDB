In different parts of the garden, the child learns to recognize colors and shapes, compare sizes, evaluate the mutual position of objects, count objects and solve simple tasks requiring logical thinking. In some games single skills are practiced, in others - several at once. Alik patiently explains how to do the task, praises the successes and says when the child has made a mistake."}
