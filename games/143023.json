Due to this sudden act, they were banished from the region, then later disbanded.\nPresent day, you and your friend go on a journey with two characters, a kind girl named Myrtle, and a mysterious, aggressive, and sword-wielding girl nicknamed Blade. You travel through the Caracara region, still feeling the effects of the Island Protection Squad all those years ago.\n\nWith the new region, brings a whole new story!
