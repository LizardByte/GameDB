The gameplay has many similarities to MMORPGs, though it is not an online game, including the ability to buy and upgrade weapons, go on missions, and fight in a group with other characters. The game follows an alternate storyline from the end of the first arc of the original story, in which a glitch causes Kirito and the other players to remain in Sword Art Online despite defeating Heathcliff, and players from other VMMORPGs such as Leafa and Sinon get sucked into the game themselves. Its sequel game Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment includes all its content.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sword-art-online-infinity-moment", "videos": [{"id": 5345, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-Mbi9oGHp0g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mbi9oGHp0g", "title": "\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30c8\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 \u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u30fb\u30e2\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 PV \u7b2c\u4e09\u5f3e!!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Mbi9oGHp0g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
