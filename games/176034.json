It was a third-person perspective action and exploration game starring a female protagonist.\n\nThe game was only shown once, and then was delayed several times before being dropped, with very few details provided. However, it is believed that Bits Studios later used elements from RiQa in its multiformat 2003 title Rogue Ops.\n\nSome prototype builds were dumped and released onto the internet on April 2024.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/riqa"}
