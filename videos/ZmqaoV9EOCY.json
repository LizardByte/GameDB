Cityglitch is a shimmery pixel puzzler with simple movement and deep challenge. \n\nTake turns moving around the board as glitches move and react to you. If a glitch catches you it will restart the level, but don't worry, with each attempt you'll learn more clues to complete it. Cityglitch starts with simple puzzles but ramps up quickly to challenge you!\n\nDeveloper Note:\nMindfungus is four friends making games together. We like to make small games with our weird art and music. If you like retro puzzle games with vibrant pixels, simple movement and devious challenge then Cityglitch is for you.\n\nIf you have any problems playing the game or just want to say hi then hit us up on the forums, twitter, or our website.
