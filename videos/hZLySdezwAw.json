The goal of each game is to score points by building a platform level one piece at a time (per player) and race each other to a flag on the other side of the level. Players add obstacles designed to challenge their opponents, while also making sure they themselves can handle their handiwork.\n\nPoints are awarded each round for various achievements, such as reaching the goal first, or setting a successful trap. The winner of the match is the player who reaches a set number of points or has the most points after a set number of rounds. Each round is estimated to last a minute.\n\nLikes and Comments are always appreciated! :)\n\nPre Order Ultimate Chicken Horse A-Neigh-Versary Edition Here - https://electricgames.co.uk/products/ultimate-chicken-horse-a-neigh-versary-edition-nintendo-switch?_pos=1&_sid=311e88fb4&_ss=r\n\nSupport the Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPP8uwW_AHGggkJ2Wg7M9ug\n\nFind Other Trailers Here - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSox11kuChJOUaRPvIr3RXej-B1OAsboP\n\nFind Other Types Of Videos Here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPP8uwW_AHGggkJ2Wg7M9ug/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2\n\n----------------------------\n\nSocial Media:\n\nOur Official Website - https://electricgames.co.uk/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/electricgamesltd/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/electricgamesco\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/ElectricGames.co.uk\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/yvQSjZUFTD\n\n----------------------------\n\nCopyright Message:\n\nI do not claim to own the rights to any of the art, video clips or music used throughout this video or its thumbnail.
