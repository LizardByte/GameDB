Codes consist of three numbers. After each guess of the player, the computer answers fermi (one digit is at the right position), pico (one digit is in the code but on a different position), or bagels (none of the digits are correct). The goal is to guess the number in as few tries as possible, so players must use the answers to infer the right code.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bagels"}
