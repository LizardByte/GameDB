Today we're gonna play a some sort of Spellcard Collection - that's Maiden's Exhibition! Kinda not-so-popular script, but has many creative spellcards. I hope you'll enjoy it~ ^^\n\n\u272a If you enjoyed my video, leave a like, comment or even share, and subscribe to my channel to be always up-to-date! Thanks! ^^ \u272a\n\nMaiden's Exhibition is one of the forgotten (unfortunately; maybe I'm wrong.) scripts that actually are pretty gooood. I started playing that at November 2016, then forgot about it for some time due to the impossibility (really...?) of some of them. And now, with some score tactics used I finally decided to upload my awesome runs :D\n\n----------\nHere the spellcards have the difficulty indicator, where 1* is Super Duper Easy, 3* is Normal, 6* is a real Lunatic and last 8* spellcards are Ultra+. While the easier ones can be easily grazed (thus done better in terms of scoring), these on 6*-8* are barely doable and even scoreable.\n\nGrazing increase the final score. Every 5 graze increase the output score by 0.01x of primary value. Of course, in order not to overuse it, there's a score cap that equals 2x starting score. Nice thing, dev xd\n\n\nAlso there is something called \"Final Rank\" - the thing that should be the motivator here for everybody that play that. It shows you how much progress you made, in terms of beating all those attacks, and the efficiency.\n\nThe ranks can be from I-G, then F-A, including F+, E+, A+ etc., and finally ranks S, S+ and SS.\nLast three ranks requires from you beating ALL THE SPELLCARDS with both characters - Reimu and Marisa - and getting a really high scores == getting much graze on all spellcard.\n- (I made for the S rank, and it's rather a nice feat ^^) -\nActually, besides the amount of beaten spellcards and their difficulty, the SCORES really counts for getting the better rank, so on the first two parts (1* to 5*) you will see the pro's way to beat those pesky attacks.\n\n-----\nDownload: http://www.bulletforge.org/u/lidera/p/maidens-exhibition\nGrand fangames list (check it if you want more!): http://nazr.in/11ww\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CreepyNinja_\nCheck out our Discord server!
