It features photographic images of both Japanese and western models. The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.\n\nTo complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and moves dramatically towards the monster side whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette. Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar. If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fantasia"}
