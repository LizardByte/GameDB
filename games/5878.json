But - the screen is full of splitters, dozens of caves in which the ball may hide, bumpers that will kick the ball around the playfield, red arrows that will accelerate the ball to unbelievable speeds and magnets that will pull the ball towards them. And more and more...", "summary": "Ballistix is a video game created by Martin Edmondson for the Amiga and Atari ST and published by Psyclapse in 1989. It was also converted to a number of other home computers in the same year and the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 console in 1991. It is a fictional futuristic sport involving directing a puck to a goal by shooting small balls at it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ballistix", "videos": [{"id": 2172, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "o4nLeC6ooK8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4nLeC6ooK8", "title": "Ballistix (amiga)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4nLeC6ooK8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
