Sit back, relax, and enjoy the thrill of ripping around on one of the coolest sleds, speeding between trees and throwing it around at the ridges. The limits are only set by you, so let loose and show us what you can accomplish! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\n\nSledders offers a massive map for you to explore and play around in. Steep hills, mountains, lots of trees, and open areas are ready to be ridden by you (yeah, there's plenty of jumps, and even water... splash!). It'll take ages for you to ride from one corner to another; that's how big the map already is. And stay tuned because our plans include bigger, better, and many more maps to come (we hear you, ditch bangers, snow crossers, tricksters, trail riders, and all!) \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f\n\nThe snow in Sledders feels as real as possible, so sharpen up your powder skills or you'll just keep on digging deeper into the snow! Freeriding in backcountries means a lot of snow to plow, and riding in it is way different than on other terrains. Master the steering by shifting your weight around, making turns with your throttle, counter steering with your skis, and many other new skills. Once you master the skills needed in the backcountries, you're unstoppable, and no pow will make you stuck. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f\n\nFeatures:\n\u2705 Freeride snowmobile simulator with real-world physics in deep-snow backcountry\n\u2705 Ride with and against your friends in an epic freeriding experience\n\u2705 Online multiplayer takes you on a ride around the world with a like-minded community of sledheads. \ud83c\udf0d\u2744\ufe0f", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DD2OyX1a6-8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DD2OyX1a6-8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DD2OyX1a6-8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DD2OyX1a6-8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DD2OyX1a6-8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sledders | Official Early Access Trailer", "description": "Shred now on Steam:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2486740/Sledders/\n\n\nShred your sled in the radical open-world backcountries!
