The Voyager message was carried by a phonograph record, a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth. Message received.\n\n200 years later. Planet Corot, one of the few habitable worlds discovered in the second age of space exploration, houses a military research facility where a super secret project known as XR-110 is being commissioned. A giant combat mech capable of interstellar travel is the brainchild of Dr. Lincoln Maverick, the last hope for humanity to resist the wrath of The Toliman Empire.\n\nA group of spies from Proxima Centauri swiftly discover that XR-110 is extraterrestrial in its design as well. The mech, that soon will set the galaxy on fire, is a long-lost relic from the Toliman\u2019s past. The Empire launches a surprise attack on Planet Corot before Dr. Maverick manages to refurbish the mech. In order to secure the ancient weapon all forces are thrown into battle.\n\nCorot is scorched in mere seconds. General Scaph launches the assault and assumes control over the planet. Before the research facility is levelled to the ground and Dr. Maverick and his team fight off the aliens until the last breath, Lt. Brooklyn Landers of The Earth Confederation Defence Force mans the mech and escapes the facility unharmed.\n\nLt. Landers, reckless and diffident, unwillingly shoulders the fate of humanity. General Scaph, now enraged, orders The Toliman Empire forces to pursue and annihilate the Space Runaway.", "summary": "Space Runaway, a compelling intergalactic journey soaked in bullet hell.
