The game first appeared only in Japan on Nintendo's Super Famicom (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System).\n\nIt has been ported with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. It was released for the PlayStation Network on April 6, 2011 in Japan.\n\nThe game begins as a wanderer named Bartz (Butz) investigates a fallen meteor. There, he encounters several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements. These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. Bartz and his party must keep the Crystals from being exploited by Exdeath's influence and prevent his resurgence.\n\nFinal Fantasy V has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite the lack of an early release in territories other than Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies. The PlayStation version has earned Greatest Hits\" status, selling more than 350,000 copies.\n\nMY COMMENT: Between Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 6, two very successful and well known entries in the series that make up the Super Nintendo trilogy of genre defining JRPG's lies this game... whilst it is not known plotwise as one of the best, however the characters are memorable especially the main character Butz,\nGilgamesh the series most popular mid boss especially for his theme and Exdeath... an evil tree no literally he is a evil tree with the most annoying final boss form since Cloud of Darkness especially with Grand Cross... god-damn.\n\nNow originally this was a mess uploaded as I originally had an XP computer which didn't have room for this file... but now I present all of you with a director's cut that includes all parts recorded, not one area has been skipped and I've collected everything I could.\nI will offer the excuse of levelling up off-screen at certain moments and I attempted to follow the same methods that Parazzing did for Final Fantasy IV. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0RtcAi94bQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0RtcAi94bQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z0RtcAi94bQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [281]  Final Fantasy V (part 1 of 7)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Tarosan\n\nFinal Fantasy V is a medieval-fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) in 1992 as a part of the Final Fantasy series.
