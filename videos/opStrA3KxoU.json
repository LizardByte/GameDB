SO here it is, I present my entry into the RGCD 16Kb competition 2019: Doc Cosmos\n\nI learned a lot about pixel art making this game and its inspired me to make a sequel already, although this time Doc will be packing weapons and the game will be packing waaaaay more than 16kb. (I'm probably also going to enlist some help for music, i found this the most difficult)\n\nStory: \nDoc Cosmos is on the search for a powerful alien device that is rumoured to be able to allow the user to time travel. He arrives on the alien planet to begin his quest to obtain the device but soon gets stuck in the underground complex.\n\nUse the device to switch between timelines to change Docs control scheme and alter the scenery in order to progress through the complex and find a way out. Search for keys to open the multitude of doors blocking Docs way. With your help Doc can get out with the device and begin his adventures in time!\n\nFeatures:\n- Large map with 47 screens and two versions of each one!\n- Timeline system, switch between different timelines and change the scenery\n- Dual Control system, Doc controls differently in each timeline Excellent environment setup video from Stepz: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP36Cn2rRDU\n\nSupport me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/evolutegames\n\nFind my games on itch.io:\nhttps://shallan64.itch.io/\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/EvoluteGames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/opStrA3KxoU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/opStrA3KxoU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/opStrA3KxoU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/opStrA3KxoU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/opStrA3KxoU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Doc Cosmos - C64 RGCD 16K competition entry 2019 - Free Download link in description!", "description": "https://shallan64.itch.io/doc-cosmos\n\nI decided to finally finish coding a C64 game and what better motivation than being limited to 16Kb.
