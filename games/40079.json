The player must use the four-way joystick, to direct the eponymous \"Macho Mouse\" around a maze, leaving a trail of dots behind him as he goes (like Pac-Man in reverse), and causing images of his head to appear while avoiding cats that will kill him on contact - but as in Konami's Amidar, Macho Mouse can jump by means of a button and stun the cats for a short period of time. Between rounds, there is a \"slot machine\" similar to that of Chuo Co., Ltd.'s Funny Mouse (later re-released by Taito Corporation, as \"Super Mouse\").", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/macho-mouse", "videos": [{"id": 106747, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HaCtPIlLExI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaCtPIlLExI", "title": "Macho Mouse [Arcade Longplay] (1982) Techstar", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HaCtPIlLExI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
