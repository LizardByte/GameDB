Because of its single-player elements, Four Swords Adventures is also the first game in the series to allow a single player to control more than one Link at once, and it utilizes various methods to allow the player to make use of the four Links, such as formations. Also it is the only title to break locations and temples up into succinct, separate stages and levels which can be replayed even after beating them once. The game itself, though an innovation in Zelda gameplay, is heavily inspired by the music, graphics, and locations of A Link to the Past.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 29123, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1AZMO5iBeDg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AZMO5iBeDg", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures Gamecube Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1AZMO5iBeDg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
