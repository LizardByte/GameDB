There are four colored lines of blocks, and each line has an electronic demon. The electronic demons can replace removed blocks when charged. They'll be charged by touching either sides of the screen. After placing a block, they'll lose the charge, and if they try to cross a gap uncharged, they'll fall and reappear after a penalty time."}
