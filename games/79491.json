Spins give you the power to dictate whether you will use them yourself, to increase your total prize money, or force them on others in the hopes they will land on a Whammy. One Whammy will erase a contestant's score, and four will remove them from the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/press-your-luck--1"}
