Humans reached the stars long ago, building a Republic of high technology and universal emancipation\u2014and then squandered it, fought over it, and finally lost it.\n\nA New Dark Age has descended upon humanity, for the greatest of civilizations has fallen and now even the stars are dying. Feudal lords rule the Known Worlds, vying for power with fanatic priests and scheming guilds.\n\nIn 4550 AD, Vladimir I, the first Emperor of the Known Worlds, crowned himself with his own hands and by the Grace of Holy Terra. He was dead within moments. The Regency is vacant and all humanity is preparing to elect a new Regent. But times are changing.\n\nThe mysterious fading of all the suns of the Known Worlds is accelerating, causing increased hardship and a general sense of foreboding. The Fading Suns are a portent, it is said, of coming Armageddon.\n\nEach of the Royal Houses can trace its ancestry to the time of Grand Emperor Vladimir, who consolidated the fragments of the Second Republic into one might Imperium. As ordered by the Great Charter, in the event of an Emperor's death, human space was to be ruled by an interim Regent. However, no Regent has been able to harness enough power to declare himself Emperor. In the meanwhile, the Regency has become a means to loot the Imperium.\n\nMany feel that the human race needs strong, dedicated leadership to face the uncertain future - a selfless leader willing to take a personal interest in the fate of the Imperium. But the Regent has been a mere figurehead, who can at most discourage inter-human conflict. Humanity's only solution is to make the position of Regent a hereditary one, to once again have it called by its ancient name - Emperor. Then the future of the entire Empire will be the overriding concern of the Emperor, instead of just the short-sighted good of his own House.\n\nCan you lead your noble house, be it selfless Hawkwood, debauched Decados, scheming al-Malik, pious Li Halan or militant Hazat, to final victory? Will you return humanity to its once-shining glory? Dare you to become Emperor of the Fading Suns?", "summary": "Emperor of the Fading Suns is a science fiction \"grand-scale\" space strategy computer game made by Holistic Design in 1996. This game was based on Holistic's in-house role playing game Fading Suns. The game had a wide array of units and a complex back-story but was rushed to market and released with numerous severe flaws and several features underdeveloped. In patched form, it survives as a popular abandonware title with numerous unofficial, fan-made mods.[citation needed]", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/emperor-of-the-fading-suns", "videos": [{"id": 122752, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "t5ZtHphQWt4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ZtHphQWt4", "title": "Emperor of the Fading Suns Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t5ZtHphQWt4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 122753, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TVbEj_fpPdY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVbEj_fpPdY", "title": "Emperor of the Fading Suns Gameplay - Starting an Empire", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TVbEj_fpPdY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
