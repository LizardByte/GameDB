Renowned for its explosive 3D graphics and high intensity gameplay, Under Defeat features no less than three game modes offering high levels of replayability, all of which have been integrated under supervision of G.rev.\n\nArcade Mode faithfully replicates the original arcade experience, with a 4:3 ratio and a pseudo vertical screen. New Order Mode adapts the game for modern displays, transforming the adrenaline packed shooting action to widescreen 16:9 ratio, and New Order Mode+ brings a host of additional elements to the game, not least being a \u201cWARNING GAUGE,\u201d which adds a risk/reward mechanic to assist the player as they shoot, bomb and swerve through the hordes of enemy invaders.\n\nIn addition, Under Defeat comes complete with an incredible soundtrack, newly boosted by video game music veteran, Shinji Hosoe (Ridge Racer series, Tekken series, etc.) and his company, Super Sweep.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/under-defeat--1", "videos": [{"id": 132149, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "9qF3bT2d_to"}]}
