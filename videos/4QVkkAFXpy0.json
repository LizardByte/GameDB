The fighter has effective support capabilities, as well as a nomenclature of unique weapons that can bring victory closer on the battlefield. Similar to other Ellydium ships, the development of Yith\u2019Mor was overseen by Conrad Dimeni. The UMC has signed a contract with the corporation and mercenaries will be able to gain access to Yith\u2019Mor\u2019s crystal technology.\n\nOfficial website: https://star-conflict.com\nTwitch channel: https://www.twitch.tv/starconflicten \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarConflict/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/starconflicten \nSteam: http://steamcommunity.com/app/212070", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QVkkAFXpy0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QVkkAFXpy0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QVkkAFXpy0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QVkkAFXpy0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QVkkAFXpy0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Star Conflict: Yith'Mor", "description": "After the successes of the Ze\u2019Ta sales launch in 4619, the Ellydium scientists immediately began developing a support ship.
