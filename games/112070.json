The game simulates flying a Boeing 777 aircraft, and was developed with the input of engineers and pilots from Japan Airlines. Two different cabinet models were manufactured. The default type is a typical sit down cabinet with one monitor, while the \"DX type\" cabinet features three side-by-side 29\" monitors, which surround the player to create a \"cockpit\".\n\nThe extreme difficulty of \"Airline Pilots\", combined with a lack of interest in realistic flight simulators, led Sega to manufacture a conversion kit which allowed owners to convert the units into the more popular Sega Strike Fighter. As a result, Airline Pilots cabinets are relatively rare.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/airline-pilots"}
