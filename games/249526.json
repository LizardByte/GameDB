Evan Bowman started the project in late 2015 while in college, and resumed work on the code after a several year long hiatus, during which he was teaching himself oil painting. Originally developed for macOS, the game was rebuilt from scratch during the 2020 pandemic, with a new custom engine. Blind Jump now compiles for various other platforms, including Linux, Windows, Nintendo Gameboy Advance, and Sony PlayStation Portable.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blindjump"}
