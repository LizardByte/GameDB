He had lost the only person he ever cherished, he had been betrayed by what he considered his master, he is now completely lost in this world he no longer knows. At least, he still knows how to use a gun. Some months after the end of Blood, Caleb starts to feel a strange emotion overwhelming him. He feels a new instinct growing in him, and it's like he hears voices asking him to go to a particular place. It's like he's hungry but does not know what he wants to eat. His mind is asking for him to go to a certain place. Over the months, this feeling grows stronger and stronger, until he can't stand it anymore. He has to go there, something in his mind is demanding him to do so. Following what the tremendous dark voice orders him in his dreams, Caleb finally finds himself in the middle of nowhere... Why coming here ? There's nothing to do here, it's completely lost. But this little village that stands before him is the exact place where his mind wanted him to be. Caleb glazes towards the entrance of the village. Nobody. Not even a single sound that could make him aware that there was life in here. There's a smell Caleb has smelled a thousand time. The smell of death, destruction, and above all...the smell of The Cabal. How come he had to come here after having destroyed the Dark God, to fight the Cabal again?", "summary": "French Meat is a single-player one episode fan add-on for Blood featuring nine maps which was created between December 2008 to December 2012 and released for Christmas. It features no new assets and runs with an unmodified copy of Blood; citing Rage Against the Machine as an inspiration. Latest release is 1.1 which finalized the maps, which are quite large and feature heavy amounts of room-over-room. \n \nThe maps were created by TEDD and tested by Le Babe, who also did most of the English language outreach; they uploaded the campaign to ModDB under the collective title of BleuBlancBlood. As the title and setting of the add-on suggests, both hail from France. Work on a sequel was announced on April 5, 2014, with French Meat 2 being released on November 23, 2019 also including updates to the original.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/french-meat"}
