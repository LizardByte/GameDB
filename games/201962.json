Play against AI opponents of varying difficulty, or challenge your friends to a duel, a duel of Tanks. Take turn launching hunks of explosive metal into the air, and then smile as then come crashing down on your opponent, obliterating terrain or the enemy tank itself. But you\u2019ll have to make sure you have the angle just right, or the only thing you\u2019ll be feeling\u2014rather than a sense of victory\u2014is embarrassment. Succeed, though, and you\u2019ll not only get a nice sense of accomplishment for angling those attacks just right, you\u2019ll also earn money! Spend it on upgrading your tank, or buying additional items. Keep being victorious, and you\u2019ll be the greatest tank in all the land."}
