Oblivion, a monstrous cosmic entity that consumed everything in its path and reigned before the birth of our universe is now invading the bodies of the living and devouring them from the inside-out. When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed, the chain reaction it triggered as a result was so powerful that the universe as it existed was completely eradicated, and the almighty Oblivion was pushed to the very brink of destruction. For the first time, Oblivion felt pain, fear, and hate.\n\nOblivion survived and now desperately seeks a means to punch through the Netherscape that separates our world from the Lost Lands. The last shreds of the pure energy source that created our world and nearly wiped out Oblivion are contained within the Light Burden, the bag that every member of the Turok lineage has carried. Unless Danielle and Joseph Fireseed, siblings that carry the title of Turok, can stop the death of the Turok mantle, it will signal the beginning of the end - the rebirth of Oblivion.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion"}
