The game environment is a synthwave/retro-themed world evoking the magic of the 80s.\nThe player enters tournaments by playing the different games. These tournaments last for 24 hours. The players get ranked on leaderboards, and the top positions win rewards.\nThree times a week, each tournament ends with an in-app show segment that announces the winners. This show is created to support the games directly; it does not air anywhere except inside the game app. The show format also features influencers and celebrities playing the game, and then players can attempt to beat the guest\u2019s score during the show, from inside the app.\nPlaying the games will also advance the metagame, where players can unlock progression rewards such as cosmetic enhancements, and acquire tickets which will be used to determine the Season Finale Winner.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/portalone-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 59383, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "G4KcRvE-rOk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4KcRvE-rOk", "title": "Welcome to The Arcade!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G4KcRvE-rOk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 59384, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "QKmXssICVTw"}, {"id": 59385, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "UPd0ZNU9hBQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPd0ZNU9hBQ", "title": "How PortalOne Arcade works!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UPd0ZNU9hBQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
