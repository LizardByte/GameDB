Each puzzle is a grid of different Hiragana that can be moved around. Adjacent Hiragana will connect to each other if the pronunciations share a common sound. So a Ka and a Na would connect as they both have an \"a\" sound. The player will rearrange the Hiragana to make one continuous connection between all the Hiragana in a level. When the player does this the puzzle will be complete. Some puzzles require figuring out the correct order of Hiragana. And others require the player to figure out the pronunciation of a Hiragana by looking at what connects with what.", "videos": [{"id": 33710, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pPhBBvRqyFs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPhBBvRqyFs", "title": "Kana Quest Release Date Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pPhBBvRqyFs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
