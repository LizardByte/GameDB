At its core CoE is a blockchain-based game, enabling users to trade and sell their cards freely, with the same level of ownership as if they were real, tangible cards. Players can compete against other players or AI opponents in 1-on-1 combat, battling to destroy the enemy Adventurer before they are themselves defeated. Players can achieve this using a variety of spells and creatures \u2014 creatures summoned onto the battlefield to fight on their behalf \u2014 as well as equipping Relics to dive directly into the fray. CoE was designed to be a quick, fun, and accessible game, but also offers significant depth, strategy, and complexity for more serious players. The game's cards, Adventurers, and locations are inspired by dark fantasy creating a game rich with detail. Players can choose to play as any of 10-20 Adventurers (to be determined later) complete with their own unique creatures, spells, and Relics. Each Adventurer has its own unique trick, which tends to epitomize its character and playstyle.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 76763, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "ZcQ7wFduIvU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcQ7wFduIvU", "title": "Cards of Ethernity Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZcQ7wFduIvU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
