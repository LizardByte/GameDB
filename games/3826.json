While primarily a BMX-based action sports title, it earned most of its notoriety for containing nudity, foul language and adult humor. The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version. While the adult content garnered a great deal of publicity for the game, it was almost entirely negative, and it was eventually released to dismal reviews and poor sales.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bmx-xxx", "videos": [{"id": 76095, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Jrilpio-IqI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrilpio-IqI", "title": "Longplay of BMX XXX", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jrilpio-IqI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
