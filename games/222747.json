It follows Super Mario Galaxy 2's concept of Green Stars, which are placed in tricky locations in already existing levels.\n\nThe hack contains 150 Stars, of which 15 can only be accessed after the other 135 have been collected. They replace Star Road's golden stars, are placed in different locations, and are often harder to reach. Enemies and bosses have been removed from levels, and there many more NPCs than the base game. These NPCs give tips to the player or contribute to the game's lore.\n\nAll of the game's levels can be accessed right from the start, as doors no longer require Stars or keys.\n\nWhen 135 Stars have been collected, green coins will appear in every main course, allowing access to the final 15 stars and the true ending of the game.\n\nThe game has no life counter, since the player has infinite lives. 1-UP mushrooms are replaced by Comet Medals, which are not required and do nothing but offer an optional challenge to the players who wish to test their skills in platforming, knowledge of the game or observation.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-star-road-the-green-comet"}
