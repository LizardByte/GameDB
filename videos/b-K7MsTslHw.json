In those versions, all flesh colored stuff are RED. Some other colors differ as well. I got two versions in my tosec, v1.01 and v2.15. I played the v1.01 one as it was the SPS (not cracked etc). Strange if the older version has better colors than the newer one. I'm too lazy to start the 2.15 version to see if it's the red one, but I will assume it is, as mine wasn't. Maybe some of the bugs I encountered was fixed in v2.15.\n\n09:35 - damn cat blocking my way. Have to pick him/her so she tries to run away. I know I could just leave the screen and return and the cat would probably be gone, but wanted to keep this in anyway.\n\n29:00 - this part was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring.\n\n46:17 - edited out the part where I run around looking for this bird. Took a while, way longer than was cut out as I reloaded an earlier save state to start looking again from the beginning when it had taken too long. Damn that bird, found it many times, but it only drops a feather like 8/10 times. At the same time I upped the speed of the emulated computer, so now there's not mega slow downs when certain stuff happens on the screen, like earlier + faster loading. Didn't wanna do it in the beginning as I thought it could maybe affect some effects, as the screen transition effect goes too fast, maybe other things might as well, but turns out that wasn't the case, oh well.\n\n46:55 - I had it bug here. If I flew straight to the spider, it wouldn't get to 144 points, only stay at 140, so I had to take it slower, good thing I found that out. This was one of several bugs I encountered. Another one was in Manannan's house, I was leaving the kitchen to go upstairs, just as I reached the end of the steps to get to the second floor, the wizard appeared at the middle of the stairs, only his first frame of animation got to play when it switched to the second floor screen. The bug was I could no longer type any text, as it gets disabled as soon as the wizard appears, so the game never reinitialized it.\n\n1:01:13 - stood still for 15 minutes till the boat arrived, edited out the waiting part. Should have spent the waiting part in the room with the rats for the needed info about the treasure so I didn't have to go there after the ship had arrived, but wasn't until after the ship arrived and I went to the island to dig up the treasure that I noticed I won't find any if I haven't heard that talk from the rats first.\n\n1:13:11 - damn bitch, blocking my way, can't go down the stairs.\n\n1:14:03 - here she blocks me again, had to go back to the previous screen.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b-K7MsTslHw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b-K7MsTslHw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b-K7MsTslHw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b-K7MsTslHw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b-K7MsTslHw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay [040] King's Quest III: To Heir is Human", "description": "Questions?: http://youtu.be/aZ1bcsIgwWM\n\nWeird they are flesh colored in this version when they aren't in the PC version nor another Amiga version someone else have longplayed.
