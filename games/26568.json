I guess I'll try reading it.\"\n\nShe pulled up a chair, took a seat, and got ready to open the book.\nIt was unbeknownst to her, however, that this would mark the beginning of an incident that would involve all of Gensokyo.\n\nLet's check out what's going on at Yokai Mountain.\nAs usual, a pile of fabricated articles lied before the crow tengu reporter, Aya Shameimaru.\n\n\"Hmm, I don't have enough experience to give this article enough appeal.\"\n\nAya racked her brain, hoping she could come up with something more interesting\nafter setting off a nuclear explosion on Yokai Mountain.\nJust then, her sidekick Momiji Inubashiri came rushing into the room.\n\n\"Hey, Aya! Stop writing fake stories and actually do your job!\"\n\nMomiji stared down Aya, holding Kisume,\nthe key witness of the explosive incident prior to this, when all of a sudden\u2014\n\n\"Ahh!\"\n\nThe girls were blinded by a light so bright that it probably reached all of Gensokyo.\n\n\"Wh-Where is that light coming from!?\"\n\"Seems like it's coming from the Human Village.\nHmm...smells like a story is in the works. All right, let's go, Momiji!\"\n\nMomiji tried to stop Aya, but she raced off with her bulletpad and pen instead.\nAs she shook her head, Momiji reluctantly followed Aya. With Kisume in hand.\n\n\"Ah...ahh...\nTo think that such an extraordinary magical book existed...\"\n\nBack at Suzunaan,\nKosuzu's legs had given out as the magical book floated above her head.\nEven for someone as fearless and inquisitive as her,\nall she could do was gaze at such extraordinary power.\n\nBut Kosuzu decided to take action...\n\nKnowing how to read a book's abilities by a mere touch, she knew.\nShe understood that this book should never be opened.\nBecause if so, Gensokyo and the Book World would become connected.\nHowever, Aya stood before her, turning around and forcing a smile.\nAnd in her hands was the magical book, completely opened.\n\n\"Sorry, but I already opened it.\"\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\n\nAnd just like that, they were all sucked into the book.\nWill they be able to return safely to Gensokyo!?\nThis marks the start of how two girls began their bullet coverage within the Book World!", "summary": "After getting sucked into a magical book, Aya and Momiji must find their way back home.
