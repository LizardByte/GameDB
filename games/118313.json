He is given the honorable task of gathering the disgusting ingredients for Satan\u2019s infamous birthday pie. To do so, Nate must venture out into the overworld and do whatever it takes to ensure those ingredients are secured in time, or there\u2019ll be hell to pay!\n\nLuckily Nate isn\u2019t alone on this quest, his \u2018pet\u2019 angel Nugget is there to offer support. Nugget offers his holy insight when needed, but more importantly is chained to Nate, so can be used like a grappling hook or swung around as a weapon. Nate can also equip horns he finds across the world to give him new hellish abilities.\n\nTogether Nate and Nugget will explore insane environments, meet tons of repugnant characters and witness some truly shocking sights. Hell Pie is a seriously twisted take on the classic mascot platformer, come along for the ride if you think you can stomach it!", "summary": "Hell Pie is a single player 3D-Platformer which empowers the player with an extensive set of moves based on a swing mechanic and lets him explore a combination of twisted large worlds and small challenging levels. Fighting against enemies, collecting weird cake ingredients and interactions with bizarre characters complement the gameplay. Our target audience are fans of old-school Action-Adventures and gamers who loved to play N64 classics such as Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie. Right now the game is in production and will be released in the 3rd quarter of 2020.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hell-pie", "videos": [{"id": 70012, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fFzMPvz_w94", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzMPvz_w94", "title": "Hell Pie - SFW Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFzMPvz_w94/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 59701, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "CqzaE14IVPM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqzaE14IVPM", "title": "Hell Pie - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CqzaE14IVPM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134333, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "E6S7a5PmNN0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6S7a5PmNN0", "title": "Hell Pie NEW TRAILER!!!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E6S7a5PmNN0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134334, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sx5yVFiLyxA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx5yVFiLyxA", "title": "Hell Pie - Legend of the Pie Trailer (2022)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sx5yVFiLyxA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134335, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qxNYZ9KR1ZY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxNYZ9KR1ZY", "title": "Hell Pie - OUT NOW!!!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qxNYZ9KR1ZY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134336, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "V-P0wl5D5YI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-P0wl5D5YI", "title": "Hell Pie - Accolades Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V-P0wl5D5YI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
