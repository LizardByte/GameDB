The goal in Falcon Beertender is the same as in Tapper, and the layout is very similar: as a barkeeper, your job is to serve your customers a mug of beer each. If you don't do this in time before they reach the counter, they will hit you, costing you a life.\n\nFalcon Beertender enhances the gameplay of Tapper in 2 ways. First, your customers can sometimes be very thirsty: they will toss back an empty beer mug for you to fill. You'll have to catch those mugs and pass them more beer. Secondly, breaking a (glass) mug also costs you a life, so you must make sure that you're not tossing more beer mugs than necessary, lest they crash into a back wall.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/falcon-bartender", "videos": [{"id": 66802, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qcKY-s21iBY"}]}
