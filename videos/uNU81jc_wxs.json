Combining the core gameplay and over-the-top action of the Trials franchise with all-new features, more competition, and a fresh visual look, Trials Rising is the biggest and most ambitious title in the series to date.\n\nThe competitive rags-to-riches experience is designed from the ground up to gently introduce new players to the acclaimed physics-based gameplay. With more tracks than ever before, beginners are in for a smooth ride towards mastery, while the skills and nerves of experienced players will be put to the test in the most advanced challenges. This is Trials at its best.\n\nCOMPETITION IS EVERYWHERE\nCompetition is all over the globe with fun and elaborate tracks located across several continents. Whether it\u2019s finding the perfect line in a smoldering caldera in the wilds of Yellowstone Park, doing triple backflips off the Eiffel Tower in Paris, or navigating massive drops on Mount Everest with snow storms looming, the thrills are endless. The new map also has integrated community features that show other players\u2019 personal bests, and alerts you if a friend has broken your record or if a new custom track has been shared.\n\nSTART SMALL, DREAM BIG \nFrom local backyard competitions to the biggest stadiums on the world stage, you will ride against other players as fully visualized ghosts or in real-time local and online multiplayer. Starting from humble beginnings, you\u2019ll improve your skills, grow your fame and rise in the ranks as you beat the competition. Looking to earn even more fortune and fame? Sponsors such as Fox Racing Gear, KTM, and even RedLynx are always on the lookout for new talent and will offer contracts to complete special challenges. Think you can execute a perfect run-through without crashing or hold a wheelie for 10 meters? You\u2019ll be handsomely rewarded if you can!   \n\nCOMMUNITY-POWERED CUSTOMIZATION\nCustomization has always been a key component in the Trials experience, and Trials Rising takes it to the next level, empowering the community like never before. Players will now have the freedom to customize and share any outfit or bike skin they want, resulting in endless possibilities. In addition to the outfit and bike customization editor, the legendary Trials Track Editor comes back bigger than ever. \n\nTANDEM BIKE \u2013 WHEN TWO BECOME ONE\nTrials Rising adds an exciting new local multiplayer mode with the Tandem Bike. Two riders, each contributing fifty percent of the power and balance, ride together on one bike. Put your friendships to the test as you coordinate through tight corners, big jumps, and other outlandish obstacles. Get ready for the unexpected and for hilarity to ensue!\n\nABOUT UBISOFT:\nUbisoft is a leading creator, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment and services, with a rich portfolio of world-renowned brands, including Assassin\u2019s Creed, Far Cry, For Honor, Just Dance, Watch Dogs, Tom Clancy\u2019s video game series including Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six and The Division.
