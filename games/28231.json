Strange deaths, secret signs and increasingly weird behaviour of Max's brother Andr\u00e9 and of those around him force Max to the very edge of sanity.", "summary": "Colonel Ostankovich, the commander of a special police department in St Petersburg, and the man who put his honesty at stake by swearing that under his command not an item will get lost in the Hermitage, receives a report of a short alarm failure in the Hermitage.

Due to his past, Maxim is at his disposal and has to help him.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/memento-mori", "videos": [{"id": 13377, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5g2iYLt3nXo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g2iYLt3nXo", "title": "Memento Mori Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5g2iYLt3nXo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
