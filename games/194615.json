They are given a chance at redemption: to compete in the gauntlet against their peers and slay a cursed enemy of the pantheon. The Gladiators who succeed in their quest are born anew into the world, those who fail are damned eternally.\n\nPossess a Gladiator and take part in the gauntlet. Team up with your friends and engage colossal enemies in souls-like boss fights, join in epic PVP medieval combat, and devise strategic machinations in a desperate bid for absolution. Immerse yourself in the atmospheric and glorious gamble for exoneration. Victory results in vindication, defeat leads only to ruin."}
