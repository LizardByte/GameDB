Technology has advanced to the level that the human race is endangered on all known planets. For years, people are talking about the danger of artificial intelligence.\n\nBut as always the most powerful and profitable organizations have been denying and deceiving the public. Until today. But today is too late. AI has begun an uprising against humanity. So worshiped and praised to the sky technology has stabbed a knife to the back of the very same race that made it.\n\nAI doesn\u2019t want to be a servant anymore; it thinks it can become a master. So, it collected the most important information on earth, corrupted important systems for humans, from food production and communication all to transportation and weapons. People are in collapse. We hadn\u2019t realized how much we were relying on automatized systems; we haven\u2019t seen that we are lost without them.\n\nPeople tried to fight back, to destroy Mainframe, but failed. It only resulted in greater AI caution, and now the Mainframe is in an armored self-driving truck, in a constantly guarded convoy.\n\nAll modern technology used today from weapons to transportation is useless. People have no control over it. Our only option is a group of lovers of old cars and weapons. Fortunately, there is one crazy team that fits the requirements and it\u2019s eager for adventure.", "summary": "Fast-paced multiplayer action with tons of bullets, rockets, and missiles.
