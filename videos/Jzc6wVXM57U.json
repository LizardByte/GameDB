All of the demons that were absent from the original Doom 64 have finally emerged from the deepest pits of hell, including the unsettling Revenant and the sinister Arch-vile. If you're looking for a new challenge, the exclusive Redemption Denied difficulty will bring some of the crueler monster placements from PSX Doom into the vanilla Doom maps. Proceed with caution; there are many evils yet unseen.\n\n---\n\nDownload: https://pyspy.neocities.org/d64ue\nDoomworld thread: https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134891-wip-doom-64-unseen-evil-run-it-back-doom-64-style/\nModDB: https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-64-unseen-evil\n\nCheck out the Bandcamp page for 'The Unseen Evil' by Blue Vertigo: https://bluevertigo.bandcamp.com/album/the-unseen-evil", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jzc6wVXM57U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jzc6wVXM57U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jzc6wVXM57U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jzc6wVXM57U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jzc6wVXM57U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Doom 64: Unseen Evil - Mod Release Trailer", "description": "Doom 64: Unseen Evil is a mod for GZDoom that brings the atmosphere of Doom 64 to the worlds of Doom and Doom II.
