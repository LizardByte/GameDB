Cyber Knights is a squad tactics heist RPG, in a unique 23rd-century cyberpunk setting. Build your team of hackers, mercs and malcontents wisely; their stories will become interwoven with your own. Fight or stealth through in-depth turn-based tactical missions. Use powerful cyberware, faction connections, stealth, hacking & more to outsmart the odds and determine your future.\n\nWishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/\nFollow for updates & previews: https://twitter.com/CyberKnightsRPG\nJoin our community: https://discord.gg/TreseBrothers\n\nAvailable on Steam (Windows, Mac, Linux, Steam Deck) now. Coming to mobile (Android, iOS) next year. Console releases are on our wishlist, depending on how the game's full launch on Steam performs.\n\nInspired by games like XCOM 2, Shadowrun, and Invisible Inc, Cyber Knights is a modern tactical RPG with some of our favorite elements: gridless movement, environmental cover, specialized overwatch, initiative manipulation and more. Independent enemy unit AI opens up a world of creative stealth options; pick them off one by one, stage diversions, or use advanced tech to sneak right by them.\n\nCombat is challenging and in-depth. Powerful abilities, tricked out weapons, and smart coordination can give you an edge, but once you go loud expect things to escalate. Move fast and avoid getting pinned down to accomplish your objectives and get out alive.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoeJcXZY7Uc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoeJcXZY7Uc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoeJcXZY7Uc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoeJcXZY7Uc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoeJcXZY7Uc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cyber Knights: Flashpoint - Squad Tactics Heist RPG - Early Access Trailer", "description": "Out now on Steam! http://s.team/a/1021210/ - Over 100 updates, including major visual upgrades, since this trailer was recorded.
