Two fighters in serpentine robotic machines try to box each other in to win the fight. The serpents are detailed in the fact that they aren't just a line, giving a greater sense of realism to the game. Each snake has a fixed amount of lives; with losing a life being a representation of \"losing the war.\" The \"game over\" message is a simple message saying \"the bitter taste of defeat\" with an animated picture of a snake crying and accompanied by a melancholic music in a waltz rhythm.\n\nThere are two modes with four difficulty levels; level 1 is considered to be the easiest (normal speed and enemy performance) while level 4 is the hardest (fast speed and enemies are likely to cheat death). The first mode allows players to simply compete against an opponent while the second mode brings in a series of small snakes that emerge when players take too long conquering a level. Missiles can be launched when the player collects them on the field. White numbers help the player develop a longer body while black numbers make the body shorter.\n\nMissiles can either make the enemy faster (black missiles) or slower (white missiles). Winning 7 of the 13 possible matches automatically makes the player into the \"champion of serpents.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/serpent", "videos": [{"id": 20174, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "rfahrQKcwHQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfahrQKcwHQ", "title": "Gameplay of Serpent (gameboy)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rfahrQKcwHQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
