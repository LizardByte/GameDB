It's a deceptively straightforward skill that involves dexterity, acute awareness, multi-tasking and tactical positioning. You'll have to strategize, solve and fight your way through multitudes of enemy installations to achieve your coveted goal.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cubetractor", "videos": [{"id": 8414, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3Ks3e_gvjtg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ks3e_gvjtg", "title": "Cubetractor Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Ks3e_gvjtg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
