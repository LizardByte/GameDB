Can Pac-Man rescue Ms. Pac-Man from the evil ghosts??\n\nAll of the graphics have received a nice Pac-Man style facelift. Including the 4 different types of ghost.\n\nThe 2 doors at your disposal on each maze now stay permanently shut. (They only lasted a few seconds in the original Lock \u2018N Chase.) This adds more strategy to the gameplay. If you trap a ghost inside of these 2 doors you will recieve bonus points. Which also makes the rest of that maze easier. But be sure to not trap yourself\u2026 you will have to restart if you do!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-man-escape"}
