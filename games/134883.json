This is a horror game about feeling lost and being worried about dying instantly to what's around the next corner.\n\nThis game does not care about what came before or what comes after. There is only the labyrinth.\n\nThis game has enemies that you cannot beat, only outrun. They are slow, they aren't smart, but they are patient, they are many, and they are powerful. Some will be very obvious with their presence, and some will blend in almost perfectly with their surroundings. Make sure to save when you have breathing room.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
