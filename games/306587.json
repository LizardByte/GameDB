The team at Limited Run has built a new collection to find the answer. Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection explores the franchise's troubled history and enduring popularity.\n\nBubsy in: The Purrfect Collection is a playable history that includes games, artifacts and interviews. All of the games have been carefully updated for modern PCs and consoles using Limited Run\u2019s proprietary Carbon Engine. Along the way the team was able to smooth out some of the games\u2019 rough edges.\n\nAt the helm of the project is Limited Run\u2019s Audi Sorlie, a producer, author, Bubsy World Heavyweight Champion and arguably the world\u2019s foremost expert on the furry franchise. Together with the team at Limited Run and Atari, he has created the ultimate retrospective celebration of Bubsy, the 3\u20196\u201d tall 80 pound bobcat (with a pet armadillo named Arnold).
