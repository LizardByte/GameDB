The Autumn Night Prelude will mostly take place in Jaska's yard, but you will discover other locations as you progress through the prelude. As well this time, the autumn evening will be filled with 100% more Erkki! The original demo didn't have Erkki! He'll definitely add some spice to the proceedings!
