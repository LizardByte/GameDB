Travelling isn't free of course so on the way you must do odd jobs to earn money to travel with car, bus, or airplane. Of course travelling with car or plane is the fastest but they're also the costliest. You've gotta take into account how much time you still have to solve the mystery otherwise you might have to ask your bosses for an extension. You have about eight chances to extend your deadline but each extension takes away a bonus point. Use your time wisely and accept jobs that pay the highest for the least amount of days to get to your destination.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
