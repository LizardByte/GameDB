In an effort to escape a pursuing squid, players must listen to the sound effects from the game to determine where to swim. Walls of sea horses approach quickly, with very narrow gaps to swim through. The dolphins of the ocean squeak at the player to indicate where the gap is located, so the player can react in time. A high pitched tone means to swim high, and a low pitched ton means to swim low. With practice, it's a simple task to always know exactly where to swim in order to never lose speed. Each gap that is successfully passed without touching the sides earns a handful of points.\n\nPlatform(s): Atari 2600", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lCmfc6kJZg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lCmfc6kJZg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lCmfc6kJZg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lCmfc6kJZg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lCmfc6kJZg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Atari 2600 Games Dolphin (1983)", "description": "Atari 2600 Games Dolphin (1983)\n\nDescription:\n\nDolphin is an Atari 2600 game by Matthew Hubbard where players control a dolphin swimming through the ocean in a side scrolling view.
