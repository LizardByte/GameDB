Marik's Rare Hunters eventually take over the whole city. Even the owner of the card shop works for Marik and tries to kill the player. Then, the player meets Ishizu Ishtar, who challenges them to a game of Duel Monsters, to see if he is strong enough to wield an Egyptian God card. After she is beaten, the player must beat Seto Kaiba, the person that organized the tournament, in order to obtain the first God card.\n\nAfter the player gets into the finals which take place on a blimp, he Duels Marik. After Marik is beaten, it is found out that it was not really Marik. It was actually one of Marik's servants. The real Marik was the person the player met earlier in the game that became one of Yugi's friends: Namu. Then, Marik starts stealing the souls of those he beats. After Marik defeats Kaiba, the player must challenge Yugi. After Yugi is beaten, the player must face Marik.
