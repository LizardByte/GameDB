You have no work every day and spend your days going back and forth between your futon and desk, but try to do part-time jobs and training. Your knowledge points will increase and your drawing ability will improve.\n\nYou can always draw your manuscript. When it is finished, ask the publisher to take a look at it. It may be rejected at first, but you may come up with a good idea while taking a walk to avoid distraction.\n\nIf your manuscript is accepted and your reading cartoon gains popularity, you can get a serialization. However, serialization is grueling for a weekly manga artist who spits blood.\n\nIf you do your job admirably despite being pressed by deadlines, you may become a popular manga that is even made into an animated cartoon or movie. Once the comics are released, you can hire assistants and concentrate on the manga you want to draw.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/manga-oku-no-hosomichi"}
