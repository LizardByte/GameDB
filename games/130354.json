Originally intended as a sequel to Super Mario 64, the sequel was canceled and the impetus was reused in a GameCube technology demonstration. As debuted at Nintendo's Space World trade show in 2000, the demonstrated graphics and physics concepts were gradually incorporated into various games through the 2000s. This includes the rapid object generation in Pikmin, the sphere walking technology used in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Super Mario Galaxy, and the physics of Metroid Prime. It became one of the two canceled Mario games after Super Mario's Wacky Worlds.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 36383, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "v_3lJTHuhZA"}]}
