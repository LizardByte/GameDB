Each task, puzzle, and game is math oriented; there are symmetry puzzles, tangrams, mosaics, logic puzzles, sequencing and pattern puzzles, as well as addition and even elementary algebra.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disney-learning-math-quest-with-aladdin"}
