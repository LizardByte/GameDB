Set in the present day, the story follows Amanda Wright, a waitress and medical student grappling with the recent tragic loss of her only daughter, Beatrice, in a car accident. As a single mother in deep despair, Amanda finds herself on the brink of suicide and, in desperation, strikes a deal with the devil. She trades her soul for a chance to descend into a hellish underworld resembling a brutal concentration camp, all in an attempt to save her daughter\u2019s soul.\n\nWithin this infernal realm, Amanda is joined by Virgil, an unusual reptilian creature who becomes her guide after she frees him from an enchanted sword. Alongside Virgil, she encounters four powerful beings, known as the Entities, each offering unique strengths. These Entities allow Amanda to shift identities, each with its own skills and abilities:\n\n\u2022 Shadow: A stealthy, thief-like figure skilled in evasion and deception.\n\u2022 Light: A protective healer adept in defensive magic.\n\u2022 Corruption: A frail but formidable mage specializing in destructive spells.\n\u2022 Instinct: A fierce, sword-wielding fighter with expertise in close combat.\nEach Entity provides a distinct advantage as Amanda navigates the perils of hell in her relentless quest to save Beatrice\u2019s soul.", "summary": "The Lost was an action adventure/survival horror game co-developed by Irrational Games (the makers of Bioshock) and FXLabs.
