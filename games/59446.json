But I always wake up at the same part.\n\nThen one day, after having had the dream for several nights in a row...\n\nI was heading home late one night after working at the library when I found that my usual route was blocked off due to an accident. So I was walking along a dim path that I typically don't use, when I heard a voice call out...\n\n\"I found youuu!\"\n\nI turned to see a werewolf, complete with wolf ears and a tail--\n\nThe werewolf attacked me out of nowhere, and as I struggled to escape, I saw a figure floating in the moonlight...\n\n\"--I won't let you do that.\"\n\nMy savior was a girl in a red hood. She was holding large scissors in one hand and a gun in the other.\n\n\"I'm going to eat you. Of that you can be sure...\" the werewolf said with a grin, before disappearing into the darkness.\n\nMy legs were shaking from fear, and I couldn't move. The hooded girl asked me if I was okay.\n\n\"I am Red Riding Hood.\"\n\nThe girl who called herself Red Riding Hood explained that she had left her picture book and traveled here to this time period in pursuit of the Wolf. Although, she was a little different from the Little Red Riding Hood I remember...\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood explained that we had no way of knowing when the Wolf would attack again, so she would protect me from now on. And so we decided to live together...\n\nWhy is Red Riding Hood pursuing the Wolf...?\n\nWhy is the Wolf after me...?", "summary": "A otome game by Matatabi for Vita.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rear-pheles-red-of-another", "videos": [{"id": 39258, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "iIDTdo_Go5c"}]}
