We also have a series of arrows or harpoons that we can shoot to defend ourselves. The enemies are sharks, giant octopuses and a number of other fish types.\n\nThe game consists of two phases, the first being the objective to find the sunken ship and the second inside the ship, find the safe, burst it and obtain its contents.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/titanic--2", "videos": [{"id": 44145, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-uQH4MiM0EE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uQH4MiM0EE", "title": "Titanic Parte 1 Amstrad cpc HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-uQH4MiM0EE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44146, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6lNkP3G2pTs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lNkP3G2pTs", "title": "Titanic Parte 2 Amstrad cpc HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6lNkP3G2pTs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
