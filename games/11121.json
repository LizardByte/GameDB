The dragon will continue to get faster and faster until you can't hit him anymore, basically causing the game to be unbeatable.\n\nYou can eat carrots that grow in the ground too, which raise your eyesight stat making the games visuals more HD and your health bar go up. Your Dovahkinn Rank increases with each dragon you kill, allowing you to use more magic and heal while running.", "summary": "Ninja Golf is an Atari 7800 video game which combines scrolling beat 'em up with golf simulation gameplay.
