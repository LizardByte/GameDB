In addition to a new user interface, a significantly improved AI and an extended text mode, numerous other changes (e.g. an improved transfer area) have been made. \n \nThe changes were not visible at first glance, however, and so Anstoss 2005 was only considered a Kick Edition in new colors. Ascaron's goal, however, was mainly to attract new fans for future projects. \n \nMany ideas from Anstoss 4 were improved, but not fully developed. It is also possible here to buy a club and take over the presidency, but it is hardly possible to celebrate success here. The transfer market is also considered to be rather unrealistic, as 4 clubs always apply for a player.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anstoss-2005", "collections": [{"id": 1499, "name": "Anstoss"}]}
