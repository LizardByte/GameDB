Along the way they find lots of things to do. At Pier City there is a stingray that paints long and short vowels. Kids hear the sounds vowels make and then hear words and sentences that use the sounds. Young readers then use what they learned to deliver mail. The postcards and packages have vowel sounds and words. At the Powerstation kids put letters together to sound-out words. This is a great phonics activity. Kids hear all the letters sounded out as they form words. Children also blend bubbles to make words with consonant blends, find words with a target blend or digraph sound and find books under the sea. Once children find storybooks they can hear them read aloud or record themselves reading the story and play it back. Kids will love playing these activities and parents will agree for learning phonics the Let's Go Read series is remarkable.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lets-go-read-an-ocean-adventure", "videos": [{"id": 122476, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fCNydpzewxY"}]}
