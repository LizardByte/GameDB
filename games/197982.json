You are able to build freely until the tower is tall enough to reach the target line of the current level. Hitting a start button activates gravity for a few seconds and your construction either stands or falls. If any single block of the tower is still above the target line after the physics simulation stopped, the whole building is magically \u201cfrozen\u201d by Egbert, so that the already completed sections of the tower will never again be subject to gravity. In the next level you will have to build on this newly created, always different, often crooked, foundation \u2013 a task that can turn out to be quite challenging.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-tower-of-egbert"}
