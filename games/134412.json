I'm having a great time growing and exploring new things. \n \nIt was made to toy with how I might use one button interaction and me exploring variables and playing. It's pretty rough and ready in places, I'm sorry about that, as a story it makes very little sense. \n \n Talking to characters multiple times and re-examining objects can yield some slightly different results. As can the order some things are carried out. \n \nI think it should take roughly 10 minutes to play. \n \nThank you so much for taking a look!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chook-and-sosig-long-weekend"}
