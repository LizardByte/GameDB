In fact, the player lives as a bum, wandering aimlessly on the streets, not capable of retrieving his own lost sanity. A new horrid menace may be lurking underneath the apparent calm and may be linked to the psychiatrist who is searching for the player...\n\nThis game uses the same engine as the original game with similar gameplay and atmospheres.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
