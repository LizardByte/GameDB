Some of them have completely changed their personalities, becoming dangerous to others.\n\nJoseph Pommodorov became one such vegetable.\nHe used to be a good tomato. He loved Carrot Marx's philosophy, helped the poor, was well-liked and respected, but the sun's rays turned him into a monster.\n\nHe has manipulated red vegetables with his hatred of others, blaming the disaster on vegetables with different colored skin. He commissioned scientists to create a cruel variety of GMO PEPPER and began to conquer the world.\nIn a short time, he has taken over the world in a brutal and cruel way, calling himself emperor and ordering the enslaved vegetables to work for the red empire.\n\nThe oppressed vegetables have formed an \"underground\" organization in which the boldest, strongest and craziest vegetables are selected. They are trained for secret subversive missions and their battalion has become famous under the name \"Suicide Vegetables\".
