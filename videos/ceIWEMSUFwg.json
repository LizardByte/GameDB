The computer's CPU is under attack and it is up to the player to defend it. Other components such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, diodes and fuses have become jealous of the processor's elevated position in the computer. The gameplay can be described as similar to a two dimensional variant of Tempest. The player has a top down view of the the circuit board, with the CPU in the middle and data lines going outwards from it. The enemies will follow these lines till they reach the CPU and the player's task is to stop them by shooting out electrical pulses down the data lines. If any of the enemies reach the CPU it will explode and the player will lose a life. At times different tools such as hammers and pliers appear briefly and shooting these will give some bonus points. In addition to the ordinary fire the player also has access to a powerful zap attack that kills everything on the screen. It can't be used freely though as it will need some time to recover after being used.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceIWEMSUFwg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceIWEMSUFwg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceIWEMSUFwg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceIWEMSUFwg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ceIWEMSUFwg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Transistors Revenge for the BBC Micro", "description": "Came also out for:\n\n---\n\n\nGame description:\n\nTransistors Revenge is a game that not only runs on the BBC Micro, it also takes place in it.
