Team up with friends or go it alone, facing a range of mini game challenges using the Switch 2 mouse controls. Each job features a unique and inventive mechanic making full use of the Joy-Con 2\u2019s brand new cursor functionality.\n\nIn Mouse Work players take on the role of adorable mice that are just trying to earn some Cheddar. Fortunately for them, the local job centre has a wealth of offerings available, each testing our mice with new and innovative cursor-based gameplay. \n\nAs a Climbing Instructor, you'll be dragging the hands of your incompetent students to the next safe hold, or as an Artist, you'll paint pictures correctly before the time runs out. Use the cursor to play keepy-uppy with all manner of spherical objects in 'Gym Teacher', or keep it old school in 'Spy', a retro style mouse-avoider. These are just a few of the jobs you'll be taking on in Mouse Work. \n\nAs you play through the jobs available, new ones will unlock, and old jobs will resurface with surprising twists.\n\nWhilst the whole game can be played solo, all the jobs are dialled up a notch when playing in local 2-4 player couch co-op mode. Multiplayer brings the party with a range of new challenges added to every job. \n\nYou may be getting in each other's way whilst tied together, or forced to have your climbers hold hands to bridge a large gap. Perhaps you'll be required to work together to lift and drag objects that would be too heavy for a single mouse. Asymmetric abilities take this further in some games too, with each player working with entirely different mechanics!\n\nAll your hard work won't go unrewarded however. Successfully completing jobs earns you Cheddar, and you can blow it all customising your mice with cute cosmetics: hats, bow ties, trainers\u2026 the lot! Mouse Work will release hot on the tail of the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nFootage shown was captured on PC and is only an approximation of what we expect on final hardware.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdhvAqS4bjA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdhvAqS4bjA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdhvAqS4bjA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdhvAqS4bjA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdhvAqS4bjA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mouse Work Reveal Trailer", "description": "An Upcoming Party Game for 1- 4 Players Using Switch 2 Mouse Controls!\n\nQuit mousin' around and get yourselves down to the job centre!
