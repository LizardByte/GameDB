Part 1 is ayame's levels and i added the cutscenes i didn't get at the end of this. The levels i'm going slow on are the ones i'm doing for the first time while if  i'm just running through it then i've probably retried a few times.\r\n\r\nSo far i'm not liking it as much as tenchu 2. The controls take time to get used to but are better in the end though. Story differs depending on what character you play unlike 2 and this game seems to over use the blur effect.\r\n\r\nIf i have time later i'll get the time tags for each level. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-yy6DSaY_0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-yy6DSaY_0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-yy6DSaY_0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Xbox Longplay [016] Tenchu: Return From Darkness (Part 1 of 4, Ayame)", "description": "http://www.longplays.net\r\n\r\nPlayed By: RickyC\r\n\r\nHaving some problems with syncing the sound, trying new way for part 2 to see if it helps.
