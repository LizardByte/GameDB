The player moves around in the same way he does in the original Paper Mario, while fighting enemies in a platformer-like style.\n\nThere is a point-based rank system in the game. Each time you defeat an enemy, you earn points. Every time you earn a certain number of points, you level up and earn more health. This gives you a reason to want to stop each and every goomba!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paper-mario--1"}
