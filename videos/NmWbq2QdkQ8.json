To create more powerful items, fans will have to master the art of \u201cResonance Synthesis\u201d by adding ingredients which resonate with each other to the \u201cAlchemy Core\u201d of the recipe. The strength of the resonance will depend on the quality of the ingredients selected.\n\nThe combat system has also been revamped in Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories & the Envisioned Land to offer intense real-time combat with intuitive gameplay. The skills available to active team members will depend on their distance from the enemy (close or ranged combat). Compared to previous instalments, players can now move or interchange characters at any time during the fight. When certain conditions are met, a powerful \u201cFriend Action\u201d combo can be unleashed in battle. By meeting certain conditions, players will be able to activate \u201cMana Surge\u201d, which will allow for exclusive actions to be performed. In addition, each character will have a unique special move, \u201cMaximize Mana Surge\u201d, which can inflict significant damage on enemies. \n\n\nJoin the #KTFamily\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@KOEITECMOAMERICA\nTwitter: https://x.com/KoeiTecmoUS\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/koeitecmous\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/koeitecmous/\n\n#AtelierYumia #KTFamily #atelierseries", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmWbq2QdkQ8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmWbq2QdkQ8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmWbq2QdkQ8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmWbq2QdkQ8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmWbq2QdkQ8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories & the Envisioned Land - Second Trailer", "description": "Official Website: https://bit.ly/4fIxxZS\n\nAtelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories & the Envisioned Land will be available on March 21, 2025 for Nintendo Switch\u2122, PlayStation\u00ae5, PlayStation\u00ae4, Windows PC via Steam\u00ae, and for the first time in franchise history, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One. \n\nTo prepare for the adventure ahead, players will rediscover the Atelier franchise\u2019s signature synthesizing system in a fresh form by manipulating \u201cmana\u201d to create new items useful in combat or exploration.
