Humanity is split: the fortunate live on lunar colonies, while the less fortunate dwell in underwater sea-bases. You play as a young dreamer living beneath the ocean, yearning for a life beyond the depths.\n\nAs you navigate this isolated world, your imagination takes flight, turning mundane moments into grand, emotional performances. When tensions rise and connections deepen, your character breaks into song, expressing hopes, fears, and dreams through music. Along the way, you'll encounter quirky characters, wrestle with personal and societal dilemmas, and explore themes of love, survival, and the power of creativity to transform even the darkest realities.\n\nAt its heart, Love in Space is a story about finding meaning, connection, and joy in a world turned upside down, and how sometimes, only a song can say what words never could.", "summary": "It is the year 2009.
