I worked years on Gamefaqs writing walkthroughs. Now I make video guides out of them. I do 100% collectibles runs to show where all of the secrets are. I record all footage all by myself, every single one, and edit them together to remove mistakes, or loading times, to make for the best and most fluid viewing experience possible and help others. My walkthroughs are usually of superior quality, so pick mines! I record in 1080p most of the time, except my older videos which are in 720p. I use HDPVR2 to record. I work the hardest possible to provide you the best gaming help. All games are posted with permission from the owners and some game codes are also often given by the publisher. I mostly use El Gato, Hauppage HDPVR, OBS, XSplit or any other program I need depending on the game to record Thanks for watching my videos! \u2665", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEl0ayD5Plw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEl0ayD5Plw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEl0ayD5Plw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEl0ayD5Plw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NEl0ayD5Plw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Disney's Goofy's Fun House FULL GAME Longplay (PS1)", "description": "Disney's Goofy's Fun House Full Game Walkthrough for PS1.
