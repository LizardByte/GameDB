Pac-Man must roll his way through Ghost-Land, collecting pellets and confronting Ghosts to save his family and restore peace to Pac-Land. Introducing an innovative new control scheme, Pac'N Roll lets players control Pac-Man with the Nintendo DS stylus. Players can roll and dash around the environment as well as execute maneuvers such as hairpin turns, immediate stops and precision rolling with effortless strokes of the stylus. In his quest to save Pac-Land, Pac-Man will venture through stages such as Castle Pac, Gyro-Jungle and the Ghost House, while facing perilous hazards like moving floors, dash panels, jump zones and wind zones. Along the way, Pac-Man will find power-ups like the Winged Chocolate, allowing him to fly through the worlds and jump over Ghosts, or the \"Knight Chocolate,\" providing him with armor which grants him the power to crash through walls and withstand more damage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-n-roll-remix", "collections": [{"id": 2095, "name": "Pac-Man"}]}
