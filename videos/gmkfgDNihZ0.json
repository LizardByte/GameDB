An invisible force is slaughtering your entire crew on a ship stranded in deep space. Suddenly all conventional combat skills are worthless as you ace your greatest challenge: a silent enemy so brutal, you never see it coming.

Your ears are your allies now and your gun is your savior.\"\n\nSega's first walking simulator based on the Aliens franchise. It's Alien without the license. The game features Laura best known from the 'D' games however she is a clone set in the future and not the same character...maybe.\n\nThe game requires a fair amount of walking about, collecting stuff and backtracking which pads out a lot of the video. What makes this game unique is its use of sound. As you can not see the aliens you rely on a series of ping sound which give an approximate position. Once you hear the alien scream, it's onto you and its time to charge the gun and release at the very last moment. You may also have a gun with a limited charge so it's a good idea to charge regularly at a station. Sometimes you can get away with running away from an alien but only if it's not directly in front of you. Note that the alien will know your exact position when stomping around but they cant pass through doors.\n\nI play the game in Normal mode however it is possible that there is more dialogue to be seen or hear between characters in the easier modes as they don't die off so quickly. In the longplay I quite often show things in the network computer which don't affect progression but may show clues on how the puzzles are solved instead of just solving them. Although for some reason it wouldn't show the video on how to solve the power room until well after id done it. At one stage I go off track to kill an alien in the basement hoping it would make the area clear later. .. It didn't.\n\nThe game comes on 4 cd's with the first just being the intro, training and credits. The game does feature high quality cinematics but I suspect very little compression much like with the game 'D'\n\nOnce the game is completed 'Hard Mode' is unlocked.
