He never thought actually of having a group or even a family, but he will find something greater than vengeance to fight for: love. In the meantime, while trying to gather the support of every nation of this world, Dan must protect those he love and also himself, not knowing that perhaps this evil instinct may be within... Follow the path of an ordinary man who can overcome extraordinary things. \n \nOrder from Caos is strongly inspired by the true JRPG classics.", "summary": "An Epic quest full os twists.
