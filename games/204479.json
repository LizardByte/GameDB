The scenario can be played in two different ways, from the point of view of either a male or female protagonist. reasons and circumstances of the suicide can also be chosen by the player. The scenario involves supernatural forces that change the fate of the heroes; however, the specific narrative is defined by the player.\n\n2.

Miraculously, she survives the accident, and is granted the magic ability of shape-shifting.\n\n3.
