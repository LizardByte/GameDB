Private Detective knew this case was going to be strange as soon as she read the letter from the Mayor of Port Providence, in which he asked her to board a ship that went lost at sea years ago, then recently reappeared with no sign of the crew or cargo.\n\nDetective is at a loss as to what happened to the vessel, even after examining all of the evidence. She knows there is more to this case than the Mayor is letting on. The press is abuzz with talk of a curse. And, after encountering a hooded figure with a hook on his hand, on a supposedly abandoned ship, she begins to believe it.\nDetective is a rational woman, not prone to believing in ghost stories or fables. But this case is unlike anything she has ever seen. What connects the ship\u2019s disappearance with Devil\u2019s Island, and a local family\u2019s unsolved murder? Will she find the allies she needs to break the Traveler\u2019s Curse?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/left-in-the-dark-no-one-on-board"}
