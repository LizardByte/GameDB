It used to be abandoned due to its owners constantly disappearing. It remained unowned for close to 100 years until Reuben's uncle, who dismissed the disappearances as silly rumours, decided to purchase the mansion and renovate it. He died many years later from natural causes, so it appeared that the disappearances were indeed just a rumour. As the new owner, Reuben decides to explore the mansion that he hasn't seen in years. He soon discovers a secret room that he never noticed when he was younger, and neither did his uncle. In it contains three life-like dolls who he accidentally awakens. Reuben finds himself stuck in a life or death game with two of the dolls trying to protect him and one of them trying to kill him.", "summary": "When Reuben inherits his uncle's mansion, the last thing he expects is to find are sentient life-sized dolls that are capable of moving and talking. As if that isn't shocking enough, one of the dolls is a psychopathic killer who has her sights set on him! Will he survive or become another victim?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/artificial-mansion"}
