NAMCO took special interest in this project even though they weren't directly involved with the development of the CD-i version, the quality of the Intellectual Property had to be maintained. This went as far as the packaging itself which is detailed in the below Suggestive Themes boxout. Philips ADS were given a Pac-man arcade board with the chipset for Ms Pac-man to wire up so they had everything to do a decent conversion. It wasn't a straight port however, the entire game was upgraded to a 256 colour palette and also extra levels were added courtesy of Johnny Wood and authorised by NAMCO.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arcade-classics--1", "videos": [{"id": 96045, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mO32UUoZGHU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO32UUoZGHU", "title": "Arcade Classics - Philips CD-i Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mO32UUoZGHU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
