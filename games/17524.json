Favorite species such as the Wolf, the Arctic Fox, the Giant Kangaroo and the Meerkat are the new Stars in your zoo! Improve the park with the blossoms of sunflowers and rare orchids and plant exotic trees such as bamboo and eucalyptus.\n\nEntertainment for all: You can use numerous new attractions for the perfect park experience. There is something special for everyone: from the children's adventure playground to the helicopter round-trip to diving in the shark cage. Visitors can travel through the park in boats, Jeeps or on the back ofhorses, camels and elephants. Or how about a dive to the newly constructed coral reef?\n\nOn the tracks of the Animal World: Of course the animals are the real protagonists! The new additions to the zoo show off their stunts and even challenge the guests of the zoo to a little duel: the courageous visitor can face the kangaroo in a boxing match. Enthusiastic water-babies are given the opportunity of swimming with dolphins and turtles - go get wet! Inquisitive visitors can track the zoo inhabitants in the wild, observe them and capture them on film. But be careful: in case of an emergency the player has to personally intervene as Zoo Director, search for an escaped animal, sedate it with a tranquilizer gun and take it back to its safe environment.\n\nAdvanced park economy: To keep the cash coming in and to ensure that expensive novelties can be paid for, supply your visitors with culinary and cultural delights at booths and stalls: tired guests enjoy a steak at the BBQ Stall or refreshments at the Pool Bar. Street musicians, a clown and a juggler provide fun entertainment. A room at the Zoo Hotel turns a visit to the Animal World into the ultimate all-round enjoyment.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wildlife-park-2-crazy-zoo--1"}
