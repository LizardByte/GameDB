The player can eat an energizer to turn the ghosts blue, making them vulnerable for a short time and allowing the player to eat them, sending their eyes back to their home base. When all the dots are cleared, a new maze is presented and gameplay resumes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jr-pac-man"}
