Your attack is a wimpy little punch whose hitbox is incredibly small; you can pick up batarangs to throw but about two thirds of the enemies and all but one of the bosses have a way of getting around them or are completely immune, forcing you to take hits to pummel a boss to death or even to progress through a level at times.  The best part of the game is easily the wall-jumping/grappling hook-swinging, mastery of which is necessary to get the most power-ups before a boss.\n\nAnd hey, the music's pretty good, right? -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YXiFFiXPURw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YXiFFiXPURw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YXiFFiXPURw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Longplay [060] Batman - Return of the Joker", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed By: Ironsharp\n\nA really not-so-good Batman game released in 1992, wherein the Batman, hero of Gotham City(TM) must apprehend the Joker for detention in the Arkham Asylum(TM).
