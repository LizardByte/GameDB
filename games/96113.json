Here two players have to join together and face frightful creatures and solve twisted puzzles to survive. The game raises a variety of social problems, the expression of which can be found in the appearance of monsters, the environment and the characters themselves.\n\nThe project is heavily inspired by Team Silent, H.R.Giger and David Lynch works.
