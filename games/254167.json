It utilized Cyberworld's proprietary QBORG technology to display 2.5D environments in a specialized browser. According to Neil Marshall, who served as a programmer and technical director for the project, the game was only available for a month before being pulled due to \"a contract dispute\". However, at least one file existed as late as 2003, and the front page of the game existed as late as 2009 according to Wayback Machine.\n\nThe game had the player set their name, choose a Pok\u00e9mon team, and select difficulty. The player would navigate a 2.5D environment, with web pages displayed on a side panel allowing for further interaction with the game world. The goal of the game was to travel to three islands, each guarded by one of the three legendary bird Pok\u00e9mon, Moltres, Zapdos, and Articuno, and retrieve an Ancient Sphere from each island.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-2000-adventure-game"}
