The other five answers are incorrect, and hitting a \"Wipeout\" loses all your money from the whole game (ouch). The two contestants with the most money at the end of round 1 go to play in the Wipeout Auction. From 12 options, players bid on how many correct answers they can pick out (up to the maximum of 8). Hitting a wipeout allows your opponent to steal the frame if they can find just one correct answer. Winning two frames gets you through to the final.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wipeout--2"}
