The game was a real-time strategy title where you controlled a submarine recovering parts of a sunken ship. You also had to mine energy from the ocean floor and deliver it to the \"core\" to upgrade your submarine. You would have to defend the core, and yourself, from enemy boats.\n\nAfter Spaceworld, the game was quietly cancelled.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/echo-delta", "videos": [{"id": 62516, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-zL1nz-Ky3s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zL1nz-Ky3s", "title": "Echo Delta - N64 Unreleased (SpaceWorld 2000)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-zL1nz-Ky3s/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
