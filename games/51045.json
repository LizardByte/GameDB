Connect puzzle pieces and watch your cities grow in a madcap cartoon environment. Race against time by picking your puzzle pieces from a rotating dispensary. Along the way you'll encounter curous creatures like the shy Bigfoot, which you can scare away with your oversized flash camera, and use dynamite to blow up rocks in your path."}
