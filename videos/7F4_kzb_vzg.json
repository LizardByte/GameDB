{"id": "7F4_kzb_vzg", "snippet": {"title": "Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot", "description": "And now, I bring you a video that's actually has a plot! For weeks now I've been giving you videos of my musical projects in Cubase. I remixed songs, covered them, and put my own spin on them, even throwing in minor compositions of my own. Not anymore! After this video, I have other video goals that don't involve Cubase.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let me explain what this is. \"Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot\" was a video game released in October 1994 for computers (Windows and Macintosh) and the SNES. What you see here is the Windows version. The game's title is presumably a combined reference to Leonard Nimoy's former television series \"In Search of...\" (which ran from 1976 to 1982) and the 1984 film \"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.\"\r\n\r\nMade by Davidson & Associates, this game is actually pretty decent. I would tell you more about it, but you can get the info you want on Wikipedia (the article title is the same as this video's title), and it even has its own IMDb page: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1555838/\r\n\r\nIn some ways, I suppose, this video is like the \"Let's play ____\" videos floating around YouTube, except that I don't offer my narration. What you're watching is my actual gameplay. I recorded the screen action and the audio at the same time, and then edited out some parts to make it all fit within ten minutes. I offer more specific comments within the video through annotations, so read those if you so choose.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nProduct Development Managed by: Dori Friedman, Product Manager; Cathy Siegel, Product Advisor \r\nProgramming: Carl Byington \r\nGraphics Created by: Luke Anderson, Lead Graphic Artist \r\nQuality Assurance: Lori Hayase, Lead Support \r\nSound Effects: Robert Koenigsberg, Tom Zehnder \r\nMusic - Tom Zehnder \r\nVoices - Mark Sawyer (Blasternaut, Spot, Trash Alien, and cave alien) and Laura Boedeker (Galactic \"G.C.\" Commander) \r\nCopyright \u00a9 1993 Davidson & Associates, Inc.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7F4_kzb_vzg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7F4_kzb_vzg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7F4_kzb_vzg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot", "description": "And now, I bring you a video that's actually has a plot!
