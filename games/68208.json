It appears that they are all coming from one central point that is controlled by a mysterious stranger. The player controls a group of heroes in this role-playing game as he tries to find out the origins of the drug and to break down on the man who is responsible for them. \n \nSpirit of Adventure allows the player to create his/her own party, choosing between various character classes, including traditional fighters and priests, but also less common classes such as Goddess or Banshee. Characters have three main parameters; body, mind, and magic, as well as strength, dexterity, IQ, and charisma. Controlling a party of up to six combatants, the player has to accept quests, explore towns, and battle enemies to advance the story.", "videos": [{"id": 27852, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "NgLeLDb8tP4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgLeLDb8tP4", "title": "Spirit of Adventure, PC DOS (1991) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgLeLDb8tP4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
