The game features an engine rebuilt from the ground up and a new fantasy styled theme. \n \nThe game is played by hitting circles bouncing down the screen when they reach a certain \"judgement\" line. Circles with green color has other targets slightly raised from the judgement line. The look and behaviour of the circles has often been compared to how an air hockey puck travels across the field, giving the series the nickname \"Rhythm Air Hockey\". \n \nSlide object introduced in Volzza were removed as they often caused technical issues. They were replaced with objects that rumble the screen and other new note types. Because of this and the engine changes, all previous song charts needed to be remade. When the game first launched only 80 songs from previous games were present. However packs of 10 song \"revivals\" has been regularly during its lifetime. Thus far 523 songs have been remade and 152 songs still waiting to be recreated in the new engine. 91 new songs has also been added to the game for a total of 614 songs. \n \nThe game focuses on a new \"Reflesia Mode\" as its main component. Where you are challenged to different quests (random selection of songs) where the opponent has a set health bar. Deplete the health bar by playing well and you will progress the story and unlock songs, as well as characters and items. These characters and items can be levelled up and equipped to be more powerful and deplete the health bar of your opponent quicker.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reflec-beat-the-reflesia-of-eternity", "videos": [{"id": 42202, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "I0935yyG3X0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0935yyG3X0", "title": "[REFLEC BEAT \u60a0\u4e45\u306e\u30ea\u30d5\u30ec\u30b7\u30a2] [15] POSSESSION (HARD) 100.0%", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I0935yyG3X0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
