Instead of a gun, the player wields a device that can make any item any size. A tree, a wall, an enemy, a passing cloud, even the levels themselves are all \"SCALEable\".\nSpace is relative in the game so progress is as much conceptual as it is physical. The player cascades through different orders of magnitude. Secrets are hidden in levels of understanding and paths are concealed behind unrealized implications.", "videos": [{"id": 3503, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MlztLu7mMrI"}]}
