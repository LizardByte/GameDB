This initiative has been named Project Overkill. As one of four mercenaries hired to protect the citizens, you must destroy hordes of alien forces while getting to the root of Terracom's nefarious purposes. Choose from a demolitions expert, a genetic hybrid, an alien weapons specialist, and a special ops assassin. The action is viewed from an isometric perspective, where your objective is to destroy anything and everything that moves. Spanning over 50 levels (including hidden areas), the game will have you infiltrating research buildings, laboratories, and blood-soaked alien territories.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-overkill"}
