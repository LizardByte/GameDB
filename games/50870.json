Released for Microsoft Windows in early March 2013, it's the first major installment in the SimCity series since the release of SimCity 4 a decade prior. An OS X version is scheduled for release during Q1/Q2 2013.\n\nThe game is considered to be a reboot of the SimCity series.Players can create a settlement that can grow into a city by zoning land for commercial, industrial, or residential development, as well as building and maintaining public services, transport and utilities. SimCity utilizes a new engine called GlassBox, allowing for more detailed simulation than previous games. Throughout its development, SimCity received critical acclaim for its new engine and reimagined gameplay; however, publications cautioned the game's use of a persistent internet connection, with which it stores saved games and allows players to share resources.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simcity-limited-edition"}
