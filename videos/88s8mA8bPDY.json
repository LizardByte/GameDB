Being the most prominent feature of having vocals like in the Rock Band games, Clone Hero/Phase Shift doesn't include only display lyrics as you play guitar, for example. I can't wait to see more from this and see what the future holds for this game. I hope you enjoy the gameplay and definitely check out the game!\n\nYARG Discord: https://discord.gg/zhKB443v\n\nYARG Github: https://github.com/EliteAsian123/YARG/releases\n\n#YARG #YetAnotherRhythmGame #rhythmgame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88s8mA8bPDY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88s8mA8bPDY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88s8mA8bPDY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88s8mA8bPDY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88s8mA8bPDY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "YARG Version 0.4 Guitar/Vocals Gameplay (Ghosts Again - Depeche Mode)", "description": "This is the gameplay of a rhythm game in development by EliteAsian123 called Yet Another Rhythm Game (YARG) that's similar to Clone Hero/Phase Shift however with the Rock Band style and gameplay.
