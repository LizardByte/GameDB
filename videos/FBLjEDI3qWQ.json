These boards include custom soundtracks and even some custom backgrounds.\n\nIf you'd like a look at what boards are included in CSWT 1.0, please check this video: https://youtu.be/qNWvz4pTrOk\n\nOr you can look at our full map repository here: https://fortunestreetmodding.github.io/maps\n\nCustom Street World Tour was created by the efforts of Deflaktor, Sophilautia and Landmaster, with contributions from 18 other map makers.\n\nIf you need help installing, or you'd like to contribute to our community, please consider joining our Discord: https://discord.gg/DE9Hn7T\n\nABOUT THESE MODS\n==================\nThis footage was recorded using Fixed Fun's HD Texture Pack: https://youtu.be/kl8rTjmgN4s\n\nMultiply Game Speed & 60fps Codes by nikkums: These two codes are an improved version of the previous Speedhack, which aims to make the game run in 60fps with increased speed, similar to Itadaki Street for PS4, but with animations and control displaying more normally than before. A version of this code exists for Wii consoles that keeps the game at the 30fps it can render while speeding up the pace of the gameplay like the 60fps version showcased in this video does. For this video, we are playing in 2x speed. Check our Discord or the video linked above for these codes.\n\nABOUT THE MOD CREATORS\n========================\nDeflaktor: https://github.com/Deflaktor\n\nSophilautia:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sophilautia\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/sophilautia\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/sophilautia\n\nLandmaster: https://github.com/Landmaster\n\nSpecial thanks:\nmask1n: https://twitter.com/mask1n\nnikkums: https://twitter.com/n1kkums", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FBLjEDI3qWQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FBLjEDI3qWQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FBLjEDI3qWQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FBLjEDI3qWQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FBLjEDI3qWQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Custom Street World Tour Map Pack 1.0 Now Available!", "description": "DOWNLOAD NOW: https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/CustomStreetWorldTour\n\nCustom Street World Tour 1.0 (or CSWT for short) is a map pack for Fortune Street and Boom Street containing 135 new maps on top of the original 18, including boards from other Itadaki Street games and many original creations from our talented board creators!
