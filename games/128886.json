The game uses a first-person perspective for the action, and is similar to Absolute's RDF: Global Conflict, also on Mega-CD. Nothing is known about the Saturn version other than being mentioned on some magazines of the time, but it's likely it would've played similarly.\n\nThe game was put on indefinite hold in late 1995 due to the poor state of Absolute's finances.\n\nSometime in the 2000s, a prototype of the Mega-CD version was found, which was later given a commercial unlicensed release by Good Deal Games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battletech-gray-death-legion", "videos": [{"id": 52251, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "nUqbx1-7p20"}]}
