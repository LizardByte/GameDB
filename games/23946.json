The player has to pass all the simulated missions, optionally including the infamous Kobayashi Maru scenario. The scenarios, in addition to simple combat situations, include a recreation of Kirk's near-disastrous starship confrontation with Khan Noonien Singh which Kirk ruefully admits is used to teach cadets to avoid his serious mistake that nearly doomed his ship. In addition, between simulator scenarios, Forester must keep his crew in check and prevent personality clashes from lowering team performance by choosing the right dialogue options during cutscenes.\n\nThe cadet crew consists of a Vulcan science officer called Sturek, a female Andorian communications officer named Vanda M'Giia, and a detached and shy human engineer Robin Brady, with Trill Jana Akton at the helm and human Geoff Corin at navigation.\n\nDuring the course of the game it is possible to foil the machinations of the Vanguard \u2014 a fanatical terrorist group dedicated to overthrowing the Federation government and installing Kirk as a despot \u2014 and to investigate the cause of increasing tensions around the Klingon Neutral Zone. On the other hand, it is possible to be dismissed from the Academy in disgrace if the wrong choice is made during certain full motion video sequences.", "summary": "Star Trek: Starfleet Academy is a PC Star Trek simulation game that simulates the life of a typical Starfleet cadet. The object in the game is for the player to learn the basics of flying a starship so that the player can eventually become a captain of one's very own ship.\n\nIt includes a simulation battle mode in which the player can pilot and fight ships of their choosing. It's also the first time in a video game that free-motion CGI filming took place. The in-game movies, directed by Martin Denning, at the time represented a breakthrough in CGI-Live Action rendering.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-trek-starfleet-academy", "videos": [{"id": 9854, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "AnhcnBy-2FE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnhcnBy-2FE", "title": "Starfleet Academy 01: Target Practice", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AnhcnBy-2FE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9856, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "lkU9hTNTD-Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkU9hTNTD-Y", "title": "Starfleet Academy: Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lkU9hTNTD-Y/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9855, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eFdmToaAYjw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFdmToaAYjw", "title": "Star Trek: Starfleet Academy - Game Trailer (1997) Macintosh/PC (Windows)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFdmToaAYjw/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3440, "name": "Star Trek"}], "characters": [{"id": 10478, "name": "Oavai"}, {"id": 1037, "name": "Newscaster"}, {"id": 10526, "name": "Kumas"}, {"id": 10523, "name": "Alshoff"}, {"id": 10480, "name": "Captain Kirk"}, {"id": 10522, "name": "Tharos Greenly"}, {"id": 10494, "name": "Dukret"}, {"id": 10524, "name": "Jasmine Lee"}, {"id": 10525, "name": "Mark Grear"}, {"id": 10497, "name": "Toracles Varo"}, {"id": 10477, "name": "Vor"}, {"id": 10507, "name": "Hseih"}, {"id": 10510, "name": "Shulaman"}, {"id": 10514, "name": "Klingon Spokesperson"}, {"id": 10516, "name": "Marqa"}, {"id": 10521, "name": "Davat"}, {"id": 10482, "name": "Captain Sulu"}, {"id": 10483, "name": "David Forester"}, {"id": 10484, "name": "Sturek"}, {"id": 10489, "name": "Robin Brady"}, {"id": 10490, "name": "Frank Malan"}, {"id": 10509, "name": "Jessie Owens"}, {"id": 10515, "name": "John Tarkinton"}, {"id": 10518, "name": "Jonathan Davies"}, {"id": 10520, "name": "Derek Brentwood"}, {"id": 10476, "name": "McNeal"}, {"id": 10481, "name": "Commander Chekov"}, {"id": 10488, "name": "Geoff Corin"}, {"id": 10491, "name": "Faith Gage"}, {"id": 10493, "name": "Darvi Zora"}, {"id": 10498, "name": "Konovin"}, {"id": 10501, "name": "Thomas Horn"}, {"id": 10502, "name": "Marcai Mav"}, {"id": 10503, "name": "Jason Royce"}, {"id": 10506, "name": "Jacob McNeil"}, {"id": 10508, "name": "Alison Morel"}, {"id": 10512, "name": "Maggie Horn"}, {"id": 10517, "name": "Francis Neill"}, {"id": 10479, "name": "Zashar"}, {"id": 10485, "name": "Aex Rotherot"}, {"id": 10492, "name": "Vanguard Spokesperson"}, {"id": 10500, "name": "Shantur Tenek"}, {"id": 10504, "name": "Durka"}, {"id": 10505, "name": "M5K"}, {"id": 10511, "name": "Var"}, {"id": 10513, "name": "Emdervoss"}, {"id": 10519, "name": "Velur"}, {"id": 10499, "name": "Anne Trava"}, {"id": 10496, "name": "Telepath"}, {"id": 421, "name": "Voice Over Cast"}, {"id": 10486, "name": "Vanda M'Giia"}, {"id": 10487, "name": "Jana Akton"}, {"id": 10495, "name": "Caldoss"}]}
