Having been charged with an unknown, often absurd crime, you are forced to bargain for their innocence from a sadistic kangaroo judge who takes every opportunity to belittle and harass them. Players can take any number of strategies against the Kangaroo, including bribery, sucking up, and confrontation. They all invariably result in failure or death. The goal of Kangaroo Court isn't victory so much as seeing how long you can go against increasingly unfair and randomized odds.\n\nThis video shows off a complete \"playthrough\" of the game from beginning to end. I'm happy with what I captured, minus one hilarious \"Yeah right!\" response to pleading Not Guilty. There's some surefire ways to pass the various writing challenges, but it's almost more fun to see how far the game is willing to tolerate.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9EolJKu2n10/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9EolJKu2n10/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9EolJKu2n10/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9EolJKu2n10/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9EolJKu2n10/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Kangaroo Court", "description": "Kangaroo Court is a 1991 HyperCard game by Dave and P.F.
