This was one of the most frequently requested features, and now it's here - a powerful tool to create highly customized landscapes.\n\nWith the map editor, you can make beautiful fields, hills, and valleys for your beaver societies.\nYou can also add and edit bodies of water by creating wonderful rivers, lakes, and waterfalls at a click of a mouse.\n\nWe also included a convenient tree tool that will help you plant dense forests - or small groves - in no time. Want to precisely place every single tree yourself? You can do that as well!\n\nYou will also have full control over the natural resources. Do you want to build a plentiful paradise or a hellish desert with hardly any wood to spare? That\u2019s up to you.\n\nEven if (Bearded-Beaver-In-The-Sky forbid) you get bored with the core game, the map editor will ensure you spend hours upon hours creating your ultimate Beaver World.\n\nSo what do you think about the map editor? What's the first thing you will use it for? Do you plan on recreating New York into New Beaveryork?
