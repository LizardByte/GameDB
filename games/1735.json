Dr. Light deduces that Dr. Wily must be running powerful jamming waves to interfere with the super computer and is behind the army of robots, and asks Mega Man to stop the robots.", "summary": "Mega Man III is an action-platform video game by Capcom for the Nintendo Game Boy. It is the third game in the handheld version of the Mega Man series. The game follows the title character Mega Man as he fights the evil Dr. Wily, whose latest attempt to conquer the world involves sucking energy from the Earth's core to power a new machine. Along with foes from his past, Mega Man must contend with the next robot in Wily's line of \"Mega Man Killers\", Punk. Like its two consecutive predecessors on the Game Boy, the game combines elements from two previously released Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles: Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 4. In 2013, Mega Man III was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-iii", "videos": [{"id": 49119, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "C8-IjpWJGc8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8-IjpWJGc8", "title": "Game Boy Longplay [011] Mega Man III", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C8-IjpWJGc8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 116737, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VxefnwmJlhc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxefnwmJlhc", "title": "\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf & \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3 & \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4 Nintendo Switch Online \u8ffd\u52a0\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb [2024\u5e746\u67087\u65e5]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VxefnwmJlhc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6377, "name": "Rockman World"}]}
