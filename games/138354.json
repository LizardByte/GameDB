She believes the answer lies with Vaulthalla, a mythical place that induces insanity in all who learn its true nature. Of course, your average psycho isn't going to peacefully sit still and share Vaulthalla's secrets, so the closest you can get to a willing participant is Krieg, a fellow Crimson Raider and the most badass psycho there is.\n\nProblem is, Krieg's not the best communicator, what with all his aggressive, barely coherent screaming. Using technology that lesser intellects couldn't possibly comprehend, Tannis is beaming you and your fellow Vault Hunters directly into Krieg's consciousness so you can discover Vaulthalla for yourself. You'll need to team up with both of Krieg's opposing personas\u2014a raging murder machine and a calm inner voice\u2014if you want any chance of surviving his twisted, meat-filled mindscapes and reaping Vaulthalla's rewards.", "summary": "Ready to say goodbye to sanity, Vault Hunter?
