I waited for scheduled planes to start with wait times of well over an hour each with some menial cargo work added in just to keep you watching the screen. I had only 8 minutes to load/unload cargo on a cargo plane but it took the ai well over 60 minutes to load/unload passengers from a passenger plane.\nThis game also had the most bugs I have ever seen. Extend tunnels collapsing, stairs colliding with planes, invisible cargo, terrible schedule algorithms and glitchy 2004-like graphics were just a few game-ending bugs guaranteed to make me restart my game every ten minutes. I saved/restarted well over a hundred times in the game. There were enough errors to test even the toughest gamer's mettle but with plenty of patience and perseverance and despite all the glitches, I finally finished Airport Simulator 2014. I just had to. Don't ask why! I've highlighted some of the game's best features in this video.
