This is Konami's Mario Roulette, a Medal game from 1991. Or, at least, it's an emulation of it in MAME.

Because of MAME's emulation issues, it's hard to see what reels you're going to get before you hit them, although it's very likely pre-set or generated after you hit the button without any skill mechanic involved.\n\nThe music in this is rather neat, since it's Super Mario World songs arranged in a style akin to early Namco or Sega arcade games.\n\nExpect this in your MAME sets soon! Let's hope Super Mario Attack is next!\n\nThanks for watching!
