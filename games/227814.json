Yes, they egged people's houses, but they used cage-free eggs! And the toilet paper in the trees was always 2-ply for extra comfort. If the neighbors were unhappy, they shouldn't have given out raisins and dental floss! So it was something of a surprise to these considerate fourth-graders when the Pumpking emerged that night to take their entire candy haul (even the rare full-size bars!). Now, using only their wits, the power of sugar, and several very sharp knives, these tweens are on a mission to take back their sweet earnings.", "summary": "Play as Elma and Harper, two tweens who may or may not have inadvertently summoned the evil Pumpking, who has swiped the whole neighborhood's Halloween candy and hidden it inside his army of tiny, adorable decorative gourds. Smash the pumpkins to find candy, then chow down. Once you're turbo-charged with sugar, transform into a costume-clad avenger and bash the Pumpking until he explodes! Master four unique levels and go for a high score in one- and two-player modes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/candy-creeps", "videos": [{"id": 79009, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "S1cJyUwblas"}]}
