The player would choose from 5 different classes, which would change the story, and intertwine with one another. \n \nProject Offset was one of the best looking games for its time. With features like Real-Time Ambient Occlusion, Real-Time Shadows, Cinematic Quality Motion Blur, Depth of Field, Specular Bloom, and Soft Particles, the Offset Engine had more special effects than most other engines currently on the market. The Self-Shadow Technique would later be used by Unreal Engine 3 and CryEngine 2. \n \nIntel (having acquired Offset Software in 2008) canceled the game in mid-2010, stating that the reason was \"recent changes in our product roadmap\". Which was believed to be connected to the failure of Larrabee as a consumer product.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-offset", "videos": [{"id": 16530, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "W2B90yTn_vM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2B90yTn_vM", "title": "GDC 2006 Project Offset", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W2B90yTn_vM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16529, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jVk1GArKqfo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVk1GArKqfo", "title": "Meteor", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jVk1GArKqfo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
