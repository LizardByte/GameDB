The radical update which harnesses the power of Ray Tracing capable GPUs to deliver an incredible visual upgrade.\n\nThe Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition is free for all existing owners of Metro Exodus on PC, but the upgrade is so extensive, it can not be delivered as a patch - instead, it is available as a separate entitlement. Upgrades include DLSS 2.0 Inclusion, Ray Traced Emissive Lighting used throughout, FOV slider, increased framerates and display resolutions. A Ray Tracing capable GPU is the minimum spec for this beast, and you can upgrade right now for free if you own Metro Exodus.\n\nFollow us on:\nWeb: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3rpVmMh\nTwitch: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3vVI6CJ\nTwitter: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3fdOUFK\nFacebook: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/2NWKVCw", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dv_KUQg_ffY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dv_KUQg_ffY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dv_KUQg_ffY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dv_KUQg_ffY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dv_KUQg_ffY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Metro Exodus | Enhanced Edition Trailer", "description": "\u2705  Link to the game \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3vU3Pu3\n\nThe Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition is out now!
