Damage the boss enemy, who is always present on each side, and defeat, capture, or force them to retreat, and the castle gate will open.

You can make captured generals your allies after clearing the stage. Capture all the strong enemies and make them your allies to create your own strongest army (you can have up to 14 generals). If your ship, Genesis-3, loses its vitality or the time limit runs out, it will be destroyed and the game will be over.
