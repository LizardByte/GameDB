Heading on a journey together with new allies and two princesses with whom he overcame a sage's trials, the Hero seeks to obtain a sacred relic which is said to vanquish demons.\n\nHowever, the Hero and his party meet an untimely demise when they encounter a surprise-attack by the Demon King. With humanity's last hope lost, it seemed like the world was all but in the hands of the Demon Lord...\n\nIn his fading state of consciousness, the Hero extends his arm towards his captured party members. In that moment, the Hero hears a voice pleading for help somewhere deep in the darkness.\n\n\"Someone please help me...\"\n\nDrawn to the voice, the Hero's spirit is summoned by Julietta, a princess from a faraway land being held prisoner in the Demon King's castle. The two quickly figure out that Julietta's desire to escape and the Hero's desire to rescue his party members are aligned with one another.", "summary": "At long last a completely new sequel to Prison Princess, the mystery-solving adventure game where you guide princesses to escape the clutches of the Demon King!", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/prison-princess-trapped-allure"}
