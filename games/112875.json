Like most young people, he wants to understand who he is more than anything. In this case, he wants to understand who he could be. The mystery of Loki\u2019s role in the upcoming conflict is something that Atreus cannot let go of. He wants to keep his family safe, but Atreus also doesn\u2019t want to stand by and do nothing while conflict consumes the Nine Realms.\n\nKratos, still bearing the knowledge of his past mistakes, wants to spare Atreus the bloody lessons he learned from his conflict with gods. He wants to keep his son safe, above all, and their confrontation with Baldur has vindicated the belief that only tragedy will come from further entanglements with the Aesir.\n\nTogether, Kratos and Atreus will have to make a choice about which path they will take. Whatever they choose will define the fate of all those living in the Nine Realms as Ragnar\u00f6k approaches.", "summary": "God of War: Ragnar\u00f6k is the tentative title for the upcoming action-adventure game in development by Santa Monica Studio and to be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE).
