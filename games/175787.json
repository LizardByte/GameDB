You have the strong mind and passionate heart needed to defeat him. Will you accept the quest?\n\nWith a wave of his icy fingers, the Snow King unleashed a bitter frost on the tropical islands across Earth. Palm trees iced over, fish were frozen solid in the seas and birds could no longer take flight. Setting up a palace on the edge of this arctic wasteland, the Snow King's chilly spirit took pleasure in expanding his kingdom beyond the North Pole. To safeguard his empire, he built a chain of 60 puzzles meant to stop even the wisest sage from reaching his castle and breaking the spell.\n\nIn Arctic Quest, you set out to solve the puzzles, each of which takes the shape of an animal or other tropical wonder. As pieces of ice fall from the sky, you grab them with your mouse, rotate them and place them on a grid within the puzzle, filling in the shape and returning warmth to the island bit by bit. If the waters that surround your once balmy home fill up with unused ice, your quest will fail. Luckily, a small fire burns on your land, allowing you to melt surplus ice. You can also earn bonuses that grant you various powers, such as the ability to smash excess ice or paint in portions of the grid.", "summary": "With a wave of his icy fingers, the Snow King unleashed a bitter frost on the tropical islands across Earth.
