It brought her brief fame (and a modest sum of cash for a pre-teen), but\u2014most importantly\u2014it made her feel special.

Beth decides this is her last chance to rekindle that childhood sense of adventure. There\u2019s too much ground to cover by herself, so (despite warnings from her friends) she\u2019s hatched a plan to invite Adam back into her life. Beth\u2019s search for the long-lost earring will unearth much more than she's bargained for.", "summary": "The Magnificent Trufflepigs is a first-person, romantic, metal-detecting game.
