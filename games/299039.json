On the night of your debut into society as an adult, you attend the Ball of Indigo Flowers. While there, you encounter a mysterious man who sweeps you off your feet and charms you with his good manners. He disappears before you can talk to him more. Suddenly a man drags you onto the dance floor, and you realize he\u2019s your childhood friend, believed to have died in a war between humans and ghouls. Shocked and overwhelmed, you decide to attend a party at his mansion the following night. Once again, you encounter the mysterious man who noticed your scent, and his enigmatic but handsome brother. While out on the patio, you\u2019re suddenly attacked by a man with glowing red eyes...a ghoul! Your childhood friend saves you, but you find yourself drawn into the world of ghouls, learning more about them and the war. Three handsome men with their own personalities and opinions accompany you, each one vying for your attention. But questions and danger plague you. What is this power you have that quells a ghoul\u2019s violent rage? Who is the person trying to kill you?
