The rebels however had support from Europe, with France and Spain later joining the war as allies to their cause.

The war ended in 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris and global recognition of the sovereignty of the United States.", "summary": "Rebels and Redcoats recreates the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War.
