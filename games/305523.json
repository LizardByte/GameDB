The game challenges players to unravel hidden anomalies strewn across the enigmatic corridor of the Byilhan Hotel.\n\nEach floor of the hotel presents a unique canvas, with some adorned by the peculiarities of anomalies while others maintain an eerie semblance of normalcy. Your task is to discern the subtle nuances that distinguish the ordinary from the extraordinary, as every object, every angle, and every shadow holds a potential clue.\nTraverse the hallways with caution, for not all anomalies reveal themselves readily.\n\nIf you suspect there is an anomaly, turn back. If you believe everything is normal, that there are no anomalies, do not turn back and continue down the corridor. If you make a mistake, you will know by looking at the level number. If the number has increased, you have made the correct choice. If you return to level 1, you have made a mistake and will need to start over (the anomalies will be different). The goal is to reach the final level.\n\nNavigate the twists and turns of the Byilhan Hotel, unraveling its mysteries one anomaly at a time.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/exit16-byilhan-hotel", "videos": [{"id": 123885, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BSQY7_2MQBQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSQY7_2MQBQ", "title": "UN ABONN\u00c9 FAIT UN JEU D'ANOMALIES SUR MOI \ud83d\ude28 (la dinguerie)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BSQY7_2MQBQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
