And it's out now on just about everything - PC, Switch, PS4, Vita, mobile, some streaming stuff... etc!\n\nwww.necrosoftgames.com/gunhouse\n\nA version of Gunhouse was originally released on the PlayStation Mobile (Vita) platform in 2014. It was coded by Jim Crawford (Frog Fractions series), with music by Disasterpeace (Fez, Hyper Light Drifter), unique hand-drawn visuals by magazine artist Juan Ramirez, and was written and directed by Brandon Sheffield (Street Fighter 30th, Indivisible, Sine Mora EX).\n\nSince that early release, we've added more enemies, more stages, a hardcore mode, higher res graphics, more story, rotating objectives, stats tracking (offline), and a whole lot more! We also rebalanced the game, improved the tutorial, added a help section and a bunch of stuff we probably forgot!\n\nDepending on the platform, we support controllers, touch, keyboard, mouse... and PC supports all those!\n\nWe hope you'll have a cool time with it!
