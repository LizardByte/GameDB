One fateful day, however, everything went wrong in the happy-go-lucky galaxy when all of the Unlimit Energy was stolen! Kranion, ever prideful, grew sick of being clowned on in Fast Cars Underground 2. Rather than admit he sucks at the game, he rounded up his army of Kranibots that he has for some reason and went on a galaxy wide looting spree!\n\nYet, there is hope. In a stadium on the floating Mystic Island live the Super Freaks, four half-brothers who always beat Kranion and other villains by using Unlimit Energy and Unlimit Powers. Unfortunately, no Unlimit Energy means the Super Freaks are denied their greatest weapon! The Super Freaks aren\u2019t chumps though\u2014they have several techniques they\u2019ve honed over the years thanks to training with their Uncle Swordsman. Can they beat Kranion and take back the Unlimit Energy before he plunges the galaxy into mediocrity? \u2026obviously yes! But they\u2019re gonna need your platforming skills and dexterity to do it. Maybe bring a few buddies along with you too.", "summary": "Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition is a 2D platformer featuring single player and up to four player drop-in/drop-out cooperative gameplay.\nGo to the right, jump on enemy heads, reach the exit, all of that standard stuff.
