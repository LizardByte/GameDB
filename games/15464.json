EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL PROCEDURES TO TO ESCAPE NOSTROMO.\" The screen then cuts to black and recalls the remaining crew's discussion on how they will take their chances in the shuttle. The screen then cuts to Ripley in the shuttle docking bay contacting Parker regarding the coolant cylinders. A short while later Ripley hears the Alien attack the two, with Ripley hearing their frantic screams. As she reaches them on C Deck, she realizes she's too late, only finding her fellow crewmembers' corpses in the room. She takes Parker's keycard from his body to unlock the door to engineering control. There, she is able to reverse a ship lockdown to access the area where the Self destruct system is located. \n \nRipley arrives at the destination and initiates the self destruct system. The game then replicates the sequence in the original movie in which Ripley runs through the corridors of a perishing Nostromo under the duress of the Alien. As she manages to get on board the Narcissus, the screen fades to black and then cuts to a screen of the Narcissus broadcast system, with Ripley's voice being heard. She then delivers her final monologue seen at the end of the original movie: \"Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo. Third officer reporting. The other members of the crew - Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash and Captain Dallas, are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier in about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.\" \n \nAs the screen fades to black a second time, an extra line of dialogue can be heard: \"I'll see you soon Amanda. Be a good girl, I love you.\"", "summary": "As Ellen Ripley, it is down to you to complete the last mission on board the Nostromo. The rest of the crew are dead.
