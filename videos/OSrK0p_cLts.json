Power hungry title for PC and PSX blends strategy, war gaming and action arcade gameplay.\n\nAtlanta, GA \u2013 May 28, 1998 - It\u2019s the ultimate power trip:  Employ the right balance of offensive might and defensive acumen, and the world is yours for the taking.  Psygnosis\u2019 Global Domination\u00ae for PC CD-ROM and Sony PlayStation\u2122 forges a new genre of game that combines 3D strategy, war gaming and arcade combat shoot \u2018em up.  But whether you\u2019re pushing the \u201cdetonate\u201d button from the safety of your war room or shooting a hail of bullets from the cockpit of your fighter, your goal is the same \u2013 global domination as Commander In Chief of the planet.  Global Domination\u00ae is planned for release in winter of 1998. \n\nFight Your Way to the Top\nGlobal Domination\u00ae offers many levels of gameplay.  It\u2019s a game of strategy, speed and skill mixed with non-stop action; and it\u2019s real-time gameplay that offers decisive victory.  It\u2019s you versus the computer in single player mode or you versus 15 other power hungry recruits over a network.  \n\nSet in 2015, you start off as a newly trained recruit resolving small conflicts.  Eventually, one country comes under your control, and you know what they say: Give \u2018em a country and they want the world!  As you work your way to the top, it falls to you to save the earth from the oppressive grasp of World Order Enterprises (not that being supreme ruler of the planet doesn\u2019t have its side benefits).  You can play pre-set computer generated scenarios or design your own game with the Scenario Editor.  \n\nThe game comes with 20 pre-set missions, and live action FMV briefings before each scenario describe your mission goals and communicate the developing story.  An end-of-game Score Sheet includes your final rank, number of territories gained and lost, and time of game.  If you want to create original missions, the in-game Scenario Editor lets you define numerous game components, including number of players, technology level, who owns which countries and the conditions for victory.  \n\nGlobal Domination\u00ae takes real-time war gaming to the extreme since you can take action anytime, anywhere in the world.  Determine your strategy for conquering territories, whether it\u2019s launching major attacks against known enemies, picking off smaller neutrals and building your base of power, or defending other countries to gain their allegiance.  You have access to a wide range of weaponry and many modes of attack with submarines, battleships, satellites, cruisers and bombers at your disposal.  \n\nThe game\u2019s weapons are from the past, present and future.  They include the destructive power of fuel/air explosives and nuclear weapons, the electronic warfare capability of elemental warheads, and the economically devastating Firestorm warheads.  Defensive weapons include basic intercept missiles, electronic missile jammers that cause missiles to drop on whatever county they\u2019re over, and super advanced reverser missiles that reprogram a missile to return to its launch site and explode.  Successful missions are rewarded with more technologically advanced weapons and promotions through the ranks.\n\nIn addition to executing strategic missions, you also can play Global Domination\u00ae in Academy Mode and Arcade Mode.  Academy Mode provides a training section that begins with relatively easy tasks and progresses through more and more challenging simulated scenarios.  A computer \u201cvoice\u201d leads you through the Academy scenarios, and your level of success at the Academy determines your rank when you enter real action.  In Arcade Mode, the strategy element is pared down to provide a greater arcade experience.  Weapons are limited to one attack and one defense so the action is even more intense.\n\nFormat: PlayStation, PC CD-ROM\nLaunch: 4th Quarter 1998\nGenre: Action / Strategy\nNumber Of Players: PlayStation \u2013 1, PC CD-ROM \u2013 1-16\nDeveloper: Psygnosis Leeds\n\nKey Features\n-Play using careful strategy or brute force \u2013 the greatest rewards go to those who use their resources skillfully\n-Unpredictable, real-time gameplay with adaptable artificial intelligence\n-Up to 16 players on PC via LAN; 2 players via Serial or Modem.\n-Totally configurable gameplay plus a mission editor included\n-Live action mission briefings\n-Huge array of totally realistic weapons, attack/defense missile silos, submarines, battleships, satellites, cruisers and bombers\n-Weapon technology ranges from post-World War II to mid-21st century", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSrK0p_cLts/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSrK0p_cLts/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSrK0p_cLts/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Global Domination trailer - 1998 | Game Archives", "description": "Trailer of Global Domination from Psygnosis's 1998 press kit CD.\n----\nPRESS INFORMATION:\n\nTake control of the world in Psygnosis\u2019 Global Domination.
