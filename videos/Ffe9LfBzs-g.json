{"id": "Ffe9LfBzs-g", "snippet": {"title": "Pokemon - Ash's Room in Unreal Engine 4", "description": "Now enjoy the VR Experience! https://gumroad.com/l/RExH\n\nIn honor of the 20th year anniversary of Pok\u00e9mon I decided to recreate Ash\u2019s room in Unreal Engine 4. Watching the Sun and Moon announcement trailer really inspired me to finish this project. I owned every single one of the Gameboys that they showed in the trailer and the main reason was to play Pok\u00e9mon. \n\nThere are a few things that are not in the original but I added in to pay homage. It turned out being almost a blend of multiple points in time in the series. Ash wore Red's style hat at a later point in the series so I use it instead. Good tribute to both. I tend to lean on a very detailed (sometimes over detailed) and mechanical style of things but in this case I stayed with a style that is similar to the show. Very simple textures with good lighting. I also went ahead and designed a user interface of what I imagined Pokedex software would look like on a pc.\n\nI hope you all enjoy :D\n\nDetails:\nEngine: Unreal Engine 4\nTime taken: About 4 days after work.\nAll post and editing was done inside the engine, No external post.\nI rendered from the viewport with Director Tools for UE4. http://director-tools.com/ \n\nCredits:\nThe song is a Pokemon Red and Blue orchestral.
