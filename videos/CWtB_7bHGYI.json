I have played it for a while and created a lot of coasters, including all the different types. What makes this coaster simulator better then the other ones is that there are much more and more complicated possibilities to manipulate your tracks and also (as the name says) there are no limits about the track length, so you can let go your inspiration at full hearth and build whatever you like. The downside is that the environments are very limited, however, and therefor your ride can be 'screwed' by the ugly environments. Also, the highest resolution is 1600x1200 which seriously reduced the gameplay experience when playing on a full HD monitor/TV. But all in all, it's a game that's worth trying and especially if coasters are your favorites. Also, there are several sites (look wikipedia link) where you can exchange coasters specificly designed for this engine.\n\nMy Computer:\n\n- Windows 7 Premium\n- CPU (Processor) - Intel Quad Core i7 860 @ 2.80GHz\n- GPU (Graphics Card) - ATI Radeon HD 5870 (1Gig)\n- Memory - 8 Gigabite (4x2gig)\n- Soundcard: ASUS Xonar D2\n- Monitor - SyncMaster B2230 (Full HD / 70000:1 Dynamic Contrast / (1920x1080)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CWtB_7bHGYI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CWtB_7bHGYI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CWtB_7bHGYI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CWtB_7bHGYI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CWtB_7bHGYI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ultimate Ride - Gameplay Trailer HD (1080p)", "description": "Ultimate Ride - Gameplay Trailer HD (1600x1200) Own-made\n\nINFO\n\n* Developpers: Gigawatt Studios & Disney  Imagineering\n* Publishers: Disney Interactive\n* Soundtrack: From the game itself, so I don't know the name.\n* More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate...\n\n* System Requirements (Minimum):\n- Windows 95B/98/Me/XP (Windows 7 run as administrator)\n- Pentium\u2122 II processor, 333 MHz\n- 32 RAM or more\n- DirectX 8.0a (Included)\n- 120mb (uncompressed) free hard-drive space\n- 16-bit with a directX 8.0a compatible soundcard\n- DirectX 8.0a Compatible 8mb GPU with 3D-Speed (16 bit color)\n\nUltimate Ride is a Roller Coaster Simulator for Microsoft Windows and has an advanced engine to create and ride own-made roller coasters.
