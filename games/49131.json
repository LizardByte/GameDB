The game is heavily\noriented towards platforming, with only a couple of blow bubbles-based weapons\nlittered throughout the game's short four levels.\n\nShin-chan can hop onto the heads of the enemy humans that are\ninterspersed around each stage, as well as use the bubbles to knock them out. He\ncan also hop onto hooks and branches, and scale telephone poles and trees.\nThere are also three mini-games in Crayon Shin-Chan along with a fourth\nkind-of mini-game. Although all four mini-games are encountered in the course of\nyour playthrough, you can also access them from the title screen using the\nsecond option presented to you.\n\nAlso of note is a timer in each of the level. For some weird reason, if\nyou try to collect everything in a level, there simply is not enough time, at\nleast in Level 2. Fortunately, you are given checkpoints throughout each of the\nlevels. Timing out will simply throw you back to one of the checkpoints.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crayon-shin-chan-ora-to-shiro-ha-otomodachi-da-yo", "videos": [{"id": 67568, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QdX8YXOYOkM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdX8YXOYOkM", "title": "GB Longplay - Crayon Shin-chan: Ora to Shiro wa Otomodachi Da yo (\u30af\u30ec\u30e8\u30f3\u3057\u3093\u3061\u3083\u3093 \u30aa\u30e9\u3068\u30b7\u30ed\u306f\u304a\u53cb\u9054\u3060\u3088)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QdX8YXOYOkM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
