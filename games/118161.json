By lifting planters out of the ground and sowing seeds in pots of various shapes and sizes, players are able to craft unique, bountiful landscapes for virtual relaxation.", "summary": "A serene, mystical journey that traverses a series of otherworldly, organic landscapes, Fujii is a respite for weary travelers.
