Tell us brave warrior, how can we triumph & colonize this new world? What shall we make of these horned beast that walk upright & appear to be human-like? Are they simply relics of an ancient time, or the remains of an existing army of terror?! The sword of Vyskata? We found it, with the boney arm of the last one that brandished it, and met his fate! On the hand the ring of Luzhevyani, the great grandfather of Poluyan Vyskata the warrior. Who was it that took his life so long ago. And are they still here, O Great One?", "summary": "Swarog is an unique real-time strategy game set in ancient Russia. There is the story of a violent Pagan God and the people he leads to victory over their enemies. In a series of missions your leadership ability is put to the test and you have to gather food, wood and ore in order to take care of your peasants. Then tax them as you need to raise an army to protect your subjects from attack by the vicious invasion forces that threaten your borders. You can choose from the two scenarios, ones for Kranks or Luzhevyans. Each mission consists of several levels, each level has its own major task to accomplish in order to achieve victory.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/swarog"}
