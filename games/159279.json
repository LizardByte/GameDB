It was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1999 as a launch title for the 64DD, for which a soundtrack by Tatsuhiko Asano was released on CD by Media Factory, early the next year. Both of these received positive reviews. An expansion was released five months later called Kyojin no Doshin Kaihou Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishuugou (or Kyojin no Doshin 2), which takes a very different perspective of the game, featuring short animated clips that the player can unlock after playing the original game. The game had an enhanced port with better graphics for the Nintendo GameCube, which was released in Europe under the name \"Doshin the Giant\".\n\nEven though untranslated, the game has the English official title of Doshin the Giant 1, according to the official website (English version).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doshin-the-giant-1", "videos": [{"id": 60063, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "R1SJIWEKhUE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1SJIWEKhUE", "title": "[Nintendo 64DD] Kyojin no Doshin 1 First Launch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R1SJIWEKhUE/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6167, "name": "Doshin the Giant"}]}
