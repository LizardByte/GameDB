{"id": "BkyCCYcoWiw", "snippet": {"title": "Deal or No Deal (Wii) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Zoo Games' 2009 game show adaptation for the Nintendo Wii, Deal or No Deal. \n\nThis video shows a playthrough of an episode in TV Show mode. \n\nSo, did you ever find yourself watching Deal or No Deal on TV and thinking,  \"Hmm, this would make a good video game! People love playing video games that rely on sheer luck rather than skill!\" Well, if you have,  you might want to rethink your perspective.  And if you haven't, well congratulations - some modicum of common sense prevented you from thinking that!\n\nJust like the game show, it's random. Whether a game goes well or not has nothing to do with your intelligence or strategy. Guess, and if you're lucky, you own! Yay! But the game does try with the little that it has to work with. It features a fairly good rendering of the show's studio, and chibi-Howie Mandel is present and fully voiced. The music and dramatic effects are all included,  and the ladies are here too, of course. Well, as long as you don't mind that they all look the same but for color and hair, and they all look like they suffered from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome - their eyes are too huge and dead looking to assume everything is normal. \n\nIf you want a faithful translation of the show into game format,  this does the job exceedingly well. If you want a game that doesn't require anything of you but a forward-looking stare and an gaping mouth, its perfect! Everyone else might do well to set their sights just a bit higher.\n____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BkyCCYcoWiw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BkyCCYcoWiw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BkyCCYcoWiw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BkyCCYcoWiw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BkyCCYcoWiw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Deal or No Deal (Wii) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Zoo Games' 2009 game show adaptation for the Nintendo Wii, Deal or No Deal. \n\nThis video shows a playthrough of an episode in TV Show mode. \n\nSo, did you ever find yourself watching Deal or No Deal on TV and thinking,  \"Hmm, this would make a good video game!
