Stone (Travis George Michael Steven) contributed with making the game this time, instead of it all being done by Ongokiller50 like the previous game. They both took the task of animating things in the game like the playable characters, but Stone did the graphics for the game, which explains the different artstyle of the game compared to the previous game. The game is usually considered to be a sequel to the game \"Combat Tournament\", which was created a year earlier in 2010, though as said by Ongokiller50, Combat Tournament Legends is really just an improved and better version of the previous game, this time being beta tested by other people as well.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/combat-tournament-legends"}
