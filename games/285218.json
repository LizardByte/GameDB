That's precisely why the game was developed for Facebook.\n\nIn this multiplayer-focused game, you must lead a group of cangaceiros (bandits) in turn-based battles, navigating through farms, towns, and swamps of the caatinga (Brazilian northeastern region). The battles occur turn by turn, and a single combat can last from a few minutes to several weeks: you make your move and then wait for your opponent (who might be offline at the moment). There are two distinct groups in the game: the cangaceiros and the volante (police force). As you challenge and defeat your enemies, you climb the ranks, getting closer to the title of the canga\u00e7o king.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cangaco-wargame", "videos": [{"id": 106490, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZZt9slXb8rQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZt9slXb8rQ", "title": "CANGAC\u0327O WARGAME", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZZt9slXb8rQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
