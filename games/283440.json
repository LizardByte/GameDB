When it reaches zero, you cannot climb or jump. You can replenish stamina by landing, or using a green stamina coin. Collecting gold coins will increase your maximum stamina.\n\nYou will slip down when climbing on ice blocks. You cannot climb on obsidian blocks, and magma blocks will quickly drain your stamina while you climb them.\n\nFor an extra challenge, try to get to the top of the mountain without letting your stamina reach zero, or collect all the coins!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alpine-ascent"}
