The Focke Wulfs and Messerschmitts flown by the Luftwaffe\u2019s \u2019experten\u2019 proved to be more than a worthy foe for the RAF\u2019s new Spitfire Mk.IX-s. The air supremacy of the Allies was still just a distant dream. In the thickest of this battle stood the Biggin Hill Wing with 611 (West Lancashire) and 340 (Ile de France) Squadrons. As a result of thorough research in the national archives, squadron records and combat reports, Reflected Simulations managed to recreate 14 of these sorties down to the smallest details. Come, join 611 Squadron at the height of the air war over Europe, and experience what it was like to be a fighter pilot in the RAF in the most realistic way that it\u2019s ever been possible in a simulator.\n\nKey Features:\n- 14 historical historical missions based on extensive research\n- 7 further missions and cut-scenes\n- Detailed campaign documentation\n- Realistic briefings and briefing images, including separate PDF mission files\n- Unique kneeboard cards and checklists for each mission\n- Maps, official forms and pilots notes\n- Nearly a thousand specially recorded voice-over messages and radio broadcasts\n- Historically accurate custom skins\n- A wide array of missions including rodeos, circus, practice flights and scrambles\n\nRequired modules:\n- DCS Spitfire Mk.IXc\n- WWII Asset Pack\n- Channel map", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UWkobUc61r0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UWkobUc61r0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UWkobUc61r0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UWkobUc61r0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UWkobUc61r0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DCS: Spitfire Mk.IX Beware!
