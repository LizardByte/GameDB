The game had different licenses with well-known cricketers in different countries. It was Audiogenic's second cricket game, 8 years after Graham Gooch's Test Match.\n\nAll the international sides are present, with the chance to change the player data and choose the team yourself. Test match and limited-overs matches are available, with 1 or 2 innings per team, and you can turn the Leg-before-wicket dismissal off, which makes the game easier to understand.\n\nThere are 3 skill levels - Amateur, Professional and World Class. The bowling involves positioning a cursor to place the bowl, then controlling the speed/spin (depending on the type of bowler selected). Batting involves timing one of the many available shots, and fielding is largely automated."}
