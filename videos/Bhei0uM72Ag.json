I could be wrong but as far as I can recall this is the very first time a \"Densha de Go!\" game ever got a english translation since... ever! This truly fantastic, niche arcade series has a lot of fans and not only the ones in Japan. Everyone who loves trains has heard of this series and its unique controller that mimics the train engine's real controllers. The Nintendo 64 version \"Densha de Go! 64\"  is one of only two games to use the N64 Voice Recognition Unit (the other being \"Hey You, Pikachu!\") but fear not, neither the controller or the VRU are required to fully enjoy the game.\n\nAt first I believed this was some sort of April's Fool prank form romhacking.net but it is not, this is the real deal! Zoinkity and mikeryan not only translated the whole text in the game, they have also replaced the voice recognition to understand Enlgish rather than Japanese! Stellar effort, very happy to see this one finally patched. Now, to find all of this game many Easter eggs... in English!
