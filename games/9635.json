The player's car is made out of a gelatin-like substance (hence the name), giving it both flexibility and durability. As the player advances through the level, a meter begins to fill; when it fills to capacity, the player can make the car expand and grow into a monster-truck, allowing it to traverse larger obstacles for a short period of time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jellycar"}
