It is the sixth installment of the MAYhem series, and was led by Michael Fraize (Marcaek). The WAD features a unique Mario theme, with textures and sprite replacements from various games in the franchise, although monsters and weapons are unchanged, and the changes to power-ups are purely cosmetic. Maps were also limited to containing a maximum of 256 things and a playable area size of 5120x3840 map units, although some did exceed these limitations.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mayhem-17"}
