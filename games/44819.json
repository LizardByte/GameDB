Each victory will increase your strength level, allowing you to move on to the next stage of play. Three Partner Decks will be at your disposal throughout play: Veemon will help you with offense; Armodillomon will provide surprise attacks; and Hawkmon will lend itself to quick digi-volving. The 40 new characters will provide plenty for series addicts to sink their teeth into, while 30 varieties of power-up cards will help gamers take down their competition. If all of this sounds like a foreign language to you, you're due to dive into the magical world of trainers and their monsters, known as DIGIMON.
