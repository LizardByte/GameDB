Everything about it, the visuals, the music, the theme, it\u2019s all quite bizarre, but fascinating. Not many people know its actually related to the Star Force series, more so as a kind of \u2018gaiden\u2019 than a continuation of the story, though none of us will really know for sure considering the games story is incredibly mysterious and nothing is really known about it. Despite the English title displayed, the direct translation from the Japanese katakana of the game is \u2018Eight Force\u2019."}
