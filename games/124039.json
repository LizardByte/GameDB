The two meet up after the Marine goes through many intense battles. They fight off drones while driving to a Falkok base where Noir Lime believes an inter-planetary shuttle is. Eventually, they come across a door and Noir Lime must find the switch that opens the door. He succeeds and waits for the Marine to finish off the remaining Falkoks. The two come across a large and massive door, upon opening it there is a Giant Robot. Noir Lime charges and is badly wounded. The Marine retreats but finds one flaw in the room in destroys the robot.
