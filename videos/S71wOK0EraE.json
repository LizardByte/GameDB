Classic Game Room presents a CGR Undertow video review of Pac-Man Collection for the Game Boy Advance developed by Mass Media, Inc. and published by Namco.\n\nFour of Pac-Man\u2019s greatest games come together in this exclusive compilation for the Game Boy Advance. Pac-Man Collection features the original Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, Pac-Attack and Pac-Man Arrangment. Pac-Mania brought Pac-Man\u2019s classic maze gameplay into 3D, while Pac-Attack combined it with\u2014of all things\u2014Tetris! Perhaps the highlight of the package, however, is the 1996 release Pac-Man Arrangement, which adds complex level layouts and power-ups to the classic Pac-Man formula. A great collection of all-time classics, Pac-Man Collection is a single-player game on the Game Boy Advance.\n\nThis video review features video gameplay footage of Pac-Man Collection for the Game Boy Advance and audio commentary from Classic Game Room's Derek.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S71wOK0EraE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S71wOK0EraE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S71wOK0EraE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S71wOK0EraE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S71wOK0EraE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "CGR Undertow - PAC-MAN COLLECTION review for Game Boy Advance", "description": "Pac-Man Collection video review. http://www.ClassicGameRoom.com\nShop CGR shirts & mugs! http://www.CGRstore.com\n\nPac-Man Collection video review.
