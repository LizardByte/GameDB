It's World Cup football game which every nation has authentic superpowers. It looks impressive for it's time because of 3D models like Virtua Soccer and it's so much fun thanks to it's fluidity and Seibu Cup Soccer like superpowers. It borrows many assets from Tecmo's J.League Go Go Goal! game released for Sega Saturn.\n\nArcade machine ST-V is based on Sega Saturn hardware, there are Saturn emulators also emulating ST-V but none of them emulates Tecmo World Cup '98. MAME emulates Tecmo World Cup '98 but some of the old versions emulates better than the new versions.
