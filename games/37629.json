The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or Genkai), and is then taken to a series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is viewed from a first-person perspective, and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system is fairly simple, allowing the player to execute three types of attacks: regular shots, charged shots, and special attacks of limited quantity. Points are received for winning fights and can be used to raise the characters' hit points, speed, or number of special moves.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yuyu-hakusho-yamishoubu-ankoku-bujutsu-kai", "collections": [{"id": 3874, "name": "YuYu Hakusho"}]}
