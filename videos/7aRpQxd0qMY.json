{"id": "7aRpQxd0qMY", "snippet": {"title": "The Fidgetts [GB] - Real Time Longplay (No death)", "description": "This is a, no commentary, Longplay of The Fidgetts for Game Boy. Another Game Boy game with no complete walkthrough on YT.\n\nThe Fidgetts is an action platform title with puzzle elements. It's about a mice family that wants to set sail to America. Somehow the 2 brothers (Freddie and Frankie) are seperated from their family and have to meet up at the dock before the ship departs. The two brothers have their own abilities; one is tall and can jump high while the other is short but strong (can lift his brother high). So you have to use both of them to evade traps, switch buttons, move blocks or fit in tiny areas in order to complete the levels. There are 4 main areas (sections) with a boss fight at the end. There is also a password screen to resume the game.\n\nAt first you might get discouraged by the strict time limit but the whole point of the story is to help the mice reach the dock before the ship sets sail; so it kinda makes sense. What I didn't like is the unbalaced time limit; there are levels, like 2-2, where you have to be very fast and others, like 1-4, where you can finish them with many seconds remaining. At the end of each level there is a bonus stage (a double Arkanoid clone) where you can get a cheese (restores life) or a slingshot (kill enemies). Unfortunately it's so broken that violates the laws of physics (just watch the bonus stages to see it for yourself). Another drawback is the hit detection of bosses, it so bad that even mastering bosses' patterns you will still have trouble hitting them (the nutcracker boss gave me nightmares).\n\nThe graphics and music are both very well made and won't leave you disappointed. Gameplay is also good with responsive controls. There is no replayability since there is no difficulty setting or alternate ending and the game itself is pretty linear. No death run.\n\nIn short it's a nice puzzle-platform title with great music and graphics, but it gives a feeling the developers were hasten to finish it and left many bugs.\n\nBelow are the video times of each level:\n\nLevel 1-1: 0:42\nLevel 1-2: 2:34\nLevel 1-3: 4:22\nLevel 1-4: 6:20\nLevel 1-5: 9:32\nLevel 2-1: 11:14\nLevel 2-2: 14:10\nLevel 2-3: 16:01\nLevel 2-4: 17:12\nLevel 2-5: 18:59\nLevel 2-6: 21:39\nLevel 3-1: 24:31\nLevel 3-2: 26:30\nLevel 3-3: 28:02\nLevel 3-4: 30:38\nLevel 3-5: 32:38\nLevel 3-6: 34:49\nLevel 4-1: 37:11\nLevel 4-2: 38:53\nLevel 4-3: 40:18\nLevel 4-4: 42:15\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame is played by me in one go.
