Old man Nebbercracker's house is eating anything and anyone who gets near it, and Halloween is almost here! So grab your Water Blaster, gather up your courage, and get ready to explore the Monster House to find out its secrets.\n\nMonster House is an old-school shoot 'em up based on Columbia Pictures' animated movie of the same name. With the help of your touch screen controlled water gun, you explore the house room by room, fighting off waves of enemies (assorted household objects) coming from every direction. You also pick up various power-ups along the way. You can play as each of the three characters from the film - DJ, Chowder, and Jenny.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 75145, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cHLREaYx5Kk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLREaYx5Kk", "title": "Longplay of Monster House", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHLREaYx5Kk/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 75146, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "g3RHYfepK-g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3RHYfepK-g", "title": "DS Longplay - Monster House", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g3RHYfepK-g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
