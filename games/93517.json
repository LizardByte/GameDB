Players take on the role of Randall Ezno, a Cerberus operative who begins to learn that the organization is not as benevolent as it appears to be.\n\nAfter completing a mission on an ice planet, Randall returns to the Barn, a Cerberus research space station. On his way to visit his advisor, Inali Renata, something goes wrong and turian soldiers begin attacking the facility. During the attack, Randall tries to contact Inali, but she's cut off by someone. Randall hurries to Inali's location to ensure she is safe. After fighting past the turian invaders, Randall is shocked to find Inali suffering through horrific experiments at the behest of the Director of the Barn. Randall vows revenge and goes in search of the Director, now having to fight past the facility's Cerberus defenses.\n\nWhile trying to escape, Randall is contacted by a mysterious voice via his earpiece. The voice claims to be a volus working with the Alliance. He tells Randall that if he can escape the facility and contact the Alliance, both he and Inali can be saved. Randall slowly makes his way toward the communications tower, fighting Cerberus troops, escaped test subjects, mechs, and X1, a massive, mutant krogan. Finally, he reaches the comm tower, signals the Alliance and heads to a nearby desert planet on a shuttle to await pickup.\n\nAfter Randall arrives, Inali shows up, augmented beyond recognition, and starts to shoot Randall. After lowering her barrier and armor bars, the Director takes complete control of Inali for the remainder of the fight. In the end Randall either spares or kills Inali depending on the player's previous morality choices. He then vows to kill the Director for what he has done and leaves the planet.", "summary": "Mass Effect: Infiltrator is a third-person shooter developed by IronMonkey Studios for mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 and BlackBerry 10) set in the Mass Effect universe.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mass-effect-infiltrator", "videos": [{"id": 28151, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "igssciSxrak", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igssciSxrak", "title": "Official Mass Effect Infiltrator Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/igssciSxrak/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 28152, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "48urNO00fUM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48urNO00fUM", "title": "MASS EFFECT\u2122 INFILTRATOR | Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/48urNO00fUM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
