This island and its sister, Quilth, are the last surviving remnants of the Old World.\n\nHalf a century ago, the wizards took the power of the Island for themselves. And so, Elth\u00eblian, the Spirit of Light, cursed them never to have children again.\n\nToday begins the Trial of the last two wizards of the bloodline: Alicia and H\u00f6stra.", "summary": "Heart Forth, Alicia is a Metroidvania RPG about a young wizard pursued by a terror in the sky.\n\nOn the night of your coming of age trial, the sky rains fire over your village, scorching everything in its path. Soon, you\u2019re catapulted into an ongoing war between the wizards of the forest and the desert army of the West. Desperate to reunite with your loved ones, you embark on a journey across the landscapes of a beautiful but threatening world, sculpted by the pulsing violence of its past.\n\nAt this game's core is an ode to the classics. Remember the electrifying gameplay of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the devious dungeons of the Zelda series, and the rich, more serious narrative of Xenogears or Final Fantasy Tactics?\n\nHeart Forth, Alicia brings a modern take on a beloved genre, combining the tight gameplay from the classic action platformers with an epic and serious narrative akin to the iconic '90s RPGs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heart-forth-alicia", "videos": [{"id": 24404, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EDySQknA928"}, {"id": 58501, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "MQUcjcQpshc"}]}
