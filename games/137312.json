Initial scans of impact craters on its surface suggested residue of the crystalline structures necessary for Walking Simulator Pods. A small research station was established, but quickly abandoned when more detail scans came back negative. \n \nAt the time of your arrival, P/24445 OV3 is passing near the rings of an exoplanet, which will redirect its course towards a nearby star, causing its destruction within a few years."}
