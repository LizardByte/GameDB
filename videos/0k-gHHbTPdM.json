Yes, that's right, we are, for now, moving to do themed Seasons instead of just Updates. Season 01 includes four new primary weapons, a new challenging boss-fight mission, and we're introducing a major new addition to the game: the Performance Pass - our take on a 100% FREE Battle Pass.\n\nFor us here at Ghost Ship, this feels like a significant moment, almost akin to how we felt launching into 1.0 last year. To celebrate this and to showcase all the cool new features and concepts, we've put together this 6 minutes long trailer narrated by Mission Control himself.\n\nSEASON 01 AND THE PERFORMANCE PASS\nThe addition of the Performance Pass is to offer a regular cadence of cosmetics that are accessible to both new and long-standing players, as well as expand on the reasons to keep on mining - we gotta meet those quotas, Miners!\n\nThe Performance Pass contains 100 levels of free unlocks for you to pursue - from tokens called Scrips that allow you to pick and choose from a Cosmetic Tree, to satchels of Credits and crafting materials, to brand-new Victory Moves, and even a FULL set of new Weapon Frameworks for every gun in the game - including the four new ones.\n\nRIVAL TECH DLC\nTo go along with Season 01, there is of course also a tasty new cosmetic DLC Pack. The RIVAL TECH PACK will let you deck out your guns even further in style - this time themed to go with the all-new enemy faction introduced with the Update. \nGo have a look https://youtu.be/n4I_eS1_du0\n\nGOT QUESTIONS?\nWe've also put together a comprehensive FAQ regarding Season 01, which you can read here: https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/season01-faq.\n\nSeason 01: RIVAL INCURSION - will release on Steam November 4th 2021, and on Xbox/GamePass on November 18th 2021.\n\nWith love\nGhost Ship Games\n\n--------------------\nDEEP ROCK GALACTIC is a co-op-first sci-fi FPS featuring badass space Dwarves, 100% destructible environments, procedurally-generated caves, and endless hordes of alien monsters.\n\n--------------------\nSteam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/548430\nMicrosoft Store: https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NHFVWX1V7QJ\n\n--------------------\nFind out more:\nhttp://www.deeprockgalactic.com/\n\nFollow Deep Rock Galactic:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/joindeeprock/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/joindeeprock/\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic\nDiscord:  https://www.discord.gg/drg\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/ghostship_games", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0k-gHHbTPdM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0k-gHHbTPdM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0k-gHHbTPdM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0k-gHHbTPdM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0k-gHHbTPdM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Deep Rock Galactic: Season 01 - Narrated Trailer", "description": "Hello, Miners!\n\nWe're proud to announce our biggest update thus far - Season 01: Rival Incursion.
