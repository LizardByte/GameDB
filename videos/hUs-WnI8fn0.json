Welcome to Hungry Hearts Diner.\nThis place has been around for years now, and we've\ngot our fair share of new visitors and regulars alike. Pull\nup a chair, grab a menu, and give me a holler when you\nknow what you'd like to order.\n\nNow, most folk come for the food, but stay for the stories.\nI've got a bit of a gift for gab, as they say, and a cabinet\nfull of fine tales about the good old days, if you're willing\nto hang around and lend me an ear. Oh, but look at me\nramblin' on. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your visit.\n\nHungry Hearts Diner is a narrative-focused restaurant sim\nset in the retro age of Showa era Japan. Help an old couple\nof diner owners run their cozy little business by cooking food,\nmaking deliveries, and interacting with a unique cast of varied\ncustomers. They'll need all the assistance they can get.\n\nGranny, you see, is as busy as a bee running errands, taking\norders, and chatting with customers who are drawn to her\nno-nonsense manner and good-natured charm.\n\nMeanwhile, Grandpa scowls in the kitchen, grumpy as\never. Gruff though he may be, his food is simple and\nscrumptious, and everyone who tastes his cooking\nalways comes back for a second helping.\n\nThis diner's got its fair share of regulars, and they're an odd bunch,\nlet me tell you. The only things they've got in common are voracious\nappetites and troubled tales to tell. They'll get to talking, too, as long\nas their bellies are full. A good meal always loosens the tongue, I say,\nand certain dishes do the trick better than most. Everyone's got that\none meal they just can't forget, after all, and a hungry heart needs\nfilling just as bad as a belly does.\n\nThe fourth entry in the hit diner sim series is here!\nWhether old fan or newcomer, this game comes with a healthy\nhelping of enjoyment, surprises, laughter, and tears.\nWe hope you like it!\n\n\u3010Story\u3011\n----------------------------------\nOn a tiny side street in a nameless little neighborhood sits an\nold Japanese diner. Things are quiet here; old-fashioned\nyou might say. But of course they are. It's Showa era Japan,\nand the television is just starting to come into vogue.\n\nCome on in, have a seat, and close your eyes.\nThunk thunk goes the steady beat of a knife chopping\nveggies. Hisss; the sound of meat sizzling in a pan.\nGetting hungry? Good, 'cause the food here's sure to\nwarm your belly and leave you feeling nice and full.\n\nBesides, the kindly old granny who runs the place needs\nall the business she can get. She just opened the diner's\ndoors the other day, and she's busy as a bee trying to stay\nafloat. Managing a successful eatery's no easy task when\nyou're all by your loneso\u2014huh?\n\nWait a sec, who's that helping her out in the kitchen?\n\nWelcome to Hungry Hearts Diner!\nIt's a cozy place, a place where regular folk gather 'round\nworn wooden tables for a bite\u2014and maybe some friendly\nconversation, too.
