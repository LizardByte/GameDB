In many ways, MAXIMUM is a \"celebration\" of the history of CAVE's shooting games, re-contextualizing many stages, bosses and mechanics from their past releases (such as DoDonPachi, Ketsui, and Akai Katana) into a more mobile-friendly format. The scoring system in MAXIMUM is massively simplified compared to the previous release (Dai-Fukkatsu), and there is instead a greater focus on completing certain in-stage actions in order to unlock easier or harder paths of stages.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dodonpachi-maximum", "videos": [{"id": 48248, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xLNe8bCRZLk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLNe8bCRZLk", "title": "iOS\u7248\u300cDODONPACHI MAXIMUM\u300d", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xLNe8bCRZLk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
