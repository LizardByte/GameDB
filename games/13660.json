In StarDrive 2 you will explore a vibrant galaxy filled with danger and intrigue in a deep turn-based strategy layer. You will design custom spaceships and deploy them into real-time battles with spectacular graphics and effects. You will conquer worlds in a turn-based tactical ground combat mode. You'll deal with aliens, pirates, monsters, and ancient threats, most of whom want to kill you to make room for their own empires.\n\nStarDrive 2 also features a \"Battle Arena\" mode where you can get right to the action by designing ships and playing through story-based campaigns with your fleet. Earn money as you work through the challenges to unlock new ships and weapons.\n\nAnd of course, you can customize your race for a unique experience, engage in deep diplomatic negotiations, research hundreds of different technologies (or maybe steal them with your spies), control strategic resources for the benefit of your empire, enslave enemy citizens, build armies of giant mechs, and so much more.\n\nIn the end, StarDrive 2 provides a comprehensive and beautiful 4X experience.
