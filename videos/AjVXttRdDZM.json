{"id": "AjVXttRdDZM", "snippet": {"title": "Stakes Winner Arcade", "description": "This game is a thoroughbred horse racing game similar to Winning Post, where players take control of any of the available horses, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, to compete against either AI opponents or other human players across multiple races. \nPlayers control their horse with the joystick while two action buttons are used; one controlling the reins for small accelerations that drains little portions of the horse's stamina and another for the whip for fast speed, which drastically consumes stamina from the horse and if the stamina is depleted completely, racing is given up for a short period. Two quick taps on the joystick at any direction allows the horse to push back an opponent in front of them, however two quick taps on the opposite side reduces speed. Power-ups also spawn on the race track for players to pick up. Failing to qualify for the next race results in a game over screen unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\r\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InsertCoinArcad", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AjVXttRdDZM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AjVXttRdDZM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AjVXttRdDZM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AjVXttRdDZM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AjVXttRdDZM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Stakes Winner Arcade", "description": "This game is a thoroughbred horse racing game similar to Winning Post, where players take control of any of the available horses, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, to compete against either AI opponents or other human players across multiple races. \nPlayers control their horse with the joystick while two action buttons are used; one controlling the reins for small accelerations that drains little portions of the horse's stamina and another for the whip for fast speed, which drastically consumes stamina from the horse and if the stamina is depleted completely, racing is given up for a short period.
