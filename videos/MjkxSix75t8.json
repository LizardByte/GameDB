Despite being cancelled, some cutscenes have been leaked on Youtube, though they have no sounds aside the voice acting. This cutscene was, in my opinion, by far the mot interesting, as it featured a villian from the TV show (albeit with a different colour scheme) and it is quite rare to see other media referencing the animated series. It does make me wonder if other TV Show villians would have appeared in the finished product, such as Mozenrath, Mirage or Mechanicles.\n\nThings added:\n-Teleportation sound effects, both for entering and exiting (Sourced from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed)\n-Background ambience (Sourced from Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga)\n-Background music (Sourced from Aladdin and the King of Thieves and Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular)\n\nWatch all of the cutscenes here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXBsHddnZlRjU90W_VwNrdOdKko8dD1VA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjkxSix75t8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjkxSix75t8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjkxSix75t8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MjkxSix75t8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Aladdin: Fate of Agrabah: Ayam Aghoul's Cutscene (Sounds and Music Added)", "description": "Special Thanks to DON SMITH for posting the cutscenes: https://www.youtube.com/user/xrdonx\n\nFor non-Aladdin fans: Yes, his name really is Ayam Aghoul.\n\nFor Aladdin fans: Recently I found out about the cancelled PC game Aladdin: The Fate of Agrabah, and having been a fan of the series for a long time, I wonder how I have not heard about it earlier.
