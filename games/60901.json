The player takes control of a young man who has just arrived in PachiPara Town looking to solve the mysteries surrounding his father's death. The player can move between three different pachinko parlors, as well as return home to the protagonist's apartment, which can be customized with items won from playing pachinko. The game proceeds much like a basic adventure game, speaking to other characters to gain information or challenge them to a pachinko duel. There are three different female characters with whom relationships can be pursued, and the ending will change depending on which character the player becomes closest to.", "summary": "Pachinko Paradise 8 is one of the many titles in Irem's long-running pachinko simulation series. It features a faithful 3D recreation of the CR Shin Umi Monogatari M27 pachinko machine made by Sanyo Bussan. There are two modes available: Ts\u016bj\u014d (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sanyo-pachinko-paradise-8-shin-umi-monogatari", "videos": [{"id": 76600, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "s3sDIoBD0WE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3sDIoBD0WE", "title": "Sanyo Pachinko Paradise 8   Shin Umi Monogatari Japan - Playstation 2 (PS2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s3sDIoBD0WE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
