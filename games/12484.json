To do this, the player must choose how to spend their available funds, finding a way to expand the number and scope of their parks while remaining profitable. Income from the park can be used to purchase new rides or attractions, hire staff to maintain the park, and other similar functions. Various elements can be controlled by the player, such as the name of the park, the price of admission, the layout of the roller-coaster tracks, and the quality of food in the park restaurants. An ant-like announcer by the name of Buzzy, voiced by Terry McGovern in the American-tailored Sim Theme Park and Lewis MacLeod in UK release Theme Park World, helps the player with advice during gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/theme-park-world", "videos": [{"id": 30838, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "4kFUqClbfzE"}, {"id": 30839, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "zGEZvay046A"}]}
