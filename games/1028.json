Link is told to awaken the wind fish and all will be answered, so he sets out on another quest.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is the first title in the series to be released on a handheld system and the only Zelda title on the original Game Boy. The gameplay is mostly similar to its predecessor with a top-down perspective, however there are short sections in dungeons where the game switches to a side-scrolling view with platforming elements. For this new adventure, Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, he must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. Since its release, Link's Awakening has been popular among fans and critics.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening", "videos": [{"id": 81493, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "E0ErE4l1EKM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ErE4l1EKM", "title": "Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0ErE4l1EKM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
