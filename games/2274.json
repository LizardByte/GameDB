With \"Return of the Tentacle\" we want to make a worthy sequel to the former point-and-click successor!\n\nThe story of the new Adventure is linked to the predecessor: Purple Tentacle is back and wants to take on the world and enslave humankind again. Will Bernard and his friends defeat Purple and save the world? It's up to you!\n\nAnother time megalomaniac tentacles have to be hunted, insane dialogues will make you laugh and crazy puzzles want to be solved. Control the characters Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne like in good old 2D Adventure times using your mouse and a modern interface. You will walk through hand-drawn backgrounds with lovingly animated characters, mood music and soundscape. We do our best to bring the atmosphere and the fun of the old classic to the 21st century.\n\nBesides familiar faces from the predecessors, you'll also meet guests which actually do their mischief in other games.\n\nThe prologue of our Fan Adventures will be released this summer for Windows, Mac and Linux.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/return-of-the-tentacle", "videos": [{"id": 7577, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2PnXhGB7N_8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PnXhGB7N_8", "title": "Return of the Tentacle - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PnXhGB7N_8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
