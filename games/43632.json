Or simply turn on the \"Karaoke mode\" to incorporate the lyrics of each song into the synching visuals. \n \nModerngroove is the world's largest independent dance music label and is world-renowned for their compilation CDs, lifestyle magazine, travel tours, and of course, the South London nightclub that started it all.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moderngroove-ministry-of-sound-edition"}
