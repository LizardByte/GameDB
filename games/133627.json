Players freely explore the beautiful and mysterious planet Phantasmagoria, seeing the sights and interacting with the people at their own pace. Following an introduction by planetary researcher Dr. Hoop, the game begins with a rotating view of the planet which players can use to pick their first destination. Each location is a self-contained animated scene, which players can interact with by clicking people and things. Clicking at the edge of the screen lets the player move in that cardinal direction, travelling the world destination by destination.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/amusement-planet-phantasmagoria"}
