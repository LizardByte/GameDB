But these Viletrap plants are also a great danger for the forest, as they are highly toxic, especially for the sarsaparilla fields!\n\nIn order to fix this dreadful situation, Papa Smurf decided to ask some of his fellow Smurfs to help him find the ingredients for an antidote powerful enough to eradicate the Vileaf once and for all and heal the plants afflicted by this curse. An ace Smurf team, featuring Hefty, Smurfette, Brainy and Chef, goes on an adventure to complete this mission.
