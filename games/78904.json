With hundreds of game modes and modifier combinations, each round is different. \n \nIn Tiny Tanks you control a small toy-like tank and try to beat your enemies (or friends) in every round to get the most points and win the game. You can beat your friends mainly by shooting them with hilariously oversize bullets or catapult them of the map by making them drive into one of your deadly mines. \n \nBut beating your friends is not just about destroying them. You can win points by evading mines dropping from the sky, not touching the ground when the volcano erupts or by not falling off the map when gravity starts to shift. To make the whole situation even more chaotic, you can destroy the whole map with your bullets and mines. If your enemy thinks he is safe on the bridge he is wrong, because it suddenly collapses as your mines detonate below it and send him flying off the map. \n \nYou can beat your friends in local multiplayer or fight with total strangers online.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 29604, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sOizhsiOYQ8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOizhsiOYQ8", "title": "Tiny Tanks Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sOizhsiOYQ8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 29634, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "k5NJlYgg1Jg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5NJlYgg1Jg", "title": "Tiny Tanks - Trailer 2018", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k5NJlYgg1Jg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
