The Japanese branch of the Drexler Institute was annihilated by the European Celestial Union, but found new life as the Rosenberg Branch of the European Celestial Union.\n\nSoon after the Kantou Incident, large-scale dimensional rifts began to open all across Japan. This sudden uptick in celestial phenomena was seen as exceptionally odd by many, and some even whispered that it could be the result of secret research by the Drexler Institute. The Japanese branch of the Celestial Union was dispatched to investigate the phenomena, and they called on several angels from the National Academy of Metaphysics.\n\nSeveral angels from the Rosenberg Branch of the Celestial Union were also dispatched, but they were soon intercepted by the Aesir.\n\nOnly six days remain until the destruction of Japan. \"", "summary": "\"SixStarS!!!!!! has a full roster of modes to choose from including Story, Survival Score Attack, Trial Time Attack, Versus, Training, Replay Theater and more!
