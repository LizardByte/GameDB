There are two major teams in Toasterball: The Burners (in red) and the Defrosters (in blue). \n \nA classic mode, but never the same: \nThe first mode you will find in the game is the classic mode. It is a caged match with a ball, two goals, and two teams of toasters fighting to be the first to score five goals. \nAfter each goal, a random gameplay variant is chosen. A variant can bring small changes like a change in the size of the toasters, the number of balls and toasts, or can completely change the game with different goals, different ball physics, changes in the environment or random event like gusts of wind or explosions. With these variants, no two matches are alike in classic mode. \n \nLots of minigames: \nAfter a few matches in classic mode, you and your friends might want to try a couple of minigames. These short challenges will take your toasters in completely different situations: in space, at the beach, in a snow fight, or on a toy boxing ring, you name it!", "summary": "A ball, two goals, and a couple of toasters : Welcome to Toasterball. In this unconventional tournament, the toasters are athletes and the laws of physics are merely a suggestion. \n \nToasterball is a party game (2-4 player), made to be played with friends on a good old couch. Because you play as toasters, you can naturally expect some slapstick physics and funny on-screen situations, but there is also a real learning curve, and enough gameplay variants and minigames to keep on surprising you. \n \nThe basics of Toasterball are quite easy to learn : simply press one of the buttons on your toaster for a short time, release it, and watch your toast fly through the air. The longer the press, the higher your toast will be launched. Each ejection also makes you jump, allowing you to hop around the field and push your opponent into tight situations. From there, any means are allowed to put the ball inside your opponent's goal! \n \nGo to Toasterball.com to try the early demo : \n \nhttp://toasterball.com/", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/toasterball", "videos": [{"id": 22849, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TLDMiZhXzok", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLDMiZhXzok", "title": "Olivia Rotelli : TOASTERBALL Story video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TLDMiZhXzok/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 33218, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "P-7nJjG-BK4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7nJjG-BK4", "title": "Toasterball - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P-7nJjG-BK4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 33219, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "uitKanQZZuA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uitKanQZZuA", "title": "Toasterball - How To Play", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uitKanQZZuA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
