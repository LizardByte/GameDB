In response, Wei has her executed, causing their only son, Fang Tu, to leave their clan. Wei divides the mask and entrusts half to a Shaolin monk, Master Kai, while keeping the other half himself. Fang Tu kills his father and takes his half. Kai requests that the player transport the other half to a secret sanctuary. The player is assisted by an ally, Wu Ching.", "summary": "Supreme Warrior is a full-motion video fighting game. The game, or interactive movie, is set in China hundreds of years ago. You are tasked with protecting half of a magical mask. The wearer of the mask will be granted untold power. Unfortunately, the villanous Wang Tu has the other half of the mask, and wants your half badly. So, you must fight off Wang Tu's minions, and eventually Fang Tu himself.\n\nThe gameplay in Supreme Warrior consists of digitized video with interactive elements. At many points during the video, you can unleash a punch, kick, or block. If your timing is correct, you inflict damage on your opponent. If you timing is off, your opponent hurts you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/supreme-warrior", "videos": [{"id": 113974, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Lyak7VQhW4o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyak7VQhW4o", "title": "Mega-CD Longplay [076] Supreme Warrior", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lyak7VQhW4o/sddefault.jpg"}]}
