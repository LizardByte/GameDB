One McDonald's made so much profit, they decided to step up their advertising and order a set of new animatronics to entertain the customers while they eat! That's where you come in.\nThe animatronics were recently shipped to a Storage Facility that McDonald's owns that keeps old belongings in there from the past moments. The animatronics are as of now being stored in there until the Staff at the McDonald's get the place set up properly before the Animatronics arrivals.\nYou're were hired to work in their Warehouse due to word that people have been breaking into the Warehouse, and stealing or even vandalising the property.\nThese animatronics were spent a fortune on, and McDonald's cannot afford having parts of them stolen or even destroyed. Don't let anyone get in.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-with-mac-tonight-2"}
