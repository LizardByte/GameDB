Then get ready for some serious monkey-wrenching with the Sabotage game mode.\n\nNew gear and extras. Patrol the not-so-friendly skies in a cloud car vehicle or hunt your enemies with the X-8 Night Sniper and EE-4 blaster. Want an extra edge? There are 3 additional Star Cards including Disruption, Scout Binoculars and the devastating Shock Grenade!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 8772, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "H5HMUAlxkws"}, {"id": 8773, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "uJbe1fRvy0g"}]}
