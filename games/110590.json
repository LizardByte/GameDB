It unfolds like a movie. The player becomes a love-sick teenager entering the local school late at night to return his dream girl's diary, which she lost earlier in the day, and to drop off a token of affection; White Day candy.\n\nPlayers are introduced to two of the central characters, talking about ghost stories, in one of the school's many haunted corridors. It isn't long before the first problem of disabling the school alarm system becomes a priority. During this challenge the game takes a very dark turn, as you encounter the janitor, a man with a baseball bat, and hear sounds of the young, and decidedly spooky children laugh.\n\nThere are no weapons in White Day, but many ingenious puzzles litter the way: the player disables alarm systems, opens combination safes and rescues trapped school kids from weird apparitions. The difficulty setting helps the player to get into the story while providing a harder challenge at every turn.", "summary": "White Day: A Labyrinth Named School is the story of a young man 's trip into a school at the dead of night to deliver some candy in preparation for the Eastern holiday of the same name, White Day, to So-yeong, a girl at school he likes.
