From building your deck to playing heroes or warriors to a specific lane, every decision you make will require strategic planning and forecasting your opponent's moves. Destroy your enemies with powerful magic, crush foes with overwhelming brute force or outsmart the opponent with your own unique strategy, it's all up to you! In Soulsmith, there is no such thing as rare cards with enormously high stats. Every single castle, hero, warrior, recipe, item, fort or monster may be good or bad depending on your strategy and the situation on the arena.\n\nCreate a mighty deck and conquer the Riviere of Worlds in thrilling PvE encounters or show who's the boss in PvP games. Both modes will grant you with tons of fun and new cards.\n\nMusic by: Matthew Pablo from https://opengameart.org under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ (\"Spiritwatcher\" and \"Heroic Demise [Updated Version]\").", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sHE6BNoE41c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sHE6BNoE41c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sHE6BNoE41c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sHE6BNoE41c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sHE6BNoE41c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Soulsmith Reveal Trailer", "description": "Website: https://playsoulsmith.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PlaySoulsmith\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/playsoulsmith\n\nSoulsmith is a strategy card game where fearless warriors led by mighty heroes battle on the arena for honor, glory, and loot.
