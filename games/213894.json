Even though it is a sequel, it doesn't carry over most of the game contents of the previous game, and after reconsidering the specifications, it's completely remade from scratch.\n\nUnlike the previous work, the course is three-dimensional, and of course there are\noverpasses, roller coaster-like loops, and even vertical walls.\n\nOf course, there will be a more acrobatic course this time as well, so make full use of techniques such as drifting with a different sense of operation and boosts that have been newly added, and finish within the top 4 within the time limit.\n\nOf course, there is also a replay, and it is also compatible with gamepads, so please take the first place with a cool run.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xelphi-second-limit"}
