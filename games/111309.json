The ball is controlled with two knobs on the side of the maze. One of the knobs leans the maze horizontally and the other vertically. The route through the maze is drawn on it, but there are holes along the route that easily swallow the ball.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/koolah", "videos": [{"id": 22857, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "p_GIgs3RF4k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_GIgs3RF4k", "title": "Koolah gameplay (PC Game, 1991)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p_GIgs3RF4k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
