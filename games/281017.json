When Mario arrives at the central plaza, he is greeted by Bowser. Bowser explains to Mario that he's too late and that all of the star power that fuels Toad Town has been stolen. Mario is soon blindsided by a hoard of enemies and is taken to an underground jail cell, which is where the adventure begins.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-journey-lane"}
