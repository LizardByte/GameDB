He turns into a werewolf at night, as indicated by an onscreen timer, and returns to human form during the day. Each room is depicted in monochrome on its own screen and consists of blocks to climb and obstacles to avoid while the player solves puzzles and retrieves items for the cure.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knight-lore"}
