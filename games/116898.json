It has no gore, no explicit content at all.\n\nWe're avid fans of Twisted Metal, the unique characters, the unique specials, the closed combat were all parts that we loved about Twisted Metal. And, an oldie called Death Tanks was also a Game that we enjoyed, and admired the format of everything happening in one screen. Both of these Games have inspired Nebulas Lasso's design to a fair degree.\nThank you for reading!\n\nSummary:\nNebulas Lasso is a local multiplayer Game, where each player pilots a UFO with it\u2019s unique pilot and unique style to capture people of earth.
