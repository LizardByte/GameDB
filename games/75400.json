Or risk life and limb in the shadow lands beyond. \n \nScavenge for precious resources, battle for prestige in the Arena, or defend outposts against incursions from enemies. \n \n\u200bWith challenges to test and develop opportunities in inventing and crafting, as well as adrenaline boosting events and mental challenges, Unearthed is tailored to fit a multitude of play styles. \n \nSURVIVE \n \nIn Unearthed, survival is so much more than just hunger, thirst and temperature. \n\u200b \nAll environmental regions have their own threats which will contribute to the challenge to survive, with some inherently more dangerous than others. \n \nFalling rocks, fluctuating gravity, exploding flora, poisonous gasses and dangerous fauna will require players to approach each environmental region differently in order to reap from the riches of its resources and other rewards it may have to offer. \n \n \nTRADE AND CRAFT \n \nGather precious resources and sell them at one of many scattered outposts. The economy changes according to supply and demand. \n \nMake your living as a crafter or inventor, or make profit by selling stock on the markets: which fluctuate in response to player trades. \n \nTinker and build robots and other fanciful inventions. Acquire livestock and breed animals both exotic and familiar. \n \nPlayers can eke out a living without ever leaving The Root or the safe plains surrounding it. \n \nA CHANGING WORLD \n \nExpect Change. \n \nUnearthed has a dynamic world with a story which expands over time. \n \nOver months, forests might change with blights or fires. Deserts could be vastly changed by floods, creating new and strange terrain, or unearthing long lost ruins. Our goal is to provide a world that will immerse players in events that change the scope and dynamics of the game and instill a lasting feel of discovery.", "summary": "Unearthed is a sci-fi Multiplayer experience currently in development by South African based Indie studio, Mad Matter Creative. \u200b As thus far, Unearthed is the work of a single individual, and founder of the studio, Ragel Alheit. \n \nA future Indiegogo campaign will be instrumental in expanding the team to help ensure that Unearthed is launched.
