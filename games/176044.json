The evil Prime Minister has kidnapped the King and Queen of Dragons, as well as Dorin's princess, Diana. Dorin escaped but fell into the Land of Faeron. Now he must escape Faeron, collecting fairy spirits and learning spells if he is to return home and rescue his family.\n\nThe action is viewed from a birds-eye perspective, but you navigate the stages by jumping on increasingly higher platforms. On each stage you have to collect all of the stars and find the elemental fairies who will give you special powers. There were seven stages in total, with a boss character to battle in each.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-hopper", "videos": [{"id": 62512, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NpmAPtBJudo"}, {"id": 62513, "name": "Promotional video", "video_id": "tSVqE7pOmgc"}]}
