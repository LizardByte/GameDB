You assume the identity of a railroad \u201cBaron\u201d and act as \u201cPresident\u201d of one or more Railroad Corporations. Your goal is to earn money. Money is earned mainly through owning shares of stock in the eight Railroad Corporations. Stock shares make money in two ways-they can provide ready cash via dividend payments, and they can increase in value. \n\nIf you\u2019re the single largest stockholder in a Railroad Corporation, you become its President and operate its railroad, ideally, but not necessarily, for the benefit of all stockholders. The game ends when either: 1. A Baron goes bankrupt; or 2. The Bank runs out of money. The winner is the wealthiest Baron at game end.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/1830-railroads-and-robber-barons"}
