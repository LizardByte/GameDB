The environment is much larger than the player making every normal household item an obstacle. The HYPER-CORE is powered by a battery and the player must explore the environment to find one, ensuring the HYPER-CORE is always operational. Nostalgic waves of weaponised toys attack from different directions and locations. They will stop at nothing to destroy the HYPER-CORE, the players and their defences. The player progresses by completing each level, earning XP and unlocking unique skins and characters, giving the opportunity to customise their action figure to their liking. The gameplay evokes nostalgic memories from those who grew up in the 80ies and the 90ies, and at the same time makes it accessible for new audiences to pick up and play the game.", "summary": "Hypercharge: Unboxed is a toy-based action FPS, with wave based tower defense mechanics.
