Toki Tori isn't very athletic, he can't even jump! Luckily he has some great tools at his disposal, including the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock.\n\nCreative thinking and problem solving are required to collect all eggs in each level, but don\u2019t worry! When you get stuck, you can always rewind time. And if all else fails, use the Wildcard to skip a level.\n\nToki Tori 2+\nExplore an enthralling forest island, learn magical songs and interact with the local wildlife to solve environmental puzzles.\n\nToki Tori 2+\u2019s ingenious game design requires just two moves: whistle and stomp. It's super accessible, yet it builds up to incredible complexity later on.\n\nThere\u2019s a tonne to do, too. After puzzle-solving your way to five Ancient Frogs and saving the island from a strange pollution, you can still find hundreds of golden wings, snap dozens of creature pictures and go Achievement hunting.", "summary": "A collection of Toki Tori games which includes Toki Tori 1 and Toki Tori 2+.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
