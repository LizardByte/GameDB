It closely resembles its predecessor in terms of gameplay and mechanics. One notable feature of this game is the inclusion of the Augusta National golf course, which is officially licensed by the Augusta National Golf Club. When playing the game, you view your golfer from a third-person perspective, with a mini-map of the current hole displayed on the right side of the screen. The main menu offers various modes to choose from, such as Masters, Tournament, Stroke Play, Match, and Training. The movement of the ball is influenced by the type of terrain and the point of impact between the club and the ball during your swing. The direction of your shot is affected by the wind, and the game also includes weather effects like rain.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harukanaru-augusta-2-masters"}
