Each card features 1-3 birds in one of four colors - red, green, yellow, purple - with the reverse of the card having either the same number of birds in a different color or the same color of birds in a different number. Thus, each number+color combination appears five times in the deck.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/whats-up-by-strawberry-studio"}
