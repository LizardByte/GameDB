Originally commercial and subscription-driven, Shadowbane was launched in March 2003. It closed on July 1, 2009.\n\nThe regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world will sometimes depend on the servers, many of which have unique world maps). Gameplay features many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races. Character creation was fairly extensive, allowing for detailed, differentiable characters to be created.\n\n-Wikipedia", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadowbane", "videos": [{"id": 8974, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pKgTDJjIuts", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKgTDJjIuts", "title": "Shadowbane trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pKgTDJjIuts/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 8975, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "8nHCkWOtgis", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nHCkWOtgis", "title": "Shadowbane gameplay trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nHCkWOtgis/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
