Make your dreams of slowly murdering the noobs that made your group wipe all night long come true, unlock more overpowered spells, misteriously earn better gear by killing players, murder traitorous NPCs that give quests for players to kill you, place deadly traps for noobs to step on and much much more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/like-a-boss"}
