It is unknown if the game will be released outside of Japan. Scans depict a roster of characters in line with the manga and anime storyline, featuring Nelliel, Nnoitra, Ichigo with his Hollow mask and Grimmjow's released form, (Pantera) to name a few. The gameplay appears to have been changed substantially, showing a split-screen during multi-player fights. It is a one-on-one fighter, but players pick a partner character for various team-up attacks and other maneuvers as well as being able to switch between them. It supports Wi-Fi play and can be played with the Classic controller or Gamecube controller in place of the Wii-Remote and nunchuk. Unlike other instalments before this, it is developed by Treasure Co. Ltd.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bleach-versus-crusade", "videos": [{"id": 35644, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bs7ff2pZH3Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs7ff2pZH3Y", "title": "Bleach: Versus Crusade Nintendo Wii Trailer - TGS 2008:", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bs7ff2pZH3Y/sddefault.jpg"}]}
