You'll need your wits about you to gun down bomber and fighter planes as well as battleships and to eliminate fuel tanks, storage buildings and much more. The risks are high but the glory even greater for those brave enough to take on the P38 Lightning and F4U-4 Corsair in high speed dog fights before swooping in to bomb targets on land. The enemy planes are super quick and the pilots ruthlessly skilled, so dont hang about admiring the scenery get in there.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
