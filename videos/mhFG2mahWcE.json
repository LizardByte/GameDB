Well, here it is 2010 and there still is little to nothing for the game, so we revamped the intro at significantly higher quality and added about nine minutes of additional footage for the game. This video shows a little walk-around, conversational bits, nice artwork, movie clips, some of the 3D elements of the game, and a boss battle towards the end. Pretty neat huh?\r\n\r\nThis game is about a good-natured young man and nature-lover who seems like an ordinary man until he meets a girl one day by the name of Erina Kouzuki (reverse it for correctness) whom he shows around the city and gets her acquainted with the area until you later branch out into other activities. \r\n\r\nAround the time she enters the city, strange things have been happening that only he can primarily see or hear (though the main females you meet obviously foreshadow that they aren't exactly normal). Your hero (known to some by name or as \"senpai\", a senior (at work or school) or superior in his case) first knows that strange things are happening when he hears voices in his head that lure him into the woods during the night. \r\n\r\nRain begins to fall and you run to an abandoned house for shelter. As you wait for the rain to die down, you notice a creature floating near the house, and it gets struck by lightning, being gravely injured. You go out to see what it is and you're astonished to see a tiny, mostly naked girl lying on the ground bleeding. You bring her into the house out of the rain and tend to her wounds, and you both exchange smiles and looks of relief, but its just a sign of things to come.\r\n\r\nKeeping the feather of a miniature angel as a memento and proof of your bond and realization of the past night, you wake up the next day and begin to have more powerful hallucinations, seeing images of other worlds and creatures. It's later revealed that coming in contact with this angel has enabled you to leave your body and travel mentally to other realms. The first realm (shown in this video) is strange because you can't understand very well what people want; all their words sound exactly the same. \r\n\r\nHelping the angel who was captured since you last healed her (by defeating a lesser fiend) enables you to understand what the people of the realm are saying and is the first angel present you recieve. The game is a pretty pleasant gal-game for the Dreamcast, but not devoid of problems. Save points are far and between and the beginning is slow and feels more like an act of attrition (taking Erina to each district, then introducing her to almost every semi-major character in town, etc.). Graphics are pretty nice and has cool movies. The music could've been better, but is suitable. The gameplay is mostly your typical gal-conversional game, but with some action segments and minor exploration thrown in to make the experience more engaging. Character designs are by the popular Noritaka Suzuki.
