(Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby) is now available for playable pre-orders! Grab it from www.dejobaan.com.\r\n\r\nDejobaan Games (creators of the award-winning \"AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! -- A Reckless Disregard for Gravity\") announces \"1... 2... 3... KICK IT! (Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby)\" for Windows PCs. Battle your favorite drum 'n' bass tracks, or zen out as you soar through that trance album. \"Kick It\" mines your existing MP3 music to build hovering, hallucinogenic worlds to fly and fight through. Gamers who pre-order the title now for $9.95 (33% off the final price) at www.dejobaan.com/kickit will receive an alpha they can preview Right Now.\r\n\r\nPicture this: Ten kilometers above the Earth's crust, you plummet, your own music library powering you through terminal velocity. A hint of orchestral strings, and gameplay responds with wide open skies ahead. But what's this? Big, fat bass beats, and suddenly you're intimate with the side of a behemoth building -- scrape by with a millimeter to spare, and your score multiplier doubles, then triples. A serious drum line breaks though the soundscape: cymbals crash, and you're swarmed by teeming hordes of mechanical monsters hell-bent on shooting you out of the sky. Take aim, and take 'em down.\r\n\r\nWant to play mad scientist? In Kick It, the worlds you create are living organisms, so if you want to alter the soundscapes generated by your tracks, go on! Tweak a tune's genomes, hit \"play,\" and watch it warp into something unrecognizably twisted. What next? \"I want every song about dragons to throw 10-story tall wyrms at you,\" says studio founder Ichiro Lambe. \"That's why we're opening the game up for feedback months before launch. We want everyone's crazy-ass ideas.\" Dejobaan will continue to polish the game 'till it's as smooth and silky as an ugly baby's bottom for launch in 2011.\r\n\r\nAvailability and system requirements: Kick It is available for playable pre-order at www.dejobaan.com/kickit, and requires Windows XP/Vista/7; a 1.5GHz processor; 2GB RAM; and a 512MB 3D card.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3W-r9IobwI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3W-r9IobwI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3W-r9IobwI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3W-r9IobwI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3W-r9IobwI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "1... 2... 3...
