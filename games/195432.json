To achieve this, a large amount of the code has been adapted from GEC Master Edition (also known as DZDoom) into ZScript, while looking at the reverse engineered source code and existing source ports of these games for reference.\n\nIn addition to that, the mod is highly modular and also incluides many optional \"enhancements\" that deviate from the original experience. Depending on your taste you can opt for going as close to vanilla as possible, or experiment and play with upscaled textures, PBR materials, flashy particle effects and other features that are common in other GZDoom \"enhacement\" mods.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doom-ce", "videos": [{"id": 66131, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HCpbXE0Sgm0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCpbXE0Sgm0", "title": "PSX DOOM CE 2.0.0 Demo 3: Exaggerated Preset", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HCpbXE0Sgm0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
