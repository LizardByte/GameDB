People embrace modern life while maintaining their belief in and reliance on witchcraft. Belikov spent his childhood in Skinnerburg, but then traveled with his parents away from home to study and live outside. It was also because of his childhood that he had a very strong interest and knowledge base in the occult. After publishing his fifth scholarly book, From Goya to Pound: the Occult Turn in Modernity, Belikov returned to his home in Skinnerburg, hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the wiccan tradition here.\n\nThe Story:\n\u201cWe don't want to repeat the mistakes of Innocent VIII. In our opinion, that tragedy was entirely due to the lack of a public opinion position for Wiccans at the time; they didn't have a media science classic that could compete with Malleus Maleficarum. So we needed an occult writer. But we expect him to write not just a witchy version of Le Deuxi\u00e8me Sexe, but a new Bible. Otherwise it's only a matter of time before something like Alcohol Night, the night we lost our beloved backdraft wizard and poet Mr. Spielwitz, happens again. This is exactly why we started our campaign, we want to do right by witches!\nWe would like to formally introduce you to our spokesperson, Mr. Belikov, a giant of occult literature from Skinnerburg! His last work, From Goya to Pound: the Occult Turn in Modernity, revealed to the world the return of the occult in the modern spiritual map, and was a landmark work in occult studies!\u201d", "summary": "\"A Chronicle of Occultism in Skinnerburg\" is a text adventure game that attempts to explore the possibilities of combining literature and gaming by driving gameplay through character building and environmental interactions and by hosting the narrative experience in novelistic and poetic texts. Explore Skinnerburg, a place where witchcraft traditions coexist with modern life, and interact with a wide variety of environments and characters, triggering literary and readable poetic texts, building character personalities and idiosyncratic tendencies, and experiencing the joy of maneuvering through a unique point-and-click combat and interaction system.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-chronicle-of-occultism-in-skinnerburg"}
