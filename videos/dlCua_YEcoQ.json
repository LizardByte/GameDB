Tell me what you think! What could be improved?\nDownload the game from these fine websites:\nGamejolt: http://gamejolt.com/games/don-t-get-a-virus/148084\nGithub: https://github.com/1029chris/dont-get-a-virus/releases\nItch.io: https://1029chris.itch.io/dont-get-a-virus\nIndieDB: http://www.indiedb.com/games/dont-get-a-virus/downloads\n\nI've released this demo to gather feedback on the first level, so that I may use that feedback while creating future levels. Have fun!\n\nFight for your computers life as different viruses try to destroy it! Use your antivirus software to blast away the viruses, but make sure the antivirus doesn't get hit itself! This game is a work in progress. Play the demo, and give some feedback! It would be very much appreciated. When the full version is complete, it will probably cost money.\n\nDon't Get a Virus requires a keyboard and mouse. This game basically works like an operating system. You control the antivirus window by dragging it around and clicking on the fire button. You can change the wallpaper and game difficulty in the settings application.\n\n---\n\n\u201cThrills and Spills\u201d by Jay Man www.ourmusicbox.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dlCua_YEcoQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dlCua_YEcoQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dlCua_YEcoQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dlCua_YEcoQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dlCua_YEcoQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Don't Get a Virus - Demo Released!", "description": "Download the \"Don't Get a Virus\" demo!
