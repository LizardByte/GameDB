Now you can continue the cartoon-style third person battle online and battle your friends, enemies or even frenemies across 6 maps and various modes. Reduce the never-ending army of a non-descriptive country to a bloody, meaty pulp (with extra zest!) as legionnaires of an even less described country. \n \nSo what are you waiting for, get ready to make mince meat of other players, battle endless forces, determine the biologic equation, host a nice pick nick or swim in the ocean. \n \nNow With Zombie Mode: \n \nAfter having a fun and merry undescribed time in the woods, the legionnaires need a Helicopter ride home. They discover a creepy cabin in the woods(TM) and decide to call a helicopter. Whilst summoning the helicopter, they accidentally summoned the evil forces of hell as well! Fend of hordes of zombies while keeping the generator running, powering the lights and the signal to the helicopter. It wouldn't be a FL map without our signature humour so expect some unusual zombies, crazy environments, a ton of destructables, easter eggs and buckets of GORE. Who can get the highest body count?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 4907, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hkP_00eVEuE"}]}
