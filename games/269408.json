A mysterious event unfolds when the great mage Karakuram, who had garnered the faith of the people, suddenly appears at the court conference of the small nation of Faluen. He condemns the king and abducts Princess Emilia. In order to rescue Emilia, King Valsia assembles a squad of royal knights led by Irina, Emilia's educator, to venture into the witch's domain.\n\nHowever, the forest where the witch resides is fraught with perilous paths infested with ferocious monsters. Additionally, apart from the main characters belonging to the royal knights, there is also Lord Raidric, a nobleman accompanied by the ruthless Black Knight Balnarg, who seeks to outshine the main characters.\n\nAs the adventure begins, the strength of the monsters proves to be beyond imagination, and Irina's inexperienced group quickly faces near annihilation. Their fate becomes precarious, especially after losing the mage who was guiding them through the forest. However, at this critical moment, they happen to encounter a young magician named Merian who is under attack by monsters. The protagonist, the sole survivor under Irina's command, successfully rescues her. With her assistance, and her knowledge of Karakuram, Irina and her group of three set out once again towards the mansion of the witch Karakuram.\n\nThe gameplay is a first person perspective ADV in which the player will have to take decisions that will leave the story to different places.\nThroughout the game, various mysteries are unraveled, including the reasons behind Karakuram's abduction of Emilia.\nEven if no heroine is successfully pursued, a happy ending can be achieved by completing the journey safely. However, depending on the choices, the protagonist may lose to enemies, resulting in a game over. In some cases, heroines may also suffer unfortunate fates at the hands of monsters, but there are no particularly explicit or gory CG scenes in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/emmyrea"}
