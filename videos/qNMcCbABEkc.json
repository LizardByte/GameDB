Smack Studio, which started as a Unity prototype in 2018, is a skill-driven fighting game that includes all editing tools within the game, requiring no additional software or programming experience. Combining a fighting game with character and stage editors, it offers powerful tech that assists artists in their creations. The game uses groundbreaking animation technology that allows 2D sprite body parts to be mapped to a pseudo-skeleton and animated as if they were 3D. The development switched from Unity to Unreal after consulting with senior developers, leading to ThirdPixel Interactive's founding two years ago. Smack Studio has already built a diverse community of fans, even during its early access phase, with over 200 custom characters created by users. The game caters to both beginners and experts, providing a unique platform for artists to create and share content.\n\nTeam members interviewed, in order of appearance: Brett Ruys, Alec Dutch, Garrett Williamson, David V.
