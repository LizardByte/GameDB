The object of the game is to trap the other player by surrounding them with a light trail that they can't avoid crashing into \u2013 or forcing them to run into their own trail. Coming into contact with a light trail, either yours or the other player's, collapses your own trail and ends your turn. The player still standing at the end of the round wins.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
