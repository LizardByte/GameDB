One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.\n\nPac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-man-special-color-edition", "collections": [{"id": 2095, "name": "Pac-Man"}]}
