One of them is killed in battle, while the other (a girl) is captured by the demon; the remaining warrior, a young man named Ryu, has to rescue his friend.\n\nAlien Wars takes place in the future. A young space pilot named Sylvie is ambushed and captured by aliens who have nothing else in mind but to have sex with her...\n\nThere is some rudimentary interaction in all the three stories: \"Friday the 18th\" allows the player to switch from one heroine to another (even though there is only one correct way to do that); \"Demon's Night\" has a scene with pseudo-RPG turn-based combat (pre-determined results); both \"Demon's Night\" and \"Alien Wars\" offer some menu-based choices to make, some of which will lead to Game Over.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/viper-v8--1"}
