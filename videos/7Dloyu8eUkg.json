I think I'm overthinking it in this video. Maybe I'll make a better one later.\nGreat port of the 1981 Taito arcade game, with weird cool music by Tim Follin. I believe the version I was playing as a kid was an NTSC game, not designed for PAL machines. NTSC games were designed to run at a frame rate of 60 Hz and PAL games at 50 HZ. The gameplay worked OK running a bit slower, but the music also ran 20% slower, which is a lot! Tim Follin's interesting sample choices coupled with this unintentional slowness gave it a weird, dreamy feeling that stuck with me for the last 30 years. It's interesting how an accident like this can sometimes create a unique impression in the listener.\n\n#qix #syltefar_amiga #syltefar", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Dloyu8eUkg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Dloyu8eUkg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Dloyu8eUkg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Dloyu8eUkg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Dloyu8eUkg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Qix (Amiga) | No commentary, 1080p 60FPS", "description": "\ud83d\udcbe More Amiga games \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEXiKm54CARSqoV4Bhhge9ubCRqxCO8Pm\n\ud83d\udcd9 I wish I was better at Qix.
