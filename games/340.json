The lethal Tiberium continues to infect the world at an ever-increasing rate which has made most of the Earth uninhabitable for human beings. To survive, GDI has moved to the arctic regions of the world while NOD has set up camp underground.\n\nThe game\u2019s story is driven by the difference in goals between GDI and NOD. As GDI strives to maintain world peace and discover the root cause of Tiberium, NOD is hell-bent on achieving world domination. The story is complicated by the apparent loss of Kane, NOD\u2019s leader, at the end of the first Tiberian War which has thrown the Brotherhood into leaderless disarray, but do not count them out just yet as NOD has created through genetic mutation via Tiberium a set of ultra-powerful units that more than compensate for the clan\u2019s lack of organization.", "summary": "The sequel to 1995's genre defining Command & Conquer, Tiberian Sun takes place in a bleak future where the tiberium infestation has spread across the world, and made large regions uninhabitable, and the long dormant Brotherhood of NOD starting a surprise offensive against the GDI forces.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/command-conquer-tiberian-sun", "videos": [{"id": 13015, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "iD_CSM_6Alg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD_CSM_6Alg", "title": "C&C Tiberian Sun Skirmish", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iD_CSM_6Alg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "phRKykEZJGQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phRKykEZJGQ", "title": "C&C Tiberian Sun Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/phRKykEZJGQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 131456, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JxD7BiBd5tk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxD7BiBd5tk", "title": "Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun TV Advert UK Broadcast 1999", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JxD7BiBd5tk/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 38, "name": "Command & Conquer"}]}
