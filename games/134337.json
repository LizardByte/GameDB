Street Fighter: The Movie is a 2D, one-on-one fighting game that utilizes digitized graphics. You have a selection of 16 playable characters, 14 are immediately available and two are hidden. The roster mostly contains the familiar Street Fighter cast, even including some that are not in the film, such as Akuma. In addition, some characters are exclusive to this very game such as Sawada and Blade.\n\nThis game is not to be confused with the home ports of Street Fighter: The Movie and it and the Arcade version are regarded as separate games. While the home ports use assets contained in the Arcade original, the stages and overall gameplay are different. The Arcade original features more experimental mechanics, whereas the home ports contains more traditional Street Fighter gameplay, mostly in the vein of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/street-fighter-the-movie--1", "videos": [{"id": 68029, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "cV-ongTmj8w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV-ongTmj8w", "title": "Street Fighter: The Movie The Game - Intro / Opening (no stretching, no filter)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cV-ongTmj8w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
