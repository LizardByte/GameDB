This time he finds himself in the infinite universe and the his family is involved. The evil witch Scylla's spies find out about the discovery of a new large asteroid in outer space, consisting entirely of the black diamonds. Scylla immediately breaks into Professor Rumbohr's house to steal his technology, improves it with her dark magic, and together with Don Croco and his soldiers hastily sets off into outer space. She wants to collect all the energy of the black diamonds to make a ray of pure evil that will enchant the Troll Forest's peaceful animals and turn them into her monster minions. It is up to Rumbohr, Hugo, Rat and Rut and the Professor to thwart Scylla's diabolical plan. Hugo needs to land on the different planets of Solar System in order to get the super fuel and a weapon for the job. With it the can reach Scylla, who is already on the asteroid, and battle her there to destroy her mining base, and then chase after the fleeing witch herself to defeat her before she can get away.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hugo-in-space"}
