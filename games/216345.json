After venturing inside, The Courier finds that it is an enormous library, cataloging hundreds upon hundreds of different Pre-War novels. The only ones still \"living\" inside are the automatons that the vault dweller- a man named Professor Cartwright- developed to keep him company after the bombs had fallen. Once inside, the Courier is given a room by the surly robot Rolland, and is asked by the kind, if slightly unhinged robot named James to search for the remnants of the humans that had previously visited the vault. So begins the Couriers quest into the depths of the library, and onto the trail of a hundreds-of-years old mystery that haunts its denizens to this day.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 74496, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "eCijaeSAXsE"}]}
