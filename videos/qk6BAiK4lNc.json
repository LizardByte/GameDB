It has well-written dialogues (a few minor grammatical mistakes but it's not a big deal) and has one of the best soundtrack made by God$peed, *Kill Them All.* Art style is good, I prefer this kind of Art Style compared to the sequels.\n\nA simple point and click game. The game is very easy to play due to it's simple game's formula. You just need to talk to all characters, show some relevant clues which  would prove everyone's innocents apart from one and make final conclusion at the end of the game via answering a quiz. You could finish this game in less than 30 minutes, my gameplay took almost an hour because I want to show all dialogues that I could think of.\n\nWhat I don't like about this game is the ending. The ending could've been better imo but I'm still glad it has one. Man...I would be pissed if I played this game for more than an hour and the game just end with \"Thank You for Playing\", screw that! Pyrozen usually loves doing this kind of crap. The game's credits are weird, I couldn't even bother watching it till the end.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed playing this game nevertheless. I might need to play the sequels next year. Hope ya'll enjoy the gameplay.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qk6BAiK4lNc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qk6BAiK4lNc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qk6BAiK4lNc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qk6BAiK4lNc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qk6BAiK4lNc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Detective Grimoire (Flash Game)", "description": "This is a great Flash Game made by Super Flash Bros.
