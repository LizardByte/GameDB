I also have the game on the PS2, those days were awesome with Jak X.\n\nIn this Series i'm going to the end of the game. With finale finishing it off. This game is unbelievable running good. Sometimes you have a little framedrop. But you won't be seeing it over and over again. Gameplay feels good just like on PS2 but on the PS4 its much better with the DS4. Also the resolution is ofcourse much better than before.\n\nBattles throughout the game are great to just jump in and attack in this game. If you're interested like me in the Jak and Daxter games then you should buy this one.\n\nHere is Part 2: https://youtu.be/AGDDdKblyUo\n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/playstation.gamer.51/?hl=en\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\n https://twitter.com/Tarkan_Akbulak?s=09", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGDDdKblyUo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGDDdKblyUo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGDDdKblyUo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGDDdKblyUo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGDDdKblyUo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jak X Combat Racing (PS4) Playthrough - Part 1 | HD", "description": "Welcome to my first Playthrough on the channel with Jak X Combat Racing PS4.
