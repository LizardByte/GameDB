The protagonist, Mary Clarissa Christie, is a girl living by herself while her mother works abroad. She attends university with her friends, Angelica Derleth and Charlotte Bronte, and lives a peaceful life.\n\nHowever, through a chance encounter, she finds herself drawn into another side of London- spoken of only as rumors of \"Metacreatures\" who roam the night and attack people. She forms a contract with a strange man in a black suit, known as 'M', and begins to help him hunt these creatures...", "summary": "The player assumes the role of Mary Clarissa Christie.
