Although pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, modern pachinko machines are a cross between a pinball machine and a video slot machine.\n\nThere are many types of pachinko machines and parlor regulations, but most of them conform to a similar style of play. Players can buy metal balls by either inserting either cash, a pre-paid card, or their member's card directly into the machine they want to use. At 4 yen per ball that's 250 balls for every 1000 yen. These balls are then shot into the machine from a ball tray with the purpose of attempting to win more balls. The pachinko machine has a digital slot machine on a large screen in the center of its layout, and the objective here is to get 3 numbers or symbols in a row for a jackpot.\n\nHissatsu Pachi-Slot Station 5 - Invader 2000 is a pachinko slot machine simulator that features a pachinko slot machine (Invader 2000) made by Baltec.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hissatsu-pachi-slot-station-5-invaders-2000"}
