It was originally released on the website of The Hub, the TV channel broadcasting the show. The player takes control of one of the show's pony protagonists in order to find the \"Elements of Harmony\" and defeat villains.\n\nThe game consists of six levels, where the player must jump across platforms, avoid spikes and pitfalls, and collect apples for bonus score. To finish a level, the player must find the \"Element of Harmony\"; after each level follows a boss fight with one of the villains from the show. The player has a limited amount of health and lives, but life and health bonuses can be found.\n\nThere are six pony characters in total to choose from. Initially only one character is available, and a new pony is unlocked when the player finishes all six levels. The ponies have different abilities - e.g. Twilight Sparkle can shoot laser beams and use teleport pads, while Applejack can climb ladders and kick. The levels remain the same for every character, though with slight changes to account for their varying skills.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adventure-ponies", "collections": [{"id": 6943, "name": "Adventure Ponies"}]}
