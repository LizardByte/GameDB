He nods along as his eyes glance around the room, until they land on a certain bespectacled classmate: Aoi Nonohara.\n\nThough they\u2019d known each other since they were little, it had never gone beyond that. In fact, they were more \u201cacquaintances\u201d than friends.\n\n(I\u2019ve got no chance. Even so, if only she would\u2026)\n\nThere were no real problems to speak of between Shouhei and his classmates\u2026 But that was merely on the surface. It was only after Shouhei and Genta went home that their classmates revealed their true selves.\n\n\u201cI say this every time, but I really am sorry for pushing you to be Kreepo\u2019s partner. Though, I guess you can\u2019t really say he\u2019s your partner\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously. Who\u2019d want someone like him as their partner\u2026\u201d\n\nThe ones badmouthing Shouhei were Aoi, and Kaho Izumi. It was at this point that several male classmates joined them in trash-talking Shouhei:\n\n\u201cExactly. Why don\u2019t we set up a way for him to confess so he can get rejected and we can move on already?\u201d\n\nTheir playfulness annoyed Aoi. She pouted, which caused Kaho to start rubbing her breasts, trying to lighten the mood.\n\n\u201cHyah?! Hey\u2026 Where do you think you\u2019re\u2026 Mmm!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re as sensitive as always, aren\u2019tcha? I love how you\u2019re on the smaller side, too. So cute~\u201d\n\nKaho began to suck on one of Aoi\u2019s smaller-sized hills. Half of their other classmates left the room as playtime started, with the lewdness of the act causing the other half to join in.\n\n\u201cYou gotta play along with us too, Aoi-chan. Just accept that Kreepo\u2019s not one of us and let yourself feel good.\u201d\n\n[From MangaGamer]", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bitter-exclusion"}
