Its success led to three further games in the V for Victory series, and then the similar World at War series published by Avalon Hill. \n \nThe game simulates the D-Day invasion on the area surrounding Utah Beach and the greater Cotentin Peninsula area. The player takes the role of overall commander of the US forces or the German forces opposing them. The game includes six scenarios to play as either side, one of which covers the entire invasion area up to the period just prior to Operation Cobra.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/v-for-victory-d-day-utah-beach"}
