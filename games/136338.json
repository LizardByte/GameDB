Their full, terrifying might is fixed on summoning the Dark Titan to Azeroth-and they've already located the key to his return.\nWith the Alliance and Horde devastated, adventurers must take up legendary artifacts and weapons used by the heroes of old, scour the ancient Broken Isles for relics of the Titans, and challenge the Burning Legion before Azeroth's last hope dies.\nSteel yourself, champion. Extinction is imminent.\n\nFollowing the events of Warlords of Draenor, the alternate Draenor's Gul'dan is expelled by his demonic masters into the original Azeroth with a special purpose - to reopen the Tomb of Sargeras and the gateway to Argus, commencing the third invasion of the Burning Legion, an invasion even greater than the War of the Ancients. Gul'dan also had to find and steal the body of the famous demon hunter Illidan Stormrage.\n\nAfter the defeat at the Broken Shore, the defenders of Azeroth found themselves exploring the long-forgotten Broken Isles in search of the Pillars of Creation, titan relics which were used to shape the world - and which were Azeroth's only hope for closing the massive demonic portal at the heart of the Tomb. However, the Broken Isles - a land which 10,000 years ago was home to the then mighty night elf civilization - came with their own perils to overcome, from the demon lord Xavius and his satyr armies, to the vrykul's God-King Skovald, to the powerful nightborne night elves, and the deadly naga led by Tidemistress Athissa.\n\nAs part of this desperate search, the Kirin Tor, now led by Khadgar, moved the floating city of Dalaran to the shores of this land, with the city serving as a central hub for the efforts of the world's heroes. The death knights of Acherus also took their floating necropolis to the Isles.\n\nTo defend their world against the onslaught of the Legion, the heroes of Azeroth sought out legendary artifact weapons to wield in battle, but also found themselves embracing new and unexpected allies in the form of the Illidari, Illidan's elite disciples, freed in desperation by the Wardens that guarded them to fight against the Legion in this hour of need.\n\nOngoing conflict between the Alliance and the Horde led to the formation of the class orders, with exceptional commanders putting aside faction to lead their classes in the fight against the Legion.", "summary": "Contents:\n- World of Warcraft: Legion \u2014 Full version of Legion on DVD.\n\n- The Art of Legion\n\n- Legion Behind-the-Scenes Blu-ray and DVD set\n\n- Soundtrack\n\n- Legion Mousepad, featuring Gul'dan and Illidan\n\n- Digital in-game goodies\n\n- World of Warcraft \u2013 Illidari Felstalker Mount and [Nibbles] Pet \u2014 Stalk the invading demonic forces atop one of the Burning Legion\u2019s own twisted hounds of war, and summon a delightfully demented companion to keep you warm by the fel fire\u2014both available immediately upon pre-purchase.\n\n- Heroes of the Storm \u2013 Felstalker Mount \u2014 Charge down the lanes of the Nexus and wreak havoc on the opposing team astride this fierce fanged terror.\n\n- StarCraft II \u2013 Fel Protoss Portraits \u2014 Take back Aiur in infernal style with psionic-infused StarCraft II portraits of Illidan and Gul\u2019dan.\n\n- Diablo III Wings of the Betrayer \u2014 Equip your hero with Illidan\u2019s wings and strike terror into the hearts of Sanctuary\u2019s demons.\n\n- Hearthstone Card Back \u2014 Your adventures in Draenor will be the talk of the tavern after outfitting your champion\u2019s deck with this custom card back forged in the fires of Blackrock \u2013 available to Hearthstone players just in time for the launch of Legion.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-of-warcraft-legion-collectors-edition", "videos": [{"id": 39712, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "eYNCCu0y-Is", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYNCCu0y-Is", "title": "World of Warcraft: Legion Cinematic Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eYNCCu0y-Is/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39713, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "N6CWue7voA0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6CWue7voA0", "title": "World of Warcraft: Legion \u2013 Feature Overview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N6CWue7voA0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
