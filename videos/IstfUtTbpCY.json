Jumpman and Pac-man must join forces to save Pauline. Each board contains a number of pellets that must all be picked up before the board can be finished. You start each board playing as Jumpman, but you can temporarily transform to Pac-Man by picking up a power pellet. When you play as Pac-Man you are invincible and can chase and catch the ghosts. Each level contains four different boards that are variations of the original boards including barrels, tunnels, elevators and rivets. Make the Jumpman/Pac-Man team a success and save Pauline, but ... don't forget to pick up all pellets !!!\n\nThis game has been released on january 17th 2024 to the public.\n\nYou can play the game online in your browser here: \nhttps://donkeykonghacks.net/page_play_pmx.html.\n\nThe site https://donkeykonghacks.net gives more information on this romhack and my other Donkey Kong romhacks.
