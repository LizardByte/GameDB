Toothpick can be used as a dotting tool in nail art to create tons of cool nail art designs. With a toothpick, one can dot the nail polish on nails or drag it to make different nail art shapes and designs. In this DIY nail art step by step tutorial, I show 5 nail art ideas on how to create different nail designs using a toothpick and a nail polish as the only tools! I show how to create a cartoon splatter nail art design, ombre dots, animal print (leopard print), googly eyes and a vintage flower nails. All of the designs are very easy and simple to create, they are actually perfect for beginners in nail art. All of these nail designs are suitable both for long or short nails! Toothpick is a great alternative to a nail art dotting tool and it works just as great for any manicure. The best part is that almost everyone has some toothpicks at home and if not, they can be bought in any local store very cheaply!\n\nWith a toothpick, you can make either smaller or larger dots! To make larger ones, let's learn a little toothpick tip (trick): Toothpicks normally have a very pointy end, which is great if you want to make tiny dots. But if you would like to create larger dots, simply cut one end with scissors! To make tiny dots, dot a toothpick on a piece of plastic bag after dipping it into the polish. This way the majority of polish is gone and with what is left on the toothpick you'll be able to draw very small dots. Further, don't worry if your toothpick is not rounded - mine has actually a triangular shape. Dip it in the polish a few times and let it dry. Your toothpick will get a perfect rounded tip!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZagYbNzpWus/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZagYbNzpWus/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZagYbNzpWus/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZagYbNzpWus/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "DEVILISH CANDY HOUSE", "description": "Use a toothpick to make pretty nail art designs!
