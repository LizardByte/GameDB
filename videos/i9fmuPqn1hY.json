{"id": "i9fmuPqn1hY", "snippet": {"title": "ADG Episode 11 - Dark Ages", "description": "Episode Originally Released: August 7th, 2010\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nApogee had made some fun shareware titles back in the days of DOS gaming, but one of the troubles a large number of their games had was that buying their full versions didn't actually get you any new features, just more levels. Dark Ages is one such example of this since the free shareware episode is fairly decent, but the second and third episodes you originally had to pay for were just more of the same. :P\n\nGood thing the ENTIRE game is freeware now. ;)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Information and Corrections:\n\n* No, no one guessed that today's episode was supposed to be Action Fighter. Oh well. :P\n\n* The 3D Realms link for Dark Ages is broken now, so here's another link to the RGB Classic Games site where you can download the game from: http://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Dark_Ages.html\n\n* My version of Action Fighter is a bit different from the most commonly known versions illegitimately floating around the net. Basically, mine has arrow key controls, rapid fire, and Tandy 3-voice sound support, which is much better than the PC Speaker sound effects.\n\n* OK, so I was partly wrong about the SNES already being out. Dark Ages and the SNES came out the same year, but Dark Ages was first. That said, the Super Famicom (IE: the Japanese SNES) came out late in 1990 before Dark Ages.\n\n* Geeze, I say \"like I mean\" and \"for all intents and purposes\" a lot, don't I? A couple other common words for me are \"extremely\" and \"actually\". :B\n\n* To enable the cheat mode to get rapid fire with any weapon, press F10, then press the = key to toggle the rapid fire mode. You can also press backspace to reduce the coin cost of more health.
