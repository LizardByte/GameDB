The game ends when Don Quixote kills the evil witch and rescues Isabella.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-don-quix-ote", "videos": [{"id": 122244, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dB-PNDE_IY0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB-PNDE_IY0", "title": "Super Don Quix-ote HD Arcade", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dB-PNDE_IY0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
