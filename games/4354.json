The game has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player's club has a wealthy benefactor who makes \u00a325m available, in the medium setting \u00a325m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/giant-killers"}
