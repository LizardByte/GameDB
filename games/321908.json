As your light fades, so does your sanity. Teamwork is crucial to overcome the puzzles ahead, and if your torches or sanity deplete, the game is lost.\nIn this eerie, ever-changing world, each level is a new challenge, from short and intense sprints to longer, multi-part stages with safe zones. The faster you complete levels, the more coins you earn \u2013 but beware, your coins drain over time. Use your hard-earned coins to buy extra sanity or lives at scattered shops, but don\u2019t linger too long \u2013 time and resources are limited!\nThe heart of the experience is cooperation. The game\u2019s shared pool of lives means everyone must work together to survive. Each failure takes a toll on the group \u2013 and the sadistic narrator, \"The Torcherer,\" is more than happy to mock your every misstep. Laughing at your failures, showing off death photos, and reminding you just how fragile teamwork can be, he\u2019s there to make sure you don\u2019t forget your mistakes.\nCan you and your team survive the torch, the dark, and the unrelenting taunts of the Torcherer?", "summary": "It's an online co-op indie, runner 3d platformer with a bit of puzzle and surreal. \"Carry your flickering torch through perilous puzzles in this retro-inspired cooperative platformer.
