After completing Act 1, a purple vortex in the sky appears and surprises Classic Sonic. After that, it goes all the way to the present day and Sonic is invited to a birthday party by Tails. However, Sonic arrives early, so Tails tells him to wait. But then a vortex sucks Tails into it. Sonic jumps in but is \"attacked,\" though he manages to get in anyway. Sonic sees a white world and wonders what's going on. Modern Sonic rescues Tails after restoring Green Hill, and Tails tells him that he sees a big city in nighttime and a giant mushroom, so Sonic decides to go check those places out, being followed by Classic Sonic, who is believed by Tails to be Modern Sonic.", "summary": "In the 3DS version of Sonic Generations, Modern Sonic's gameplay is similar to that of Sonic Rush and the DS version of Sonic Colors. He has the Boost, the ability to slide under obstacles, jump off walls, and the Homing Attack. After the second era, Modern Sonic learns the Stomp. Modern Sonic's levels use the 3D effect of depth on the 3DS version more actively as well as to giving a better view for when Modern Sonic jumps into the background, although the console versions are 3D-TV compatible. In the HD version, Modern Sonic is only able to wall jump off certain panels (similar to the DS version of Sonic Colors), but in the 3DS version, he is able to wall jump on any wall (much like Sonic Unleashed and the Wii version of Sonic Colors).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-generations--1", "videos": [{"id": 39471, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gb9RQwlNRy8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb9RQwlNRy8", "title": "Sonic Generations 3DS Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gb9RQwlNRy8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
