The game's unnamed protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. In order to free her, he must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out. But in addition to guards, various traps and dungeons, the protagonist is further hindered by his own doppelg\u00e4nger, an apparition of his own self that is conjured out of a magic mirror.", "summary": "The game is set in ancient Persia.
