It features three species: the cute, dependent Norns, the cantankerous Grendels and the industrious Ettins. The game tries to simulate life, and includes a complex two-dimensional ecology of plants, animals and insects, which provide the environment for the three main species to live and develop in. The player interacts with the world using a hand-shaped cursor, and tries to encourage the creatures' development by manipulating various objects around the world, guiding the creatures using the cursor and encouraging the creatures to speak.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/creatures-2", "videos": [{"id": 27290, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "fjVaeQB1kcA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjVaeQB1kcA", "title": "Creatures 2 Intro Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjVaeQB1kcA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
