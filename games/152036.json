With her talents, she can make them come true in the dream worlds she conjures.\n\nWhen Cornelius, a student of the Astral Academy, stumbles upon Melody\u2019s music box and opens it, he unleashes Melody, who decides to create fantastic new dreams for all the Academy's students. Luckily one student is able to escape the curse and summon the Heroes of Trine to set things right.\n\nThe heroes must traverse the dreamscapes of the Astral Academy, lush and verdant pirate adventures, face the night on the icy cold tundra, follow a sinister path through a haunted old forest, survive in the surreal world inside the clockwork mind of a mechanical owl, and finally solve all mysteries at the deceivingly cosy homestead of Cornelius Crownsteed.\n\nIn addition to the familiar faces of Heroes of Trine, Melody of Mystery reintroduces many fan favorites from Nine Parchments, a Trine universe spin-off story that focused on Astral Academy students. Cornelius is not the only student under Melody's spell - Carabel, Gislan, Rudolfus and Owl are all dreaming of enchanted fantasies.", "summary": "In Trine 4: Melody of Mystery, there's trouble brewing at the Astral Academy once again. All the students are cursed, trapped in enchanted slumber and unable to wake up. With a mysterious spirit on the loose, released accidentally by the kind and guileless Cornelius Crownsteed, it's best to call the Heroes of Trine to see what they can do to bring back Cornelius and his fellow students from their enticing dreamlands.\n\nTrine 4: Melody of Mystery is a 6-level story campaign that continues the travels of Amadeus, Pontius, and Zoya. The new adventure features more upgrades for the heroes' skills, and fresh puzzles with clever gameplay elements for our heroes to take on.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trine-4-melody-of-mystery", "videos": [{"id": 50517, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "mU_ldfr_g0Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU_ldfr_g0Y", "title": "Trine 4 Expansion - Melody of Mystery PC Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mU_ldfr_g0Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 887, "name": "Trine"}]}
