While the game was cancelled as Accend never actually licensed the Build engine, it was leaked and released to various pirate BBSes as well as licensed out to a Korean developer that turned their early version into a full release. A fan translation has become available in 2019.\n\nThe game is set in medieval China, where the main character is transported from the modern world and finds themselves becoming a hero of the Shaolin Temple and has to uncover a conspiracy to topple the ruling dynasty.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
