Nikochevski then leaves him to assist the main body of commandos when they arrive in the morning to rescue a Royal Navy submarine, the E-423, sheltered and under heavy guard in one of the hangars. They destroy the base's anti-aircraft guns and torpedo warehouse before escaping in the submarine together with its crew.[1]\r\n\r\nWhile in the North Sea, the Royal Navy submarine is caught and forced to surface in the frigid waters after being depth charged by a German destroyer. The enigma machine is confiscated and the entire crew captured with the exception of James Blackwood, who hid in the bow of the submarine. He soon manages to contact Thomas Hancock, who also escaped capture. After rescuing the crew, the commandos proceed to recover the enigma machine and disable the destroyer's main guns & engine. Under orders that the enigma machine be hastily brought to England, Jack O'Hara and Rene Duchamp takeoff in a Fieseler Fi 156, while the rest continue their journey in the submarine.\r\n\r\nA year passes and the commandos are deployed to the Pacific Theatre. In Burma, they rescue a spiritual leader and assassinate a Japanese tyrant with the help of Gurkhas. On June 17, 1942, the commandos enter Bangkok, Thailand, where they rescue a Colonel Guinness, who in turn helps them destroy the bridge over the River Kwai by revealing its structural weakness. The bridge is blown up just as a train of the Japanese high command approaches it.[1]\r\n\r\nIn July 1942, the commandos land on the strongly fortified Savo Island to disable the large artillery guns, before Operation Watchtower can commence. While on the island, they are assisted by a castaway named Wilson. After destroying the artillery and rescuing a downed American pilot, he returns the favour by piloting a Kawanishi H8K to help them escape the island, but not before telling them of a gold monkey statue which is symbolic to the Japanese. O'Hara steals it as a souvenir.\r\n\r\nIn Spring of 1944, the commandos are sent to Haiphong, Indochina, destroying the port's fuel depots and infiltrating the Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano. While out at sea, the commandos sabotage the rudder of every A6M Zero and report the carrier's position before taking off in two undamaged Zeroes. The Shinano is then bombed by American F4U Corsairs.[1]\r\n\r\nFollowing their tour of duty in the Pacific, the commandos are recalled to Europe for the Normandy invasion. They rescue a wounded Private Smith and with the help of American soldiers, successfully defend the town of Cherbourg from waves of German infantry and Panzer III tanks. A few months later, Toledo is captured and taken to Colditz Castle where he is to be executed. The commandos save him and they help the POW's housed there escape by disguising them in German uniform. After the prisoners escape, the commandos acquire top secret documents from three high ranking German officers, revealing plans to devastate Paris with planted explosives before it is liberated.\r\n\r\nIn August 1944, the entire commando corps arrive in Paris and succeed in disabling the detonator, before leaving the city in an airship from top of the Eiffel Tower.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1oLDoJO7sE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1oLDoJO7sE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1oLDoJO7sE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Commandos 2 Men of Courage Trailer", "description": "PLAY FREE FLASH GAMES AT ~ http://www.fullmoongamer.com/\r\n\r\nMay 1941, on a mission in a German submarine base at La Pallice in La Rochelle, France, commando Paul Toledo, with the help of Natasha Nikochevski, capture an Enigma machine hidden in an officer's safe.
