Designed to solve the problem of Earth\u2019s overcrowded prisons, the U.S.S Anomaly is the ultimate test of your escaping prowess. The floating fortress is complete with robotic guards (and dogs!), jet packs, shuttles and an A.I Warden. In space, no one can hear you escape!\n\nThe Escapists 2 is the forthcoming sequel to the multi-million selling, award-winning sandbox prison-escape game which will include, in a first for the series, drop in/drop out play for up to four players in both local and online play.\n\nEscaping won't be easy though. You'll have to work around the strict prison schedule and avoid the unwanted attention of guards. Craft weapons and tools found (or stolen) from within the prison, but beware of cell shakedowns. Get a job or perform \u201cfavours\" for your fellow inmates to purchase vital supplies, all while scouting escape routes.\n\nTeam17, founded in 1990, are a fully independent Video Game Developer and Games Label, responsible for the Worms\u2122 series, Beyond Eyes, Sheltered and  many more.
