She goes to work, she goes to sleep, she checks her e-mails\u2026 In fact, there's nothing special about her. She's just ordinary. \n \nIf she's so uninteresting then why was she targeted by an entity calling itself 'File'? \n \nPart desktop simulator, part platformer, this is a game designed in 2.5 months for #PixelHorrorJam by myself & James_T_Ripper \n \nInspired by the popular titles Welcome To The Game & Pony Island, File requires the mouse to be controlled in order to maneuver Raven's computer in search of a set of programs, each more horrifying as you progress. \n \nControls: \n-Once a program is executed, the D/Right-Arrow Keys can be used to move the player right \n-Alternatively, the A/Left-Arrow Keys can be used to move the player left \nLike most platformers, the Spacebar is used for jumping in levels which require it", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/file"}
