The orb is filled with fire and a powerful light known as Noohra, you must become the light bearer a hero commissioned to bring light and truth back into the world. Without a hero the souls of humanity move toward the coldness of certain death.", "summary": "Darkness often seems to have the unfair advantage being the master of deception, seeking to enslave souls.
