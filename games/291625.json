The people gathered in arenas to watch violent battles, where only real warriors were able to survive. Amid all this chaos, a story of valor and courage began. Titus, the great fighter, surprised the empire and managed to defeat all the gladiators to be released.\n\nThe game is a series of one on one gladiator fights with increasingly stronger opponents. Between each fight there is a text screen with a description of the next oponnent which also serves to advance the story. Winning each fight unlocks progress towards the next weapon, which can be equipped for the next fight. The player can move forward, backwards, raise the shield or attack, all in real time. The strategy is to know when to defend and when to attack.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/luta-de-gladiadores"}
