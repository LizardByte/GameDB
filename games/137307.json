Unfortunately, many civilizations choose to view our cataloging and tourism as unwanted, and attempt to shield themselves from our work. This month's tip features such a civilization, who views our entry into their reality as demonic (any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, etc). While they are currently successful in barring entry to their realm proper, we do have access to their surrounding countryside, albeit with some interference. With any luck, we will one day be able to grant you access to their most treasured places... \n \nAs per usual. we advise that you do not venture past the walls, as your reality is only stable within a few kilometers and any and all warranties are void if you venture too far.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hinterland--1"}
