It is divided into three realms - heaven, home to white-winged angels; the human world, inhabited by relatively weak, wingless people; and hell, where black-winged devils reside. The three realms are largely independent and their natives are suspicious of the other realms. Many humans have been convinced of the evil nature of Hell by the angels, but for all their fearsome powers neither the devils nor Hell itself are inherently malevolent. Hell is ruled by the beautiful and compassionate Jenarose, who is said to love humankind more than anyone in the world.", "summary": "Rage was one of the four Great Generals of the Demon Army, but he was slain in a battle against the Angels. He has recently been revived, but has lost all memories of his previous life. With the war between Demons and Angels still continuing with no end in sight, he must restore his power and build his forces back up to strike back against the Angel Army.\n\nBlack/Matrix II is a turn-based tactical strategy game similar in structure to Final Fantasy Tactics, and the sequel to Black/Matrix. Characters level up and learn abilities individually, and it is possible to recruit a variety of characters, though only 6 at a time can be deployed into a battle. There are also several different romantic interests to pursue, with multiple endings for each depending on the player's choices throughout the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/black-slash-matrix-ii", "videos": [{"id": 83194, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Mg-kgsQLh64", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg-kgsQLh64", "title": "Black/Matrix II [\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30af\u30b9II] Game Sample - Playstation 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mg-kgsQLh64/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 5052, "name": "Black/Matrix"}]}
