When a tribe of echidnas sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds' power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Before it could destroy the world, Tikal, a young echidna who befriended Chaos, imprisoned it in the Master Emerald along with herself. Eggman releases Chaos and Sonic and his friends must act against Eggman's plans and prevent the monster from becoming more powerful.", "summary": "Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut, although it has the same name as the GameCube and PC expanded version of the original Dreamcast game, is actually a bundle with both the game released first for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the title of \"Sonic Adventure\" and its DLC, \"Sonic Adventure DX Upgrade\".
