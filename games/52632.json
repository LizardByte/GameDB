Sling colorful bugs at each other to make sets of three like-colored beetles, and prevent a much-dreaded infestation. Journey from the city to countryside while dealing with bees, butterflies, centipedes, and persnickety hard-shell bugs. Hilarious animated cartoons tell the story of Lylek, the electrician, and Martina, the insect expert, as they try to solve the buggy mystery before the lights go out for good!."}
