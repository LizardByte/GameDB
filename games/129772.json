Like most other games in this genre, it features randomly generated levels, relatively high difficulty and a large number of things to learn. And like most other games of its genre, it is quite challenging.\n\nThis game is based on the source code of another Android game, Pixel Dungeon. It began as a small project with the goal to improve the original game here or there, but has since gradually grown into something much, much bigger. The games are quite different from each other, so there is no need to play the original game before trying this one (but I would recommend to try it as well, it's good).\n\nThe main feature of YetAnotherPD which makes it different from original game and other mods is that it is mostly focused on tweaking game mechanics in order to make the game more interesting, diverse and balanced. Anyone who is familiar with the original game will have much to learn again in YAPD.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yet-another-pixel-dungeon"}
