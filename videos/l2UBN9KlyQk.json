Japanese dubbed version \"DeathMask\" was released for PSX and Saturn. Manual contains a lengthy background story and short version can be read in Wiki.\n\nI like the Blade Runner / cyberpunk thing they were going after and overall presentation is pleasant. Unfortunately, the game has no options for volume levels or anything. Can only save load and quit and the only video mode available is scanlined. It's not possible to skip between screens. Having to watch prerendered videos every time when moving makes this game tedious to explore. There's not much of a game in AD. Conversations are simple three mood choice options. Alternative reactions follow the answer and may result in death. There are few puzzles, but those are easy and not very interesting. IMO the story they were going after isn't bad, but more interaction with characters would make it feel less scripted. Now you only meet each character once, watch a video and then move on. But I enjoyed playing AD because of the atmosphere.\n\nAt the end of the game there are three possible endings, shown in row and followed by credits. Most of the death scenes and some alternative response videos are shown after the credits.\n\nHint: In DOSBox start the game with /nounivbe option to avoid sound problems.\n\nAll endings: 01:42:55\nCredits: 01:48:19\nDeath scenes: 01:50:40\nEaster egg: 02:02:57", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2UBN9KlyQk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2UBN9KlyQk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2UBN9KlyQk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2UBN9KlyQk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2UBN9KlyQk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Angel Devoid (PC DOS) longplay", "description": "Angel Devoid is a 1996 FMV adventure game developed by Electric Dreams.
