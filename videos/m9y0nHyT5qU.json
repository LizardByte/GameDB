They've already done Commodore 64 and Amiga, so now it's time for Atari's 8-bit computers... more specifically, the Atari 400 model. And what's better is that Atari themselves helped out and licensed it.\n\nAs always with Retro Games Ltd's machines, The400 Mini allows you to sideload your own Atari 8-bit games via USB stick. The mini console will run games for the following models: Atari 400, Atari 800, XL/XE models and even the Atari 5200 console.\n\nAnd of course, it wouldn't be a mini console without built-in games. The system has 25 games, as well as two hidden bonus games that can be unlocked by plugging in a compatible controller, like the Evercade VS controller as an example.
