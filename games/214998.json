This project was first released as a demo build in July of 2015 and was later released in October for SHC 2015. This hack is a mixture of CrazyBus' gameplay and music and Sonic 1's gameplay, plus other additions. It was designed to be as obnoxious as possible to evoke negative reactions from players. Despite this, it is generally considered to be amusing by players, especially first time players.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazysonic"}
