Bickering in the world community over the morality of these campaigns eventually leads to the withdrawal of China and Russia from the U.N. Even NATO is divided and it soon becomes obvious that America's only real support comes from Great Britain.\n\nIn 2009 the league of Arab nations invade and occupy Israel. The U.S. and Britain come to Israel's defense but it is a struggle that will eventually be lost. China and Russia are supplying arms and troops to the invaders. Tactical nukes are used in the offensive marking the first time nuclear arms have been used in war since WW2. Six months later, India falls to Pakistan. The world is in a state of shock.\n\nIn 2010 Russia, China, Vietnam, North Korea, and the entire Middle East form the Eastern Alliance. They quickly expand into most of Europe, Asia and Africa. Since they possess a large nuclear arsenal plus most of the world's oil supply, no countries, including the U.S. are in a position to oppose them. A cold war sets in that would last for 7 years.\n\nIt is suspected that the Alliance, headed by Russia is working on cloaking technology. It is rumored that they have discovered a way to bend light, making it possible to render things invisible, such as troops, weapons and even missiles. Despite their best efforts, U.S. scientists are unable to crack this technology. This would prove extremely detrimental.\n\nIn January 2017 the Eastern Alliance launch an attack of cloaked nuclear missiles upon major cities and industry in North America. The U.S. is helpless as all but 2 of its retaliatory missiles are shot down. What's left of the free world watches in horror as Eastern troops invade American shores in an attempt to occupy the country. Even though most of the command structure has been wiped out, the Americans aren't just going to roll over. A fierce fight ensues that would last for months. This is where you come in.
