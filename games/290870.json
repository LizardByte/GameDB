The player controls a stickman who must get past a wall, avoid cannon fire, and defeat an opponent in one-on-one combat. In each of the three levels the player's role is to press Space when an oscillating \"power bar\" is at its fullest. If the player presses Space at the wrong time, a cutscene will play in which the hero is killed (there are two possible death scenes, depending on how close the power bar was to its maximum.) However, pressing Space at the right time instead shows a cutscene where the stickman destroys the obstacle and moves on to the next one. The player can also watch all nine cutscenes in a separate video player, accessible from the main menu.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xiao-xiao-no-2"}
