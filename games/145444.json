The kids these days listening to their mumble poets and warbling tragedians are just too much for him to bear. He wants to bring back the stars of his youth... but they're all dead. A little death never kept a good god down, though, and certainly not a heroic figure with bulging biceps and a penchant for bashing heads. So Dionysus, being at least one of those two things, hatches a plan so he can also pass himself off as the latter.", "summary": "The Frogs is a point-and-click adventure game based on the ancient Greek comedy by Aristophanes. Play as Dionysus as you survive awful puns and break all the fourth walls in a journey through Renaissance paintings on a quest through Hades. It's an ancient Greek comedy with Renaissance art and 18th century classical music... and that identity crisis is just the tip of the iceberg.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-frogs", "videos": [{"id": 47499, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HO-e6ub5t6Q"}]}
