Frustrated with the lack of innovation in other word games, indie designer Chris Garrett developed QatQi to freshen up the genre with never-before-seen gameplay, an elegant interface, dazzling art, and otherworldly music that changes as you play. In a word, it\u2019s INSPIRED (161 points.)\n\nQatQi offers more than just laying down tiles and reaping the rewards. Game puzzles form a \u201cmap\u201d for players to explore, uncovering bonuses and avoiding barriers as they link letters together. It\u2019s easy to learn, but offers a new kind of strategic depth for the genre. Bolstered by robust statistics and enticing social features, QatQi is a complete package for word game lovers eager for something new.\n\nBeyond the innovations in gameplay and scoring, QatQi is an audiovisual tour de force with art and music that can be appreciated even without words. The game\u2019s puzzles will have you racking your brain, but its ethereal aesthetics will leave you in a state of zen.", "summary": "You know that feeling you get when you finish every path and cover every square inch of a map in an RPG? When you apply that concept to the word game genre, you get QatQi.\n\nThe levels in QatQi are designed with many large, open rooms, much like dungeons. There are several gold coins hidden in each of those rooms, and discovering them will result in massive score bonuses. You can view a detailed breakdown of your performance for each level you complete, including factors such as word length, effectiveness, and gold coins, among others.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/qatqi"}
