There are two new offline tournaments for a total of six, and an internet play mode. Perhaps in response to Tiger Woods' success at the time, a black-skinned golfer is added to this version. You now view other golfers on the main play screen, and the action is tracked by 8 smart cameras. New visual enhancements include water reflections, waving flags, blimps, balloons, airplanes and environmental haze and fog.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/links-ls-1998-edition"}
