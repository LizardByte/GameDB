Dear Isaac has been sent home from his Doctoral studies at Trinity College Cambridge back to Mother in Woolsthorpe Manor. Rainbows, prisms and reason have been his sole companions. It has been quite some time since he set foot outside, but of sound mind and body, he has made some significant progress towards solidifying the Corpuscular Theory of light. He will surely confirm his proofs... if he can just finish this morning's experiment - one that will surely prove no challenge at all to a determined man of Science.", "summary": "An Eye for Optical Theroy 1666 is a short point & click horror adventure game with a focus on atmosphere and narrative. It is the plague year of 1666 and Isaac Newton, in lockdown at his home, has been thinking on the topic of Optics, and planning a series of experiments.
