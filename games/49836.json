Bubbles of different colors descend from the top of the screen in clumps. Using your blaster that fires colored bubbles of your own, you must attempt to clear the screen as best as you can. BUST-A-MOVE MILENNIUM EDITION offers five unique modes of play. In the returning Puzzle mode, you'll play through a huge number of new stages of bubble-busting action that require careful planning and fast reflexes. Challenge mode also returns to test your BUST-A-MOVE skills. In the brand new Story mode, you'll take on a series of increasingly difficult computer opponents in a battle to the finish. Also new is a mode that allows you to play as long as you can last. Of course, the biggest and best addition to BUST-A-MOVE MILENNIUM EDITION is the two-player link cable Versus mode. Now you can grab a friend and show off your BUST-A-MOVE skills! You get all of this plus enhanced graphics and other new options.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bust-a-move-millennium", "videos": [{"id": 144175, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yYa0BgDS0fc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYa0BgDS0fc", "title": "Game Boy Color Longplay [034] Bust-A-Move Millennium (US)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yYa0BgDS0fc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 712, "name": "Puzzle Bobble"}]}
