They intend to engage players emotionally by allowing them to build relationships with the game's characters and shape the outcome of the story through an array of conversation choices.[8] The game eschews certain conventions of action-oriented computer role-playing games such as the focus on a young lone hero's story, looting and buying items, or reloading a saved game state after defeat. Instead, the developers intended to tell the story of the player's caravan as a whole, and encourage players to accept and deal with the consequences of any defeats they may encounter.[9]\n\nThe first game in the Saga centers on the return of the Dredge, a warlike race that despises humans led by the Bellower, a nigh invincible Dredge who leads them on a warpath on human and Varl. As a wandering army sent to fight against the Dredge and find a weakness for the Bellower, many difficult decisions are made by the caravan that would shape the fate of both man and Varl.", "summary": "The Banner Saga is a Viking-themed tactical role-playing video game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 1952, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "btd0JrWmuA8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btd0JrWmuA8", "title": "The Banner Saga: Factions launch trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/btd0JrWmuA8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 5774, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mHaUw7LMjX0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHaUw7LMjX0", "title": "The Banner Saga -- Your Saga Starts Now Trailer | PS4, Vita", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHaUw7LMjX0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1640, "name": "Voice Actor"}]}
