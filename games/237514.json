Jino vows to grow strong enough to finish his uncle's work. Years later, the young but unprepared adventurer collapses outside the town of Encia. He recovers upon healing at the local inn, then fights further into the surroundings of the capital city Delphi. Others also want the fabled Orichalcum, from his magic-using ally Tia Chanti to the antagonistic sorcerer Thales. In the end, who among them will revive and reclaim the land's hidden power?\n\nWander Wonder is a unique overhead 2D action-RPG by Compile, originally released in 3 episodes via their Disc Station digital magazine starting in October, 1999. Jino can jump, slash, and use a mix of items, tools, and special moves to explore and fight his way across the land. Weapons degrade with use, but are frequently found as loot or merchandise, adding an element of resource management and incentive to repair arms at blacksmiths. The game progresses in a flip-screen style a la classic Zelda or Ys; multiple complex overworlds and dungeons await you. Finally, there's considerable post-game content, from new side-quests to a 500-floor mega-dungeon!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wander-wonder", "videos": [{"id": 84180, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Kg1gtyGWozY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg1gtyGWozY", "title": "[PC/JPN] Wander Wonder - action RPG from Compile", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kg1gtyGWozY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
