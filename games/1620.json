He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earth Realm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen. When Sindel is reincarnated in Earth Realm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earth Realm becomes a part of the Outworld, killing billions instantly. Only a few are spared, as Rayden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earth Realm is partially merged with Outworld. Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earth Realm and kill any survivors.", "summary": "Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, \"Dial-A-Combo\" attacks, a \"Run\" button to speed up the battles, and \"Vs.\" codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat-3", "videos": [{"id": 34360, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BlaiCXBtivc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlaiCXBtivc", "title": "Sub-Zero - Mortal Kombat 3 - PC DOS Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BlaiCXBtivc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 117979, "name": "Behind the Scenes - Motion Capture", "video_id": "rzZsQQIRJIA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzZsQQIRJIA", "title": "Behind the Scenes - Mortal Kombat 3 [Rare Footage]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rzZsQQIRJIA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 117984, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "Gs4tAuiANQE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs4tAuiANQE", "title": "Making of - Mortal Kombat 3 (high quality) [MK3 Into The Outworld - Behind the Scenes]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gs4tAuiANQE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
