Now the evil Sir Ruber is out to claim Camelot. Since the King is unable to fight, he trusts a young girl named Kayley to fight for him and save his Kingdom. You take the role of Kayley as you explore nine worlds and a total of 60 areas in search of Excalibur. Along the way, you will have to learn how to use several devices including a slingshot, snorkel, and grappling hook to perform tasks and solve puzzles. Naturally, Sir Ruber has henchmen out to stop you, but use your sword to dispatch them. As the game progresses, you will learn a powerful spin-attack as well as dart- and lunge-attacks. Will Kayley be able to save Camelot? Will finding Excalibur be enough to help King Arthur? Find the answers to these questions by playing QUEST FOR CAMELOT.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quest-for-camelot"}
