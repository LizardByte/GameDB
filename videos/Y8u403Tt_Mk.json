In this mode, players experiment with different chords, notes and strum speeds to develop their signature sound and make each performance their own. It\u2019s a completely new kind of music gameplay, it\u2019s perfectly suited to VR, and it\u2019s unlike anything else Harmonix has ever created.\n\nUnderpinning the gameplay is an amazing sense of presence you can only get in VR. From the moment the player takes the stage, they\u2019ll experience what it\u2019s like to perform in front of sold out crowds \u2013 sweaty palms and all. To deliver this fantasy, Rock Band VR focused on the details \u2013 from working effects pedals to interacting with your bandmates to the ability to use your guitar to bang on the drummer\u2019s hi-hat cymbal. It\u2019s an incredibly immersive experience.\n\nWhile the gameplay may have changed, scoring and leaderboards remain as central to the Rock Band experience as ever. Players will need to develop a mastery of Rock Band VR\u2019s new gameplay mechanics if they want to claim a top spot. Chaining together chords and notes into musical phrases and combos will earn players points, while timely deployment of overdrive and signature rock moves, like head banging in time to the music, will trigger multipliers to boost scores even further, earning more stars. It\u2019s a deep, complex system that rewards both technical proficiency and creativity. \n\nTraditional Rock Band gameplay will have its own dedicated leaderboard at launch in Classic Mode.\nSoundtrack\nRock Band has a history of amazing soundtracks and Rock Band VR is no exception.
