It is the third installment in the Prince of Persia franchise, and technically the first of many reboots the franchise has got. Even though the game follows plenty of concepts from the original duology of games, it has a completely unconnected story from them. Despite that, since the release of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time marks the second reboot and the start of the \"modern era\" of the franchise, this game is often considered a part of \"original trilogy/classic trilogy\" including the original duology.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
