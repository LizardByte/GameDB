Another one opens to reveal a prostitute that invites the character in and asks him to choose from a list of sexual acts. All acts are paid, if the player has no money, he will get r**** by a male character as a punishment.\nThere are also three characters that show up randomly:\nAn old lady shows up at random, if the player has a pistol, they can r*** her, which attributes 10 points to the final score.\nA thief shows up occasionally, sometimes he asks for a lighter but may also try to rob the player. If the player shoots him, he can avoid being robbed, otherwise he will lose everything including his wallet.\nA policeman shows up once in a while asking to the see the player's documents, if the player doesn't have his wallet, he will be sent to prison. The game over screen shows the player \"pleasing\" himself.", "summary": "An early open world/sandbox game released only in Portugal in 1985 whose controversial status (involving sex, violence and drugs) and crude humour allowed it to become the most famous game ZX Spectrum game created in the country.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paradise-cafe", "videos": [{"id": 93672, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Nxz6ZDUyffg"}]}
