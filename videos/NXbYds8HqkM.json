Use the familiar media bar mechanics to manipulate time and solve a variety of mind bending puzzles.\n\nTake control of Scrub, a bot who has been tasked with finding and fixing all the glitches in the videos on the site. As time goes on  you find out there is bigger problems at play.\n\nThe game features many of the common options you would find in an online media player. Such as comments that will be used to give hints and tips as well as progress some story elements.\nFull Screen mode and bookmarks as well as  options for speed and resolution which can be used to make the game a little more accessible. \nSpeaking of accessibility, Lowteks\u2019 text to speech plugin \u201cDislectek\u201d will also be available to read the above mentioned comments.\n\n\nPleayhead received some funding from the \u201cUK Games Fund\u201d in 2021 which allowed for Lowtek to go full time on the project for a few months. They feel the demo is in a good place to show off and ask Kickstarter for more money to get the game over the line.\n\n\nThe game will be available digitally on itchio and steam as well as a couple physical pc versions.\n\n\nThe campaign features some stretch goals in the form of dedicated Steam Deck support and a Switch port.\n\n\nLowtek is working with influencers who have shown support for past projects. They will appear as cameo comments in some of the levels and hopefully support some cross promo.\n\nIf you like the sound of this game and have a reasonable presence on youtube etc please reach out. Doesn't even need to be games related. It would be great to see some vloggers, makeup artists , musicians get a shout out too.\n\nPlayhead was Honorable at Pocket Gamers \"Big Indie Pitch\" in December 2021\n\nLinks to Demo:\nitchio\nhttps://lowtekgames.itch.io/playhead-...\nSteam:\nhttps://lowtekgames.itch.io/playhead-...\n\nPress kit:\nhttp://lowtek.co.uk/press/sheet.php?p...\n\nhttp://lowtek.games/\n\nThanks \nAlly", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXbYds8HqkM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXbYds8HqkM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXbYds8HqkM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXbYds8HqkM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXbYds8HqkM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Playhead Kickstarter Live Trailer", "description": "The campaign is live from the 21st March 2022\nKickstarter campaign Link:\nhttp://kck.st/3IrGk1g\n\nPlayhead is a puzzle platformer game set inside an online media player.
