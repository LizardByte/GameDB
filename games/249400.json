None of them, including Nagisa herself, know what love is like. But perhaps they can learn.\n\nIn an unknown town, an unfamiliar miracle has begun to search a corner of the world for a tiny flame of happiness.", "summary": "Sekai Project will release Cosmillica's \"A Bouquet of My Beloveds\" (Subete no Koi ni, Hanabata wo.), a yuri visual novel, in English for PC via Steam.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-bouquet-of-my-beloveds", "videos": [{"id": 107174, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Yw8miKYqE5M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw8miKYqE5M", "title": "\u3010\u767e\u5408\u30b2\u30fc\u3011\u5168\u3066\u306e\u604b\u306b\u3001\u82b1\u675f\u3092\u3002OP\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yw8miKYqE5M/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
