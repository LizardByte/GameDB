Though it has six stages that end with the same boss enemies, its level design, layout, and many regular enemies are different. This release also completely removes two key gameplay features of the computer version: the ability to equip different weapons and armor, and the flying side-scrolling shooter stages.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/valis-ii", "videos": [{"id": 102365, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8nfWGPCzUxU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nfWGPCzUxU", "title": "Valis II (TurboGrafx-CD) Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nfWGPCzUxU/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3238, "name": "Valis"}]}
