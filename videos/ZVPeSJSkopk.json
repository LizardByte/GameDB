Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. It\u2019s Karl\u2019s mission to take out the high-ranking Nazi officers and end Operation Kraken once and for all. \n\nBased upon real world locations from France in 1944 the new game maps are the largest and most immersive in the franchise\u2019s history with the new traversal system offering players an even greater sandbox of options when it comes to taking out their targets. You can even invite a friend to help you on your mission with enhanced co-operative gameplay options.\n\nSniper Elite 5 continues the franchise\u2019s unparalleled tactical sniping experience complete with incredible ballistics and enhanced kill cam taking the genre-defining feature to the next level.

Change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondary weapons, and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.\n\nInvasion mode drop-in PVP \u2013 you can invade another player\u2019s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\n\nTense adversarial multiplayer \u2013 customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals, and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op\u2019s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.\n\nEnhanced kill cam \u2013 more realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot.
