But just as everyone's getting settled in, a mix-up at his father's workplace forces Natsu's parents to hop right back in the car and drive home, leaving him to spend the remainder of his summer break out in the sticks. Misaki is more than happy to take him in, of course, and so begins a peaceful, relaxing few weeks where absolutely nothing out of the ordinary threatens to disturb his tranquil everyday routine... Bwahahaha, as if!\n\nIt isn't long before a self-proclaimed magical girl named Chitose worms her way into Natsu's life, but her boisterous intrusion is the least of his problems. An eccentric candy seller, an insecure wanna-be teacher, a pink-haired loudmouth... Not to mention, his aunt's strange behavior around the topic of the outdoors. Surrounded by misfits, it soon becomes apparent that Natsu's real summer homework is to learn more about the women around him and help them with their problems. And yet, with only 30 days until his parents pick him up, is this one assignment he's fated to flunk, or will he pass with flying colors?", "summary": "Summer vacation is finally here, and the next few weeks promise to be anything but uneventful! Natsu has just 30 days to acclimate to life in the countryside, help the locals face their demons, find that special someone, and gain the self-confidence to return home with his head held high!", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/natsu-no-sagashimono-what-we-found-that-summer", "videos": [{"id": 140130, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MW7rO08uVk0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW7rO08uVk0", "title": "Natsu no Sagashimono ~What We Found That Summer~ - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MW7rO08uVk0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
