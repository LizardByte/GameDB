The title was the very first game created by WorkJam, a developer founded by Yutaka Kaminaga that famously took over the Tantei Jinguji Saburo franchise after the closing of Data East. Cross Tantei Monogatari was initially released for the Sega Saturn in Japan on June 6, 1998 and featured seven different episodes that had their own mysteries to solve. The following year a PlayStation port was released that contained several enhancements including the main character being fully voiced among other improvements. A discounted version was also published in 2000 that was separated into two titles with episodes 1-4 being in the first game and episodes 5-7 in second game."}
