After asking about this granny and Tikhon, he goes to the forest, where the Nightingale counts the stolen money. Ilya makes an attempt to attack and grab the robber, but the latter whistles and blows with all his might so that Ilya is blown back to the village. Ilya understands that his heroic strength disappeared because he did not follow a diet and did not eat anything for almost seven days. He turns to the granny for help, who kneaded the dough for him. Ilya warms up the dough itself in the oven, on which Tikhon lies and after eating the baked bread, the heroic silushka returns to Ilya. However, the Nightingale still blows Ilya back to the village, no matter how strong he is. But Ilya came up with a cunning way, launching an iron wheel from afar at Nightingale, and then approach him and arrest him for attacking the village and resisting the Russian hero.\n\nThe Nightingale the Robber escapes and steals Ilya Burushka's horse along with the Prince's treasury. The prince turns to Ilya for help and they decide to go together in pursuit of the Nightingale. First of all, they decided to go to the outpost of the heroes, ask Dobrynya and Elisha if they had seen the Nightingale. Dobrynya was sleeping at that moment, and Ilya and the Prince could not wake him up. Elisha explains that Dobrynya has been chasing Nightingale's robbers all night and is now sleeping the other day, and it is useless to wake him up. In addition, he proves this by yelling at Dobrynya at the top of his voice, but the latter was fast asleep. Then Ilya and the Prince find a map leading to the camp of the Nightingale the Robber and they go there. Having found the cave where the Nightingale's lair was, Ilya lights a signal fire near the cave in order to attract all the robbers to his battle. Ilya, armed with a mace, defeats all the robbers and takes from one of them the key to the pantry in the cave, where they kept the chronicler Alyonushka locked up and tied up. She tells them that she has been eavesdropping through the keyhole on Nightingale's conversations with his gang all night. The Nightingale the Robber, together with Burushka, went to the magical forest. On the way, the Prince remembered that he had other things to do and decided to leave, while Ilya continued on his own.", "summary": "Ilya Muromec i Solovey-Razboynik is a computer game in the \"quest\" genre.
