Game-play consists of the player twisting the shorter end to position the piece projected on the smaller screen above the gap in the pieces shown on the larger, twisting the smaller screen itself to rotate the piece itself in one direction or another, then squeezing both ends together to \"drop\" the piece in place.\n\nOn Marathon Mode the player is given three lives, and the time allotted the player to maneuver, rotate and drop the piece gets shorter as the game progresses. Should the player either fail to drop the piece in time, or they drop said piece in a way that any part of the piece would stick out of the top of the lower LCD screen, the player loses a life.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bop-it-tetris"}
