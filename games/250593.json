The action takes place in 2010. The main bans were programming, sex with women, and drinking beer. The FSB, bikers and soccer hooligans try to resist, but all in vain. Moscow is destroyed by a hundred-meter-long mechanical hare controlled by the Devil, because the Underworld raised his rent and moved into the hare's inner apartment. The fields near Moscow are covered with radioactive nettles, awaiting a strategic napalm bomber. Abbot Nimalo piously saves money for the Blessed Warhead, and underground clubs use waitresses as furniture.\n\nThe main character is Anton Tvorog's sister, Stasia, who needs to get out of the city urgently before the authorities dispose of all the women. On her way she will meet many interesting places: from an underground men's strip club \"Fresh Meat\", where Stasa will have to pour strippers from a water machine filled with yogurt to the charity organization \"World Thermonuclear War\", where she will be taken into the arms of Abbot Nimalo and the Great Pope.", "summary": "Russian adventure point & click game.
