Try to master 10 different courses that take you through ovals, twisting bobsled runs, and several treks through the wilderness. When you are ready for some competition, try to win the Tournament Cups, where you will have to take first place from two other racers. After winning, you will be able to upgrade your vehicle before moving on to the next race. With three different Cups to win, there is plenty of racing action. If you get tired of racing computer-controlled opponents, hook up a link cable to challenge your friends to a race.
