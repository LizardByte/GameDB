Stop! is a clone of the game Keystone Kapers, originally developed by Activision. The game is for the most part exactly the same except for a few color and sprite changes. In Hey! Stop!, you are not playing as a policeman, trying to chase down a thief but you instead play as a droid chasing down an alien (despite the fact that the box art displays a picture of the former).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hey-stop"}
