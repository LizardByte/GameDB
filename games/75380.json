In Battle for Azeroth, the fall of the Burning Legion sets off a series of disastrous incidents that reignites the conflict at the heart of the Warcraft saga. As a new age of warfare begins, Azeroth's heroes must set out on a journey to recruit new allies, race to claim the world's mightiest resources, and fight on several fronts to determine whether the Horde or Alliance will lead Azeroth into its uncertain future.\n\nWhoever wins the coming war will likely win a dying world thanks to the Burning Legion. Magni Bronzebeard reached out to the faction leaders and was rebuffed. So now Magni turns to the adventurers, needing help to save the world, and these chosen ones will receive a gift from the titan herself.\n\nAn epic \"War Campaign\" arc will be woven throughout entire questing areas.\n\nThe expansion pack takes place 33 years after the Dark Portal events.", "summary": "World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth (abbreviated as Battle or BfA) is the seventh expansion for World of Warcraft. It was announced at BlizzCon 2017 on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe idea of the expansion came up after the heroes of Azeroth dealt with so much external threats like the Burning Legion. In their own words, \"so when we talk about what's the biggest threat in this world, is it the titan or is it the dwarf paladin that put a hammer in that titan's head\"? As such, the enemy (at least during the early parts of the scenario) will be the opposite faction, a \"vast army of world-destroying forces\".\n\nOn January 30, 2018 Battle for Azeroth was made available for preorder, coming with the unlocking of the four first allied races. With the announcement of the Collector's Edition and release date for Battle for Azeroth on April 5, 2018,[3][5] Legion was the first expansion to be offered for free with a preorder.[6] Battle for Azeroth is the first expansion to launch in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia/New Zealand at the same time. Battle for Azeroth set a new day-one sales record for a World of Warcraft expansion with more than 3.4 million units sold on day-one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth", "videos": [{"id": 23059, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HLKS0Jq9U_E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLKS0Jq9U_E", "title": "Terror of Darkshore", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HLKS0Jq9U_E/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 23060, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LKZ7ygLTR0g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKZ7ygLTR0g", "title": "Cinematic: \"Lost Honor\"", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LKZ7ygLTR0g/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 21879, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hndyTy3uiZM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hndyTy3uiZM", "title": "Warbringers: Azshara", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hndyTy3uiZM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 27312, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eeZOFt8EUy0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeZOFt8EUy0", "title": "Cinematic: \"Safe Haven\" (EU)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eeZOFt8EUy0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16667, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "HiWCmiKVs94", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWCmiKVs94", "title": "World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth - Cinematic Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HiWCmiKVs94/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16668, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "kg6DqgdMpUI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg6DqgdMpUI", "title": "World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kg6DqgdMpUI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
