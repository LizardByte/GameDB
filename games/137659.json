But such order does not happen all by itself - the city needs YOU to control the traffic lights and to make sure everything goes smoothly. That means no crashes, no jams. Everything will run perfectly - as long as you stay focused!\n\nImmerse yourself in a beautiful, hand-crafted, low-poly world to discover the enormous satisfaction of watching the hundreds of tiny, colorful cars flowing through the streets \u2013 all while listening to the chill, urban music.\n\nOver 100 levels, each with its own busy intersection. You have one job: operate the lights and keep it safe.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/urban-flow", "videos": [{"id": 44084, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "z9vhMOVAD28", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9vhMOVAD28", "title": "Urban Flow - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9vhMOVAD28/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
