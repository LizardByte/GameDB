It\u2019s a two player game that you play against a computer player or with your friend on the same device. OIL is a tense digital board game that plays a lot like battleships with a major oil mining twist! Unlike battleships, in OIL you and your opponent share the same play-space and compete for the same oil. Use your strategic mastery to beat your opponent and show who is the best oil miner! Influenced by the film \u2018There Will Be Blood\u2019, OIL focuses on the competition of oil mining in the iconic setting of the American oil boom of the early 1900s.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oil"}
