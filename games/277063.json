There's exploration, leveling up, and multiple endings. My idea was to make the dragon coin system from JUMP 1/2 into a central gimmick.\n\nLevel design styles include everything from standard: easy to kaizo: intermediate. Like most of my hacks, this pushes the boundaries between kaizo and standard. This is a hack that boldly proclaims, \"Kaizo needs more fishin' boo.\" Let this be a warning.\n\nMy goal is to create a fresh experience that's accessible to kaizo players. If you decide to take up this challenge, I hope you enjoy!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-whatever-quest"}
