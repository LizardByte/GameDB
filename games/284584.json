Studios. The game centers around two characters, Meg Crimson and Alan \"Steppenwolf\" Kane, as they journey around the world in search of the blood samples of various cryptids rumored to have been alive for hundreds of years, all in an effort to finish the X-Creatures Project, an operation designed to grant humans immortality.\nThe gameplay often revolves around collecting items and interacting with the open world in an attempt to solve a mystery or escape a dangerous situation. In-game quick cut scenes are used to show the effect of an action. The game is split into six chapters, with each consisting of a prologue, four episodes, and, with the exception of the final chapter, a recap.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/steppenwolf-the-x-creatures-project"}
