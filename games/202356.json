The dream gameplay involves exploration and collecting effects, called \"Tracks\" in this game. The main part of the game also has some dialogue, but is not the main focus. Dry is drawn in mostly grey shades, making it look somewhat depressing.\n\nDry is about an alcoholic deer named Dry, who had recently graduated from college and is about to enter university. The game begins with him sitting in a pub and asking the bartender for another drink, but he talks him out of it and tells him to go home.\n\nThe problem is Dry is far away from home right now, as his father gave him a CD that should help him to overcome his addiction. His father said that Dry should be far away from home for it to work, so he took a tent and traveled to the place where the game starts.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dry--1"}
