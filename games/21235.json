Though only one man, he became renowned throughout the world for his heroism. However, within ten years, the empire Lord Median had created collapsed with the death of his son, quickly followed by his own death. With no apparent leader, the continent collapsed once more into civil war. Fifteen years later, Lord Median's daughter had proven herself as a true leader, and convinced the remaining countries to form peace treaties, establishing peace once more.\n\nThis peace collapsed 50 years later, however, when the \"Master of Death\", Gig arrived with three giant beings known as World Eaters under his command. They quickly devastated the land annihilating entire nations in a matter of days, and it wasn't long before nations began abandoning their alliances and allying with the World Eaters in an attempt to save themselves.\n\nWhen things looked their darkest, Layna gathered up what remained of her forces and made a direct assault against Gig, a battle which apparently killed both of them. With their leader gone, the World Eaters fell silent, apparently having gone to sleep, remaining as monuments of the destruction that occurred.\n\nStarting Your Journey\nThe year is now 800 in the Tamaito calendar. 200 years have passed since the defeat of the shadow at the hands of the technique user Layna. Ever since that day, with the shadow's defeat, the giants known as \"The World Eaters\" have retained their silence in the continent. The body of one of the giants remains in the peaceful country of Raide, and serves as a symbol of fear to those who pass by it.\n\nWithin the country of Raide, there exists a small secluded village that refuses to acknowledge the existence of those from outside world. It is known as the \"Hidden Village\". In that village lives the protagonist along with their friend Danette, and other members of the Sepp race. Along with Layna, whose age now exceeds 200, the protagonist helps to protect the village.\n\nOne day, the protagonist and Danette are called forth by old lady Layna and given weapons to help guard the village. Danette, who has always dreamed of protecting the village, is overjoyed and is given twin daggers. The protagonist is given a long black sword.", "summary": "Gig and the gang are back to spread destruction!
