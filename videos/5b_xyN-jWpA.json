{"id": "5b_xyN-jWpA", "snippet": {"title": "Brain Bender (Hard) [GB] - Real Time Longplay (No death)", "description": "This is a, no commentary, Longplay of Brain Bender for Game Boy, played on Hard. Another Game Boy title with no complete walkthrough on YT.\n\nBrain Bender is a puzzle game where you have to guide a laser beam, using mirrors, to destroy the enemy's satellite. There are also gray spheres (gas spheres as written on manual) that you have to explode and bulbs you need to turn on in order to complete each level. Story is abstract but I assume there is some kind of alien invasion and you need to defend your home. Nothing spectacular really... There are 12 Levels in total and each one is divided in 10 screens, so there are 120 (!) of screens (stages) to play. Each stage has a time limit that becomes shorter as difficulty increases. Furthermore, when you do mistakes (for instance by hitting the white spheres or send the beam directly back to the mirror) time limit decreases rapidly which makes it almost impossible to complete the stage on time (especially on Hard setting). So this is a quite challenging title that requires not only good memory but also speed to complete.\n\nFrom my standpoint the game has 3 main flaws: 1) When the beam is reflected from many mirrors, the game losses frames and becomes very slow (better optimization was needed). 2) The ending screen is pathetic; a text message that congratulates you and after that you are sent back to the last stage. 3) Some levels are identical, for instance levels 4-4 and 8-7, what is the point of that? \n\nThe graphics are acceptable for a puzzle title released in 1991, but music is very bad. It is absent in the title and options screen (yes, no music at all, not even SFX) and there is a SINGLE low quality track playing throughout the game (120 stages with the same track, are you serious guys?). \n\nIn short, Brain Bender could have been a decent title but the frame drops and terrible music makes it a below average title. I only recommend for people who like puzzle games. If you give it a try be prapered as it is a quite difficult game that needs a lot a patience to master it. After many attempts I managed to do a No death run.\n\nBelow are the video times of each Level:\n\nLevel 01: 0:35\nLevel 02: 6:00\nLevel 03: 11:34\nLevel 04: 17:43\nLevel 05: 24:45\nLevel 06: 30:25\nLevel 07: 38:28\nLevel 08: 45:58\nLevel 09: 52:48\nLevel 10: 1:01:20\nLevel 11: 1:09:14\nLevel 12: 1:17:20\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame is played by me in one go.
