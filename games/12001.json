Solving a level invariably involves collecting microchips with available tools such as keys, magnets, shields, and cleats. Doors, traps, monsters, and other mischievous devices pose barriers, entice you into danger and complicate your progress. As each level is solved you are led into the next, slightly more difficult level.\n\nThe first eight levels are puzzles that introduce you to the game's basic concepts. You find your way through mazes, collect keys to open doors, teleport from place to place, pick-up tools, and use logic to conquer each puzzle.\n\nThe levels get progressively more formidable. You must pay attention to subtle hidden clues, learn how to evade many forms of disaster, and execute a complex series of actions.\n\nWith 144 levels, even the most skilled strategy game players will be absorbed by Chip's Challenge for countless hours.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chips-challenge", "videos": [{"id": 52154, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Qw4EFHGemfQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw4EFHGemfQ", "title": "Atari Lynx Longplay [58] Chip's Challenge", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qw4EFHGemfQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
