This event resulted in the death of almost all of the humans and set in motion the rise of the Undead, the creation of the Anims, and the birth of the Demons... As the world was about to see its absolute end, a being known as the Heavenly Queen rose up to challenge the Beast and the magic it was using to attack Starcross. After their battle, the Heavenly Queen was left mortally wounded and the Beast was destroyed. However, its magic was not gone, and the Heavenly Queen chose to seal herself in the Door locked behind the Rose so that she may one day return with her strength recovered to heal Starcross. Only a single sword was left as the key to re-opening the door and ending her slumber... but again, that was 300 years ago!\n\nThings might not be so awful now! Or they might be! Depends on who you ask but honestly things have gotten along pretty well thanks to the leadership of some really impressive individuals! A notable feat is that Demons, Anims, and humans live very much in harmony. The Door locked behind the Rose, the Sword, and Mt. Starcross itself are also pretty fun tourist attractions now! So whether or not you even believe that stuff about the Beast and the Heavenly Queen and blahblahblah, you gotta admit that a lot of people seem happy enough!\n\nNow who knows what would happen if some unknown, idiot kid just came along and actually pulled the sword up. But I doubt we'll ever have to worry about that! Schools out! Summer just started! A perfect time to take a vacation!
