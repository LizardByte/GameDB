All of these features, coupled with new races and hero classes, new spells and items, and new building and dragons meld to form a Real-Time Strategy game that once again raises the benchmark for other games in the genre. Warlords Battlecry III is poised to receive even greater accolades than the previous award-winning titles in the Warlords Battlecry series.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warlords-battlecry-iii", "videos": [{"id": 6851, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "DWhqFs-Dxos", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhqFs-Dxos", "title": "Warlords Battlecry II -Intro- 2002", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DWhqFs-Dxos/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1316, "name": "Warlords Battlecry"}]}
