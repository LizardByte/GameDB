{"id": "bZiIQY-O46I", "snippet": {"title": "FrostRunner Trailer", "description": "FrostRunner is a first-person platformer \u201cspeedrunning\u201d game, where the player is tasked with rapidly completing platforming challenges before the timer runs out.  The game is set in a desolate, frozen environment seemingly abandoned by all life. Scattered throughout the icy landscape are mysterious energy crystals emanating a strange power. The player navigates 36 levels of arctic terrain using their platforming skills and a tool that allows them to tether between crystals. The constantly ticking timer encourages players to complete levels as quickly as possible and compete with others to earn their place at the top of the leaderboards.\n\nThe game originated as a first-person platforming game, called Warp, where the player moved around via teleportation. It was a puzzle game that challenged the player to use their warping abilities to complete obstacle filled levels. Over time, we found that the most engaging moments of our game were high speed moments where the player was moving. The team agreed that we wanted to focus more on the fast-paced aspects of the game and we slowly removed all elements of the original puzzle focus. As we continued to develop, we embraced the speed of the game and put in leaderboards and achievements to encourage players to go as fast as possible.\n\nStudio Name: Think Arcade\nDevelopment Time:  5 Months\nDevelopment Team:\nGame Designer \u2014 Andrew Chase\nProducer \u2014 Gerald Milton\nLead Level Designer \u2014 Phillip Carter-Tracy\nLead Software Designer \u2014 Zach Bracken\nLead Artist \u2014 Claire (Chengyixiu) Bian\nLevel Designers \u2014 Alexander Cocoles, Zhi Yang, Xiao Wei, Quest Washington\nSoftware Developers \u2014 Rui (Siri) Xie, John Peng\nArtists \u2014 Unna Pussayapaiboon, David Rosario III", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZiIQY-O46I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZiIQY-O46I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZiIQY-O46I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZiIQY-O46I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bZiIQY-O46I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "FrostRunner Trailer", "description": "FrostRunner is a first-person platformer \u201cspeedrunning\u201d game, where the player is tasked with rapidly completing platforming challenges before the timer runs out.
