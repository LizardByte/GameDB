We've always wanted to turn our ideas into a game. After extensive planning and refinement, we are excited to introduce our brand new game, also our debut work, \"Encounter.\"\nThe game's storyline combines elements of Chinese horror with encounters with extraterrestrial beings. It features innovative processes and gameplay. In this game, you'll experience how to interact with extraterrestrial beings, the connection between your character and the plot, and fulfilling tasks required by the alien entities. For instance, you might use a camera to capture unseen substances and then decrypt the elements after placing them in designated spots. There's also the use of an energy-absorbing gun to charge energy blocks in specific locations, thus unraveling the mysteries of the plot. Additionally, you might need to gather specific items and place them in a certain location to unlock the progression of the storyline.\n\nThe game is enriched with a plethora of eerie atmospheres, allowing players to experience supernatural visuals and sounds that evoke a distinct sense of horror. We hope you enjoy this unique terror experience!\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts with us. In our upcoming projects, we might just incorporate your invaluable suggestions!\nOfficial QQ Group\uff1a\n878740232", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qwh7YspREdA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qwh7YspREdA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qwh7YspREdA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qwh7YspREdA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qwh7YspREdA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Encounter(\u63a5\u89e6\uff09Game Trailer", "description": "steam link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2498580/_The_Encounter_Chapter_One/?beta=0\nThroughout our journey, we've held a deep fascination for exploring topics like dark matter, alternate dimensions, multi-dimensional spaces, parallel worlds, the unknown, UFOs, extraterrestrial beings, and more.
