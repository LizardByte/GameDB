What you can see here is a labour of love from a variety of mappers, beginner to pro. The concept behind it? Each mapper has taken a specific theme, and then tried to make something nice looking, but also fun, within specific confines. This Doom II megawad is divided between chapters of varying difficulty, with each chapter using specific monsters and enemies, with the purpose of the whole thing feeling like a gradually more challenging adventure. While this is playable from pistol-start, it is mean to be experienced continuously in UV as it has been balanced for that purpose and that purpose alone.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/theme-gawad-a-doom-ii-megawad", "videos": [{"id": 101750, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fuj7yE9t2b4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuj7yE9t2b4", "title": "This ain't just any Megawad, it's a THEME-GAWAD - Maps 1-5 Blind Ultraviolence", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fuj7yE9t2b4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
