Honouring the tradition of your people, you have come to the ruins of old Kc'tall to face The World-Eater. Eons ago, in The Time of Legends, your people worshipped The World-Eater as Qu'tall, God of conquest. In his name you subjugated an entire continent, countless cultures and vast lands. But left with nothing more to conquer, Qu'tall went mad, turned inwards and swallowed whole his own people. Your tribe was the sole survivor of the cataclysm. The Bards and Storytellers of the culture, you were sheltered by your patron God, Itotia, God of Arts. It is in her honour that your people, once in each generation, send a Bard to face the World-Eater.\n\nYou wield The Instrument. You have mastered its sacred songs. Songs of power and beauty. So powerful they can shatter stone, so beautiful they can lull even Gods to sleep.\n\nYou have come to the Temple City of The World-Eater. He is once again awakening to sate his eternal hunger. With the instrument you brave the temple city, avoiding the dangers created by the awakening of the World-Eater. Because the old god will use the whole temple city to try and stop you. Statues will come to life and the very floor beneath your feet will try and throw you into your death.\n\nShould you fail to defeat him he will rise and devour the world. It's a heavy burden you carry, but there is no return. Countless Bards have walked this way before you. It is The Way of your people. And it will lend you strength.", "summary": "You are The Bard.
