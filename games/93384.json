The levels tend to have a bit tighter spots, making the pace a bit slower compared to Wipeout. \n \nGeopod XE has a greater set of tracks to compete in, and many new pods to fly. Like the original Geopod, it has a simple league mode and allows you also to buy some upgrades to the pods, making them faster or easier to handle, for example.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/geopod-xe"}
