Be you the Werewolf-- brutal and swift, or the Doll Master-- creeping and conniving, you are designed to feast on fear, terrorizing your teenage prey relentlessly.\n\nTeens scramble to flip the script with weapons fueled by ancient Stigma-- Burn, Shock, Curse, and Purify-- that extinguish Evil. Blast monsters with a faceful of Flame and Fury, dish out a killer jolt from your Raygun or RC Flyer, swing Cursed Swords and cast curses, and harness the glory of a Holy Slingshot or Cross.\n\nVideo Horror Society bleeds 80s horror, and if you\u2019re not careful, you will too.", "summary": "Choose between good and evil and fight for your life in Video Horror Society, a thrilling 4v1 asymmetric action tribute to the 1980s horror era-- where small town teens face off against terrifying monsters brought to life from the aisles of a 1980s video store.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "videos": [{"id": 54462, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "EudLkQrn0qc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EudLkQrn0qc", "title": "Video Horror Society Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EudLkQrn0qc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
