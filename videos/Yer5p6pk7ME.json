And why do you see the name of SquareSoft in this game? The answer is simple, Capcom produced full Breath of Fire and released in Japan, but was not sure if the game would succeed in the West, then SquareSoft saw the quality of the title and offered to launch in the West, having been a game successful in a time when the RPGs were making a success in the SNES.\n\nIn this game we control Ryu, half human / half dragon and one of the last descendants of the clan of the Light Dragons, warriors that can transform into powerful dragons. Ryu lived with his sister Sara, in a small village that was attacked by the rival clan, Dark Dragons, clan that wanted to reunite the 6 keys of the goddess and to resurrect the Tyr Goddess and to cause a great chaos to the world. Sara manages to convince Jade, the second main general in command of the Dark Dragons, that she is the only survivor of the Light Dragons clan, and Jade prefers to kidnap Sara, instead of killing her.\n\nIn the face of all this, Ryu goes out into the world to save his sister, rescue the keys and prevent the Dark Dragons from ending the world, so he will have the help of characters like Nina (specialist in healing spells and princess of the Clan of Windia, clan where men and women can transform into giant birds and fly when they reach maturity), Bo (the archer ranger of a race of humanoid wolves of the Forest clan, able to cross forests through the map), Karn (the leader of the thieves of the city of Bleak, able to overcome any trap, open any door and make fusions with other characters), Gobi (a very ambitious half man/half fish, with trade skills and turning into giant fish), Ox (a giant clan being of the Iron Ogres, who are peaceful despite their colossal appearance and are skilled blacksmiths), Bleu (a great sorceress, half woman/half serpent and endowed with enormous black and elemental magic skills), Mogu (character of the mole men race, able to dig in specific places on the map to find rare items).\n\nIt is undoubtedly a very well produced game, its only problem is not having a button to run (problem that has been corrected in the version for GBA). The entire video was made with all the fusions, all the dragon transformations and the best ending.
