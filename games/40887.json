Some of the customers welcome him and want their windows washed while others are worrisome about his wet work and would not want him washing their windows. There's only so much water for Willie to wield in his bucket, so he must only waste it on the welcoming window wash customers. It's also raining so Willie will have to remember who lives where. \n \nMemory Manor is a memory matching game played from a side-view perspective. Players take control of Wee Willie who can move left and right, climb ladders and choose to wash a window he is in front of. The game relies on memory, after a brief glimpse of the people in the manor the windows fog up, hiding the occupants. The player must remember which windows contain happy customers and wash their windows. Willie has a limited water supply and so must not waste washing on anyone who doesn't want their windows washed. The game is over if Willie uses up all of his water.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
