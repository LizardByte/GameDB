Players will receive a starting bonus in Saise-hen based on how many times they have completed Hakai-hen, along with an extra bonus for playing all of Hakai-hen's scenarios, but unlocked machines and pilots will not transfer.\n\nEvery series from Hakai-hen returns, with their sequels/second seasons debuting if applicable. Macross 7 makes its Z-series debut, with Dynamite 7 appearing for the first time in any SRW. The only completely new series, Tetsujin 28, is the 1980s incarnation of a robot series that predates even Mazinger.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dai-2-ji-super-robot-taisen-z-saisei-hen"}
