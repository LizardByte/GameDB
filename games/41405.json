After Rance's battle with the former Demon King Gele, he was trapped along with Sill in an alternate dimension with no means to escape before being transported by the God of Light GOD and taken to an unknown location that they've never seen before.\n\nRance being literally naked, and with his level mischievously dropped to 1 by the God of Light, they find themselves in an unknown land that isn't in The Continent they've always lived. They come across a small town nearby and it doesn't take them too long to find out that they are actually in the floating island above Leazas, Ylapu. Stuck in the floating landmass with no means to get out, they are forced to investigate in order to find a way to return to the main continent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen of Leazas sends a platoon called the Rance Rescue Team to the unknown land in order to help Rance. However, Leazas is not the only country visiting the floating land, as they will also come across Helman agents and they will be forced to fight to stop the awakening of an ancient super weapon from hundreds of years in the past. The Legacy of the Sect.", "summary": "Hundreds of years ago, the Master of Magic decided to use his immense power to bring peace to mankind and to annihilate the demons on the Earth once and for all. In a grand battle that lasted thirty-two years, his army defeated the demonic forces. However, as always in such cases, something went terribly wrong. Now the one who must correct things is Rance, a young warrior with nothing but sex in mind. As always, with the aid of his lovely slave Sill, Rance will prevail in his fight against darkness... but not necessarily against his libido!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rance-iv-legacy-of-the-sect", "collections": [{"id": 2786, "name": "rance"}]}
