Ultor Corporation, aptly named after the ancient Roman temple dedicated to Mars the god of war, owns all the mining rights on the planet. The company is an expert at maximising production while minimising costs. Fortunes are made as cargo ship after cargo ship return to Earth filled with precious Noachite.\n\nMine workers, misled by promises of adventure and easy money, arrive on Mars by the shuttle load. Few ever make it back to Earth. Conditions in the Ultor mines are brutal. The work is dangerous and the miners\u2019 living quarters are disgusting. Environmental suits and bunks are shared between miners on different shifts. Food is lousy and in short supply. And beatings from Ultor guards are commonplace.\n\nWorst of all, a mysterious, disfiguring Plague is running rampant through the mines. As the death toll rises and Ultor remains complacent, the miners\u2019 fear and discontent grows. Pamphlets and posters from an underground organisation begin showing up all over the mining complex. Signed by the mysterious Eos, the pamphlets tell of bizarre deaths and missing comrades and urge the miners to take action against Ultor. Tensions run high. The mines are wired like a powder keg. All it will take is a spark...\n\nDuring a shift change, a young miner is brutally assaulted by an Ultor guard. Another miner, Parker, witnesses the brutality and is quickly caught up in the chaos. He has no choice. Kill or be killed. A rebellion explodes across Mars.\n\nCan you live long enough to become a hero?", "summary": "Red Faction revolutionizes gaming with Geo-Mod technology, the ability to completely alter and destroy the environment in real-time.
