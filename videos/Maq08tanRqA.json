Players are being called to arms in a new trailer, released today, which encourages bold knights to choose their weapons wisely, and to come prepared with the skill to wield them. This trailer shall serve as a final reminder to those knights who wish to test their mettle on the fields of battle: bring any weapon you wish, but it will not save you unless you have mastered it.\n\nHowever, every second spent watching the epic trailer leaves players with less time to join the battle during the early access period: pre-orders for War of the Roses will conclude on September 25th, 2012, and only those who have wisely pre-ordered the game will be allowed to play during early access, which will begin that same day. \n\nThose with pre-orders will have an entire week to roam the battlefield and engage in fast-paced combat. This will afford those players the opportunity to develop the skills sorely needed to survive when the game finally launches on October 2nd, 2012.\n\nIn addition, every pre-order receives a free upgrade to the Digital Deluxe Edition and an exclusive set of in-game armor.
