In actuality, she's a very sweet, kind girl who just wants to get along with her classmates better. However, it seems her name, Sawako, often gets misheard or compared to Sadako (which is a popular horror character from The Ring). The Ring is about a dead ghost girl, who pops out of the TV screen to kill their victims. This happens after a certain amount of days have passed when someone views a cursed video tape connected to her.\n\nNote: The translations may different from the original Japanese text. I took a more liberal approach and changed some meanings to make it sound smoother and more natural in English. I'm still in the learning process, so I can't guarantee the translations are 100% correct. \n\nHope you enjoy the video!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13ysSXkR84M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13ysSXkR84M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13ysSXkR84M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13ysSXkR84M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13ysSXkR84M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Kimi ni Todoke 01 DS English Gameplay (subtitles)", "description": "Kimi ni Todoke: Sodateru Omoi DS by Namco Bandai.\n\nYou'll need Annotations On, or it won't be translated correctly.\nI just played through with subtitles, and explained tutorials in the game :)\n\nThis is a story about a girl who gets misunderstood as creepy, so everyone is afraid of her.
