This is a game development log  video for that game. I had limited time to make a game that had to be a simulator. AIR FRYER SIM is a restaurant simulator where you must maintain 10 air fryers and complete the required orders until you waste too much food or have too many orders. I did my best. Can you manage 10 air fryers at once? How many orders can you complete? \n\nPlay it: \nhttps://divagated.itch.io/air-fryer-sim\n\nIt's an Indie game made using Unity and Visual Studio. The art is made in Aseprite. This video is a dev log. Development log. whatever you call it. It's for a game jam. \n\nSong is Aurora by Harris Heller (StreamBeats)\n\nContact me:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevDivagated\u200b\u200b\u200b\nJoin my discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/TCyHkAR\u200b", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOHhLdghHwQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOHhLdghHwQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOHhLdghHwQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOHhLdghHwQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOHhLdghHwQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "MANAGE 10 AIRFRYERS: AIR FRYER SIM DEV LOG", "description": "Alright.
