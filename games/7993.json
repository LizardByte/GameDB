Since they can't come to an agreement, Jack demands a competition to see which cook is the best. The winner would get to serve their food at the party. SpongeBob is adamant on the Krusty Krab winning but he needs help since they don't have much staff. Plankton's cousins want to help him, but since he won't pay them anything, SpongeBob recruits them and tells them that Mr. Krabs will pay if they want to help him in the competition throughout the game, players will play through 5 \"Episodes\", each with a new judge after every 3 workdays, and a new theme for the Krusty Krab. The player will then need to help SpongeBob train a group of Plankton\u2019s cousins to become the best chefs in Bikini Bottom. Throughout the game, the player helps SpongeBob and his friends train them to cook multiple foods like the Krabby Patty, Fried Seaweed Sandwiches, and many more. The player works on a daily schedule to serve a number of customers before being done for the day. Each customer asks for certain orders that players must fulfill by performing several mini-games related to the dish. High-scoring dishes receive larger tips, which can be used to buy more recipes or skills for the plankton helpers.", "summary": "Play as Spongebob in this DS exclusive cooking simulator and help him become the best chef in bikini bottom", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spongebob-vs-the-big-one-beach-party-cook-off", "videos": [{"id": 30862, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "llr5NWZxtgM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llr5NWZxtgM", "title": "SpongeBob vs. The Big One: Beach Party Cook-Off - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/llr5NWZxtgM/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 30863, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "U7UmQQOriqw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7UmQQOriqw", "title": "SpongeBob vs. The Big One: Beach Party Cook-Off (NDS) - Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U7UmQQOriqw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
