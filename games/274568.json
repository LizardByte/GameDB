Each realm boasts its own mythology and mysterious beings, embodiments of their respective worldviews. Amidst these worlds, a hybrid being emerges for the first time, known as The Light of the Darkness.\n\nThe game opens in the aftermath of a brutal battle between the Ophelians (Pales) and Zigardtians (Darks). The Dark troops emerge victorious, capturing the Pale soldiers and civilians for execution in the Cursed Lands, a mystical realm between worlds where death erases one's existence from memory. Sephius, a Pale peasant, follows the trail of the soldiers only to find himself captured by the fearsome Dark General, Aekon, and thrown into a pit with other Pale prisoners. Amidst a pile of corpses, Sephius is reborn as a hybrid, with no memories and striking new features including pale and dark wings.\n\nEmerging from the Pit, Sephius now navigates the desolate, apocalyptic Plains of Death. He gains strength by absorbing essence from corpses, learning new abilities. His journey is fraught with dangers, not least from both Pales and Darks who continue their war, and the ferocious beasts of this realm. Misunderstood and attacked by all, Sephius begins to explore the Death Plains, not only to survive but also to uncover powerful secrets about his own mysterious history. This quest for self-discovery leads him to confrontations and alliances that challenge his perceptions and force him to question his true purpose and identity in this divided world.", "summary": "A captivating dark fantasy action RPG featuring rich-visual biomes, an intriguing narrative, and a challenging Souls-like combat.\nPlayers experience unique and epic aerial combats and exploration with a winged protagonist and absorb essence from others to grab their essence and natures.
