This game features mostly dark and disturbing themes and has a rather unusual soundtrack, consisting of metal and trance tracks in contrast to calm piano music. It stars a girl with messy hair named Inahoozuki and a silver haired child named Ginmokusei.\n\nLike most traditional fangames, the objective is to explore dream worlds and collect effects. There are six endings to find, three for each character.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/de-i-cide"}
