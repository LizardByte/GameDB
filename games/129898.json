Though your efforts are marred by being the last survivor of the bloody massacre, you are nevertheless hailed as a hero. Surely that entitles you to some well deserved R&R, right? Not if those demonic bastards have anything to say about it. Landing on Earth following your discharge, you open your pod to a world of fire and blood as the demons have invaded your homeworld. With everyone being killed or mutated to extinction, it\u2019s up to you to do what you do best: kick some demon ass, stop this invasion and save the world. Armed with your ever trusty shotgun, chainsaw and BFG 9000, you must once again do battle with Hell\u2019s spawn and find a way to save Earth. But that\u2019s not all. Once you\u2019ve cleaned up this mess, there are 20 more bloodied levels waiting for you in the Master Levels for Doom II. With no-where left to hide and a legion of demons, mutants and the undead wanting your head, there\u2019s only one thing left to do - don your armor, grab the nearest shotgun and blast your fragging way out of here! \n \nThe highly anticipated sequel to DOOM, this GOG release brings not only DOOM II, but also introduces the Master Levels for DOOM II. Twenty never-before-seen levels all with the same acid drenched, hell spawned horror of the originals. Each was created by independent designers and supervised by the demented minds of id Software. You might as well forget about seeing the light of day ever again.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
