It ran from November 11, 2006 to 2009 and was replaced by Weekly Toro Station. There was also a version for the PlayStation Portable called Mainichi Issho Portable. Trial versions of both the PSP and PS3 versions can be found on the original Japanese version of Toro! Let's Party!.\n\nAfter the service ended in 2009, the console version was made inaccessible, although the PSP version is still playable in a limited form. The console version can also be played in a limited form offline through emulation by forcing a PlayStation Network connection, although all its online features are inaccessible.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mainichi-issho", "videos": [{"id": 87644, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2daujcGl1O8"}, {"id": 87645, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zkYSe67WGHk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkYSe67WGHk", "title": "Mainichi Issyo PlayStation 3 Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zkYSe67WGHk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
