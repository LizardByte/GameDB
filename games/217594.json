Set in the late 19th century, Japan is facing the darkest of times as it struggles with its oppressive rulers and deadly diseases while western influence permeates as civil war continues to rage between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Anti-Shogunate factions.\n\nHere in this time of mayhem, you embody a Ronin character, a warrior bound to no master and free to make choices of its own. Rise of the Ronin is a new Team Ninja experience that will immerse you in an historically inspired world while bringing together its renowned combat action with Katanas and the likes, with new firearm weaponry that depicts the unique personality of its time period.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 74658, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "0gwsQvDGh4o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gwsQvDGh4o", "title": "Rise of the Ronin - State of Play Sep 2022 Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0gwsQvDGh4o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
