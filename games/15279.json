Yes, the cult-classic returns with all the fast-paced action you expect from the franchise, mixed with modern visuals and multi-player online experiences.\n\nThe sixth Magical Drop game was developed by French independent studio Golgoth and published by UTV Ignition for Steam in 2012. Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network ports were announced, but ultimately never materialized. The game features a much smaller selection of characters, omits items, and removes Puzzle Mode; however, it adds new online gameplay modes. Characters from the cancelled Data East puzzle game Ghostlop are introduced; these three characters use Ghostlop gameplay instead of traditional Magical Drop mechanics.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magical-drop-v", "videos": [{"id": 13379, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "luWd0zspsqc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luWd0zspsqc", "title": "Magical Drop V - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/luWd0zspsqc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 55, "name": "Unknown"}]}
