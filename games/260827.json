It also remixes the original stages of SR6 LA into new ones to make it more interesting and not feel the complete same.\n\nIn this hack you play again as Luigi like SR6, but this time the paintings inside of Peach's Castle are getting messed up by a huge flower that appeared out of nowhere outside of the castle. You can find 9 main courses in this hack + 2 boss levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-revenge-6-dot-5-wrath-of-the-dim-flower"}
