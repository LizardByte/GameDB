Players control with two-way joystick and three buttons with different hit levels. Each for creating different level attacks. Like in Data East's Karate Champ, buttons must be held. If they are released, the players' characters will revert to their standing animation. Moves can be defended against by intercepting the players' opponents' weapons with the players'.\n\nThe object of the game is to land a hit on the opponent or push him/her off the mat to score a point. There are fifteen levels with three different modes. The first three are fencing, the next five are kendo, and the final seven are gladiator-based. After clearing all levels in one mode, the \"VICTORY SCORE\" will be added to the players' scores, even if any of them was tied with their opponents at the end. After fifteen levels are completed, the players start over in a higher difficulty setting and repeat after the next fifteen levels are also cleared. There are also bonus levels where players must deflect arrows to score extra points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/great-swordsman", "videos": [{"id": 129338, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7xgeKHMGJ5U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xgeKHMGJ5U", "title": "Arcade Game: Great Swordsman (1984 Taito)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7xgeKHMGJ5U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
