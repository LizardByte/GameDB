You fly your ship through various waves of different types of enemy ships similar to those found in Defender - i.e. there is a baiter-type, pods, swarmers, landers (except that they don't land). There is also an added feature of an energy balloon; blast this twelve times and your firepower is increased. Your armament initially consists of a Defender style laser system. A function carried over from the sequel to Defender - Stargate - has also been included, inviso-flight. This makes you temporarily invisible and immune to enemy attack. The ship can go in four directions, and re-trace its steps to get an enemy that has been missed. You also have a long range radar scope to see what's coming up, and what's been left behind.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/videos-revenge"}
