Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament: the American Sports Team, now replaced by the \"Rival Team\" consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from Fatal Fury: King of Fighters), and Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2). Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo's father, appears as a fighter for the first time (having made a non-playable cameo in KOF '94) as a computer-controlled sub-boss character. After defeating Saisyu in the arcade mode, it is revealed that Saisyu was being brainwashed and that Rugal will fight once again as a boss character, but as an enhanced version named \"Omega Rugal\".", "summary": "The King of Fighters '95 is a 1995 fighting game produced by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home console.
