During adventure mode, you can check certain predefined locations and speak with characters you meet, sometimes selecting your answer during conversation. Sometimes during the story, the girls in Hinata apartments will ask you quiz questions about the Love Hina anime. The action mode in the game is done via four different mini-games which, unlike the adventure mode, use 3rd-person perspective.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/love-hina-party"}
