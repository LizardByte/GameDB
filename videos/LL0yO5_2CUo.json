{"id": "LL0yO5_2CUo", "snippet": {"title": "Math Snacks - Game Over Gopher Gameplay", "description": "Hungry gophers are after the prized carrot! Defend the carrot by placing units on a coordinate grid. Game Over Gopher is an exciting tower defense game that guides students in plotting coordinate pairs, differentiating negative coordinates from positive coordinates, and identifying the four quadrants. To introduce students to the coordinate grid, Game Over Gopher introduces new skills via interactive tutorials and uses consistent visual clues (e.g., x red, y blue) to guide players in plotting coordinates. The game lowers intimidation about the coordinate grid, helps students understand how positive and negative numbers reflect each other across the axes, and helps students get comfortable with the four quadrants. A finalist in the 2012 Serious Games Showcase & Challenge.\n\nTo play Game Over Gopher: http://mathsnacks.com/game-over-gopher-en.html\nFor more Math Snacks, see http://mathsnacks.org\n\n\u00a9 2014 NMSU Board of Regents.
