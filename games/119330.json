Twenty years have passed since society collapsed during the 80s and 90s, and mankind helped itself into oblivion by fighting each other, instead of focusing on the Snowbreed.\nA lesson well-learned for the survivors, who realized that the rules of modern civilization no longer mattered and finding a new way of life was necessary. One of humanity\u2019s last bastions, The Line, is based in an abandoned subway station in Downtown Los Angeles. It serves as a base of operations for the Harvest Runners, an organized division of combat-ready civilians to not just defend against the undead snowbreed, but harvest them together.\nThe snowbreed carry a substance inside their bodies that humanity has been using since the Fall to stay alive. It is the evolutionary irony that the one thing that turns humans into snowbreed is what they also need to survive. In controlled doses, it\u2019s what keeps their bodies functioning in the freezing cold; without it, they will freeze up and turn. Beyond that, that same substance is used for other purposes, such as raw fuel, refined into power cells for electronics and vehicles. In order for humanity to move forward, the snowbreed must be harvested. And that\u2019s where you come in.\n\nAfter spending years as an independent scavenger, barely surviving on your own, you find yourself in an abandoned base. Things aren\u2019t as bad as they were during the Fall, but then again; there is hardly anyone left anymore to make it as bad until an incoming radio transmission wakes you up.", "summary": "From the creators of the hit VR shooter Arizona Sunshine comes an epic multiplayer VR action FPS with seamless, co-operative gameplay at its core that pits up to four players against a vast, hostile VR world in a raging fight for survival.\n\nSet in the ice-covered ruins of LA nearly 20 years after the apocalypse, After the Fall combines a living, breathing VR world shared with players from all over the world, a cinematic and atmospheric campaign, action-packed solo and multiplayer gameplay, and endgame built from the ground up for VR.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 61439, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "k0UCPkB6WOA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0UCPkB6WOA", "title": "After the Fall | Launch Trailer [ESRB]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k0UCPkB6WOA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 61440, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "FnReoRcibgg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnReoRcibgg", "title": "After the Fall | Cross-platform Gameplay Showcase [ESRB]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FnReoRcibgg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 61441, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "JSmx9LhZ4pg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSmx9LhZ4pg", "title": "After the Fall \u00ae | Skid Row Gameplay [ESRB]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JSmx9LhZ4pg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77958, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kPh_3R6TioA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh_3R6TioA", "title": "After the Fall - Closer Look | PS VR2 Games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kPh_3R6TioA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
