The dwarves discovered power stones while mining deep in the mountain. They used them to power machines and, eventually, entire cities. They lived in peace and prosperity for centuries.\n\nOver time they became infatuated with power stones and dug deeper to find more. One day they dug too deep and unleashed the Gloomdark Hordes, an army of trolls and monstrous creatures. Once the dwarves realized that trolls turned to stone in the sunlight, they fled far from the mountain and found refuge on the sunny Hills of Brekka.\n\nCenturies passed and, over time, the dwarves forgot their traditions and abandoned craftsmanship and innovation in favor of warring and raiding. History became myth, and myth became bedtime stories. But whispers of a long forgotten darkness echo throughout the valley of the great mountain. It can be heard in the Snoring Forest, by those who dare to enter...", "summary": "Dwerve is a Zelda-like action tower defense RPG where you play as a dwarven tinkerer that uses turrets and traps to fight.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dwerve", "videos": [{"id": 40205, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ViWCGsTTHZE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViWCGsTTHZE", "title": "Dwerve - Kickstarter Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ViWCGsTTHZE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118385, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Qp3Jn077GhE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp3Jn077GhE", "title": "Dwerve - Gameplay | Android Apk iOS #dwerve #newgame #gameviewtrending #trending #bestgame #rpg", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qp3Jn077GhE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
