The mother computer \"Maxis\", which controls the whole Second One's Home was completed in advance. Howerever, some control problems had been left which was solved two years later. Since then peaceful days have continued.\n\nThe incident happen as if the peaceful days were laughed at mockingly. The first incident was \"anxiety\". It was that \"Kirishima\", who as the leader of the \"One's Home Project\" dissappeared. The Second One's Home tried to hush up the incident, while the NUN side tried to intervene in it. However, the action ended in failure by some powerful people, and the incident of Kirishima's disappearence was concealed.\n\nThe second incident was \"resistance\". The affair of terrorism occurred at Universe Port \"SUS\". Since there is no statement for the offense, it was treated as in discriminate terrorism. However, the criminal's true character has not yet been captured...\n\nThe third incident was \"fear\". three planes for the second platoon of the NUN space force which belonged to the Second One's Home, encountered uncertificated Flying objects, and were shot down. This unknown object was called \"Hughey\". As a clue of this, the NUN Space Force intends to further build up it's forces. This incident might be a warning from space to human beings who left the \"cage\" called Earth.\n\nTime passed, and in February, 2149, the past incident does not mean what it used to.
