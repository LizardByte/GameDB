{"id": "OogFpDIlnqo", "snippet": {"title": "AROUND THE CLOCK AT BIKINI BOTTOM - Official Trailer (2021)", "description": "Squidward's earned his chance to wow a crowd during the Symphony Orchestral performance in Glove World. As Squidward is warming up, he receives a call from Mr. Krabs, warning him about a smelly-smell, the kind of smelly-smell that smells... smelly. All at once, a massive swarm of jellyfish overrun Bikini Bottom, and begin attacking Bikini Bottomites! Oh, the horror!\n\nIt's up to SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs to eradicate the Jellien invasion, and the resulting clones that follow. They'll have to stay one step ahead of the Overlord's advances in order to survive these weird, and rather horrifying, monstrosities that are on the prowl. They've fought robots, bucketheads, and more... surely they can take down some scary Jelliens, right? ...Right?\n\nSigh, better grab some mayo and get to it! I have a feeling tonight's going to be a very long night.\n\nGamejolt \u25ba https://gamejolt.com/games/AtC_BB/587340\n\nItch.io \u25ba https://dave-microwaves-games.itch.io/around-the-clock-at-bikini-bottom\n\nSpecial thanks to Padre Snowmizzle for making the trailer \u25ba https://twitter.com/PadreSnowmizzle\n\n\nGet Dave.EXE + more over on my Patreon! \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/DaveMicrowavesGames\n\n\nMy Twitter! \u25ba https://twitter.com/The_Toonimator\n\n\nMy Website! \u25ba https://davemicrowavesgames.wixsite.com/davemicrowavesgames\n\n\nMy Merch! \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/the-microwave-merch-shop\n\n\n#DaveMicrowavesGames #AroundtheClock #AroundtheClockatBikiniBottom", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OogFpDIlnqo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OogFpDIlnqo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OogFpDIlnqo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OogFpDIlnqo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "AROUND THE CLOCK AT BIKINI BOTTOM - Official Trailer (2021)", "description": "Squidward's earned his chance to wow a crowd during the Symphony Orchestral performance in Glove World.
