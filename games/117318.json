Point to a spot on the screen and the python will move to that spot. \n \nWhen Funky eats three of the same colored fruits or insects in a row, they turn orange and are added to his tail. A click of the left mouse button lets him snatch food at a distance with his tongue. As his tail grows longer, it is more challenging to move him across the screen but inches him closer to the end of the level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/funky-python"}
