A year ago from the time this game was set, her mother had died from an illness - her father was a famous wizard who died from saving the kingdom when Parfait was young.\n\nAt the beginning, Parfait introduces herself and tells the player that she is almost at the risk of losing her beloved shop (the only remains of her mother), for Parfait has to pay the debt of 1,000,000G (gold) by 12 months to keep the shop running. As a normal shop, there seems no hope for raising the Black Cat Market's fame.\n\nThe player's motive is to collect this debt by 12 months in various ways such as putting cauldron-made potions to the shop counters for customers, accepting potion orders at the end of the day and sell her potions on the street. As Parfait gains more experience via studying in the library or creating potions, her levels will rise (with a maximum of six stars) which enables her to succeed more on potions that are high-leveled. Many places may trigger the encounter with other important characters whose futures the player must decide by motivating Parfait.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
