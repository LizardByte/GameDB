SANIC!

If you have a high refresh rate monitor you'll need to cap the framerate to 60 yourself with something like RivaTuner otherwise the game will run faster than it's supposed to, and there are a handful of other rough edges throughout, like inconsistent resolutions for cutscenes (with some using pillarboxing which, hilariously, doesn't -quite- reach the top of the screen).\n\nIt's still a convenient way to play SA2, however, which for someone who grew up in PAL-land is something I'm grateful for.\n\n---\n\n0:00:00 Opening Cutscene\n0:02:04 City Escape\n0:05:07 vs. Big Foot\n0:08:32 Wild Canyon\n0:10:22 vs. Dr. Eggman 1\n0:11:38 Prison Lane\n0:15:40 Metal Harbour\n0:17:54 vs. Shadow 1\n0:18:43 Green Forest\n0:22:12 Pumpkin Hill\n0:27:16 Mission Street\n0:31:04 Aquatic Mine\n0:34:16 Route 101\n0:39:24 Hidden Base\n0:42:51 Pyramid Cave\n0:47:01 Death Chamber\n0:52:22 vs. King Boom Boo\n0:56:22 vs. Egg Golem\n1:01:18 Eternal Engine\n1:06:27 Meteor Herd\n1:09:52 vs. Rouge\n1:12:50 Crazy Gadget\n1:20:38 vs. Dr. Eggman 2\n1:22:20 Final Rush\n1:27:28 vs. Shadow 2\n1:29:43 Credits - It Doesn't Matter\n1:33:53 Iron Gate\n1:38:33 vs. Hot Shot\n1:41:30 Dry Lagoon\n1:42:54 Sand Ocean\n1:47:34 Radical Highway\n1:52:35 Egg Quarters\n1:55:16 Lost Colony\n2:03:08 Weapons Bed\n2:07:05 vs. Tails 1\n2:07:35 Security Hall\n2:11:25 vs. Flying Dog\n2:13:04 White Jungle\n2:16:01 vs. Sonic 1\n2:22:10 Route 280\n2:25:44 Sky Rail\n2:29:39 vs. Egg Golem\n2:32:22 Mad Space\n2:36:24 vs. Knuckles\n2:40:18 Cosmic Wall\n2:49:42 vs. Tails 2\n2:52:20 Final Chase\n2:58:07 vs. Sonic 2\n3:00:12 Credits - Throw it All Away\n3:10:14 Cannon's Core\n3:21:58 vs. The Biolizard\n3:27:50 vs. The Final Hazard\n3:31:16 Credits - Ending/Live and Learn\n3:36:06 Kart Race - Beginner\n3:38:29 Kart Race - Standard\n3:41:23 Kart Race - Expert\n3:45:08 Green Hill", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EU4CbUoPBi4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EU4CbUoPBi4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EU4CbUoPBi4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EU4CbUoPBi4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EU4CbUoPBi4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (HD) playthrough ~Longplay~", "description": "This is a playthrough of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle for PC, including the Hero, Dark, and Last stories, as well as the Kart Race minigame and the secret unlockable final stage (timestamps below).\n\nSANIC AVENSHURE TOOOOOOOOOO!
