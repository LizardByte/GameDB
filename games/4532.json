The survivors of the war gather their strength and resources in an attempt to bring Earth back to the way it was. Using a super computer called God System, the survivors start their first step in rebuilding Earth by having the God System create machines capable cleaning and reconstructing much of what has been lost from the war. However, without warning, a mysterious mutant entity known as \"N\" takes over the God System; creating three strange guardian statues based on Greek mythological figures, N manipulates the God System's machines and programs in order to attack mankind. The survivors create an artificial human called Yukiwo \u2013 built to harness perfect dexterity and strength \u2013 as well as a super-powered jet for him to pilot in order to reclaim Earth from N.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/master-of-weapon"}
