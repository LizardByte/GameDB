This is no speedrun as I tried to show a few hidden areas. I think I may have missed on energy ball too.\n\nI hope to see the Pinnacle of what md is capable of in Vectorman 2 as one of the last games released on the system. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcL_kM9twZk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcL_kM9twZk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcL_kM9twZk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NcL_kM9twZk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [168] Vectorman", "description": "http;//www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by MadMatty\n\nOne of the best platform/shooters on the genesis.
