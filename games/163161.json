This implies that you might join in the middle of a round, but as rounds are short and each question is only up for 30 seconds, it's not long before there is a new question to a leaderboard to view. Between questions and at the end of a round, the top 20 players are displayed. Players are scored on accuracy and time. For every second that you delay in answering your total possible score lowers."}
