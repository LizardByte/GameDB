Break the computer code to launch your missiles, then guide your interceptors before enemy missiles converge with your cities. This is a game in two parts. The first part plays a lot like a sliding block puzzle. You are given a figure in a 3 x 3 grid to match. Using the joystick and fire button, you rotate pieces in a larger grid to try to match the smaller figure. If you do that, you can select a missile launch site. Eventually, the enemy will launch its own missiles. You position your crosshair at the radar dot for the enemy missile, and can then launch an intercepter. This part of the game is more action-oriented as you \"fly\" your intercepter to take down the enemy nuke.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/computer-war", "videos": [{"id": 112224, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZE6FzK61758", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE6FzK61758", "title": "Computer War for the Atari 8-bit family", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZE6FzK61758/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
