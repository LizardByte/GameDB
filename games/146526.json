Bison, Charlie Nash awakens in a tomb and is instructed by a woman called Helen to retrieve an item from his old friend Guile that will help him destroy Bison. Meanwhile, the Shadaloo organization starts their secret plan called \"Operation C.H.A.I.N.S\" by launching seven artificial satellites in orbit known as the \"Black Moons\". Rashid infiltrates the Shadaloo main base looking for a friend who was kidnapped by them but is discovered and defeated by F.A.N.G, who steals a chess piece-like item in his possession and uses it to detonate one of the Black Moons, triggering a high altitude electromagnetic pulse that strikes New York City into chaos.\n\nAfter attempting to stop M. Bison and his subordinates in New York with no success, Guile and Chun-Li are attacked by Charlie, who attempts to take the pieces that were sent to them, and he flees soon after. Charlie then reunites with Helen, who also convinces Rashid and Juri to form and alliance with them to retrieve the pieces in order to stop Operation C.H.A.I.N.S after revealing that they contain the keys to control the Black Moons, and were sent to certain individuals in order to prevent them from being used, while Shadaloo's objective is to use the Moons to spread fear and despair around the world's populace, which is the source of Bison's Psycho Power, and they intend to siphon this energy in order to render him and his forces invincible. In possession of the same information, Karin Kanzuki summons warriors from around the globe to help gather the pieces before Shadaloo as well. All of them answer to Karin's call, except Ryu, who stays behind for a while to train further in order to keep his Satsui no Hadou at bay by Ken's suggestion.\n\nAs the warriors travel the world in search for the pieces, they are time and again attacked by Necalli, an ancient Aztec fighting god that appears in times of crisis to challenge the strongest living fighters in order to devour their souls, as well as by Shadaloo's minions and dolls. In one of those fights, Cammy manages to defeat and capture her sister Decapre, but knowing that she was just being brainwashed by Shadaloo, she refuses to surrender her to the police and flees with her with Juri's help instead. Once gathering all remaining pieces and more allies along the way, the warriors storm Shadaloo's base and successfully manage to deactivate the Black Moons, but fail to defeat M. Bison and their forces, having no option but to retreat. However, F.A.N.G threatens a young girl among the programmers that were kidnapped and forced to create the Black Moons to alter their course to have them fall on Earth instead, striking six main cities around the globe in 24 hours, in order to cause enough havoc to gather the Psycho Power they need nonetheless.", "summary": "Download the cinematic story DLC \u201cA Shadow Falls\u201d today for FREE!
