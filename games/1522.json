This region is inhabited by various Pok\u00e9mon, and unlike before, none of those available prior to Generation V can be obtained before completing the main story by defeating Team Plasma.\nThe games' names were revealed on the official Japanese Pok\u00e9mon website on April 9, 2010, and scans from the subsequent issue of the magazine leaked the following day, April 10.\nPok\u00e9mon Black and White are followed in 2012 by two sequels, Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2, which are set two years after the events of Black and White.
