The games are selected by pressing any direction of the joystick while their names are displayed on screen.\n\nIn the 8-ball game, the winner is the first player to sink either one of the two black balls in game.\n\nIn Rotation, the black balls are replaced by colored ones, and the winner is the player to sink the most balls. By sinking one ball, the player gets the chance to try another shot. There are no penalties for missing the balls or sinking the white one.\n\nPlayers can choose the direction of the shot (by rotating the cue around the white ball) and the strength of the shot (the longer the action button is pressed, the harder the shot is)."}
