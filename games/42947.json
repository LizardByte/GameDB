Gripped by fear and with tensions in the group running high, you\u2019ll be forced to make snap decisions that could mean life or death for everyone involved. Every choice you make while playing as each of the eight friends -- even the seemingly trivial ones -- will carve out your own unique story. \n \nSpine-tingling performances from a Hollywood cast including Hayden Panettiere are brought to life with the power of PlayStation 4 -- your actions alone will decide who survives Until Dawn. \n \nThe Extended Edition included a different game cover and a new exclusive scene.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}]}
