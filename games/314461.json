This game is intentionally difficult and confusing at some points, though the mechanics are pretty simple, once you learn how to move propperly, you will notice it isn't enough for you to overcome it, you must as well have patience and be persistent, then you may be able to reach the end. This journey depends completly on you, so don't give up, and remember, it can always get worse.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hexahedral"}
