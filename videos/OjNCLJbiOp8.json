Even from the very beginning, they showed an exceptional amount of talent among Doujin circles, with QoH98 featuring nice pixel art, smooth animation, an excellent soundtrack, and simple but competitive gameplay that takes elements of \"The King of Fighters\" (dodging, naming), \"Asuka 120%\" (clash system) and the \"Capcom Vs. Series\" (air combo mechanics). The characters are based on Leaf's popular \"To Heart\" series with three hidden characters (one of which is Yuki Morikawa from Leaf's \"White Album\") who become playable by clearing the game's highest difficulty and with the \"Osage.EXE\" patch installed.\n\nThe game has a free-flowing combo system for basic attacks and certain special attacks, but the game is more about telegraphing attacks than being exceptional at combinations -- since attacks can easily be clashed, the key is breaking through an opponent's offense and being relentless is key, as the game has a guard gauge which can quickly be whittled away for players who like to turtle. While there are some familiar movesets to be found (as is the case with most Doujin fighters), characters do have a few moves unique to them and they play to the character's personalities pretty well. The characters also have a variety of super moves at their disposal.\n\nIf I had to leverage any criticisms towards the game, it would be that the game is not recommended for use with controllers with analogs, as it doesn't register inputs as well as a d-pad, and key binding is a nightmare as the game goes haywire for some reason if you try to use external programs like \"JoyToKey\", so use older pre-analog USB controllers or keyboard controls for this one. The characters have different illustrations when you beat the game, but no actual endings. Overall, it's a great first effort. This title is available from a variety of locations as abandonware.
