All the greats started as interns and you\u2019ve only got seventeen cycles to prove that you belong in the newsroom.\n\nWe\u2019re assigning you stories that put the hyper in hyper-local news! On any given cycle choose to cover shuttle crashes, intersolar cat shows, even space ghost funerals. It\u2019s up to you!\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your assignment, head to the shuttle bay and blast off for intern adventures!! That means interviewing sources, digging up clues and investigating the scene. We hope your conversational circuits are well oiled as you earn or betray the trust of more than 100 characters and ask a lot of questions.\n\nThere\u2019s always more than meets the eye, and the more information you can gather, the more equipped you'll be.\n\nAt the end of each assignment, it\u2019s time to file your story.\n\nUse the Build-a-Story tool to construct your article using all that info you gathered. Depending on who you interviewed, the choices you made and how deep you dug, you\u2019ll have different options to work with for your story\u2014you were a diligent reporterbot and managed to get ALL the info, weren\u2019t you?\n\nYour choices impact the quality and tone of the story and how both your editors and readers will react to it. Over time, the choices in each story start to shape the reputation and popularity of a holopaper. So hey, no pressure!\n\nDesigned and written by former journalists, this is almost exactly how real journalism is done. Except with aliens.\n\nThe staff at Times & Galaxy all live and work together on the Scanner, a sprawling, spacebound newsroom.\n\nBetween assignments, you\u2019ll have the chance to get to explore the Scanner and get to know a diverse and colorful crew of more than twenty crewmates including your fellow reporters, the editorial staff, pilots and ship\u2019s crew.\n\nThe staff come from all over the system, where you\u2019ll find Humans, Augers, Verge, Xeel and of course, Robos.\n\nEveryone has their own thing going on and they\u2019ve always got something to say. They\u2019ll react to you in all sorts of expected, and unexpected, ways depending on your choices.\n\nThe Scanner is more than just a newsroom. It\u2019s where you sleep, eat, work and relax.\n\nAfter recharging your literal batteries in your bunk you might take a moment to recharge your emotional ones in the Garden, home to many species of plants from all over the system. Or at least it used to be. Find seeds to restore the green space to its former glory!", "summary": "Embark on an interplanetary adventure as the first robo reporter for the Times & Galaxy, the solar system's most trusted holopaper.
