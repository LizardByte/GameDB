Which side will you choose?\n\nBattle through two distinct, narrative-driven campaigns, from the points of view of two different factions: one campaign puts you in control of a Blood Angels squad, which you will customise and upgrade as you progress, while the other puts you in control of the Genestealers for the first time in a Space Hulk game!\n\nSpace Hulk: Tactics is based on the rules of the popular board game, given a fresh new spin in the form of the unique Card system. Cards give more ways to customize your squad before a match, and allow you to turn the tides of battle with abilities that trigger game-changing effects when used at the right moment.\n\nTest your skills against other players in the expansive online competitive multiplayer, letting you command a swarm of Genestealers or a custom squad of different unit types from one of four Space Marine Chapters \u2013 the Blood Angels, the Space Wolves, the Ultramarines, and the Dark Angels. Multiplayer modes and tools offer a rich and deep online experience, and include an intuitive map creation tool, which gives players everything they need to create original maps with custom objective, and share them with other players to play either online or against the AI, all from within the game!\"", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 22404, "name": "Genestealer Trailer", "video_id": "hcFPQiuheoE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcFPQiuheoE", "title": "Space Hulk: Tactics - Genestealer Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hcFPQiuheoE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 22405, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9XqsoGJNXsA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XqsoGJNXsA", "title": "Space Hulk: Tactics - Overview Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9XqsoGJNXsA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 22406, "name": "Overview Trailer", "video_id": "OPdzi824Hto", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPdzi824Hto", "title": "Space Hulk: Tactics - Overview Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OPdzi824Hto/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
