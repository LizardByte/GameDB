The power of the human race grew. However, with power comes corruption. With corruption comes imbalance. With imbalance comes unrest. With unrest comes war.\n\nPlay as Captain Junius Fahrenheit, a soldier of the United Terran Vanguard onboard the state-of-the-art ship, the Sierra, as him and his crew are thrown into humanity\u2019s first interplanetary war. Tasked to protect Earth and free its colonies from under the Ares Confederacy of Mars\u2019 grasp, there\u2019s no question that he must fight to protect everything he stands for\u2026\n\nBut what exactly is it he stands for? Who is right? Who is wrong? Does it even matter?
