Sam would've stayed in L.A. to investigate Hayley's murder due it's possible connection to Tull.\n\nTogether, the trail would have lead her and Dave to a decadent secret cult of the Hollywood elite... a cult they would have to infiltrate. The cult would be based on an obscure series of Fantasy novels from the 70's, led by the series' reclusive author. Hayley was a member of the cult, and was killed because they were concerned she would flip in jail.\n\nHer killer, the primary enforcer of the cult, would have been a massive murderous cultist called The Beast, who had had surgery to be redone as a monster from the novels.\n\nThe final showdown would have involved saving a bunch of hostages from him, and the story would have branched differently depending on the reader's previous choices.\n\nIn the end, Sam and Dave would have shared a kiss, and Sam would have taken a permanent position in the LAPD homicide unit alongside Dave.", "summary": "Most Wanted, Book 2 is the second book of the Most Wanted series.
