Who needs that. Just mow down enemies and parry projectiles to fill up the meter and then use your powers to cause even more destruction, or heal yourself if you need it.\n\nLots of enemies and bosses with unique attack patterns and behaviors.\n\nSome platforming and deathly traps. When there are no enemies around, the environment will become the enemy.\n\nMetal soundtrack, catchy melodies and riffs. Not humming them will be impossible.\n\nMade with Godot Engine, inspired by modern Doom.\n\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/chairmanmcchair", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KjkqsjUivKA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KjkqsjUivKA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KjkqsjUivKA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Last Mind Standing - Trailer | Out on STEAM now", "description": "STEAM page link \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/\napp/3071100/Last_Mind_Standing/\n\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\n\nLast Mind Standing is a FPS inspired by modern Doom but with my own twist.\n\nLeft hand: Powers.\nRight hand: Weapons.\nLeg: Melee (and Parry!)\nYou can use all of them at once.\n\nAmmo?
