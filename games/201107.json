The goal of the project is be mostly accurate to the original game as well as add very minor improvements for that extra bit of polish. Think of this mod as being an enhanced version of Doom 64 for GZDoom. We have Doom 64 EX, Doom 64 Absolution TC, GZDoom64, and Brutal Doom 64. Why you ask? I was personally dissatisfied with the quality of the GZDoom64 project, and Brutal Doom 64 (while it is a great improvement) is along the same lines but changes too much and deviates from the original Doom 64 experience. And thus, this project was born.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doom-64-retribution", "videos": [{"id": 68049, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "68tRsfMySMg"}]}
