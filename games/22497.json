You'll get a real taste of power and money, but it's not going to be easy. You'll also have to deal with all the responsabilities and headaches that come with such a prestigious position.\n\nYour decisiveness will be sorely tested: Do you need to form price cartels or engage in cutthroat competition? Can you react to a competitor's advertising \"blitz\" before you lose the competitive edge? Will you decide to automate your factories in order to cut production costs and risk labor's wrath? How will you handle labor demands during profitable years? What steps will you take when productivity declines during recessions?\n\nThe proverbial buck certainly stops with you. But think of the rewards! Do your job right and you may make megabucks!\n\nDeveloped by two professionals - one in systems simulation and the other with a master's degree in business administration - C&C provides a full range of options, from an easy-to-play game for beginners to an advanced version that'll stump even experienced businessmen. This game is so much fun you may overlook its use as a superb educational tool.\n\nDesigned for one to six players - with the computer playing up to five positions if you want - CARTELS & CUTTHROATS will prepare you to take on the \"real world\"!", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cartels-and-cutthroats", "videos": [{"id": 102578, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0wzZW4VQUjA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wzZW4VQUjA", "title": "cartels & cutthroats gameplay (PC Game, 1985)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0wzZW4VQUjA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
