Team Z2 is quite pleased to announce their next character release to be used in Hyper DBZ; Gotenks! This character is the largest so far; not in stature (Gotenks is small!) but in terms of how much heat he's packing. He's got it all! Ghost clones, Entrapment balls, Transformations...(and AI!) the list goes on. You're gonna love it!\nGet him here: http://network.mugenguild.com/balthazar/char_gotenks.html\n\nFor those who previously added Super Buu to their HDBZ build; it'll work the same for Gotenks. Just add his folder to the 'chars' folder and add his name to the character roster in the 'select' file located in the 'data' folder of HyperDBZ.\n\nCongratulations to Daeron, who's worked on all of the stages in the game, as well as on a handful of smaller characters. Now, his first true character has been released! You can support Daeron's pixel work on his Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DaeronRedFire\n\nCoding is done by JustNoPoint, who previously coded the green beast; Piccolo. The rest of Team Z2 has put in the work and effort as well to bring you our first fusion character. Special thanks to the lovely lads on the HyperDBZ Discord channel and in particular our batch of beta testers who took Gotenks on an exhilarating test session for the last few months!\n\nThe custom voice for Gotenks was recorded and edited by PM Seymour. The metal cover of the Hyper DBZ Title Theme (originally composed by WizzyWhipItWonderful) was made by Ray Casarez. It was the winner of our small Hyper DBZ Title Theme Cover Contest. Follow Ray on Twitter at RayCasarezMusic. And hey even if we have no contests running; we ALWAYS appreciate more covers of our title theme, it's brilliant to hear and we love the tributes!\n\nCharacter files include special Maximilian Dood art by Daeron and a movelist for Gotenks.

This is a free fan game; we make no revenue in any way and the download to our game and characters is free. Our game runs on the freeware M.U.G.E.N. engine.\n\nYou can find our characters at my site at mugenguild or on links I give with my videos; any other download you find might have been edited or might not be up to date.\n\nSome of our previous characters have been updated to make sure that Gotenks works better with them, preventing the game from bugging.
