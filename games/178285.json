Their sun is going supernova, and they need your help to build up their city and find a way to escape the impending solar disaster!\n\nEver dreamed of creating your dream house in an out-of-this-world setting? In Spacefolk City citizens inhabit a solar system where the sun is close to going supernova and it is up to you to create a city for all of those who are fleeing their homes!\n\nSolar flares and other dangerous activities have resulted in the destruction of Spacefolk settlements around the system, leaving many Spacefolk without a home. Stranded citizens are brought to your new settlement and you must help them build a new city and eventually construct a solution to allow everyone to escape the danger of their dying sun.\n\nBut hey, that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be a boring job!\n\nThe Spacefolk are lovely citizens and all want to have a good time. They have different backstories and talents, and they\u2019d love to contribute to your efforts of making a new home for them. It\u2019s up to you to create a spacious space\u2026 in outer space!\n\nSpacefolk all have interests that are indicated by their body type. By building homes and facilities that are decorated with items matching Folks\u2019 Interests, you can make them happy. Happy Folks perform their roles around the city more efficiently, and can also make use of special abilities unique to each species.\n\nEach Spacefolk has different abilities that you\u2019ll need to utilize creatively to ensure their survival. Spruce up the place with items matching each of their interests to keep them happy, and maximize their roles around the city to create a delightful little community!\n\nWhy limit your city building to a flat surface! Enjoy the spatial advantages of VR and construct your city in free-space, adding buildings on top and underneath. Be sure to make the most of all the silly things you can decorate your city with too, so your Folk remain happy and productive. Cooperate with your Folk and work your way toward a solution to their solar crisis!", "summary": "Spacefolk City is a funky, casual take on the city building genre.
