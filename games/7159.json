Toxins in the air poisoned the land and water, and earth's warped axis even robbed us of time. The human race, unable to adapt to the changes brought by such harsh environmental destruction, rapidly began to die out as a species.\n\nThose that survived created Basel, a gigantic structure embedded beneath the earth, designed to purify the atmosphere and normalize the environment. Little by little, life began to reassert itself as people formed civilizations around Basel, but as more and more people withdrew into this tiny world constructed by man, they came to repeat the mistakes of the past... Thus begins the story of a world nearing it's end, and the intertwining fates of those who inhabit it.", "summary": "In this sci-fi rpg you will follwo the three protagonists - Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron - as they form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel.
