There are three doors from which boulders are coming, bouncing down the mine-shafts; every time Pete destroys one of these he gains 3 points, although the axe wears out after a while and disappears. When two boulders collide, they explode, and out comes either a pick-axe which floats to the bottom of the screen, a key which floats to the top, or nothing. If Pete has no axe, you can either jump over boulders (gaining him 1 point), or get to the bottom of the mine to retrieve a new axe (gaining a 5-point bonus). If he collects a key then he can enter the doors, which lead him to the next level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pickaxe-pete", "videos": [{"id": 10495, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "EFy876HAV4Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFy876HAV4Q", "title": "Pick Axe Pete! -Odyssey 2 - Best Platform Video Games of All Time", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EFy876HAV4Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
