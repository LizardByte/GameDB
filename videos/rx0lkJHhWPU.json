Randomized enemy drops are included too. Additionally, warping via both the Sheikah Slate as well as going inside and outside of shrines will have the chance of getting randomized too. \n\nBut... this was only the beginning part. I aimed to expand the definition of a \u201cRandomizer\u201d for this legendary game... So I built a new system which I named \u201cThe Randomizer Cycle\u201d. This cycle will appear randomly and picks one of many, many options that will change your game on the fly.\n\nThe longer the Randomizer Cycle does not trigger / choose an option, the higher the chance gets which results in a 100% chance eventually.\n\n\nTHE RANDOMIZER CYCLE - LIST OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS IN CATEGORIES:\n\nRandomizer - Spawn:\nThis will make enemies spawn everywhere across Hyrule - these enemies have randomized weapons too. The chosen option can be reverted.\n\nRandomizer - Prohibition:\nWill set prohibitions such as saving, warping, using shrines, eating, drinking, killing time, etc. The chosen option can be reverted.\n\nRandomizer - Time:\nThe time will change on the fly which results in changing of weather, lighting and enemy behaviour (e.g. sleeping) and schedules of NPCs.\n\nRandomizer - Environment:\nWill change the environment such as setting everything on fire (e.g. Volcano Eldin), making it cold (e.g. Hebra Mountains) or hot (Gerudo Desert). Setting a specific so-called \"palette\" can occur too such as the Lost Woods fog (incl. music), complete darkness, sandstorm, etc.\n\nRandomizer - Take Equipment:\nOne of the player's equipment will be taken out of his pouch which can result in dangerous situations and increases the excitement.\n\nRandomizer - Money:\nA random amount of rupees will be either lost or credited to the player.\n\nRandomizer - Damage and Heal:\nCan either damage or heal the player.\n\nRandomizer - Get Item:\nThe player will receive an item. This can include everything such as Small Swords, Large Swords, Spears, Shields, Bows, Armor parts, Fruits, Meat, Insects, Plants, etc.\n\nRandomizer - Warp:\nWill warp the player to different spawn points. This can include warping the player to a different world too. E.g. from normal overworld to divine beast.\n\nThe Cycle will never stop so there are basically unlimited permutations and combinations, additionally to the randomly placed enemies which I cannot calculate.\n\nThere is a \"Goal Mode\" too which will result into awesome Randomizer races between people. This mode will be covered in a separate video.\n\n\nMusic Credits starting at 4:35 \"Hyrule Castle Epic Version\" by L'Orchestra Cin\u00e9matique: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AjK9CQehi0\n\n#Zelda #BreathOfTheWild #DLC", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rx0lkJHhWPU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rx0lkJHhWPU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rx0lkJHhWPU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rx0lkJHhWPU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rx0lkJHhWPU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\u2b50 BRAND-NEW ZELDA BOTW RANDOMIZER!", "description": "Support the Randomizer project now!
