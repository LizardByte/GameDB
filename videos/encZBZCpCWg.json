{"id": "encZBZCpCWg", "snippet": {"title": "O'Riley's Mine Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Al Rubin and published by Datasoft in 1983.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nO'Riley is delving into the depths on a quest for treasure. Unfortunately, a stick of misplaced dynamite blows a hole in the rocks and the mine starts to flood. The player must help O'Riley cut a path through the Earth's crust and collect the valuables hidden therein whilst avoiding the onslaught of rushing water and monsters let into the cave system.\n\nAlthough simple enough in concept, the game is exceptionally challenging, particular on the later levels. The real danger in the game is the water, which will rise to the highest level that you have tunnelled. The best strategy that I found is to dig to the bottom of the mine as quickly as possible and work horizontally and then vertically whilst ensuring that you don't end up digging yourself into a dead end or touching the water.\n\nHaving said all this, the game actually randomises the location of the valuables at the start of each level (and also if you die and have to restart a level). This means that a level can either be relatively easy or a complete nightmare; if the level places items either side of the shaft at the very top then the level becomes much tougher since the water will likely rise and fill the shaft before you can collect items from both sides (of course, I could just be rubbish at the game...).\n\nAnother reason why the game is so difficult at times is due to the fact that playfield scrolls and doesn't fit on a single screen. This prevents the player from formulating a strategy on how best to collect the valuables. Couple with the fact that the level randomises on each attempt, this leads to a lot of trial and error.\n\nAudio-visuals for the game are basic, as is to be expected for a game from 1983. However, there is a certain charm to it and the water effect is quite decent.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the game has no ending. If you make it past level nine, the counter simply changes to ?? and the game continues to infinity and beyond.\n\nDespite being tough, O'Riley's Mine isn't a bad little title and provides an hour's entertainment; don't expect to beat it any time soon though!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/encZBZCpCWg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/encZBZCpCWg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/encZBZCpCWg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/encZBZCpCWg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/encZBZCpCWg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "O'Riley's Mine Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Al Rubin and published by Datasoft in 1983.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nO'Riley is delving into the depths on a quest for treasure.
