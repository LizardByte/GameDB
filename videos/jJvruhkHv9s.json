{"id": "jJvruhkHv9s", "snippet": {"title": "SNES Longplay [375] Slayers (Fan Translation)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nLongplay of game Slayers, a RPG released by Banpresto for Super Famicom only in Japan. It is based on the anime/light novel Slayers, one of Japans most great and successful series of the 90s.\n\nThe protagonist is called Lina Inverse, she is a witch, and is the only character to appear in all incarnations of Slayers. She is a young but powerful (and pretty) sorceress with a love for money and food. \n\nIn this game she has to follow through towns alongside allies who meet on your journey, as the swordsman Gourry, Zelgadis the chimera shaman, the warrior princess Amelia and the copy version of Lina, and more too! Your journey begins when she is on a mission where you try to negotiate with Goblins, but she loses her memories. She does not know who she is, or how to cast any but the most basic spells. Most of the game follows her adventures across different locations in the Slayers world. Gradually, Lina regains her spellcasting abilities and reunites with old friends and acquaintances from the novels. This game have a gameplay similar to Dragon Quest and Phantasy Star. All 2 endings are included (because the game dont end after first ending, have more history with Lina Copy too, which I named Yarita in honor of a friend who always supported me! For you Ylimw).   ;) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jJvruhkHv9s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jJvruhkHv9s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jJvruhkHv9s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [375] Slayers (Fan Translation)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nLongplay of game Slayers, a RPG released by Banpresto for Super Famicom only in Japan.
