The best ending is shown, since I didn't lose any matches. \n\nThis is a great port. It benefits a bit compared to the SNES port from the larger ROM size (it was 40mb compared to the SNES version's 32mb), and has more of the voice samples intact because of it. Who cares it they're a bit distorted? If you're playing a Genesis game, you expect it anyway. The graphics also fare extremely well here - sure, they're lower color than the other ones, but they still look great and animate smoothly. The music is also quite good - it doesn't emulate the arcade version as well as the SNES (mainly because the arcade version was using wavetable synth, which is also used by the SNES, compared to the Genesis' FM synth chip), but I actually prefer the FM music in this version. \n\nIt's also got a load of different modes included, if you like a bit more variety in a fighter than the standard arcade-style 2 out of 3 matches. \n\nYou really can't go wrong with this one. As long as you have a couple of six-button pads and a buddy to beat on, 16-bit fighters don't get much better than this. \n\n________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FOduEcYFR38/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FOduEcYFR38/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FOduEcYFR38/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FOduEcYFR38/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Street Fighter II (Genesis) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1994 Sega Genesis versus fighter, Super Street Fighter II.\n\nPlayed through with Fei Long on the highest difficulty level.
