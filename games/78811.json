Triumph against all these odds and you get 29 more levels of similar gameplay!\n\nThis unremarkable clone is largely known on account of having been included in the second \"Microsoft Entertainment Pack\" for Windows.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rattler-race"}
