He reluctantly explains that a demon lord named Belial has taken custody of his soul and lest the Hunter does what he says then it will be forever damned in Hell. To this end the Hunter has been responsible for the deaths of the rest of his kind by leading the demons to them. \nDeath decides to hunt down Belial at the Hunter's request, once in the heart of his territory Death and the Demon Lord exchange banter. Belial explains that he holds no power over the Hunter's soul, the mere threat was enough to buy his compliance, and doesn't consider the \"measly human\" a threat. With the banter finished the two enter a grueling fight in which Death is victorious. \nDeath returns to the initially relieved Hunter only to inform the now-mortified human that Belial never held any power over his soul, overwhelmed by the grief the Hunter makes one final request of Death, his death to which the Horseman reluctantly complies.", "summary": "The Demon Lord Belial is a DLC for Darksiders II. \nIn the Deathinitive edition, the DLC is unlocked automatically upon finishing the main quest of Shadow's Edge.
