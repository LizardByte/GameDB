Turn your former Fallen adversary into a fearsome ally across new story missions as Venom fights alongside his best frenemy Spider-Man.\n\nBlood-sucking vampyres have infested the sewers beneath New York City, but even they quake in fear at the sight of Venom's pitch-black claws and razor-sharp teeth. With help from the Midnight Suns, Venom is fighting to regain control of his actions and rid NYC of the undead scourge\u2014but unshackling himself from one manipulative demon has attracted the attention of another.\n\nWith fangs bared and tongue writhing in ravenous anticipation, Venom is eager to chew through evildoers, protecting the innocent and feeding his insatiable hunger in the same bite. Use Venom's voracious violence to your advantage and make this brutal antihero an honorary member of the Midnight Suns.\n\nThis content requires Marvel's Midnight Suns to play and is included in the Season Pass.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marvels-midnight-suns-redemption", "videos": [{"id": 84902, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qPOC7uCkoRI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPOC7uCkoRI", "title": "\"Redemption\" - Venom DLC Trailer | Marvel's Midnight Suns", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPOC7uCkoRI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
