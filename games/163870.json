Burn zombies with a flamethrower, shoot them in the face with a sniper rifle, or go berserk with a shotgun!\n\nMake sure you bring enough guns because they will break quickly while you go on missions and kill hordes of zombies. You will be dodging zombies that are crawling out of the ground and jumping at you. If you die while fighting your way towards the zombie boss you will lose all your gear.\n\nIn a world where people are fighting among themselves as well as against hordes of zombies nobody trust anybody now, and people are afraid of getting infected. Penny is traveling alone to find a safe place, and soon she lands in a small camp in the middle of nowhere.
