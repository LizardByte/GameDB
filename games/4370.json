Each bad guy has a big reward on his head. And they're helped by hordes of bandits, gunslingers and horse thieves, so pack loads of lead. Track those rotten skunks through an Indian village, on a steaming locomotive, and down the mean streets of lawless Reechforem Gulch. Occasionally, dynamite is at your disposal, as well as weapon power-ups. But cattle stampedes and sneaky traps could end your adventure in a cloud of dust. Oh, and be sure to carry ointment for your saddle sores because you'll ride horseback in a galloping bonus stage filled with handy items. Ultimately, you must make villainous Sir Richard Rose eat sagebrush. Do so and you'll have lots of money and the townsfolk kissing your boots.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sunset-riders"}
