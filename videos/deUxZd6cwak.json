Defeating the second loop results in achieving the true ending.\n\nA unique gameplay feature is the weapon system; the VF-1 Valkyrie fighters can transform into one of three different modes (Fighter, GERWALK and Battroid) by collecting the corresponding power-up icons, and the attack patterns range from spread shots to a straight laser. Each mode can be powered-up three times by obtaining \"P\" icons and picking up additional mode icons (\"F\", \"G\" or \"B\") unlock alternative \"paths\", providing more firepower and modified attack configurations for the Valkyrie respectively. The Valkyrie can also transform into a fourth mode (Armored Battroid), via a rare item drop that grants an extra armor and attacks using grenades with missiles.\nAfter taking an enemy hit, the armor is expelled and any power-up items collected while armored become bonus points. The Valkyrie fighters are equipped with a number of bombs at the start as well, which obliterates enemies and bullets caught within its blast radius.\n\nIn some occasions, players can pick up a Valkyrie-shaped 1UP icon, which grants an extra life. \nFiring on determined locations is also crucial for reaching high-scores, as certain setpieces in each stages hosts a bonus point items within their scenery, as well as destroying enemies on certain spots. \nThe title employs a respawn system where their ship immediately starts at the location they died at. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the Valkyrie's firepower to its original state, and the game is over once all lives are lost unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/deUxZd6cwak/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/deUxZd6cwak/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/deUxZd6cwak/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/deUxZd6cwak/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/deUxZd6cwak/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Spacefortress Macross Arcade", "description": "Super Spacefortress Macross is a science fiction-themed vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up game that is part of the Macross series. \nThe plot is based on the 1984 anime film,in which the Zentradi alien race invaded the Solar System and waged a war against humanity. \nIn response, the UN Spacy unveils the VF-1 Valkyrie, variable mecha fighters created via reverse-engineering of the alien technology obtained from the SDF-1 Macross, to confront the Zentradi.\n\nThe players control the VF-1 Valkyrie mecha fighters, piloted by Hikaru Ichijyo (1P) and Max (2P), through seven increasingly difficult stages over a constantly scrolling background, populated with an assortment of alien enemy forces and obstacles, and the scenery never stops moving until a boss is reached, which must be fought in order to progress into the next stage.\nAfter completing the last stage, the game loops back to the first stage, with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns.
