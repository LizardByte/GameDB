link to what most of them look like:\nhttp://justinanddennnis.deviantart.com/art/Some-Walt-Disney-Magical-Racing-Tour-Characters-567598947\n\nI even had this idea for a Toon Disney/One Saturday Morning cartoon miniseries, where all these characters are racing each other through the disney parks attractions to win mickey crests that are secretly magical enough grant any wish, which is Tiara Damage wants them and she'd would do magical spells and traps to stop them, kind of like a mix between the beginning shows for the Disney Afternoon and Wacky Races, also each week, the viewers can guess which racer was going to win that week, and if turns out right, you could win prizes including a trip to Walt Disney World, \n\nI even got personalities for the characters:\n\n-Amanda Sparkle: a sweet little girl, who dreams of being a disney princess, mostly because her loving father always calls her \"Heaven's Little Princess\", she is also likes everything neat and pretty and is scared of bugs, and she's also kind of crybaby when ever she gets hurt, sad, or scared\n-Baron Karlott: a crazy horror lover with a Gollum-esc personality, that always worships the undead so much that it drives him insane to the point where he'll keep spreading nonsense and chaos wherever he goes\n-Burno Biggs: a nephew to one of Beagle Boys, who's is commonly known as ruthless brute who tends to bully the other racers, though some of the racers think he secretly has a good side that he doesn't like to show when he secretly takes cares of canary, also he sometimes secretly thinks Polly is cute\n-Moe Whiplash: a tough but friendly member of the Country Bear Jamboree, who's always keeps a smile on his face most of the time, and barely gets angry, even to the point where people like Bruno are dumbfounded by his attitude\n-Otto Plugnut: a smart yet somewhat neurotic geek, who's both obsessed with technology and automobles to the point where he can fix it up in no time, he also has has a crush on Amanda, but most of the time he has a hard time talking in front of her\n-Polly Roger: a tomboy girl, who loves being a pirate, she loves all kinds of danger and craves for adventure, though she does tend to fight with Amanda due to Polly being less ladylike than Amanda, she also barley takes any baths and is sort of a pack rat cause that's the life of a pirate to her\n-Ned Shredbetter: an athletic and reckless snowboarder/surfer who tends to be an annoyance to some of the racers with his constant need to show off, he even tries to hit on every good looking lady he sees, though he does show that he does have a good heart sometimes\n-Oliver Chickley III: an animal environmentalist who always likes to protect nature, even though he's not the most strongest of the racers, he even sometimes stop dead in the middle of a race whenever there's a duck crossing the road or something\n-X.U.D. 71: a robotic duck, created by Fenton Crackshell (also known as Gizmoduck) made to take his place as a hero when he dies, 71 talks in a robotic voice and has a hard time trying to understand human nature and emotion, but he starts to grow a brotherly bond with Moe to better understand it more\n\nand for the record the animation team that will do this series would be the same team who did Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers, Ducktales, and the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\n\n\nlet me know
