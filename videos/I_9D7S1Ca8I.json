{"id": "I_9D7S1Ca8I", "snippet": {"title": "Alternative Sphere Hard Mode ALL Clear - Hoshimi Twin Sisters, Maiha and Tsubasa", "description": "Once again, we find ourselves logged back in to the world of Ill-Net through Alternative Sphere!\n\nYeah, Alternative Sphere was the game I've been working since earlier this month in July. In this game, you can actually play as the Hoshimi Twin Sisters, Maiha and Tsubasa, like at TWilight INSanity, only this time, Alternative Sphere plays a little differently from TWINS.\n\nHere, in this game, you can choose a character pair to play as, kind of like the other AQ Loop games. Since I picked the Hoshimi Twin Sisters to play as (Incidentally, to unlock the Hoshimi Twin Sisters, you need to 1cc the game (All stages have to be done in Route B, I think) with one of the other character pairs), I had Maiha as my main, with Tsubasa as my support for shield.\n\nWhat the supporting character (Tsubasa, in this case) does is that her shield absorbs most kinds of bullets (Though not everything, like lasers, for instance), and you can withdraw the shield at any time, though the longer you keep her out there as a shield, it'll take a bit longer to re-charge the shield. Yeah, using your shield is also essential to scoring well in this game.\n\nYou have a thing that's called \"LIFELINE\" in this game, which is not only your health bar, but your bomb bar at the same time, just like in TWilight refrAIN. If you use a bomb, it takes 1 heart out of your lifeline, and should you get hit by, say, a bullet for instance, you'll autobomb, making you use 2 hearts instead of 1, and there are other penalties as well.\n\nThe amount of \"RATE\" you get determines what sort of route you can get. You can get your rate up mainly by absorbing a lot of bullets using your shield. If you get the required amount of RATE per stage, you'll get the option of being able to go to the Reverse-Net version of the next stage instead of the Ill-Net versions. The Reverse-Net route (2-B, 3-B, 4-B, and 5-B) gives you the best ending. I'm not familiar with the Ill-Net versions enough to say anything substantial about them.\n\nTo score well in this game, you'll want to absorb as many bullets as you can, and you'll also want to collect as many e-Crystals as you can, for they'll boost your multiplier by a lot. One way to absorb a lot of bullets is, for the most part, get near the bosses, midbosses, and certain other enemies and get your shield up there to absorb a whole lot of bullets.\n\nYou'd also want to capture the final attacks of the midbosses and boss without bombing or getting hit, as that'll get you an x2 multiplier to the score you get from it, and you can even get a couple extra e-Crystals out of them by killing the boss/midboss lackeys.\n\nIn this run, I picked all Reverse-Net stages (2-B, 3-B, 4-B, 5-B). I did not expect this particular run to 1cc, since I made quite a number of mistakes in this run, scoring and survival-wise (Happens pretty often whenever I do full runs in-general, but you just persevere and keep at it). The ending sure was pretty tense! I was shaking at the end, let's just say, haha!\n\nI would like to improve on this one at some point in the future, but for now, I think this will be fine. I'm quite pleased with getting my 1st Hard Mode 1cc of AS! Yeah, you'll get to see all the dialogue in this video, including the ending and credits, so yeah!\n\nThere's plenty to do in this game, suffice to say. I think I'll do the Sequel Stage next!\n\nIf you have any questions about this game, feel free to ask me!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I_9D7S1Ca8I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I_9D7S1Ca8I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I_9D7S1Ca8I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I_9D7S1Ca8I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Alternative Sphere Hard Mode ALL Clear - Hoshimi Twin Sisters, Maiha and Tsubasa", "description": "Once again, we find ourselves logged back in to the world of Ill-Net through Alternative Sphere!\n\nYeah, Alternative Sphere was the game I've been working since earlier this month in July.
