But there are other colors around: blue, green, flashing red... In general, the hell of an epileptic. Eyes watery from the stale air... It watery, if it were. I forgot again that I am a mannequin now. Who did this to me is still unclear, and it doesn't matter anymore. My hopes stayed somewhere else. I woke up from a coma on a rusty bed.
