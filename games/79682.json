The player controls the titular character through (mostly) top-down environments, exploring the surroundings, acquiring items, talking to characters, and sometimes fighting enemies in a simple action-oriented combat. The mini-games usually involve spoofs of famous video games such as the Mario franchise, Grand Theft Auto, and others.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jonny-rpg"}
