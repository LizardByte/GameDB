She has close friends and is part of a prominent pod, her future is all planned out. But Cordelia isn\u2019t most mermaids. When her pod moves to the coast, she\u2019s warned about the forbidden shallows and the dangers that lurk beyond. She\u2019s heard all the rumours of course, but none of her friends will go near it. Curiosity gets the better of Cordelia, and she soon finds herself trembling at the fearful lights and hum of this strange city. However, something - someone actually - has also caught her eye. What starts as mere curiosity blossoms into something far more interesting. Soon Cordelia questions who she really is, and what she really wants. As she ventures further into uncharted territory, she gets closer to love but further from who she is and what she knows. Will she risk it all for a taste of the forbidden?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/where-the-anemones-bloom"}
