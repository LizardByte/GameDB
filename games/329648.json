It was released by Sound Source Interactive in North America in October 1999. It features a series of five minigames, each with three difficulty settings featuring characters from the series. In their review of the title, Discovery Educational declared that \"we found the label of 'toddler' for this software to be somewhat of a misnomer. Most toddler software titles require very little mouse/keyboard skills and feature very basic concepts\", saying that the game was more appropriate for players over 3 years old, and that \"children in the upper end of the suggested age group will find a fair amount to do\".", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-land-before-time-toddler-time", "videos": [{"id": 138952, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "sMrN31eHIP0"}]}
