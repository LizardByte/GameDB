The game is set in Hell and contains only one court, the \"Pit of Hell\", which wasn't in the original Outlaw Volleyball. Returning characters also had slight outfit variants to reflect the setting, like red horns and devil wings. The game can now be found at many used game retailers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
