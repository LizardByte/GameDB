Dark Crusaders was going to be one of the few first person shooters based on the Warhammer world, but the gameplay was not that much fun and in the end Mindscape decided to never publish the game, even though it was almost complete. The game was however later released onto the internet and is for the most part playable. It seems that the FMV sequences used in Warhammer: Dark Crusaders were later recycled for Warhammer: Final Liberation, a turn-based tactics game published for Windows in 1997.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warhammer-40000-dark-crusaders", "videos": [{"id": 81045, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XSr4ilOeXhw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSr4ilOeXhw", "title": "Warhammer 40,000 - Dark Crusaders (1996) PC (never released?)
