Then suddenly, Elysium's magical castle pops up, and school students challenge the story that solving the secret of the castle will grant their wishes. After hearing the story, Arle also decides to enter the tower, but Carbuncle runs away to the castle. Arle navigates the maze and eventually finds it again, and continues to climb the tower by solving the puzzles on every floor. By the end of the dungeon, Arle encounters a young girl in the tower, the Sleeping Princess. The Sleeping Princess claims that she is a powerful opponent, and tells Arle to prepare herself for battle. They fight, and once Arle wins she puts her back to sleep. Arle also decides to take the princess's staff before she leaves the dungeon. As she exits the dungeon, the moon begins to speak to her and tells her that she has solved the Secret of Elysium and that she can make a wish. Carbuncle wishes for curry that he can eat whenever he wants, which makes Arle laugh. With the Secret of Elysium solved, she and Carbuncle return to their daily life.", "summary": "Madou Monogatari: Secret of Elysium is a first-person dungeon-crawler with minimal to no numerical statuses.
