But beware, this Haven is anything but safe because this time, the Battlegrounds hunt you. Haven is a small, dense, urban map, under the control of an enemy faction called Pillar, and they're none too happy about you being on their turf. Stick to the shadows as you slink your way through the city of Haven to avoid Pillar's Scout Helicopter and Kill Truck to survive the night. Utilize the new Emergency Parachute to quickly move from rooftop to alley or take down Pillar guards and be rewarded with the caches they guard containing powerful level 3 gear. Pillar Guards and Kill Trucks aren't all you have to worry about, though. This is Battle Royale after all and there can only be one winner. Whether you choose to hide or seek, Haven's compact and dangerous environment will provide you an all new challenge on the Battlegrounds.", "summary": "Hide, Seek, Survive", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-season-10", "videos": [{"id": 46049, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YLwCfTA6LCQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLwCfTA6LCQ", "title": "Season 10 Haven Launch Trailer | PUBG", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLwCfTA6LCQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
