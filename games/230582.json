It is based in the same world as StreetPass Quest/Find Mii although has no effect on gameplay in the game. The concept involves cooking required dishes with 10 ingredients (which can be purchased with play coins or supplied by StreetPassed Miis). Selecting the right ingredients leads to higher points and so the Miis make more progress in the quest adventure.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/feed-mii"}
