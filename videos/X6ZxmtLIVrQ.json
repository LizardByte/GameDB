{"id": "X6ZxmtLIVrQ", "snippet": {"title": "Polymega Gameplays - Mappy Kids [Famicom]", "description": "Mappy the mouse had a son named Happy. Happy has grown up and now wants to settle down with a wife. However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.\n\nThe game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.\n\nAfter each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform. The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.\n\nAfter the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.\n\nThe two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.\n\nMappy, Mappy Kids \u00a9 Bandai Namco\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #polymega #polymegagameplays #nes #nintendoentertainmentsystem #namco #nintendo #famicom #mappy #mappykids\n\nFUN FACT: This game had been a Japanese exclusive for a long time since its release in 1989. In fact, it wouldn't get an international release until 2020, where it was included as part of the Namco Museum Collection 1 cartridge for Evercade. This was the same cart that came with every OG Evercade handheld in Europe. The Evercade release in particular is also the first time the game was given an official English translation.
