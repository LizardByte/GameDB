Originally created for game developers, Insects was reinvented to be an educational and engaging demonstration of the console's real-time graphics rendering capabilities.\n\nInsects looks best when paired with a 4K Ultra HD TV with support for High Dynamic Range but can be enjoyed on all Xbox One consoles and displays. Spatial Audio can be enjoyed over headphones as well as surround sound systems."}
