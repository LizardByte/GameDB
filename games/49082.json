With the exception of the latter two handhelds, all of Thin Chen's games were produced without license from the console manufacturers; the company produced at least 70 unique games for the NES and Famicom and at least 32 for the Game Boy (albeit compiled into eight 4-in-1 cartridges), making it the most prolific unlicensed developer and publisher for both consoles by a considerable margin.[1] The company also produced its own Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clones, such as the Q-Boy.[2] \n \nMost of Thin Chen's products were released under the \"Sachen\" brand name, although the names Joy Van and Commin were also used for certain early games for the Famicom and handheld consoles respectively. Several of their NES games were released outside Taiwan under license by foreign publishers, including Hacker International in Japan (usually with added pornographic content), Bunch Games/Color Dreams and American Video Entertainment in the USA, and Milmar in Brazil.[1] \n \nNote: This is taken from wiki, no description for actual game.
