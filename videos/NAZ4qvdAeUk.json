The PAL version is being played as the US release seemed to be missing the introduction sequence.\n\nAs mentioned the game is short and can be played in 10-15 mins.  I drag out the longplay to show more of the items and jokes presented in the game and there is surly more not presented here as there are other areas to visit.  The replay value comes from the random clues and hidden key parts being in different places each time you play the game.  At the end of the video I include a few clips of what happens when you go afk. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NAZ4qvdAeUk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NAZ4qvdAeUk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NAZ4qvdAeUk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [258] Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster and the Beanstalk", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nA short adventure game for the younger generation.
