{"id": "IdRcgD7kJEA", "snippet": {"title": "Witch It 1.0 Teaser Trailer", "description": "On the 22nd October, 2020 Witch It will be leaving Early Access!\n\nUpdate 1.0 is our grand finale to mark the end of Early Access, jam-packed with more content, including a fresh layer of polish across all aspects of the game. To begin, we\u2019ve included two brand new witch forest maps, stuffed full of wacky and unusual props. Due to popular request by our players, we\u2019ve designed two new skills, allowing for a broad range of unique tactics and mobility. Additionally, we\u2019ve added an assortment of cosmetic items for both the witches and hunters, as well as a bundle of challenging achievements.\n\nDuring 2020, we focused a large amount of our time towards ironing out bugs and exploits to make Witch It a polished experience. \n\nHowever, this is just the tip of the iceberg - there\u2019s so much more to discover in update 1.0! Release day will introduce new additions such as entirely new prop sounds, and an enormous overhaul of map backdrops. To our veterans, we hear you - swappable clothing sets and unique music for all maps are ready for you on October 22nd!\n\nUpdate 1.0 will push Witch It to a high level of quality that is a dramatic difference to the game we had at the start of Early Access. Over the years, we\u2019ve introduced countless gameplay enhancements, amusing events, and huge additions such as Creative Mode, where players can create their own Witch It maps with their friends. From release day, Witch It will contain 15 official maps, as well as player-created maps. Witch It also includes over 300 playable props and 5 game modes. With that in mind, the price of Witch It will raise before we leave Early Access on October 22, 2020.\n\nWe want to express all our thanks and gratitude to our players who stuck with us through our journey, providing us with invaluable feedback and support. We cannot thank our community enough for allowing us to turn our small passion project into a dream come true. Of course, We plan to continue updating Witch It beyond update 1.0!\n\nMusic by: Jan-Helge Schn\u00f6bbe\njhsoundtracks.de", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdRcgD7kJEA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdRcgD7kJEA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdRcgD7kJEA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdRcgD7kJEA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IdRcgD7kJEA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Witch It 1.0 Teaser Trailer", "description": "On the 22nd October, 2020 Witch It will be leaving Early Access!\n\nUpdate 1.0 is our grand finale to mark the end of Early Access, jam-packed with more content, including a fresh layer of polish across all aspects of the game.
