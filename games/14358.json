Players move their character by clicking on locations shown in the main display, and each scene will only be finished when a character has completed all the actions on the screen. Players interact with NPCs as well as specific objects by clicking or dragging. An in-game hint system is located on the bottom left corner of the screen as a question mark. Items carried by players can be combined with additional items. Objects return to their original position whenever they are dropped. Interactive cut scenes are triggered once a player has completed location objectives.\n\nTo complete the game, the player explores real life locations such as Paris, New Orleans or Havana. Some game stages have a time limit that, if not completed is punishable by the character\u2019s death. If a character dies, the player\u2019s progress is saved automatically and the player may start over from their last save.\n\nArt of Murder contains a range of mechanical and slider puzzles.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/art-of-murder-hunt-for-the-puppeteer", "videos": [{"id": 6027, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MPi37XFK8ic", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPi37XFK8ic", "title": "Trailer Art of Murder: Hunt for the Puppeteer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MPi37XFK8ic/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6028, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Iqfp5zjDuA8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqfp5zjDuA8", "title": "Art of Murder Hunt for the Puppeteer PC Gameplay (HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iqfp5zjDuA8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
