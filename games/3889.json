Instead of the standard GameCube controllers, the game is intended to be played with a special controller called the DK Bongos that resemble two small bongo drums. \n \nDonkey Konga was developed by the same team of people who made the Taiko: Drum Master series for the PlayStation 2. The tracks include hits such as \"Louie Louie\", \"We Will Rock You\", \"Shining Star\", \"Rock Lobster\" and \"Losing My Religion\". There are tracks from the Mario series, the The Legend of Zelda series and other Nintendo related music. All regional variants of the game have differing track listings, and in the North American version of both games, almost all of the licensed non-Nintendo/traditional songs are shortened covers.", "videos": [{"id": 14122, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WaW3h559uWc"}, {"id": 39640, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "G70HoWO1umc"}]}
