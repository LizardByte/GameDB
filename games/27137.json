I am considering adding choices in any future chapters/stand-alone novels.)  \n  \nAfter meeting with Doctor Adam Cendrillon, Charlotte and Seleste head off to do a task to retrieve a rare plant with magical healing properties with a mysterious new ally: Dawn Ngo. With the Violean Royal Guard on their tails, how will they fare in the face of even more threats? Aye, the sea is a very dangerous place...  \n  \nThis is the second of many humorous and drama-filled chapters to come. As a warning this game at the most has some foul language, a bit of blood, mild sexual themes and crude humor.  \n  \nPress the \"A\" key to Auto play the text.  \n  \nThis game is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, in window mode and full screen mode.  \n  \nAgain, this is Windows only.  \n  \nAlso, be careful, as the game can crash when you close it, as Novelty, the program I used to create this game, is still in its Beta stages. Be sure to save often, just in case. This is the main reason I place this game under \"Unstable\"  \n  \nCredits  \n  \nOriginal Story and Character Art by me, Kassidie Butler (Viridea) 2015-2016  \n  \nMusic by Audionautix and AngelHeights  \n  \nSFX by Freesound.org  \n  \nBackgrounds from Pixabay  \n  \nBackgrounds edited with FotoSketcher  \n  \nand Adobe Photoshop CC 2015  \n  \nThank you very much, and I hope you enjoy the game!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/viridescent-dragon-chapter-2", "videos": [{"id": 12076, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "o78SOG5IVcQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o78SOG5IVcQ", "title": "Viridescent Dragon: Chapter 2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o78SOG5IVcQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2614, "name": "Viridescent Dragon"}]}
