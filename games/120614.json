The aim of the game is to avoid buildings and enemies to last as many meters as you can. Unlike other infinite runners where the camera is stuck to one place you can freely fly up and down in a world about 4 times the height of your view. You can also collect items along the way. You can choose to have items on or off in the pause menu. Your high-score with items on is different from your high-score with items off in order to keep things fair in the leaderboards. You can buy cosmetics with in-game currency such as changing the player into a bat and getting rid of all textures. More enemies, items, and cosmetics will be added in the near future!"}
