The game follows Rean Schwarzer and his fellow students of \"Class VII\" at Thors Military Academy, a newly formed class at the academy which is the only one not segregated by social class, composing of both Erebonian nobility and commoners.\n\nThe basic gameplay is nearly identical to the previous entries with a few changes. The biggest change to the battle system and also counting as a brand new feature is the \"Tactical Link System\". The \"Tactical Link\" allow players follow up with three different kinds of link attacks, dealing additional damage and providing various other benefits. \"Tactical Link\" becomes a more useful asset to the player as the story progress and characters level up their \"Link Levels\" with other characters. As the link levels increase, you will obtain new link abilities such as healing the link partner or increase the CP gain of the partner.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel", "videos": [{"id": 9580, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Pfcx4EkaDgo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfcx4EkaDgo", "title": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel - Launch Trailer (EU - English)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pfcx4EkaDgo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 5900, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "uXIaukqbh6k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXIaukqbh6k", "title": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel - Teaser Trailer (EU - English)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uXIaukqbh6k/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9579, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-KJ0UfMFP_E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KJ0UfMFP_E", "title": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel - BattleTrailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KJ0UfMFP_E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
