Or run through the streets of a new city to escape a zombie apocalypse? Have you ever read a story and wish you could be in it? Calling the shots, helping the good guys (or bad), choosing your adventure. Story City makes you the hero of your own story, giving you the chance to take part in your own adventure in cities across the world.\n\nEach game on Story City only opens when you're in the right location. Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, a musical journey or scavenger hunt, all stories and games on Story City are made by creators who know their cities best.\n\nWill you explore Brisbane while running from a zombie apocalypse? Or how about cruising the Adelaide streets while solving a mystery? Or will you be pillaging the city looking for pirate supplies? Perhaps you'll take a musical journey with a First Nations storyteller and drummer in Edmonton's River Valley, or learn about your non-profit in a social issues walk.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/story-city", "videos": [{"id": 80572, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "2nSaiw7JpMU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nSaiw7JpMU", "title": "Story City In Under a Minute", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nSaiw7JpMU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
