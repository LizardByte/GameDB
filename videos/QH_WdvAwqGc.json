{"id": "QH_WdvAwqGc", "snippet": {"title": "Batman Returns-DOS longplay", "description": "Hey everybody.\n\nA new longplay, this time an old favourite of mine, Batman. Batman Returns, a DOS game released by Konami based on the movie from 1992 with same name. A somewhat mashup of good old adventure games and RPG, this game wasn't the best of the bunch that came alongside the movie, but I like it a lot.\n\nFirst of all, the story wasn't transferred to the game that well, you actually need to see the movie to fully understand the game. The gameplay is sparse, a simple point-n'-click game, even the fighting sequenses are automated, you only get to choose special attacks which Batman executes when he can. The music is okay, but very few songs in total, and no support different MIDI players. The sound effects are okay, but some feel out of place, for example the sonic batarang that sounds like a car alarm. But one thing that really shines with the game is the graphics and animations, they are superb.\n\nI have a complete playthrough first, with the \"normal\" ending, the one that matches the movie. After that I show you some different endings, first a bad one where the Penguin becomes mayor. There are different ways to get this ending but only the text differs a little between them. \nSecond, a bad ending with the Penguin gets his revenge on Gotham City when his campaign for mayor fails. Again, there are different ways to get this ending. \nThird, a good \"fairy tale\" ending I guess it can be called, where Batman and Catwoman both makes it out okay and leaves together.\nThe good ending was the hardest to obtain, and the most not \"Batman-like\" way to play the game, ignoring to help people in need, the ice princess in particular.\n\nThe schedule of the video:\n\n0:00 Title\n1:35 Day 1\n11:15 Day 2\n21:03 Day 3\n28:05 Day 4\n39:30 Day 5\n49:40 Day 6\n57:47 Day 7\n1:05:50 Day 8\n1:11:31 Day 9\n\n1:20:25 Bad endings\n1:21:42 Good ending\n\nEnjoy the video and have a good one 'til next time.\n\nThank you for watching.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QH_WdvAwqGc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QH_WdvAwqGc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QH_WdvAwqGc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QH_WdvAwqGc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QH_WdvAwqGc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Batman Returns-DOS longplay", "description": "Hey everybody.\n\nA new longplay, this time an old favourite of mine, Batman.
