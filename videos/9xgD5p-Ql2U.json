So I thought it might be fun to sample semi-random games and upload them so everyone can see how terrible I am at them!\n\nSo here we have a game called Highway 2000 for the Saturn.  It was developed by Genki and published in North America by Natsume in 1996.  This was my first time playing this game and I actually thought it was pretty good.  I could see myself trying to master all of the tracks in this one.  I didn't do very well in these races, but I think it's just a matter of understanding the handling and learning the tracks.  It felt a lot like Ridge Racer and while I don't think it'll top that one or some of the other great '90s arcade racers like Daytona USA, it's still a good one to check out if you're a fan of the genre.  I captured this video on a Saturn.\n\nYou can check out my full video game collection here:  http://www.completionator.com/Collection/Index/1", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9xgD5p-Ql2U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9xgD5p-Ql2U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9xgD5p-Ql2U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9xgD5p-Ql2U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Highway 2000 Sega Saturn Intro + Gameplay [No Commentary]", "description": "I have a ton of games in my backlog that I've either never played or played very little.
