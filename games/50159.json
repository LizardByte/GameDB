Your client is a rich industrialist and copper mine magnate who goes by the name of W. Hamilton. He accuses the local Cree community of vandalizing and stealing from his summer residence and hunting manor. The Crees are no friends to Hamilton, as they blame him for destroying sacred lands for the sole purpose of increased profits. \nFrom driving to shooting to scene-searching, Kona combines the atmosphere and immersion of a modern survival title with the deep storytelling and puzzle-solving aspects of a traditional adventure game. \nStep into a surreal interactive tale of mystery and investigate the perplexing quietness in the entire town \nExplore a vast, frigid Northern environment and battle the elements to survive \nGo back in time with a vintage look and feel reminiscent of 1970s rural communities", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kona-day-one"}
