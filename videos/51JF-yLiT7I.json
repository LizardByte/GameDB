{"id": "51JF-yLiT7I", "snippet": {"title": "PSX Longplay [171] Penny Racers", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Deskawa\n\nThis game is the first of a japanese saga called Choro Q (it's a license of toys in the style of Micromachines) which is (or has been) the largest saga of racing games ever. Of all them only a few have been distributed outside Japan, and always under different names, like Gadget Racers, Road Trip and Penny Racers. This game introduced the concept of campaign in racing games, with a car that starts being garbage and that you improve it winning races until you can compete in the bests circuits. Grahipcs are quite buggy and the gameplay isn't specially good, but other than that this game is a piece of history. And the music is made by the same composers of the Toshinden series, so it's best reason to play it nowadays.\n\nI'm quite satisfied with this longplay. I thought it would be a mess, but it's more understandable than I expected. No item was bought, sold or equipped outside of the camera. Circuits are played in the same order they appear, but I won't show them again in the GP modes unless they get some extension (with the exception of the last circuit). I didn't show either how I got the money to buy the new parts (which implied racing again and again in the same circuits). -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51JF-yLiT7I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51JF-yLiT7I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51JF-yLiT7I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51JF-yLiT7I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [171] Penny Racers", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Deskawa\n\nThis game is the first of a japanese saga called Choro Q (it's a license of toys in the style of Micromachines) which is (or has been) the largest saga of racing games ever.
