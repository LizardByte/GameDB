See description below for instructions on how to record HD-quality retro gaming video content:\n\n1. Get a Vizzed account on www.vizzed.com. Make sure you download the RGR plugin, since all games require it.\n\n2. When you select your game, in the upper left-hand corner, you'll see the option to play using an emulator that allows for video recording.\n\n3. When you press F8 to start recording, it'll ask you where you'll want to save the resulting video. It'll begin a continuous save as long as you are recording, and all you have to do to stop recording is to press F8 again.\n\n4. The video will no doubt be a large file, and not even QuickTime Player can open it without having audio only. So, download and use Freemake Video Converter using this link - http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/\n\nAND YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO! :D", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/viP2-Mz4aaQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/viP2-Mz4aaQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/viP2-Mz4aaQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "EarthBound Intro [HD]", "description": "Pretty much just testing out gameplay recording with the Vizzed Retro Game Room emulator, for my upcoming \"Let's Play\" videos for \"Mother 3\".
