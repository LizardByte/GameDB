It has a new compilation of songs: \"MIKI YellowGreenMIX\". Much like Hibiki and Takane's volumes, Miki's image color (fresh green) is replaced with \"Yellow Green\". This volume also marked Eri Mizutani's second HD appearance, featuring her in a special mode of the game. This mode allows players to take pictures of her wearing the costume \"Pastel Bikini\" and listen to her sing the BGM music. An option was also developed to allow pictures to be taken on a horizontal, empty beach. Both \"Dreamy Wedding\" and \"Pastel Bikini\" debuted in this volume.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-idolmaster-gravure-for-you-vol-8", "collections": [{"id": 957, "name": "The Idolmaster"}]}
