Mushroom World is a coin-operated pinball machine released to commercial buyers in the U.S.A. It is the direct sequel of Super Mario Bros., which was released two months earlier. Unlike its predecessor, Mushroom World was more focused on commercial buyers, as it was given redemption features. Gameplay is based on the NES game Super Mario Bros. 3, as the cabinet displays the game artwork of the Koopalings and uses power-ups during gameplay such as Frog Mario and Raccoon Mario."}
