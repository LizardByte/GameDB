You have 4 arms,\nthat can aim at multiple targets at once. Your skin is implanted, giving it enhanced resistance. Your body has steel plates around primary centres, aiming systems, extension motorics, and as many as 9 special abilities.\n\nThe main hero is able to use several special abilities where the most significant one is the presence of two extra arms. Mutant can hold different guns in different hands and he can fire at different targets at once. The player can control one of the hands or several hands at once while they aim at a common target. Other hands are automatically seeking space around Mutant for any enemies.\n\nHe was born as a quite an ordinary boy in a tiny Czech village. After the death of his parents he was raised by his grandmother, a very kind though a bit muddle-headed woman. She would make anything for the boy! So when the gentlemen in well-fitting suits came around one day, she didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment. Face to face with her own reflection in their black sunglasses, she let the boy go with them to a holiday camp. Then she arranged the money into neat packets and hid it in a straw mattress. She knew the value of things of this kind. The summer came over. Leaves fell off the trees. The snow covered the ground, and the boy never came to the old woman`s mind again.\n\nThe lad wasn\u2019t satisfied with the camp from the very first day. He could get over the loss of direct contact with other children, and he could accept the communication with them only by rapping out on the wall of cell. He could acquiesce with the camp guiders who were dressed in white gowns instead of scout uniforms. On the other hand the attractions disgusted him. They promised him sun, water, merry-go-round and lots of fun. It is hard to say what kind of source it was but they surely shone something on him. Anyway he grew one meter up and he became much stronger. It was exactly what he had always wanted to happen. On the other hand there was lots of pain in it. More than he expected.\n\nAnd then, one day after many years, he woke up and unplugged himself from all those beeping-in-panic devices. Because he didn\u2019t find anyone in the laboratory he came finally to light. Prague is nice but too deserted. The city is almost empty except hordes of strange creatures driven by very simple killing philosophy. There are enough enemies for each hand!", "summary": "Mutant is a game featuring 15 huge levels and nine mutant special abilities. Hold up to four guns at once.
