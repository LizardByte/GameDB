Due to the CD-ROM format of PlayStation it has longer load times in comparison to the Super Famicom versions.\n\nThe North American version, which is only available as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles and Final Fantasy Anthology compilations, came with a brand new English localization. Although certain translated lines from the previous localization by Kaoru Moriyama, such as \"You spoony bard!\", were kept, as they had become fan favorites.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-iv--3", "videos": [{"id": 104990, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "WcaDE7G3zaQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcaDE7G3zaQ", "title": "INTRO[5] Final Fantasy IV (PS-US)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WcaDE7G3zaQ/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 39, "name": "Final Fantasy"}, {"id": 9320, "name": "Final Fantasy IV"}]}
