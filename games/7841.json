While the entire soundtrack of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was re-orchestrated, the only pieces in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix that received any sort of changes were \"Dismiss\", \"It's a Small World\", and \"Keyblade Graveyard Horizons\". Additionally, Aqua's English voice actress Willa Holland provided new dialogue for the three cutscenes that are exclusive to Final Mix's Secret Episode.\n\nKingdom Hearts Re:coded\n- Kingdom Hearts Re:coded was featured as over three hours of fully voiced, high definition cutscenes. In addition, it includes character reports. Unlike Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days in Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX, Kingdom Hearts Re:coded features cutscenes from the Disney worlds, as well as battle scenes, and narration by Mickey. Cutscenes were added to better understand the Kingdom Hearts series, including one to connect to Kingdom Hearts \u03c7\n\n- An additional secret ending of Re:coded, titled \"A Will that is Passed on\", was added to connect to the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. Additionally, due to Phil Snyder's retirement, Joe Ochman had to replace him as the voice of Jiminy Cricket, which included providing new dialogue for some of the new cutscenes, and redubbing all of Snyder's previous recordings.\n\nKingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance\n- This titles is experiences as a collection of cutscenes accessed through credits menus.", "summary": "Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix is an HD remastered compilation of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix.
