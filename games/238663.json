What was once a technological powerhouse, creating the most intelligent and sturdy robots, made to replace humans in tasks that demand lot's of back breaking labor and complex calculations, is now a rotting wreck floating aimlessly around its star.\n\nWhile the company and its founder were always a source of controversy, nobody has claimed any sort of attack on the facility. Making the sudden abandonment all the more mysterious.\n\nYou awaken on board this ship, not knowing who you are or how you got there.\n\nYou get an incoming message from a humanoid robot named Rick, who tells you that the robots on the ship have become self sustained and will kill any intruders.\nHe can help you escape, if you help him in return.\n\nWill you trust Rick?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/somber--1", "videos": [{"id": 84535, "name": "Preview", "video_id": "TKkN-jr8AHI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKkN-jr8AHI", "title": "Somber : Gameplay Preview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TKkN-jr8AHI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
