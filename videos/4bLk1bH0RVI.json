In this beautiful 2D world, you will live the story of a \"Spirit Warrior\", who is on a journey to find his purpose in the \"Spirit World\". To do so, you will 'transcend' time and worlds to prove yourself among the galaxies' greatest warriors. You will learn to live like one of them, you will train with them, learn their strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately... you will challenge them. Every decision you make in Transcend will be 'judged' and will have an evolving effect on the game-play and story. \n\nTranscend is composed of a series of chapters, like a book or TV series. Each chapter will be released as soon as it is ready and polished. The story in the series is unique and should be a fun, new experience for everyone. \n\nFollow me!\n\u25baTWITTER - https://twitter.com/YnorThe/media\n\u25ba CONTACT-  ynorron@gmail.com\n\nTrailer Edited By:\n \u25baYOUTUBE- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83gtRqJuLdt3d_Ncwdjm3w\n\u25ba CONTACT-  sebichaos@gmail.com\n\nCREDITS:\n\u25baTrailer Song - Denny Schneidemesser\n\u25baCombat Animations(blood and sparks) - Pow Studios\n\nON STEAM: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=765787013", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4bLk1bH0RVI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4bLk1bH0RVI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4bLk1bH0RVI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4bLk1bH0RVI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4bLk1bH0RVI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "TRANSCEND - Teaser Trailer | PC Game", "description": "NOW ON STEAM 2018 : http://store.steampowered.com/app/760860/TRANSCEND/\n\nTranscend is inspired by a mixture of Ghibli Studio's work and James Cameron's \"Avatar\".
