Its background is set at the foreseeable future, when protagonist is facing a survival crisis due to deterioration of the Earth\u2019s natural environment. At this point, some scientists detect the existence of other planets outside their own galaxy with other types of life on them, which are very likely to be suitable for human beings. They therefore trained a group of elite space astronauts to look for chances of extending life in the outer space and save their home. These well-trained space warriors need to drive spacecrafts to explore and find a planet suitable for human life. In the unknown space, unprecedented great challenges awaits them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-cruise"}
