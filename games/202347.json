Most of the objects are on ledges, requiring climbing up ladders and across rope bridges. Other characters are also running around the screen, and must be avoided to prevent losing a life. Graphically and game-play wise, it is very similar to Lode Runner, except that instead of digging holes to temporarily trap your pursuers, you can fire either horizontally or vertically to stun them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boogie-woogi-jungle"}
