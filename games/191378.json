S is an arcade game where you fly around in a spaceship collecting stars. As you collect a star an entity from subspace appears and starts to chase the ship. As you keep on collecting stars, more entities appear and follows the first entity, creating a longer and longer tail that upon collision with the ship will destroy it.\n\nGoal of the game is to avoid the tail for as long as possible while collecting stars. Scattered around the universe, you'll find power-ups that can be used to your advantage. Some can destroy the entities chasing the ship, doing so creates more stars and gives bonus points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 64149, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jqcaD6vdp-4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqcaD6vdp-4", "title": "Hive P v.
