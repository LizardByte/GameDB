The poor, defenseless pillbugs have no choice but to retreat into their shells to escape Hank\u2019s nauseating smell.\n\nPillville is no longer the joyful paradise it once was. It is a wasteland consumed by vile stink bug stench. Even the once bright and happy Polycorn Palace has been converted to a filthy and pungent bowling alley. Hank The Stank, a fierce, competitive bowler now spends his days on the lanes using frightened, rolled up pilbugs as bowling balls!\n\nHaving been captured and locked in an airtight bowling trophy, Princess Polycorn's magical powers have been rendered useless and there is nothing she can do to save her kingdom! All hope would be lost, if it weren\u2019t for the severe allergies and clogged sinuses of Phil The Pill!\n\nPillville and it\u2019s sugary snacks have begun to wither and rot.
