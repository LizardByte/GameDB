It pioneered many aspects of modern gaming, including open world city exploration, and was the game that coined the Quick Time Event (QTE). It was one of the first games with a persistent open world, where day cycles to night, weather changes, shops open and close and NPCs go about their business all on their own schedules. Its engrossing epic story and living world created a generation of passionate fans, and the game consistently makes the list of \u201cgreatest games of all time\u201d.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shenmue-i-and-ii", "videos": [{"id": 19050, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "juPGbtqe8mU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juPGbtqe8mU", "title": "Shenmue I & II - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/juPGbtqe8mU/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 271, "name": "Shenmue"}]}
