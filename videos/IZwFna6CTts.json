{"id": "IZwFna6CTts", "snippet": {"title": "Target Hits Arcade", "description": "It contains three fixed-screen games with several scenes for each one:\n\nShooting Range: a traditional shooting range with targets that move towards the front of the screen, either in a straight line or with circular movement. There are also skulls and those need to be avoided. At the end of each stage the amount of hits and the accuracy are shown. There are five lives and when a skull is shot or a target reaches the screen a life is lost.\n\nDesert Chariots: here moving targets need to be shot on vehicles moving sideways, left and right. When all targets are destroyed the chariot explodes. Enough targets need to be shot before they leave the screen to keep progressing. The same lives system is used as in Shooting Range. There are skulls to be avoided and sometimes there is a bottle instead of a regular target.\n\nTrack Wagons: here a single target needs to be shot on a wagon. Five bullets are provided per stage and now the game takes into account if the yellow, red or blue zone is hit for accuracy. Time is taken into account as well and a certain level needs to be reached to qualify for the next stage. Each stage has new factors to take into account. There is variation for the distance to the target, movement or not, and the type of movement.\n\nNext to points the player's overall performance is shown through silver and golden stars displayed in a row near the top of the screen. They represent a completed stage and scene respectively. The game keeps track of high scores.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IZwFna6CTts/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IZwFna6CTts/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IZwFna6CTts/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IZwFna6CTts/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IZwFna6CTts/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Target Hits Arcade", "description": "It contains three fixed-screen games with several scenes for each one:\n\nShooting Range: a traditional shooting range with targets that move towards the front of the screen, either in a straight line or with circular movement.
