Once again, you're a mage whose quest is to destroy the evil Nemesis. Just like in the previous installment, you can throw fireballs at your foes or use them to destroy certain walls. You can find bolts and nukes which allow more powerful attacks, healing potions, scrolls and keys. You can also find gems which allow you to see approaching enemies on your radar. Of course, there are completely new levels to explore and many new enemies to fight, such as harmless rabbits which suddenly turn into fearsome beasts, or evil trees which can be set on fire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/curse-of-the-catacombs", "videos": [{"id": 137841, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "srmSeSJ7EKw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srmSeSJ7EKw", "title": "Curse of the Catacombs gameplay (PC Game, 1993)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/srmSeSJ7EKw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 137842, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3ZjQsPqIFlM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZjQsPqIFlM", "title": "Catacomb Armageddon - Level 1: Towne of Morbidty", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZjQsPqIFlM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
