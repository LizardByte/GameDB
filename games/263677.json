Many locations have simple puzzles to solve, and some dungeon areas are maze-like. The gameplay system is nearly identical to that of Gensei Kitan, with the same interface and overall structure. Random enemies are fought in turn-based style, on a side-view battle screen. Characters use physical attacks, special techniques, and magical spells. As in all Gensei games, HP, SP, and MP are fully restored by level up.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gensei-kaito-den"}
