You snoop around the grounds of the South Fork Ranch, superficially interacting with much-loved characters from the TV show and an assortment of extras from the animal kingdom. So far, so good.\n\nYour travels ultimately lead you to the jungles around Playa Peligro, in South America, where you overcome a series of obstacles by using various techniques, but mostly by doping a friendly monkey with tobacco -- a firm reminder that we're descending beneath even soap opera plot conflicts and sitting squarely in an early-'80s text adventure game, with all of the internal logic-twisting that entails.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-dallas-quest", "videos": [{"id": 110940, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JaQqKHpXHuE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQqKHpXHuE", "title": "C64 The Dallas Quest Remastered longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JaQqKHpXHuE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
