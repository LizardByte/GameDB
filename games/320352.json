This version is a fanmade remake built from the ground-up. It faithfully recreates every aspect of the original while also providing a few new things to play around with.\n\nThe Retro Mode covers the game with the classic pixel graphics of Pac-Man's arcade games and a heavy dose of Namco fanservice as you can select from a whopping 17 different characters! You can also compete with friends locally in the game's alternative multiplayer modes!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-athlon"}
