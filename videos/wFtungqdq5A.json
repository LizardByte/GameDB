You could say it was over-engineered with its two-stage three-speed (!) supercharger and two simultaneous boost systems (MW-50 water-methanol for altitudes up to 10 km and GM-1 nitrous oxide for 11+ km). Yes, this is not a typo - this piston-engine aircraft could not only climb above the modern airliners (its ceiling was 13 km), but also be able to dogfight there.\n\nLike most late-war German war machines, there were too few of them to make a difference. By the spring of 1945, when it was too late to intercept Allied bomber formations - Allied ground forces were advancing into the Reich from both the east and the west - only about two dozen aircraft were combat-ready. The few planes were used in the usual fighter roles and, ironically, much closer to the ground than they were built for - covering the takeoffs and landings of the new jet-powered aircraft. This is similar to the story of the Allied P-47 Thunderbolts, which were designed for high-altitude combat and had special systems for it, but ended up spending a good part of their flying time close to the ground because they proved to be the best ground attack fighters of the US Air Army Air Forces.\n\nhttps://il2sturmovik.com/store/collector-planes/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/3021360/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFtungqdq5A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFtungqdq5A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFtungqdq5A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFtungqdq5A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFtungqdq5A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ta 152 H-1 Collector Plane Released in IL-2 Great Battles", "description": "This unique machine was a pinnacle of German piston engine technology of its time, designed to be able to engage Allied bomber formations at very high altitudes and prevail over Mustangs and Spitfires.
