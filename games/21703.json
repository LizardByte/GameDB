The game is a typical scrolling shooter, with two buttons used for the primary shot and secondary shot respectively. Red capsules will leave \"S\" icons which will raise the ship's speed. Along the way the player will also find blue capsules which will release power-ups which equip different secondary shots into the ship. There are nine different secondary shots available, each represented by a different letter. By shooting the power-up icons the player will cycle between the letters, allowing to equip the desired weapon. Weapons don't stack, so picking up more icons of the same letter won't raise the player's firepower.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-next-space"}
