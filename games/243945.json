Frup-Foo (our hero) believes that if the mythical White Whale exists, he can keep the secret of a new beginning. But there is an evil afoot. Now that Mushsnail is starting to dry up, he has been left vulnerable to monsters that previously couldn't enter the magic barrier. With each passing day, the village becomes more at risk.\n\nWhite Whale features turn-based rpg battles and an aerial world map. Each character has their own abilities, of course. Priss is the healer as well as the state spell caster. Frup is slower than the others, but has a powerful special attack and is the only character who can use items during battle. Chup is the fighter, and he can only ... well... fight!\n\nThe game progresses in chapters. Each chapter takes place in the same world, just with a different goal.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-white-whale"}
