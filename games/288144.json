In the game, players compete in teams to combat the Noise around Shibuya. It was officially shut down on February 28, 2014.\n\nPlayers had to find and defeat Ringleader Noise, the main enemies of the game. At the beginning of the week, the Players were assigned into groups of 20. The player would have to work with their team to defeat the Ringleader Noise for the week to achieve victory.\n\nCoco Atarashi was a new Reaper introduced in LIVE Remix, becoming the player's guide throughout the game as they explore Shibuya.\n\nThe battle system is similar to that of The World Ends with You and The World Ends with You -Solo Remix-, but uses a portrait display orientation instead of a landscape orientation.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-world-ends-with-you-live-remix"}
