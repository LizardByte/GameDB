Lots of it. That's not all though -- the maps from the original game are being redesigned too. Note: I'm not the mod's developer. Credit goes to Zio McCall for the concept, development, as well as the various contributors. I just felt that this mod needed a place here.", "videos": [{"id": 67409, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5msRfphQHaE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5msRfphQHaE", "title": "Brutal Wolfenstein 3D V5.0 Episode 1 [100% EVERYTHING] 1440p 60fps", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5msRfphQHaE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
