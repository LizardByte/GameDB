It's not the most exciting job, but it pays the bills. Each night, you go home, go to sleep, and have vivid dreams that let you escape your mundane life. However, sometimes the line between dreams and real life start to get a bit blurred. Will you work hard and keep your job, or will you get out of touch with reality?\n\nThe game was heavily inspired by Yume Nikki, and it was created for Dream Diary Jam 4. So like Yume Nikki, the game is mostly just about walking around and exploring dreams. However, there are a few significant changes in how this plays compared to Yume Nikki and most fan games."}
