Released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows platforms and following on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable afterward, Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is the 6th edition of the Pro Evolution Soccer series for the PlayStation 2, 2nd for the PlayStation Portable and 4th for Microsoft Windows. It is the first game to debut on the Nintendo DS and the Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 version features improved graphics, but retains gameplay similar to the other console versions. The edit mode has been stripped down for the Xbox 360 release, due to time restrictions. The graphics engine on the PC does not utilise the next-gen 360 engine but will again be a direct conversion of the PlayStation 2 engine.\n\nAs with previous versions, the game features an edit mode allowing the player to edit certain elements of the game.\n\nA Bundesliga license was supposed to be a feature of the game for Pro Evolution Soccer Installment, but Konami were forced to remove the teams, which means the Bundesliga is not present in PES6, not even as a series of unlicensed teams, with the exception of FC Bayern Munich who were fully licensed with the omission of their shirt sponsor T-Home. From then on, no further games featured the Bundesliga, with the participation of German teams restricted to a few of its teams appearing in separate blocks (like the UEFA Champions League teams without their own league). It is also the last Pro Evolution Soccer game to use a sequel number moniker, being replaced with the year featuring in the title from then on. Also it was the first installment released with \"Pro Evolution Soccer\" name on North America. PES 6 was succeeded by Pro Evolution Soccer 2008.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-GETGry1dx0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-GETGry1dx0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-GETGry1dx0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-GETGry1dx0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-GETGry1dx0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER 6 | Xbox 360 Gameplay", "description": "Xbox 360 Games Playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz1UQhw0O7bYUjT5VfYMImZE0XUlGHnU3\n\nPro Evolution Soccer 6, known as Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 in the United States, is a video game developed and published by Konami.
