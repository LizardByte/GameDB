The Mana Tree, the giver of mana and life for the world, burned down nine centuries prior to the events of the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the drained Mana Tree slept and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, controlled by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and its mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa'Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa'Diel is also the home of a host of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other Mana titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins.", "summary": "While incorporating action role-playing game elements from the three games which preceded it, Legend of Mana has its own distinct style of gameplay. Most notably, it gives the player the ability to shape the game's world of Fa'Diel according to his or her desires, a system which was incorporated through the use of \"artifacts,\" which are gained as the player progresses through the game. The player uses the artifacts to create different towns, dungeons, etc., called \"Lands\", to venture to and explore. This creates a non-linear gameplay, since the game is driven by a series of what would be considered side-quests in other games. Legend of Mana features three different plots which can occur simultaneously, and which do not necessarily need to be completed for the player to finish the game.\n\nLegend of Mana was a financial success in Japan. While the game garnered considerable praise for its graphics and presentation, many critics and fans were turned off by the game's lack of a main storyline.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legend-of-mana", "videos": [{"id": 6508, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "voXZwYb3Xa8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXZwYb3Xa8", "title": "Legend of Mana Official Trailer (1999, Squaresoft)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/voXZwYb3Xa8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6509, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "xfG_z1fGKZ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfG_z1fGKZ0", "title": "Legend of Mana Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfG_z1fGKZ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
