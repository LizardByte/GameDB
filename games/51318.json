Yes, the elves have returned. This time, they have decided that the North Pole is a drag in the summer so they have stowed away aboard a yacht into the tropical Pacific. God help the Pacific.\n\nPlayers of Elf Bowling: Hawaiian Vacation will note similarities between it and Elf Bowling 7 1/7: The Last Insult. In both games, you are bowling elves and can direct the direction of the ball after it is thrown. In both games, you have bonuses to help you, like increasing the size of the ball, giving the ball super speed and shrinking the size of the gutters plus dirty tricks to use against your opponent, like increasing the gutter size, oil slicks and barriers on the lane and a cloud that makes the ball unchangeable after it is thrown. Hawaiian Vacation adds a story mode in which you can read the story then play a character in a best two out of three games. The story then continues and you play another, generally more skilled, character. You continue along the story until you are beaten in two out of three games or you reach the end of the story.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 50869, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_9nnJ5dWff8"}]}
