And thy anger has pressed down upon me; and all thy cares have come down upon me. And from this bed I cry out for the kindling of thy Light!\n\nOutbreak might be best summed up as an add-on to the original SMOD that encourages the same frenzied action as it throws a generous number of hostiles at the player, especially zombies. Following its base, Outbreak's arsenal includes usual suspects like the G36 carbine, as well as less conventional ones such as a katana that gives the player a speed boost.\n\nOutbreak started off in Summer 2007 as a small, personal mod by SMOD: Tactical forum member veteran_gamer. His hobby project was later released and was well received. As time went on, others like Useful, Jen4, and IneptGuard contributed work and ideas as well.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smod-outbreak", "videos": [{"id": 121748, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_mn6KhmR8_o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mn6KhmR8_o", "title": "SMOD OUTBREAK teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_mn6KhmR8_o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
