In this timeline there is no Salem/OZ war, Grimm are a force of nature, and after team RWBY successfully graduated as Huntsman(no Fall of Beacon), but shortly after end up going their separate ways. Weiss returns to Atlas to take up her reins at the SDC, Yang travels with her partner Blake as Blake takes a bigger role in Faunus and Human politics and a counter White Fang movement. And Ruby wanders Anima being the huntsmen as she always dreamed. After a few months playing hero solo though, she's missing the close friendships and moments she had with WBY and she is re-evaluating her life choices. After a lot of begging she convinces Weiss to take time away from work, to go on a hunt. That's the backstory. The game itself focuses on Ruby And Weiss relationship post beacon and is more a collection of events that happens to the duo.", "summary": "An 2D Action Brawler based on Monty Oum & Rooster Teeth's web series RWBY.\n\nFight hoards of Grimm and other enemies as Ruby, Weiss, Blake and Yang, but you don't have to fight alone!
