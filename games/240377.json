Despite the game having a unique title, it has very few truly unique levels of its own. It was released for J2ME-enabled mobile phones in 2006.\n\nGameplay is almost unchanged from the J2ME version of Lemmings, with a few minor improvements.\n\nThere are 30 levels total compared to J2ME Lemmings's 28, split into the same three ranks as J2ME Lemmings (Fun, Tricky, Taxing) with 10 levels in each. In both games, the Taxing rank is locked until the player completes Tricky.\n\nWhile the game has a couple unique, albeit forgettable, levels, the vast majority of its levels are either taken directly from the later ranks of Lemmings (the J2ME version only had levels from the original Fun rank) or taken from Oh No! More Lemmings but reskinned with original Lemmings tilesets, much like the Mega Drive version of the original game, with most of them here taken from the Tame rank.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lemmings-return"}
