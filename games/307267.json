The enemies typically fly all over the screen during the gameplay and depending on the level they might shoot at the player's ship. Power-Downs are replaced with obstacles that include fans which will redirect the player's shots, and invulnerable enemies that can only be destroyed with balls/fruits (by shooting the balls/fruits to make them bounce across the battlefield and destroy all the enemies they touch).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bugatron-worlds"}
