Bought to us by Phoenix Games. I was expecting a lot more from this game,but when i pushed the start button i realised i was playing a badly made point n shoot coin op  conversion rip off. You get presented with some text based storyline (what else do we expect from the infamous Phoenix??) and then thrown into a slightly moveable screen in order to shoot bad guys (that just appear to run left to right) for no apparent reason at all! The game is pretty much crazy chicken x with suits of armour! As you can probably tell....im not in any rush to play this game again anytime soon! A longer playthrough will be on demand only! \nIf you want to see some more exciting Phoenix Games releases,or more retro gaming videos, please check out my channel, and subscribe\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\n\nRobin Hood 2: The Siege was released by Phoenix Games on the Sony PS2 console and was recorded with the HD PVR2 by SHLIMPOLE & WIGGY G", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ose7KxgOj28/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ose7KxgOj28/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ose7KxgOj28/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ose7KxgOj28/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Robin Hood 2: The Siege PS2 gameplay ( Phoenix Games ) 720p", "description": "Heres a first test run of Robin Hood 2 The Siege on the Sony Playstation 2.
