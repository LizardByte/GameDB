Adventure Mode takes the player from game to game automatically as each area is completed, while in Freeplay Mode he can pick any location from the map to play. As in other Dora games, actions are performed with the mouse by pointing, clicking, and dragging. * Boot's Treehouse - paint a picture of Dora's lost teddy bear to show around.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dora-the-explorer-lost-city-adventure"}
