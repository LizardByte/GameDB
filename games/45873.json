Both floppy disk-based and ROM board-based versions of the game exist. The game presents itself in a pseudo-3D setting a la T&E Soft golf games like Pebble Beach Golf Links where the screen slowly redraws itself at certain intervals in your swing.\n\nA game with the same name for the Sega Mega-CD was produced, but only released in Japan. Whether or not this is the same game is unknown.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dynamic-country-club-3d-golf-simulation"}
