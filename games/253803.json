Become a wild wolf, fight for new territories so that the wild world would know who is a real Alpha.\n\nThe main action of the game lays around realistic hunting of a variety of animals and beating the Alphas on each territory of the vast open world map. But be careful! Some animals might be very attentive, so you have to silently crawl to catch them.\nYou may also grow your pups which will help you hunt down big and fierce animals, like bears and even tigers! On the other hand, you simply can explore numerous stunning locations with your fellas, once they are grown ups.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wolf-simulator--1"}
