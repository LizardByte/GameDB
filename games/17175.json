As a commander, you will have to employ real world combined-arms tactics in order to secure victory. This means you will have to lay ambushes to surprise opposing forces, use suppressing fire to pin them, flank hostile armor for maximum effect and, if necessary, assaults the enemy to clear strong points. In some cases you will also have access to powerful off map artillery and air support with the capacity to weaken the enemy defenses or even stop an enemy attack dead in its tracks. At the same time you will have to play close attention to the morale of your own troops and use recon units to spot any hostile ambushes or flanking attacks.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-academy", "videos": [{"id": 121611, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JIYIfb92Klo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIYIfb92Klo", "title": "Battle Academy - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JIYIfb92Klo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
