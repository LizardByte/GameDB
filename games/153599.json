The remake is being developed by Phisnom and is officially endorsed as a part of The Fazbear Fanverse Initiative. It is expected to be released sometime within mid to late 2021. The game has been revealed to not just be a remake of graphical elements, but a complete remake of everything. In multiple teasers officially released by Phisnom, noticeable differences between the remake and the original have been spotted. The most notable one being the presence of The Puppet, who was planned to be in the original game, but the idea was scrapped and then recovered for Five Night's at Freddy's 2.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 51579, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "dqDHrG_MlGo"}, {"id": 51581, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "QG-trE9HubE"}, {"id": 51582, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "IHZa1ZvUL7c"}, {"id": 51583, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "lhWlGJvqKtI"}, {"id": 71791, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "oTzevEktItw"}, {"id": 71792, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "Hww9DqrQXTk"}, {"id": 71793, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "aFHzq6COuH8"}, {"id": 73180, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bk1czRZ6pXI"}]}
