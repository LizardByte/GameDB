It was the first game to use light and sound gameplay mechanics \u2013 different surfaces cause varying noise. You can use sound to your advantage - it's not only your main source of information on how close your enemies are but you can use it to distract them, for example by throwing objects. With unscripted levels, and objectives and paths altered based on difficulty settings, Thief Gold can give you hours of non-repetitive gameplay.\n\nThis extended edition includes all of the missions from the first release, as well as three new missions adapted to the original storyline, with full voice acting and new graphics. It can still be considered the first game in the Thief series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thief-gold", "videos": [{"id": 16150, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hHWYCfuPQHM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHWYCfuPQHM", "title": "Thief: The Dark Project - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hHWYCfuPQHM/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 15585, "name": "Murus"}, {"id": 2565, "name": "Guard"}, {"id": 2622, "name": "Renault"}, {"id": 488, "name": "Ramirez"}, {"id": 15576, "name": "Opera Guy"}, {"id": 15577, "name": "Opera Gal"}, {"id": 551, "name": "Servant"}, {"id": 10661, "name": "Keeper"}, {"id": 4875, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3630, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c4j0cb96bgakr88bjfvl.jpg"}, "name": "Garrett", "species": 1}, {"id": 15578, "name": "Thief 1"}, {"id": 15589, "name": "ApeBeast"}, {"id": 15580, "name": "Mage 1"}, {"id": 217, "name": "Hermit"}, {"id": 15579, "name": "Thief 2"}, {"id": 15581, "name": "Mage 2"}, {"id": 15582, "name": "Constantine"}, {"id": 1001, "name": "Prisoner"}, {"id": 15583, "name": "Viktoria"}, {"id": 15584, "name": "Cutty"}, {"id": 15587, "name": "GraniteFace"}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Hammer"}, {"id": 15586, "name": "The Eye"}]}
