(also unofficially referred to as Sorry! '98) is a 1998 video game based on the board game of the same name. It offers classic Sorry! and also a mode called Way Sorry!, where new cards are introduced, including Bully, Buddy, Punish, and Happy. The animated pawns talk, joke, and make amusing remarks during gameplay that relate with the colors' personalities. There are cutscenes as well, which show what happens afterward when a specific color wins. Rules are identical to normal play; however there are some options for \"house rules\", such as being allowed to bump teammates. Both the Classic (playing cards drawn) and Strategy (playing cards from hand) games are available.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sorry"}
