Eventually monsters start to bleed into the real world, where Ai discovers that she, too\u2026\n\nTest your courage in a dangerous game of hide and seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world. Use the items you\u2019ve gathered to flee your sunset hell, but be sure to remember the paths you\u2019ve taken or risk being trapped there forever.\n\nExperience an unnerving mix of beauty, fear and nostalgia in a mysterious world where a Japanese house, school and hospital are all inexplicably connected. Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out.\n\n10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit\u2019s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can\u2019t get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces.\n\nUpon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you.
