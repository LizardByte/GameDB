He never found his way back.\n\nNow his little brother heads to the stars in his self-built rocket to find his lost brother and to free him from the clutches of the aliens!\n\nYou\u2019ll solve twisted physics-based puzzles by rotating the cells around our heroes with your finger. And of course you\u2019ll have to use the Freeze-buttons to arrest gravity for the brothers. Sounds simple? Well, yes, it is - at first.\n\nThe basic gameplay is the same as in \u201eFreeze!\u201c, but there are many exciting extensions: In the levels you\u2019ll encounter liquids like water and deadly rocket fuel sloshing around. The brothers have to pass most levels together, fighting against lethal electric fields, smart batteries (what?!?) and slightly sadistic level design.", "videos": [{"id": 59514, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zpWlWgW54Kw"}]}
