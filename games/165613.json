Sparky is an adorably insane intergalactic bounty hunter who can dash through obstacles, fire his weapons in any direction and even extend his jumps by flapping his long bunny-like ears. Each time he brings down a boss, his connected confidante Shig (half shark, half pig) is ready to point him in the direction of yet another space fugitive. In the grand tradition of irreverent 1990s video-game heroes, Spectacular Sparky is as sassy as he is fearless. His voice-acted wisecracks and sarcastic jabs tend to get under the skin of his enemies in a most amusing fashion. And his universe is awash with spikes, lava, buzzsaws, super-saturated colors, slick parallax scrolling and mega-driven music, the way every game ought to be.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 54658, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "9jw-aud7ovE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jw-aud7ovE", "title": "Spectacular Sparky Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch/Steam/Epic)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9jw-aud7ovE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
