He spends his days not doing much of anything in particular, and feeling a vague sense that he's running out of time.\n\nOne day, his classmate and female friend Hayase Mitsuki invites him and his buddy, Taira Shinji, to a summer festival. There, she introduces him to a friend of hers, Suzumiya Haruka. Haruka is an extremely shy, introverted girl, and since Mitsuki's trying hard to make her feel like part of the gang, Takayuki does his best to make her feel comfortable as well. But for some reason, instead of thanking him, she goes out of her way to avoid him. He leaves the festival frustrated and annoyed.\n\nDays later, though, Haruka calls him out to the hill behind the school and tells him that she's in love with him. Knowing how much courage it must have taken a shy girl like her to ask him out, he says finds himself unable to say no. The two begin dating, even though he's not really interested in her.\n\nJust like he predicted, his conversations with her are strained and awkward.\nBut as time passes, the two of them grow closer, and Takayuki finds himself falling in love with her sweet, innocent nature.\n\nAnd then one day...", "summary": "\"Kimi ga Nozomu Eien\" returns as an Enhanced Edition!
