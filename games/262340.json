In Survival Bowling, you use a limited supply of bowling balls to defeat waves of bowling pins. In each wave you will complete a typical game of ten-pin bowling. Typical, that is, except for the fact that the pins are coming to snatch up all your balls!\nThe pins are alive. They have arms, legs, and cruel intentions. They will advance down the lane towards your stash of bowling balls. If they make it all the way, they will steal a bunch and try to carry them back to the pit. But if you act fast, you can bowl them over as they retreat and get the balls back!\nThe game progresses as a series of waves with increasing difficulty. As you advance you will have more lanes to manage, the pins will get quicker, and they may start surprising you with some dirty tricks! At the end of each wave, you will receive reward balls for each spare, strike, and turkey you achieved. You will need to do well to earn enough balls to make it through the next wave. If you run out of balls, you will see the Game Over screen. You may use up to 3 continues to keep going, after which the game is truly over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/survival-bowling"}
