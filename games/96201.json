Step through the door into a different world? Full of monsters, danger, adventure, and loot!?\"", "summary": "\"Sir Questionnaire is a turn-based hack\u2019n\u2019slash game, where you enter a dungeon and each room gives you two options: leave the room, or interact with what ever is in the room. This can be monsters, but also debris, treasure chests, pools of water, or just another door!\n\nTake pictures of your various encounters and complete your codex with information on the various entities that roam the dungeon.\n\nTake on Quests as you enter every game, ranging from easy to hard, with each quest type giving you a reward for your next game. The harder the quest, the bigger the reward, so choose wisely!\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sir-questionnaire", "videos": [{"id": 18914, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "QcLg-VhwZz8"}]}
