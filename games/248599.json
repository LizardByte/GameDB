In the main mode, you take a team of ten performers on a world tour, taking on challenges like \"Laser Limbo\" (where you jump over lasers), \"Pool of Lava\" (featuring a pool of lava), and \"Don't Jump Too Much\" (where the platform is a mine that will go off if you jump too much).\n\nCharacters have various stats and body types, making it important to know which to use for which challenge. For instance, the ability to slow down time is available to all performers. However, the rate at which they slow down time varies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/finesse", "videos": [{"id": 89126, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "WB7qC7tNFjs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB7qC7tNFjs", "title": "Finesse Gameplay Trailer 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WB7qC7tNFjs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
