It all returns in CastleStorm II\u2014with even more modes, more play styles, more mythical races and more\u2026sheep. \n\nAn Undead threat rises intent on vanquishing humanity, and only you can stop them. Or control these hellish monstrosities against the living if that\u2019s more your thing. We won\u2019t judge.\n\n\u2022 Bigger Genre-Blending: CastleStorm made a name for itself with a tantalizing mix of ballista-based destruction, tower defense, and in-your-face beat-em-up combat. It all returns, and is better in every way.\n     O Destroy Even More! Projecting ballistic weapons to destroy an opposing force\u2019s castle defined much of the core gameplay of the first CastleStorm. This mechanic returns with a visceral fierceness and sense of crushing weight that surpasses the original. \n     O Control Every Soldier: Once again, players can hack and slash their way through a battle using hero units \u2013 like the noble knight Sir Gavin, the wise sorceress Lady Meredith, and the not-quite-evil vampire Luna \u2013 for a direct impact on a battle\u2019s progress. But for those times when a personal touch can mean the difference between victory and defeat, players can now control individual soldiers as well.\n\n\u2022 New Metagame of Strategic Conquest: Inspired by the \u20184X\u2019 subgenre most popular in 1990s PC gaming \u2013 yet designed for accessibility for the modern gamer \u2013  CastleStorm II encourages players to explore the map, expand their territory, exploit the resources they control, and exterminate their rivals (or at least to rough \u2018em up pretty good). \n     O Liberate the Kingdom \u2013 or Destroy It: The Undead threat is quickly overtaking land once held by the Kingdom. Meanwhile, each unique faction has its own idea of what\u2019s best for the land. Only through total domination of the map by one faction can the Kingdom once more restore peace (or rest in peace, should the Undead prevail\u2026).\n     O Procedurally Generated Maps: No two campaigns are ever the same, as a map\u2019s terrain and layout changes with each new game. Fields, forests, mountains and more await. \n     O Find Secrets and Side Quests: Each map is replete with unique side encounters where your decisions may result in comradery, coin or carnage \u2013 or maybe a little of each! \n\n\u2022 Unique Campaigns and Stories: Six memorable hero characters \u2013 three from the Kingdom, three sided with the Undead \u2013 represent their own unique factions, and each hero has his or her own motivations. \n\nOther Features:\n\u2022 Multiplayer modes include quick PvP castle-destruction matches, plus cooperative and competitive campaigns spanning the entire map\n\u2022 Trademark CastleStorm charm and humor in a cartoonish medieval setting\n\u2022 Powered by Unreal Engine 4\n\u2022 Planned expansions will carry the game forward for years to come\n\n#CastleStorm2 #KFGShowcase #E32019", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBOlUXUwziM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBOlUXUwziM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBOlUXUwziM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBOlUXUwziM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OBOlUXUwziM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "CastleStorm II Announce Trailer | E3 2019 | Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, Epic Games Store", "description": "CastleStorm II is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and the Epic Games store!
