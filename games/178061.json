Hyrule is enjoying a time of peace and tranquility, but Princess Zelda suffers from a dark, recurring dream showing a shadow over a temple; a premonition of evil to come. One day, she witnesses a mysterious and brilliant light in the sky to the east. Aginah, the younger brother of the wise man Sahasrahla and now living in his old hideout near the Eastern Palace also witnesses such a light, and travels to investigate. There he finds a strange youth lying on the ground. Zelda, also following the light, meets up with Aginah, and they both carry the child to rest in Sahasrahla's hideout. Confused by the youth's unusual clothes, they believe the child not to hail from Kakariko Village. Speaking to Aginah while the youngster sleeps, Zelda learns that his brother Sahasrahla had also sensed danger surrounding Hyrule and had left the land to find the hero, Link. While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light.", "summary": "The first part (week) of BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 57314, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "m3HxP0-cCFY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3HxP0-cCFY", "title": "BS\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\u3000\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u77f3\u76e4\u3000\u7b2c1\u8a71", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m3HxP0-cCFY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
