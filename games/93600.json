Your choices will affect her opinion of you, potentially unlocking new story paths. In addition to dialogue options, you will also have opportunities to interact with Sonico through personal interactions. Be careful, as some choices can be dangerous, while others can lead to sparks of love!\n\nBecome a Photographer:\nChoose a location, put together an outfit, and get to shooting! During each photography session you must score points by shooting quality photographs as requested by the client. Your photographer's eye will show colored rings to identify the best shots. Don't get too carried away! You must also manage Sonico's enthusiasm and stamina. Lift her spirits with well-timed banter and breaks. The greater her enthusiasm, the more daring her poses!", "summary": "Motto!
