You simply cannot rely on your previous experience to guarantee safe passage.\n\nYou will need to face off against lurking, otherworldly horrors in the perilous, run-down Kowloon Walled City before its destruction in the early 90s.\n\nYou are fragile. Not just physically, but mentally as well. The grotesque creatures will challenge your very sanity and losing your mind can be a fate worse than death!\n\nThe odds are stacked steeply against you, but you can prevail through sheer cunning. You must scavenge for resources carefully, sneak past and distract your enemies. If you are caught, you can fight back, but don\u2019t expect to live for very long.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phantasmal-city-of-darkness", "videos": [{"id": 7794, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0r8Nf83Y-U0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r8Nf83Y-U0", "title": "Phantasmal: City of Darkness Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0r8Nf83Y-U0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7793, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kesJE37ck2E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kesJE37ck2E", "title": "\ud83d\udc80 Phantasmal: Terror Evolved \ud83d\udc80", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kesJE37ck2E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
