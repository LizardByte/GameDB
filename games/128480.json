Caught between East and West, Tokyo has degenerated into a brutal, crime-ridden wasteland.\n\nLike many of those reaching adulthood in this dark new world, a young man named Akira seeks some kind of meaning in the violent street fighting contest Bl@ster. But even as he rises up the rankings, he feels almost nothing. Is this all there is?\n\nIn Toshima, a district of Tokyo ruled by the mysterious syndicate Vischio, the blood sport Igra makes Bl@ster look like child's play. Competitors have the chance to win control of a drug empire worth more than in their wildest dreams, but losing a bout means losing your life.\n\nWhen Akira is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, a strange woman appears with an even stranger offer: he can regain his freedom if he fights his way to the top of Igra and destroys Vischio from within.\n\nWhat dangers and revelations await Akira on Toshima's pitiless streets? Is he strong enough to survive them?", "summary": "Akira's life has been defined by violence, but that won't be enough to save him when he's forced to play a deadly game. Will the bonds you forge in this stunning visual novel lead to his salvation, or to his ruin?\n\nThis is a remastered version of Togainu no Chi from 2005, featuring higher resolution assets and improved compatibility.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/togainu-no-chi-lost-blood", "videos": [{"id": 47331, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "apY5k_NcUJk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apY5k_NcUJk", "title": "Togainu no Chi - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/apY5k_NcUJk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
