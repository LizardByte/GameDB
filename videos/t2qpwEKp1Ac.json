I'm new to longplays, so consider this my test run. \r\n\r\nHere is Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, probably one of the most popular HE games out there. I made this one different from my other longplays in the fact that I made it very thorough by comparison. I talked to all of the baby animals and their parents, and even showed off some of the factual dialog for each animal.\r\n \r\nI also took as many pictures as I possibly could, though I didn't get all of them (it's impossible anyway, because there's also seperate photos for when the animals are rescued, so you have to leave at least one photo out). \r\n\r\nBecause I tried to make the longplay thorough, I took a very unusual route. I ended up screwing it up, as I forgot to get the rope before going to Jungle Land. I could have saved myself five minutes by getting the rope first, but it was too late by the time I had realized it. Ah well, I'm not perfect.\r\n \r\nThat's basically what I have to say.
