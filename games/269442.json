In the story of the game, Haruka has decided to make her own doujinshi (amateur fan comic). The only problem is that she's bad at drawing, but is so proud of her own work that nobody has the heart to tell her how it really is... The four themes you'll enjoy on this doujin creation adventure are \"Maid Costumes\", from Haruka's cosplay adventures, \"Doujinshi\", as she draws her own, \"Party\", as you gather with Haruka and your friends to celebrate, and \"Event\", the Comic Market-style doujin convention where Haruka finally is able to sell her books.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nogizaka-haruka-no-himitsu-doujinshi-hajimemashita"}
