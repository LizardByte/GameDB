Utilizing this new alloy, Lerman Matsunaga developed a new clean energy engine called the Buster Engine, which was globally adopted and quickly replaced fossil fuel and nuclear-based engines. With nearly all of the world's engines now being centrally powered and controlled by a fully automated computer system called BAC, the unthinkable has happened: BAC has gained intelligence and has turned against humanity.\n\nWith humanity on the verge of extinction, a secret internal division of Lerman Matsunaga had the foresight to design a special weapon against BAC: the Rolling Gun. Operated and controlled via brain implant, humanity's fate now rests in the hands of a courageous RF-42R STORK pilot who must set out to destroy BAC at the old Lerman Matsunaga building, which has been turned into a near impenetrable BAC fort. This is the last hope for humankind.\n\nAnd now the final hope takes flight...", "summary": "- Navigate across 6 stages blanketed in a hail of bullets from an unceasing onslaught of enemies and screen-filling bosses\n- Choose from 3 different STORK ships to pilot, each with unique attributes and firing patterns\n- Multiple difficulty settings allow players of all skill levels to jump in and enjoy a true bullet hell experience\n- Save Replays and use Training mode to master the Rolling Gun and learn the intricacies of each stage\n- A pulse-pounding, high-energy original soundtrack composed by COSIO (Space Invaders Extreme, Groove Coaster) perfectly complements the gameplay\n- Beautifully animated cutscenes marry gameplay and story\n- A challenging risk v reward point system will have seasoned players shooting for the top of the in-game leaderboard", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 28593, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6dwEctyDoMI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwEctyDoMI", "title": "Rolling Gunner PV English Ver", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6dwEctyDoMI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 28594, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RYFOa5bdfM4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYFOa5bdfM4", "title": "Nintendo Switch\u3000Rolling Gunner\uff08\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30ac\u30f3\u30ca\u30fc\uff09\u3000\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYFOa5bdfM4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
