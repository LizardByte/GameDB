The mod, serving as an unofficial sequel to Half-Life, told the story of Gordon's continued adventures under the G-Man's employ traveling through the Himalayas, a carnival (appropriately named \"Half-Park\"), and even back to Xen in search of the three sacred Telnorps/moths/butterflies. It was well received by players and served as a sign of the great potential to come in the future of HL1 modding.\n\nHowever, in May of 2000, Maverick suddenly withdrew the mod from their site and started asking third party hosts to take down their mirrors. The reasoning to eliminate all available downloads of Redemption on the net soon became clear. In the following months, the developers announced that Redemption would become a retail-only product in a new second revision to be called Absolute Redemption. Their previous public release was now deemed a beta version. In November of 2000, the mod finally reached store shelves as one of a number of Half-Life mods included with the CD release of Counter-Strike.\n\nWhile Absolute Redemption was eventually re-released for free in mid-2001, the decision to retract a free mod and making it available again only by purchase caused quite a commotion in the fledgling Half-Life modding community, one that you no doubt still hear about to this day. Nonetheless, in its journey from mod to retail, Redemption underwent a number of particularly notable changes. These included edits to cut copyrighted content, namely to the discontinued sponsorship from PC Zone magazine as well as the ill-fated Quake II reference, along with a few dramatically overhauled areas to improve gameplay in response to common player complaints.\n\nCredit to Barnz for historical research and assistance.\n\nThis is the original 1999 Redemption mod release:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/6lvl77lgtg8no8w/redempt.rar", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DfktJ87-els/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DfktJ87-els/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DfktJ87-els/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DfktJ87-els/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DfktJ87-els/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Absolute Redemption - Mod vs. Retail Comparison", "description": "This is a video comparison of the differences between the original mod release and the retail release in the classic Half-Life singleplayer modification Absolute Redemption.\n\nJust a bit of history: In October of 1999, a small team of modders known as Maverick Development, already known at the time for creating Drug Barons, one of the first custom HL1 map packs, released a large and ambitious Half-Life project then known as Redemption.
