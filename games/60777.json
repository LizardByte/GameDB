The game lets players build, customize and strengthen their bases for epic battles. It also allows the players to train and experience commanding an army of legendary heroes, elite soldiers, and devastating drones from the Call of Duty franchise. Gameplay differs greatly from previous games due to it being a real-time strategy game rather than a first-person shooter, making the gamplay similar to Clash of Clans. The player takes control of Units, and can also call in Heroes to help, to destroy enemy bases. While Heroes can be controlled to an extent in that they can be moved, Units can't be controlled, except for the fact that the player can choose where to place their units.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-heroes", "videos": [{"id": 111096, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AmOQNLUB2Og", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmOQNLUB2Og", "title": "Official Call of Duty\u00ae: Heroes Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AmOQNLUB2Og/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 107, "name": "Call of Duty"}]}
