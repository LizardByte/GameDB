They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy\u2019s voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra \u2013 and his way back to the seas he once knew.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is the first Zelda game for the Nintendo DS and a direct sequel to The Wind Waker. The art direction is the same cel-shaded style as the Wind Waker but is displayed from a classic top-down perspective. The gameplay is structured similarly to other games in the series and is divided into two major gameplay sections: sailing between islands and exploring the islands and their dungeons on foot. The touch screen is used to make Link move and attack instead of buttons, you can also make notes of secret treasures and items on the map simply by writing them down. The game received critical acclaim from reviewers, who agreed that the game was a worthy sequel to The Wind Waker.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-hourglass", "videos": [{"id": 15519, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-gnZGtb8c7c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gnZGtb8c7c", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass Nintendo DS Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-gnZGtb8c7c/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 9026, "name": "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"}, {"id": 106, "name": "The Legend of Zelda"}], "characters": [{"id": 9221, "name": "voice"}]}
