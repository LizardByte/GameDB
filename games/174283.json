The Cube consists of many rooms; in the center of each room there is a puzzle device; once you solve the puzzle you can unlock the doors to the adjacent rooms. But be careful! The space and time inside the Cube are intermixed; an open door can lead you to prehistoric Earth, to a dimension of unimaginable horror, or into the vacuum of open space!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mechcube-dark-stories", "videos": [{"id": 60924, "video_id": "0HLtkzoIGRM"}]}
