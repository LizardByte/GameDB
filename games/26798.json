Let's play!", "summary": "The difference in this game is that the targets are not static and their trajectories are never repeated, increasing the challenge.\r\n \r\nThe dragons of Mars want to dominate the Earth and the fireflies will combat them.\r\nThe main challenge of the game is to eliminate the dragons in a short space of time, taking care of the laser beams of flying saucers, anchors, rocks, balloons, balls and etc. But all is not lost because there are shortcuts and snails that boost the flight. \r\nThere are eight heroes to help you, each with a different characteristic. In each fight you win blue balls that can be exchanged by a new hero to your collection.\r\nThe battles occur in five scenarios (sea, beach, field, desert and park) in 60 levels.\r\nYou can dispute the punctuation with your Facebook friends.
