But the universes are collapsing on themselves and Dr. Eggman risks destroying all the worlds they harbour.\nTo prevent the destruction of the world, Sonic and Ashuro will join their forces to restore the order and return to their respective worlds.", "summary": "Sonic the Hedgehog & Ashuro is an awesome ROM hack based on the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. Created by Ashuro from SSRG (Drakughost), the game features 2 characters and 2 universes on one single screen. The game features custom and special stages with 3 acts that take place during the different time of the day. In this game, you will control both Sonic and Ashuro. The two characters have similar movement but use a different approach on various obstacles like water and high places. If you can collect 50 coins during the gameplay, you will transform into a more powerful form.
