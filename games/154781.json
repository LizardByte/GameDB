Both paint score and kills are counted toward your total score at the end of each match.\n\nYou can group up with up to 7 friends or be randomly teamed up and matched against up to 7-15 other players to battle across a variety of different maps depending on which PvP playlist you select. Before a quick play match begins you are able to vote to play on 3 randomly selected maps and gametypes. There is also a weekly PvP leaderboard that you could compete with others to reach for a top ten spot each week.\n\nThe item shop includes over a hundred different character customization options. You just need to earn the in-game currency called Chips by playing matches and completing daily and weekly challenges to be able to purchase your favorite items in the Item Shop.\n\nThere are special limited time events that have limited timed items that are available for purchase to keep even after the event is over. Some events include a limited time map that you can only play during the special events as well!\n\nYou can host custom private matches with your friends or practice on your own and test your skills against some bots!\n\nYou can also fight multiple waves of monsters and bosses in the Chippingrounds 4 player co-op playlist.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paint-chips", "videos": [{"id": 99759, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5k2FGdo5EE4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k2FGdo5EE4", "title": "Paint Chips Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5k2FGdo5EE4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
