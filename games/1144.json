It is driven by an intricate simulation that tracks ammunition and fuel, inventories for each and every unit, cover and line of sight, tank combat with penetration and deflection of shells, field of view, and much more beside.\nWhile Assault Squad is geared toward multiplayer, the new co-op Skirmish mode can be played offline without a partner.\nLike earlier games in the series, Assault Squad includes a \"direct control\" feature that allows the player to take control of any unit on the field. This allows fine control during firefights, such as priming grenades before throwing and aiming for specific parts on a tank.\nThe multiplayer uses the GameSpy client and has a built in Elo rating system. Multiplayer matches can take place on dozens of maps and between the games five factions. New multiplayer maps are being released as DLC.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/men-of-war-assault-squad", "videos": [{"id": 94594, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Y8WgcvpjHII"}]}
