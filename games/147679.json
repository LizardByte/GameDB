Viruses have the habit of moving back and forth on wires that are strung across the circuitry. Collide and destroy viruses by attracting and splitting them up. Viruses will continue to be generated indefinitely and, if left unattended, will transform into other forms. The key to clearing a stage is the player's ability to make quick decisions and efficient operations. There are three different game modes, three difficulty levels, and a random stage generation function."}
