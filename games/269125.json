It is the third installment in the MAYhem series. As with previous editions, the project aim was to create as many maps as possible within the month of May. In this edition, in the spirit of Claustrophobia 1024 and similar such projects, the maps were confined to a 2048x2048 playing space, in reference to the then largely popular video game 2048.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mayhem-2048"}
