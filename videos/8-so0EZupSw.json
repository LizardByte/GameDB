Now available via Xbox Live Arcade.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in December 2034. Global warming has taken effect, causing widespread disease and an upsurge in natural disasters around the globe. The small town of Silver City (Midwest, USA) is directly affected - mostly by a comet that has crashed into town.

Available via PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade, AMY is a survival horror/action adventure game where players must protect, and escort the eponymous Amy - an enigmatic eight-year-old autistic girl with curious powers - as they try to get her out of a city overrun with wild creatures and dangerous enemies. AMY takes place in December 2034 in Silver City (Midwest, USA) after a comet strikes, wreaking havoc on humanity and unleashing a deadly virus that has infected almost everyone. Players take on the role of Lana, who regains consciousness in the midst of all the mayhem.
