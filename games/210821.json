It uses a split-screen side-scrolling view and can be player against computer-controlled opponents or in a two-player mode. The latter allows players to choose any stage, while the former follows a linear set of levels, starting in Tokyo and advancing to the USA via China and Europe. The courses typically feature platforming sections alongside flat terrain; it is usually required to jump in a timed fashion to succeed, and jumps can vary in height and length depending on how long the player holds the correspondent key. Runners would also take falling damage in certain spots.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 76943, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "UR_HE6Bd1-E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR_HE6Bd1-E", "title": "Run Run Kyousoukyoku (\u3089\u3093\u30fb\u3089\u3093\u72c2\u8d70\u66f2) for the NEC PC-88", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UR_HE6Bd1-E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
