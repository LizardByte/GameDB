Under the normal order, departed souls were delivered to a realm appropriate to the lives they led, but now, all souls are being funneled into the Maw, where the most wicked are damned to suffer for eternity. As they seek to right the cycle and uncover the extent of Sylvanas' designs, players will forge bonds with the Covenants who hold domain over different planes within the Shadowlands.", "summary": "The veil between life and death is no more.\nWith a single act of destruction, Sylvanas Windrunner has ripped open the way to the afterlife. Azeroth\u2019s staunchest defenders have been dragged into all-consuming darkness. An ancient force of death threatens to break its bonds and unravel reality.\n\nHidden realms of wonder and horror await any who would pass to the other side. The Shadowlands is home to an entire realm of the departed; it is a world between worlds whose delicate balance preserves life and death itself.\n\nAs one of Azeroth\u2019s greatest champions, you have been granted the power to cross over in body and soul. Now you must investigate a conspiracy to unmake the cosmos, and help Warcraft legends journey back... or fulfill their ultimate destiny.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands", "videos": [{"id": 30880, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "s4gBChg6AII", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4gBChg6AII", "title": "World of Warcraft: Shadowlands Cinematic Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s4gBChg6AII/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40087, "name": "Gamescom 2020 Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "JwuLt1kBtyc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwuLt1kBtyc", "title": "World of Warcraft: Shadowlands - Official Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JwuLt1kBtyc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
