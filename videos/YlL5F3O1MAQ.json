A new gameplay trailer showcases world-first footage of a brand-new level, showing off a little more of what the game has to offer- careful use of the environment, puzzle-solving, and how light, darkness, and the rats are friend and foe in tandem. Amicia must make it to the University, past the Inquisition\u2019s worst and through a town racked with chaos - all to find a glimmer of safety in this dark, brutal world.\n\nThis is just a taste of everything that awaits in the full-game, where your wits, your ability to explore, Amicia\u2019s crafting skills, and her partnership with Hugo are all that will keep the pair alive. Hugo is not your own companion on this adventure, with those orphaned by the war and the sickness banding together to try to survive - will everyone manage to see the light of day once again?\n\nAsobo Studio and Focus Home Interactive can\u2019t wait to get A Plague Tale: Innocence into your hands on May 14, on PlayStation 4.
