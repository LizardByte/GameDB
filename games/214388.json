After the big explosion, you fall to the ground and are very badly injured. Some people find you and take you home to a small village outside the city where the citadel was built. After 3 months you\u2019re strong again and want to fight on.\n\nYou have never seen Alyx or any of the others since the explosion. But you try to find new people that will fight with you against Breen. Nobody wants to help, some are afraid, others think that Breen has learned his lesson and won\u2019t start again. It also seems that most of his organization was lost in the explosion. Then you hear that along the coast Breen is starting again and trying to take control again. So you decide to go to the coast. There you take a little boat and go along the coast so the Combine won\u2019t notice you coming.", "summary": "Coastline to Atmosphere is a big Single Player Modification for Half-Life 2.
