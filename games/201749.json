You once ruled the skies, feeling the air rush through your hair as you flew between the clouds, clothes fluttering in the wind as you raced higher and higher. However, that's all in the past now, ever since the accident.\n\nNow, completely opposite to what you once felt, the world is monotonous, gray, and dead. You find no meaning in life, as if frozen in time, now that your freedom was taken away from you.\n\nHowever, that would all come to change with three fated encounters. The appearance of an old acquaintance from the track team, a reserved class president that seems to be hiding something, and a kindred soul seeking solace in the silence.\n\nFaced with these new people who suddenly appeared in your life, you have to make the choice. Do you wallow in your failure in this monochrome prison, or do you take their hand and repaint this world?\n\nBy their side, the hands of the clock start ticking once more.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lazulight-by-your-side", "videos": [{"id": 82048, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "qe7hVYakK0s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe7hVYakK0s", "title": "Lazulight: By Your Side Opening Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qe7hVYakK0s/sddefault.jpg"}]}
