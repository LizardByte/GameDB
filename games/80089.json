On each level, you'll encounter a lot of enemies - initially dogs and ninjas with clubs and bows, but more types of enemies appear later.\n\nTo defeat them, you can slash at them with your sword. However, your ninja also has magic powers. He can spend this magical energy to toss magical projectiles at the enemies, or to restore his health. Depleted magical energy can be refilled by collecting golden spheres scattered throughout the levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-knights"}
