By following the sinful path, your followers will delight in gluttonous rituals, vain buildings, and wrathful doctrines. Invite your most loyal Followers to the inner circle of Disciples, a revamped levelling system of Follower progression.\n\nBetter Cult Life\nShiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings improve busy Cult life. Shiny poops have special effects, like yielding fruitful crops and adding XP to your broom. Levelling up your broom will make chores faster and more effective. To improve automation, there\u2019s also a new tier for the Janitor Station and the Storage Structures so your Followers will take better care of themselves.\n\nReady, Aim, Fire\nBlast heretics away with the new Blunderbuss weapon. When loaded, it fires big damage in close quarters to bring a new combat playstyle for your crusades. If you charge it up even more with a heavy attack, you can aim to snipe enemies from long range.\n\nOutfits, Options and Offspring!\nEach of your cultists can flaunt their Follower fashion at the new Tailor building. Once unlocked, each cultist can wear their own outfit, with 23 different styles to choose from. But your Cult is getting even more unique. When two Followers love each other very much, they might find an egg. Nurture the egg for it to hatch, then care for the offspring until they're ready to pledge allegiance to your Cult!\n\nJoin the flock on Discord: http://cult.link/3f4nnp7\n\n\ud83d\ude4f THE \ud83d\udc11\n\nWebsite: https://cult.link/3vdbNBa\nTwitter: https://cult.link/3f68XVC\nReddit: https://cult.link/3vdbNBa", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dsCUA_VQ5Nw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dsCUA_VQ5Nw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dsCUA_VQ5Nw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dsCUA_VQ5Nw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dsCUA_VQ5Nw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cult of the Lamb | Sins of the Flesh Launch Trailer", "description": "Play the newest update for Cult of the Lamb, SINS OF THE FLESH, on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nhttps://www.cultofthelamb.com/\n\nIn its biggest and most wicked content update yet, the Cult\u2019s tendrils extend even further with a blasphemous beneficence of quests, features, improvements and a deliciously evil new resource that rewards those leaders prepared to yield to the Sins of the Flesh.\n\nSins and Disciples\nNew progression systems add more depth and complexity to managing the Cult of the Lamb.
