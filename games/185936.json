Dark Interval doesn\u2019t include original levels found in the \u201cleaked\u201d version of Half-Life 2, and instead features brand new maps which were built from the ground up \u2013 it was decided that this was the only way to make them both stand out and be actually modern and not just modernised fix-ups.", "summary": "Dark Interval is a restoration/revision mod that lets you play Half-Life 2 as it could have been.
