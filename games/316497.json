Upon reaching their destination and crossing paths with Shadow, they'll soon find is that there is much more to these floating landmasses than meets the eye.", "summary": "From Stick Drift Studios comes Sonic Skyfall, a brand new Sonic fangame being made with the Infinity Engine framework, taking inspiration from Unleashed, Colors, Generations, and Frontiers! The very first demo is now playable, featuring the first 4 levels of the game. Each can be played as either Sonic or Shadow, and both hedgehogs have their own collectibles to find. Explore the Atlas Sky Islands in Nanite Nimbus Zone and enter the Liminal Spaces: pocket dimensions that somehow emits familiar energies.\n\nBoth Hedgehogs each have one new ability/quirk added to them to mix things up a little. Sonic still has his Bounce Bracelet as his Air Special, but can now also utilize a new Ground Special Ability called the Cylaunch. As the name implies, it is based on the Cyloop from Sonic Frontiers, except it sees Sonic instantly launching himself high into the air, while also being able to take out closeby enemies on the ground. This ability will drain 10 units of Sonic's Boost/Energy Meter, so use it with caution! Shadow's Chaos Control is his Special Ability, which also costs 10 Energy. Not only does Shadow slow down time, but he also reduces his own gravity by a very noticeable amount. With proper use of this perk, Shadow can reach unthinkable heights while cutting down times! Both characters can also fire a projectile that seeks closeby enemies at the cost of 3 Energy. Shadow will fire a Chaos Spear, and Sonic will launch a Sonic Boom Shockwave.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-skyfall", "videos": [{"id": 128734, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "iLa7p9847P8"}, {"id": 128733, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Xvq6YTaf-rk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvq6YTaf-rk", "title": "Sonic Skyfall - Fangame Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xvq6YTaf-rk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
