The terrorist cell, Fraction, is unforgiving, and it's reflected in the game with permadeath and autosaves to make going back on decisions impossible. You'll have to make difficult choices every day as the Commander of the UOD - but remember your ultimate goal is to protect civilians and to prevent panic and terror.\n\nYou can't do it alone. Using your limited funds, you must continually recruit and manage your team of professional bomb disposal experts, teach them to grow their skills, and to monitor channels and the map for suspicious activity.\n\n\nHire Screen\nYour team can get injured, get mentally stressed or ill, they can act erratically with other team members, they can lose their skills over time, and most importantly they can save the city. But it's up to you to manage which one can happen at any given time. Your team must gather Intel which can prevent terror attacks on and around the city, and allow you to send yourself or your team out on missions to diffuse bombs or arrest suspicious individuals in order to eradicate  the terrorist cell, Fraction, from the city.\n\nWho Are Fraction?\n \n\nFraction is a terrorist cell whose base of operation is somewhere within the city you reside over. They are made up of teams of hackers, bomb makers, and general anarchists whom have all come to the conclusion that in order to resolve issues of inequality and overpopulation, a vast majority of the population must be eradicated in order for humanity to continue at a diminished rate.\n\nThey see no other alternative, and while they originally set out to disrupt the accumulation of wealth for the richest 1%, they have slowly changed their doctrine to encumber more extremist measures, killing indiscriminately in order to incite fear and ultimately reduce the population down to a fraction of what it once was.\n\nFinding Fraction and Their Threats:\n\nAs your team gather Intel, you'll be able to pinpoint locations of interest, such as where Fractions Members meet, where they assemble bombs, and most immediately pressing, where they have planted a bomb.\n\nA Single District of the Map\nThe map consists of many districts, each with their own attributes, landmarks, municipals buildings, functions, and classes. This determines whether or not they are likely to be under immediate threat by Fraction, as the terrorist cell adopts a different tactic every other week to disrupt your operations, and eliminate human life.\n\nFor instance, as Fraction was founded upon disrupting the lives of the socially elite, they may initially still target richer districts at first. However, their tactics have grown so indiscriminate over time, that no where is safe.\n\nStory Building:\n\nIn \"Don't Go Bang!\" concerned citizens and members of UOD will email you regularly about the state of the city, and the state of your management skills. This is the primary way you directly build relationships in the game, with each email having multiple responses to cater to your own style of management, and your own intentions for how your relationship develops with that person. There is no \"Just Good\" or \"Just Bad\" answer. We want to embrace the grey area of dealing with a complex and frightening scenario.\n\nEmail System\nAs you build relationships, the content of each email differs as every person remembers who you are and what you've said. Choose to be unkind because you don't have the time, and it might come back to bite you later. Equally, be too soft and people might find it acceptable to walk all over you. Remember, YOU are in charge.\n\nUltimately, you are responsible for the protection of the city. As such, if you continue to fail on a regular basis, you will be petitioned to be replaced by the citizens of the city, as they work themselves into a panic and a frenzy. They will make life continually more difficult for you. If they succeed in having you removed from office, the game, and the city, is lost.\n\nDo not fail them. Do not fail your loved ones. Do not let Fraction win.\n\n\n\nCurrent Features: (In The Mobile Game)\n\nProcedural Bomb Generation\nWire Cutting Puzzle Variations (Cut All Yellow Wires, Cut Third Wires etc.)\nMultiple Tiers Per Bomb (Multiple Levels/Sections to each bomb.)\nPlanned Features: (For The PC Game)\n\nMassively improved visuals - We'll be able to hire an artist better than ourselves to give the games art a complete overhaul to capture the intensity of the situation, whilst still capturing the games dark humour moments too.\nPanic - The purpose of the game is to respond to terrorist threats, suspected/potential/otherwise. Failure to do so will result in increased panic in the city, and as this grows the citizens can petition to have your funds lowered, or to have you removed completely, resulting in Game Over.\nComplex Bomb Disposal - With the limitation of a single tap used in mobile games being lifted, we can make the bomb disposal process much more complex and interesting. This includes requiring certain tools to perform certain actions.\nRules/Instructions - The rules of bomb disposal will change depending on how quickly Fraction is improving their bomb making skills. It's upto your team to gather Intel to give you the new list of instructions as quickly as possible. E.g. You may be told to always cut the first red wire, and then one day that rules changes...\nFull Map - A huge interactive Map with different districts that have different functions for the city. As events/festivals/celebrations come up, the population density of an area may change, and you'll have to work harder to protect these areas.\nManage and Build your team - Hire people you trust and build them up to be the best they can be at bomb disposal. You cannot afford to use them sparingly, but be careful as once they're dead, they stay dead.\nConnection to the Citizens - You receive regular emails and communications from concerned or supportive citizens in the city regarding the recent events. You can make dialogue decisions on how well you should inform the public or build relationships with people. Be careful though, as you fail missions, those you care about can perish.\nShop - You are able to customise your office space that you work in, as well as buy new equipment for yourself and your crew.\nResearch - As Fraction grows, and their bomb making prowess increases, it\u2019s your job to stay one step ahead, so you\u2019d have to recruit avid researchers to provide you with the latest tools and equipment to deal with the threats.\nScanner/Send Investigation Team \u2013 As briefly mentioned, the map displays information about the city currently, but in order to find bombs there has to be a process to do so. You can do this by scanning for suspicious signals, or physically sending an investigation team (at your expense) to reconnoitre the area and report back if there are threats or potential threats.\n\n\nBreakdown of Funds for Don't Go Bang!\nPart of our commitment to being open and honest regarding everything about this endeavour means going over exactly where your pledges will be going towards. On our part, we've designed the game for a long time, and came up with exactly what it is and could be back when it was a mobile game, and what it is now! \nAs such, you might be wondering while Design gets less of a cut than Art and Programming, but the truth is we did a lot of the Design work off our own funds, but it still needs Playtesting which comes under Design, and also various tweaks - a lot of the time a Programmer makes it work, but a Designer makes it feel right. Equally, while the Writing Budget is low, it's because this also comes under Design at times, so it's actually difficult to pinpoint.\n\n\n We'll be humbled immensely if we reach our goal of \u00a320,000, but if the unimaginable were to happen and we go beyond that, we've carefully selected a number of stretch goals to help make \"Don't Go Bang!\" an even better experience.\n\n\nStretch Goals for Don't Go Bang!\nEither way, we'll strive to make \"Don't Go Bang!\" an amazing experience, with incredible gameplay and an engaging, unforgettable story.", "summary": "Don't Go Bang is the first full PC title brought to you by Dalriada Games.
