Top Gunner was played sitting down in a full cockpit-style motion cabinet. The motion of the player's seat followed the action of the flight simulator-style gameplay, providing the player a unique, immersive arcade experience. The player interacted with the machine via a dual-axis flight yoke, a throttle lever, and the standard coin slot, start, and fire buttons.\n\nThe game Vertigo, produced roughly two years before prior to Top Gunner, is thought to be its prototype. Vertigo was shopped around but never picked up due to poor location test results and excessive hardware costs."}
