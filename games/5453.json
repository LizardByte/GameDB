A horror in the dreaded shape of the Myrkoids, an alien species older than the stars themselves, with a unified mind far colder than the spaces between those stars. The Mykroids - killers of worlds - descend on unsuspecting star systems, sucking them dry and draining every planet of its internal energies.\n\nBryk Hammelt, the last of a noble race of warriors known as the Cryo-commandos, set out in his great starship, the Treaghon, to hunt down the merciless Myrkoids.\n\nHe has hunted them for centuries. For eons he has followed, and they have always eluded him.\n\nUntil now.", "summary": "Soulstar for the Sega CD/Mega CD is a 3D shoot-'em up that combines several different types of gameplay into one game. Some levels in this game are on a fixed path, similar to Space Harrier or Star Fox. Other levels allow your space craft to hover freely around a 3D environment, and in other levels your craft transforms into a walker robot for close-up attacks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soulstar", "videos": [{"id": 114116, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rObi13jlNy4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rObi13jlNy4", "title": "Mega-CD Longplay [092] Soulstar", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rObi13jlNy4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
