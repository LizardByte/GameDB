{"id": "EpfG6Z0nBSE", "snippet": {"title": "NIGHTLINGS - Early Access Trailer - Wishlist on Steam", "description": "Nightlings is a first person, fast-paced survival horror game, where you play as a 10 year old child, left home alone for the weekend while your parents handle a family emergency out of town. Initially thrilled by the freedom, your excitement fades quickly as midnight approaches. Strange, goblin-like creatures from forgotten neighborhood folklore appear outside, intent on breaking into your home to slaughter you.\n\nYour goal? Run, Secure, and Survive. Run around your house, blocking off all entries to secure your home from the Nightlings, and survive the nights until 7 AM.\n\nEach night will get progressively more intense, with more entrances opening up. You'll have to strategize your movements to get to each entrance and block off the Nightlings before it's too late.\u00a0\n\nNote from the devs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game was made by a group of game dev college students in the span of only 4 months!
