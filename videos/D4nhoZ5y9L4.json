The Leggites developed martial arts and now live in peace with the local fauna. But the spheroids have turned to organized crime. \n\nTheir boss, Chunga, uses violent thugs to control his territory and keep a boot on the neck of the local population.

Players have a dynamic set of moves that include a standard kick, a jump kick, and a roll maneuver that can be combined in unique ways to create engaging combat encounters. Players can also pick up two projectile items that further extend combat choices.\n\nThere are eight unique boss battles, multiple enemy types, and an entire alien world to explore and liberate.
