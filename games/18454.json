The ruins of Oakmarsh are no different. Their telling silence, the dust blanketing what was once a quiet village near Coventry. If you walk among the ruins you can easily imagine what it was like. The small black dots of the Luftwaffe getting bigger by the minute. The whistling of the dive bombers approaching on that fateful day of February 1941. And if you touch the charred wood, you can even hear the warning calls and the waves of panic resonating through time. And then again, maybe you\u2019ll hear nothing at all. Maybe you\u2019ll only feel the weight of the silence, broken only by the wind in the branches of old trees. Maybe you\u2019ll only feel the weight of this unanswered question: could that fateful attack explain what happened here? Is it enough to explain why the whole population fled the village? That\u2019s when you look beyond the village limits, when you look up and see its shape: Blackwood Manor. Behind its gates, the silence of Oakmarsh takes on a different taste. Icy, metallic, faint, swollen with secrets that won\u2019t stand still. Blackwood. The name of a manor and the family that lived within. A perverted and mad lineage, a clan whose final members devoted their life to mysticism and fanatical experiments. I am Abigail. Abigail Blackwood. Recently risen from the grave, I know nothing about the last 40 years of my family\u2019s history... But obviously somebody is keen on seeing me lift the veil on what happened in Oakmarsh - to what led to the downfall of Blackwood Manor. And it seems like I have no choice in the matter\u2026", "summary": "Goetia is a point-and-click adventure game \u2013 and, as in any adventure game, you\u2019ll be seeking out clues, finding objects, and figuring out how to use or combine them in order to progress through the different areas, puzzles and encounters. However, there is one major difference compared to other adventure games that you might be used to. In Goetia, you play the part of Abigail, the ghost of a young lady. And as a ghost, you can walk through walls and fly through ceilings, you can explore everywhere as you see fit. But\u2026 to manipulate objects, you\u2019ll have to possess them, just like a real poltergeist would. And once you possess an object, you can\u2019t pass through walls anymore.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/goetia", "videos": [{"id": 7585, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "v7uJVNp7ps4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7uJVNp7ps4", "title": "Teaser Goetia", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v7uJVNp7ps4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7584, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "T9HdQnAFjdA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9HdQnAFjdA", "title": "Goetia - Gameplay trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T9HdQnAFjdA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 8676, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4XrdceBdHWk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XrdceBdHWk", "title": "Goetia - Available Now on Steam!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XrdceBdHWk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7586, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p2dJLEWDqlo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2dJLEWDqlo", "title": "Kickstarter campaign trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2dJLEWDqlo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
