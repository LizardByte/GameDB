She now lives with him (as his sister) and his father in a mansion in Japan. Because she wants to see more of the world (other than the mansion you live in, that is), she wants to mingle with humans and go to school (yeah, there are other ways, but sneaking out at night and saving a random boy and meeting a guy who can turn into a werewolf without father dearest knowing where his daughter is just did not go down well). So, assuming a human form, Little start hanging out and becoming friends with humans and other creatures of the night. Between the studying and fighting demons that randomly appear, she is being chased by both a vampire hunter and a mad scientist. Not only that, but apparently she also became the perfect candidate for bride of the underworld's demon lord who wants an heir (though if the lord has his way, Little will die in the process of giving birth).\r\nGrow close to friends and enemies, open their hearts and find routes to new adventures.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Karin changed artist for this game. At first I thought this was regrettable (I loved the art for Animamundi), but I quickly got used to it. Just like I got used to the Lolita like main character.\r\n- Luckily, the soundtrack still rocks.\r\n- The game has a decent length (meaning it takes quite some time to finish all routes) and is fairly hard with lots of options and paths to take. (I am still missing 1 scene and 2 CGs)\r\n- The story takes twists and turns and differs slightly from character to character. It is so much fun to learn more about the other characters, see what makes them who they are. You actually start to care for them. Well done, Karin!\r\n- Again, there is a timer to force you to choose quickly.\r\n- I wanted to stab Karin when I learned of the PS2 release. I had just finished the PC version and regretted the lack of route for one major character when I found out that the PS2 version --does- have a route for him. Not only that, but it also has extra endings for one of my favourite characters and extra scenes and CGs.\r\n- Every character is voiced, including your character. The voice acting is also very well done. I found it both brilliant as well as hilarious that the voice actor for your father in this game was Mephistopheles in Animamundi and that they got a new voice actor for this game's Mephistopheles.\r\n\r\nFav Character: Inukai, Franken, Chesha, Hellsing, Phantom, Little, Prince Chaos Crimson", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lqn2FTiC2kM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lqn2FTiC2kM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lqn2FTiC2kM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 \u30fb Princess Nightmare - PC Game Opening", "description": "Game title -- \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2\r\n(romaji) -- PrincessNightmare\r\nAge rating -- All ages\r\nGenre -- Visual Novel (Interactive novel game) / Otome\r\n \r\nCompany and Copyright -- Karin Entertainment\r\nRelease date -- 2007-04-27 (J -- PC) / 2008-05-22 (J - PS2)\r\nWebsite -- http://www.nightmare.co.jp/index02.htm\r\n\r\nSong title -- \u6771\u4eac\u30b8\u30aa\u30e9\u30de\r\n(romaji) -- Tokyo Diorama\r\nArtist -- \u7247\u9727\u70c8\u706b (\u6b4c/\u4f5c\u8a5e/\u4f5c\u66f2),\u3000HIR (\u7de8\u66f2)\r\n(romaji) -- Katakiri Rekka (Singer/text/composition), HIR (arrangement)\r\n\r\nGame plot:\r\nYou are Little, a vampire who was turned 100 years ago at age 14 by a young vampire (at that time 416 years old) named Radou.
