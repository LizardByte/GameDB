The game is a life-simulation game and it comes as a pseudo-sequel to the earlier-broadcast (July 1996)/retail release Bokujou Monogatari, commonly known internationally as \"Harvest Moon\"; this has given the series the fan-nickname \"BS Harvest Moon\" as a result. Together with the game (typically immediately before and after), 10-minute broadcasts of a related nature were released entitled BS Bokujou Monogatari Torisetsu (a digital instruction manual) and Bokujou Monogatari no Kekka (a score/results program). It stars Yoshitake Tanaka as voice actor.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "videos": [{"id": 58676, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ho5hu0X1Dyw"}]}
