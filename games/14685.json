The scattered survivors of mankind come out of their hiding holes and seek out new hope. But they are not the only ones seeking to survive. The many mystical creatures lurking in the shadows are not keen for man to reclaim his place. It is up to you to lead your men away from doom and into the light\u2026\n\nThere are no heroes, no monster slayers, and no great armies ready to banish the dark forces that plague Thea. Just a few hopeless and starving survivors, who are desperately trying to stay alive. And you: their only true hope.\n\nIn Thea: The Awakening you take on the role of a god, a patron of a small group of survivors, hopelessly trying to lead your flock through the many risks and dangers that plague Thea. Only your skill and judgement will determine whether you can save mankind from eternal Darkness.\n\nThere are five key elements to gameplay in Thea: Village Management & Crafting, Resource Gathering, Card Minigame, Story Driven Events and Exploration.\n\nManage your village\n\nYou will need to decide how to best use the limited resources at your disposal, both in terms of supplies and manpower. You may choose to devote more men to building a new house, but then who will go out and find the resources? Or on the flip side, if you send out too many people, will your village be safe? Thea: The Awakening will based on a Day Turn and a Night Turn and during the long nights, your village is exposed to all manners of encounters and events, including simple attacks by hungry scavengers, or a mystical plague brought on by the Night Horrors\u2026\n\nSend out parties to seek out resources\n\nSending out scouting parties is not just a matter of choosing the direction. Many events will have different outcomes or dialogue options depending on who is in your party, so choose wisely! A wise woman may be frail and thus you risk loosing her on the road, but if you come across an unknown creature, she may be the one to save your hide!\n\nEnter into a unique card minigame\n\nResolve combat, social encounters, physical challenges, disease and more! Your people become your deck as you face your challenge in the tactical card minigame, so choose your party wisely!\n\nDiscover the many strange creatures lurking in the shadows\n\nYes, there is an abundance of creatures, both beast and man, who will inevitably attack your parties and village, for treasure, for the kill or simply out of hunger and desperation. But, not all of your encounters must end with a fight, nor will all fights start off in an obvious way! You may meet a lost child and wonder if it\u2019s a trick, or you may meet a beast and end up talking it out\u2026 Will those flickering lights in the distance offer guidance and warmth, or will they lead you astray?\n\nExplore the map and discover new locations\n\nOur maps are randomly generated, so with each playthrough you will get a whole new world to explore! There will be forgotten ruins, forlorn forests, misty swamps or hazardous mountains, where the legends say, Orcs run amok\u2026", "summary": "Thea: The Awakening is a survival game in a Fantasy setting with hexagonal, turn-based strategic gameplay!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thea-the-awakening", "videos": [{"id": 6279, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cRO7n9hpKig", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRO7n9hpKig", "title": "Thea: The Awakening - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cRO7n9hpKig/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 27442, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fnZLdTSrEKI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnZLdTSrEKI", "title": "Thea: The Awakening - Return of the Giants DLC trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnZLdTSrEKI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
