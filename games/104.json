World was released worldwide on July 27, 2010. However, people who ordered a \"Starter Pack\" had an early \"head-start\" in the game, which started on July 20, 2010.\nNeed for Speed: World, along with other EA free-to-play titles Battlefield Heroes, Battlefield Play4Free, and FIFA World, went offline on July 14, 2015.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-world", "videos": [{"id": 118248, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cpmw_eTphFU"}]}
