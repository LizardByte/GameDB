One follows a standard RPG route of a hero's journey, another involves the princess of the kingdom of demons as she attempts to uncover an attack on her father's throne with a band of allied monsters, and the third involves a thief who steals money from monsters and gives it to beggars. Each campaign follows the core gameplay of the series: overworld exploration and turn-based combat.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/momotaro-densetsu-gaiden-dai-1-shu"}
