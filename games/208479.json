In the year 20XX, the world was at peace for the time being, all thanks to Mega Man putting an end to Dr. Wily's schemes once more. During this time, Dr. Light had developed a new prototype technology to enhance Mega Man's memory and copy abilities called the \"Mega Data\". He intends to use the data to bring back all his previous creations to destroy Mega Man and take over the world. Using the Mega Data, Dr. Wily even created eight original Robot Masters as a part of his new Mega Data Number (MDN) series. Now it is up to Mega Man to stop him, save Rush, and put to stop to Wily's evil scheme again.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-eternal", "videos": [{"id": 90386, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HnXYPhwK1To", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnXYPhwK1To", "title": "Mega Man Eternal: Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnXYPhwK1To/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
