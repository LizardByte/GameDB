One of the descendants happens to be Princess Zelda, who informs Link of her plight. Armed with a trusty sword and shield, Link begins a journey that will take him through treacherous territory.\n\nFour Swords\nA long time ago in Hyrule, there was a hero who used a legendary sword called the Four Sword to defeat the sorcerer Vaati and trapped him into the sword. After the battle, people built a shrine to protect it. Several years later, princess Zelda noticed that Vaati might have escaped from the blade of the Four Sword and asked Link to come to the Four Sword shrine to check with her. As soon as they came there, Vaati captured Zelda and carried her away. Some little fairies later told Link that princess Zelda was at Vaati's palace up on the sky. In an attempt to recuse Zelda, Link dragged the Four Sword and it created three more Links! The Links then began their adventure to save Zelda.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords features two games, a port of the SNES game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and a new multiplayer adventure called Four Swords.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-and-four-swords", "videos": [{"id": 39533, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SbSaka9DGFw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbSaka9DGFw", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past trailer (GBA)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SbSaka9DGFw/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39534, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "vBUv85g3o84", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBUv85g3o84", "title": "Game Boy Advance Longplay [091] The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vBUv85g3o84/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39535, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "44F5vWWk0kE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44F5vWWk0kE", "title": "Legend of Zelda Four Swords(Full game)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/44F5vWWk0kE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
