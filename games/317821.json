It was said that He came to\npurge the world of evil and bring\nscholarship and enlightenment to those\nthat sought it.\n\nIn those days the world had been a\nterrible place ruled by barbarian\nchieftains on land and ruthless pirates\nat sea.\n\nLord Azriel brought order to the\nchaos and created the roots of\ncivilisation by forming a world of\njustice and equality and inspiring men\nto strive for a better life through\ncommerce and trade.\n\nSince His passing however, His\ndeeds were gradually forgotten. Pirates\nwere rife once more upon the oceans,\nslavery became a profitable business\nand thieves and cut throats infested\nevery city.\n\nHis good works were remembered\nonly to a few faithful followers who,\nnow outcast by society as religious\nzealots, were forced to confine\nthemselves to a small island where they\ncould lead a monastic and simple life.\n\nThey raised an immense tower and\nwithin its walls the servants lived,\nworked, prayed and died.\n\nAlthough the servants of Azriel\nled a simple life, as an order they\nwere far from poor.", "summary": "A superb graphic fantasy role playing/trading game. You start the game as a new captain of a merchant ship at anchor just outside the port of Aron's Bay. Your first ship is just a coastal vessel and unsuited to the rigours of travel across the vast oceans, but make a profit from your trading around the coastal ports and you'll soon be able to buy yourself and your men a larger, ocean-going vessel.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-curse-of-azriel", "videos": [{"id": 127659, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "i59QzFUoWqA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i59QzFUoWqA", "title": "ATARI ST the Curse of Azriel By A A Covell & Lapd LICENCEWARE NOT PD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i59QzFUoWqA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
