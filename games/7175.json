Imagawa Yoshimoto from Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends returned in the expansion with an updated character design, and Shibata Katsuie and Sasaki Kojiro from Samurai Warriors 2 Empires are also playable and have new weapons. Shibata Katsuie wields two hand axes, while Sasaki Kojiro still carries a nodachi, but can now summon an ex-dimensional sword during battle. Because Imagawa Yoshimoto was put back into the game, the previously omitted Battle of Okehazama is brought back, and Hideyoshi's Shikoku campaign against Chosokabe Motochika is also included.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-warriors-2-xtreme-legends", "videos": [{"id": 6845, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wVODdL0RfAw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVODdL0RfAw", "title": "SAMURAI WARRIORS 2: XTREME LEGENDS (PS2) TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVODdL0RfAw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 34003, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "ESvsCjRps8Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESvsCjRps8Q", "title": "PS2\u3000\u6226\u56fd\u7121\u53cc2\u731b\u5c06\u4f1d\u3000OP\u30c7\u30e2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ESvsCjRps8Q/sddefault.jpg"}]}
