With this kind of work you can make good money, because car owners have to pay a pretty penny to redeem their car. So it's high time to get on the gravy train.\nBut watch out - you have to drive the tow truck yourself and in narrow streets car body damage happens too easily. Such incidents are not only annoying but also expensive. Only those who get their job done quickly and accident-free can expand their business."}
