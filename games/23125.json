The Mercury blob itself has now been given an overhaul and has 4 varying 'states' - Normal, Solid, Fast and Slow. These states allow for larger more complex levels, which in turn mean a greater challenge and more enjoyment to be had for the player. The number of levels has more than doubled - now 160+, and with the newly added feature of Downloadable Content more levels will be made available at a later date. Wireless 2 Player modes have also been an important addition, with 5 sub games each providing a challenge against the computer or a friend.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mercury-meltdown", "videos": [{"id": 36325, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XZUmiNZ57FU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZUmiNZ57FU", "title": "Mercury Meltdown Sony PSP Trailer - Mercury Meltdown Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZUmiNZ57FU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
