The player controls a contemporary team of mercenaries who are not only characterised by a set of skills or equipment, but also personal traits, what makes each of them a memorable individual.\n\nThe game content was intended to start a scandal. In addition to violence of close combat between cold blooded mercenaries, mobsters and corrupted policemen, expect vulgar language, adult themes (including prostitution or homosexual sex acts - that's how your team \"blows off the steam\", apart from taking drugs and drinking alcohol to excess). Game creators wanted to laugh up or at least parody everything: ranging from pop culture to church and politicians.
