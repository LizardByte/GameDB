Summer vacation has ended, and she has started high school! To her suprise, she finds out that her three friends, Shun Kurosawa, Shinogu Hakuba and Hikaru Akagi are all in the same class as her. After class they are talking when suddenly, the wind kicks up, and pages from her manga go flying everywhere! She and her friends all try to help her collect them from around their school. Suddenly, after finally collecting her drawings, she falls down the stairs. When she wakes up in the nurses office, she can't remember anything! As Nono continues to go about her life drawing and doing schoolwork, she hangs out with her friends and will eventually regain her memories and maybe... love? The game is mostly made up of conversations between Nono and one of the boys, and then afterwards a test of her memory of the thing they just talked about, or a small mini game. If Nono is successful, she regains some of her memory, and gets a puzzle piece for that boy's puzzle. A new puzzle piece is introduced each month, and the game plays out in a week by week system.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ore-sama-kingdom-ikemen-kareshi-wo-get-shiyo-moe-kyun-school-days", "collections": [{"id": 7901, "name": "Ore-sama Kingdom"}]}
