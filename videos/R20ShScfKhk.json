Meen is a fangame by Ralorche. Like with Mario 5 a Day, expect some weird stuff to happen. There's even a Chapter that's specifically Sonic related, and after you beat it, you have to go into a chapter menu by putting in the password \"WHY\". I of course, tried out Chapter -2 since it was after -1, and it also contains one of the credits you're supposed to get for the game. After that, I played Chapters 2 through 6, each of course playing in order. After Chapter 6, you beat the game with the normal credits. Like with Mario 5 a Day, I recommend trying this fangame out for yourself, it's pretty fun and pretty interesting at the same time.\nDownload: https://mfgg.net/index.php?act=resdb&param=02&c=2&id=35139", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R20ShScfKhk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R20ShScfKhk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R20ShScfKhk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R20ShScfKhk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R20ShScfKhk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "British Mario VS I.M.
