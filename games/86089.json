Their orders are given the topmost priority, such that it is common practice for the 666th to ignore allied distress calls that will result in deviation from their original mission, even if only for a short moment.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/schwarzesmarken", "videos": [{"id": 56451, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-TOlNWbU1A0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TOlNWbU1A0", "title": "\u30b7\u30e5\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30c4\u30a7\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30b1\u30f3 \u7d05\u8840\u306e\u7d0b\u7ae0 OP \u300c1983-Schwarzesmarken-\u300d - fripSide", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-TOlNWbU1A0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1575, "name": "Muv-Luv"}]}
