The scenario mode is equipped with novice guidance, so that you can quickly understand various operations and simple equipment operation. Sandbox mode has 4 different difficulties and numerous random islands for you to challenge.\n\nPlot mode background\nThe West Island is a small island country. It has to be relocated due to the volcanic recovery. However, due to its self-sufficiency, the West Island does not have enough funds to purchase the required islands. In the case of insufficient funds, the only foreign student in the West Island played by the player started the development journey, and added value to the capital with his own knowledge and ability until he could buy enough islands to accommodate all the islanders.\n\nIslands\nSandbox mode has numerous random islands. According to the size and type of islands, terrain, minerals, livestock and crops will be generated randomly, which ensures that every challenge can bring a brand-new experience!\n\nBreed\nAt present, there are four kinds of livestock that can be cultivated. Chicken, duck, sheep and cattle are respectively corresponding to four basic products: eggs, duck down, wool and milk. Through the processing of these four basic products, more processed products such as cakes, chocolate milk, sweaters and down jackets will be produced. In the future, we will expand more types of processed products and increase the types of livestock.", "summary": "Set management, strategy, planning, breeding elements as one.
