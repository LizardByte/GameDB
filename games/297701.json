Don\u2019t forget to bring your gardening shears.\n\nMeanwhile, in Appalachia, the Russo family has evicted the Mothman cultists and turned the Ingram Mansion into a swanky night club. They seem to be doing well after escaping their blood-stained past in Atlantic City, but beneath the surface of their glamorous exterior, the Russos are harboring some dark secrets, and they need your help.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to dig into in this update, and along with new quests, we are introducing free exploration of Atlantic City! There are even new side quests that you can pick up from the ever-optimistic Jeremiah Hopkin\u2019s bulletin board in the Whitespring Resort, so make Atlantic City your next vacation destination. Take your time, wade through the flooded streets, stroll along the boardwalk and stop to smell the Overgrown.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fallout-76-atlantic-city-americas-playground", "videos": [{"id": 111544, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "g3vcQhFgmM8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3vcQhFgmM8", "title": "Fallout 76: Atlantic City - America's Playground Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g3vcQhFgmM8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
