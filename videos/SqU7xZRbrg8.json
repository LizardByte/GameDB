It's an open world RPG that brings a new approach to the genre.

You can't overpower armies single handedly, you have to be clever and prepared.\n\nMoreover, Outward can be played both solo or coop, either locally in splitscreen or online.\n\nTo learn more, check out our website at www.ninedotsstudio.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SqU7xZRbrg8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SqU7xZRbrg8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SqU7xZRbrg8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SqU7xZRbrg8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SqU7xZRbrg8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Outward Pre-Alpha Trailer E3 2015", "description": "Outward is the third project for Nine Dots Studio.
