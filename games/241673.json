Developer \u0141ukasz Kur and musician Robi put together the game in aid of the 2016 Cowlitz Gamers for Kids Expo, an event organised by popular retro gaming YouTuber John Hancock plus friends Chelsea Beck and Jonathan Rose.\n\nThe Cowlitz Gamers\u2019 Adventure casts you in the role of youngster Justice as he delves into some mysterious caves in search of gold. Following the format of classic 8-bit single-screen platformers, your goal is seemingly simple: collect all the gold before the time runs out.\n\nNaturally, accomplishing this goal is anything but simple, as there are scores of obstacles and dangerous creatures just waiting to make Justice\u2019s life miserable. With no way to fight back, Justice will have to avoid these various perils on his quest if he wants to survive long enough to spend all his shinies!\n\nIn classic 8-bit platformer style, all of the obstacles in your path run on strict, set patterns. When you start a new level, take a moment to watch how everything moves in relation to one another, and you\u2019ll soon be able to spot an opportunity to get through safely. Even the most seemingly impenetrable obstacles have a safe path through \u2014 but thinking of a plan is just half the battle. Then you have to execute it, of course!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-cowlitz-gamers-adventure"}
