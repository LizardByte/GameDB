Instead of using analog controllers to control the katamari as in the home console Katamari games, players roll the katamari by tilting the phone in the direction they want the katamari to go.", "summary": "Katamari Damacy Mobile (\u584a\u9b42\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb, Katamari Damashii Mobairu, lit. \"Clump Spirit Mobile\") is a video game developed by Namco Bandaifor the Mitsubishi P904i series of mobile phones for NTT DoCoMo. It was released in June 2007 in Japan. It is a spin-off of the \"Katamari Series\", the second game on a portable system and the third game produced without the involvement of series creator Keita Takahashi.\n\nThis version of the game uses a unique method of control, by making use of a software technology called GestureTek EyeMobile to make phones capable of detecting vibration via the built in camera on the P904i. The player is able to move the katamari ball forward, backwards, left and right by merely tilting the phone.\n\nThere are also traditional controls as an option to the default motion controls.\n\nKatamari Damacy Mobile will come pre-installed on P904i model phones. Other phone models need to download the game through the Namco Games channel.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/katamari-damacy-mobile", "videos": [{"id": 87083, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ezt5Bszb52M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezt5Bszb52M", "title": "G4TV Katamari Damacy Mobile Gameplay Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ezt5Bszb52M/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
