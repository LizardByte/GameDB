As your legend grows, you will recruit additional adventurers to assemble a powerful, sprawling faction and bring it under your control.\n\nYou begin the game as a lowly beggar, newly drafted into the kingdom\u2019s army to fight the growing scourge of Enthralled; magic-infused creatures formed by corrupted shards of spiritual energy. You soon find yourself thrust into an epic struggle with the god-like High Spirits and the warring factions that worship them. Using your powerful ability to Soul Bind, you can absorb and swap between four unique adventurers on the fly, each with special skills, weapons, and combat styles. You will need every trick and magical ability you can muster to guide your faction in uncovering the origins of the Enthralled blight and ultimately decide the fate of the kingdom.\n\n*Join us on Discord:*\nhttps://discord.gg/HhbUXB3uVp\n\n*Follow us on socials:*\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ArsNotoriaGame\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ArsNotoriaGame/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/arsnotoriagame/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@playarsnotoria\n\n#survivalgame #actionrpg #sandbox #fantasy #arsnotoria #arsnotoriagame #coop #craftinggame  #openworld #rpg #steam", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xGZamG_zJ3w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xGZamG_zJ3w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xGZamG_zJ3w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xGZamG_zJ3w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xGZamG_zJ3w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ars Notoria - Announcement Trailer", "description": "*WISHLIST ARS NOTORIA NOW!*\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074620/Ars_Notoria/\n\nArs Notoria is a fantasy, survival-action RPG set inside an open world sandbox where you can hunt possessed creatures, solo or cooperatively with friends, and defeat them with mastery of unique schools of magic to create mighty enchanted artifacts.
