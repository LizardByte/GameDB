In order to play the game, you have to wave the baton at the right speed and with the right amount of force in order to match the game's desired tempo and volume for the length of a song. Depending on how accurate you are with each swing, the game will either grant or subtract points and if you run out of points, you'll fail the song. At the end of a song, you're ranked based on your overall accuracy. The game is divided into Rehearsal and Concert modes that each have their own sets of songs from famous composers. In each mode, you need to complete three songs before the credits will roll. Once songs are played in the main modes, you can replay them as you please in the Free Mode and also read information on each of the game's featured composers.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-maestromusic", "videos": [{"id": 117146, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6WRcR3km6hE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WRcR3km6hE", "title": "The Maestromusic (PS1): Interesting Conducting Simulator [Playstation Project]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6WRcR3km6hE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
