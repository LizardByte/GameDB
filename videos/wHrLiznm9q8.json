{"id": "wHrLiznm9q8", "snippet": {"title": "Super Metroid Redux - Hack Showcase", "description": "This is an excellent improvement hack for Super Metroid created by many contributors, with the main credited contributor being ShadowOne333. It contains many quality of life improvements already found in previous hacks, while also including many more new features to improve the gameplay experience, especially for first-time players.\n\nSome examples of improvements and additions are:\n- Including all the control improvements from Control Freak, which allows the control scheme to be played in a manner closer to Zero Mission and Fusion. Hold down the button of your choosing (R, for example) to use your secondary weapon with the fire button, rather than having to cycle through your items like in the normal game. Use the Auto-Run feature and Samus will automatically run after moving in the same direction for a little bit, allowing easy firing while moving quickly without having to potentially \"claw hand\" the controller. Speed Booster will activate automatically upon running for a short time. Crystal Flash can still be performed if the same buttons are held as in the normal game--lay a Power Bomb and hold all the buttons until it goes off. Charge Beam combos can be performed by holding the fire button and pressing Select. X-Ray Scope has its own button.\n- Improving Samus' control to be snappier and less slow, plus making things like wall jumps more forgiving and closer to the GBA games, without completely removing the floaty feel of Samus in this game. An additional patch, provided with the main Redux patch, can be applied to make Samus feel heavier like in those games.\n- Improving the map system to show which doors require what items on the pause menu (Standard, Missile, Super Missile, and Power Bomb doors each have their own color), as well as showing what rooms have uncollected items--these rooms show a circle on the pause menu instead of a dot. The minimap also is somewhat changed up and shows door exits and more.\n- Making repeatable item pickups (missiles, power bombs) quicker like in Zero Mission and Fusion, while keeping the item pickup tune for the first of every unique item (the Super Missile pack after Spore Spawn, for example).\n- Missile Reload stations now restore all secondary weapons (Missiles, Super Missiles, Power Bombs). They will say \"Weapons\" instead of \"Missile\", much like in Zero Mission and Fusion.\n- Speeding up elevator segments and door opening animations/transitions.\n- Missile doors require only one missile to open, like in Zero Mission and Fusion.\n- Showing item collection percentage and play time on the Samus pause menu, plus filling in the Samus portrait in that menu. It changes color based on the suit equipped.\n- Completely fixing the Tourian issue which locks out players who decide to save at the final save point. They can go back to the rest of Zebes and pick up items they've missed even after beating the final boss and getting the ending.\n- An additional Hard mode is selectable when starting a new file and using the settings menu.\nAnd even more subtle improvements that haven't been noted here!\n\nNote that this hack may still have a few small glitches here and there, such as the small graphical issue on the floor in Kraid's arena after exiting the room with the Varia Suit. These issues are expected to be fixed over time and you may not encounter them by the time you play it.\n\nYou can find the patch for this hack to try it out at:\nhttp://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4963/\n\n#Metroid", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wHrLiznm9q8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wHrLiznm9q8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wHrLiznm9q8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wHrLiznm9q8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wHrLiznm9q8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Metroid Redux - Hack Showcase", "description": "This is an excellent improvement hack for Super Metroid created by many contributors, with the main credited contributor being ShadowOne333.
