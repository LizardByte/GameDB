To get back to your own world, you must traverse through five dangerous zones, defeat the portal guardians and face MEGABLAST in the Magic Zone.\n\nThankfully, there's a high quality FUJI cassette tape in each zone, and armed with your trusty tape recorder, you can record beats scattered across the zones and use them as a weapon against enemies and bosses. Playing back beats creates a small area of effect and in order to do damage, you need to stay dangerously close to your enemies. Unlock the portal areas by finding a switch in each zone, then face the portal guardian by playing back the recorded beats and opening the portal once they're defeated.\n\nMany dangers await you in your adventure across the zones. Enemies will drain your tape recorder so you'll need to collect batteries to replenish its power. The tape recorder is also vulnerable to fall damage but collecting repair tools will fix it from becoming permanently broken. You also only have a few minutes to finish each zone, so keep an eye out for clock power-ups to add 25 seconds to your timer.", "summary": "A German-language FUJI cassette tape promotional platformer game for DOS with a 90's electronic music soundtrack.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soundrace", "videos": [{"id": 142145, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dMpCskyqcbc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMpCskyqcbc", "title": "Soundrace (1995)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dMpCskyqcbc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
