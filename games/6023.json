The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-fantasies", "videos": [{"id": 40615, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7kZ-i9mGav4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kZ-i9mGav4", "title": "Amiga Longplay Pinball Fantasies", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7kZ-i9mGav4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
