Zombies 2: About Time. It was created by goodpea2 in collaboration with Mine Power and makes numerous changes in order to bring things more in line with what many fans loved about the original. Examples include:\n\n- Removes \"pay to play\" aspects of the game (micro transactions), allowing things to be either earned through Adventure mode or bought with in-game currency.\n- Introduces a tier system, allowing the player to strategically develop their plants for different strengths and weaknesses.\n- A re-jigged, linear narrative, with tweaked dialogue and hundreds of original levels across the game's worlds.\n- New game modes\n- Some newly designed zombies and plants\n\nThe most notable change that players will encounter is the steep difficulty. The mod not only fixes problems with the game, but also makes it incredibly challenging - this is not a fault, but an intentional change for the appeal of those who have mastered the original game and desire more of a challenge, with a much greater emphasis on strategy. This may put off some players used to the usual skill level required of players from other games in the series.\n\nUltimately, the mod is a challenging and impressive overhaul which bares very little resemblance to the original PvZ2 game.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 35098, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jT5t57srah0"}]}
