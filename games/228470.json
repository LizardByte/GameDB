If any is detected, it will show in the radar screen. In order to capture it, it is necessary to quickly tap the point in the radar and the capture screen will show. Once this has been done, one only needs to throw Marciano Balls until one of them shakes 3 times. Marciano Balls are limited and can be obtained inside chests that are detected by the radar. There are currently 16 different martian species.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marcianito-go"}
