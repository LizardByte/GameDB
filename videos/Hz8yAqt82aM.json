You still know what to do. But sorry still.\n\n...Yes, I'm also pretty annoyed about the fact that 3 was never seemingly translated or it had a super limited release. Will I myself make a translation of 3? Dunno, this one was already more tedious than my normal projects.\n\nThere's quite a few things changed aside from a newer engine. But I don't necessarily think for the better. I don't know maybe I'm looking for things that were never intended but I saw in the original.\n\nI think the bear is way less threatening in this game than the original. I don't know what would've happened if I went to it when it glowed all blue but it's not threatening. At all.\n\nI know the chases in the original were pretty static. They would trigger in specific places so you could do a lot before one. But the new format is worse since I got chased even less in this one. I could just leave a room and the bear would be gone if it decided to spawn on a map.\n\nIt doesn't help it seems that you can just run for a bit and the bear would be gone whenever you do get chased. \n\nThe original wasn't scary by any means but there are cheap scares now and they're not too interesting. Basic RPG Horror stuff. \n\nThe chase music is also gone aside from the finale and I'm sorry but I do want banger MIDIs when I'm being chased. That's a shame that it's gone.\n\nThe finale is also less interesting. Like the part where you choose the options is neat but my main issue is that there seems to be no timer to throw the doll?\n\n In the original, you had to get to the fireplace in time or you'd die. That doesn't seem to be the case here. Unless it's invisible but there's no indication of the doll doing anything at that part.\n\nI guess this sounds like a whole lot of nonsense if you're not familiar with the original Paranormal Syndrome lol\n\nI assume this was more like a test project before starting development on 3 so I shouldn't be so harsh but still. It might just be because I have something to compare this to and it's something I'm nostalgic for to some extent.\n\nIt probably doesn't help that my perception of Paranormal Syndrome is primarily formed of the first game's first 2 chapters since I get bored once I get to the 3rd chapter of it so uhhhhhhh\n\n(Also the first video I edited in an editing software because I made a very embarrassing mistake.
