Levels are made up of rooms with specific objectives (defend, survive, etc.) for each. The Terminator can fire a variety of projectile weapons, throw explosives, and can punch effectively when all else fails. A few levels also include vehicles to control. The Terminator can also activate the films' red-tinted Terminator vision for a limited time, to spot hidden items or areas and cause additional damage to enemies.\n\nTwo players can fight through unique co-op challenges over a link cable, where they will fight spawning enemies and bosses in progressive rooms. Up to four players can also control their own Terminator in a capture-the-flag arena mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/terminator-3-rise-of-the-machines--1"}
