The partisans who advocated this view actively embraced technological advances and advocated a cooperative symbiosis between androids and humans.\n\nIn contrast, however, there was a faction that viewed androids as mechanical beings and treated them differently from humans.\nThey pointed out the potential danger that androids equipped with advanced AI posed to humans and argued for the need to limit them in human society.\nThis faction took a cautious position on the development and use of androids, emphasizing clear boundaries between humans and androids.\n\nThe ideological conflict gradually increased tensions and caused political friction.\nThreats from enemy nations also added to this complicated situation, and there were reports of various androids infiltrating the country as spies.\nThe evolution of androids and the accompanying changes in human society were presenting a new dimension in national security.\n\nThe government was busy trying to resolve ideological conflicts within the country while promoting stricter control and monitoring of androids.\nAt the same time, scientists and ethicists were working to establish new frameworks and norms for the coexistence of humans and androids.\nThe future was moving toward uncharted territory, and many unanswered questions hung in the air about how the fusion of humans and androids would change society.", "summary": "Xearz is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with a retro feel.
