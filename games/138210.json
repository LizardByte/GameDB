Thus accommodating vastly different fighting styles along with the game's more traditional life sim elements.\n\nThe game is wrapped in a beautiful, inky minimalist art style with precisely choreographed animations (every single animation frame hand-drawn), complementing a thought-provoking narrative about existence and magic, within a vast world filled with hidden lore to discover. While getting tangled in the lives of a colorful, diverse cast of characters.", "summary": "Sonzai is a 2d, action-brawler platforming RPG. The town of Kumotoshi holds secrets.
