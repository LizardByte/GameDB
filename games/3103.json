With rings of channeling, Summoners call forth demons and golems, supernatural servants and elemental creatures. Summoners have toppled empires and challenged gods. They are venerated as saviors and feared as destroyers. The chosen are born with a mark on one hand, but the origins of this gift were forgotten long ago.\n\nJoseph fears his power more than death itself. As a child, Joseph tried to save his village from attackers, but the demon he summoned slaughtered the villagers while Joseph watched in horror, his misguided heroics causing the deaths of those he loved. Exiled and ostracized, Joseph vowed never to summon again.\n\nOver the years, the enigmatic Yago counsels and guides the youth, preparing Joseph to fulfil his prophecy. As the invading armies of Orenia march across the Medevan plain, Yago urges Joseph to quest for the ancient rings. Reluctantly, Joseph agrees.\n\nOn his journey, Joseph meets three young adventurers who become his companions-Flece, Jekhar, and Rosalind. Flece is a cunning thief and cynical rogue who grew up on the streets of Lenele. Jekhar's family perished when Joseph summoned a demon long ago, and now the warrior seeks revenge. Begrudgingly, he helps Joseph on his quest. Rosalind is novice of the Order of Iona and yearns to become a mage-priest and guardian of Iona's divine scrolls. The daughter of Yago, Rosalind is jealous of Joseph's power and hates her father for devoting his life to the Summoner\u2019s cause.\n\nTheir quest takes them across the world-to the sunken empire of Ikaemos and the rugged wilds of Liangshan, from the stronghold of the Khosani to the Jade River that flows from Heaven. In the ruins of lost civilizations and the temples of Orenia, they search for the Summoners' rings.", "summary": "One of the earliest role-playing games for the PlayStation 2, Summoner originally had its roots as a PC title before being moved to Sony\u2019s console as the lead SKU. Following the exploits of Joseph, one of the last remaining Summoners, Volition\u2019s first RPG tells a story of destruction, salvation, and exploration as our hero travels the world in his quest for the legendary Summoner rings.\n\nFeatures include an action-oriented combat system, a cast of more than 120 different characters, five person battle parties, 16 different summoned creatures, more than 50 hours of storyline, and an arsenal of unique weapons and spells.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/summoner", "videos": [{"id": 98071, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Z4O_kx-dSyk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4O_kx-dSyk", "title": "Summoner (2000 Game Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z4O_kx-dSyk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
