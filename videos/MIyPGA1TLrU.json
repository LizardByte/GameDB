{"id": "MIyPGA1TLrU", "snippet": {"title": "Yolanda (Amiga Longplay)", "description": "Originally designed and released by Steve Bak (RIP) on the Commodore 64, under the name Hercules. This Amiga counterpart, Yolanda, was published by Millennium in 1990.\n\nThere's an optional trainer level which provides a flavour of the challenges ahead. For the main game you choose between Wimp, Hero, or Legend mode. I opted for the latter which provides 1 life only - however the difficulty and ending are identical whichever mode you choose.\n\nThere are 12 labours in total. The twelfth labour is only available once the other 11 have been completed; their order is completely random, unless you chose Wimp mode at the outset.\n\nIt's essentially a memory game, knowing where platforms will appear and disappear, and which turn to flames. Once familiar with the layout it's still really difficult! Definitely not for those lacking patience, or seeking transparency.\n\nWhilst Hercules was a Marmite game, this incarnation was widely panned.
