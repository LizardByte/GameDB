You take the role of a nameless man, a sort of wandering healer. The kind of healer who dabbles in his own medicines way too often and burns down entire towns to stop infections from spreading. Exactly what a situation like this needs. He has now entered the great city, making the first INCISION, and entering the heart of the spreading sickness.", "summary": "INCISION was made as a personal challenge to see if I could create a fun and fully playable prototype in one month. It soon afterwards gained enough attention and interest from people to make me fully commit to making a complete game on scale akin to the classic FPS games of the 90s.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
