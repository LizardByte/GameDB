Which is exactly where it took Love and Hate when foolish Love pushed the shiny red thing.\n\nOn their journey you guide Love and Hate through dark caves, icy lands with heavy snow, steamy factories and old castles. While you proceed you get to meet more and more other ones that will help Love and Hate to reach their goal, the red button. They react differently on Love and Hate, so the challenge of rearranging all of them never gets old.", "summary": "About Love, Hate and the other ones\u201c is a mindbending puzzle game in which you take control of the two main characters Love and Hate.
