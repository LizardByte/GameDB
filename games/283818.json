The game features a high degree of customization, allowing players to mix and match various parts and weapons for their robots, as well as different operating systems and software. The game also emphasizes PvP (player versus player) combat, where players can join one of two rival factions, POF or Infinity, or remain as freelancers. The game has a unique and complex backstory, involving a secret plan by POF to terraform and colonize Alter 8, the emergence of a mysterious threat called GHOUL, and the eventual collapse of the planet.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/junk-metal"}
