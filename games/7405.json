This story begins with the end of the world.", "summary": "Deep within the Shropshire countryside, the village of Yaughton stands empty. Toys lie forgotten in the playground, the wind blows quarantine leaflets around the silent churchyard. Down on Appleton\u2019s farm, crops rustle untended. The birds lie where they have fallen.\n\nStrange voices haunt the radio waves as uncollected washing hangs listlessly on the line. The televisions are tuned to vacant channels. Above it all, the telescopes of the Observatory point out at dead stars and endless darkness. And someone remains behind, to try and unravel the mystery.\n\nImmerse yourself in a rich, deep adventure from award-winning developer The Chinese Room and investigate the last days of Yaughton Valley. Uncover the traces of the vanished community; discover fragments of events and memories to piece together the mystery of the apocalypse.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/everybody-s-gone-to-the-rapture", "videos": [{"id": 2666, "name": "E3 Trailer", "video_id": "fX1P_WxB9Zo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX1P_WxB9Zo", "title": "Everybody's Gone to the Rapture - E3 Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fX1P_WxB9Zo/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 5460, "name": "Sean Davies"}, {"id": 5465, "name": "Diana Davies"}, {"id": 5467, "name": "Philip Wade"}, {"id": 5473, "name": "Evie Baker"}, {"id": 5477, "name": "Charlie Tate"}, {"id": 5479, "name": "Barbara Foster"}, {"id": 5466, "name": "June Fletcher"}, {"id": 5468, "name": "Lizzie Graves"}, {"id": 5472, "name": "Meg Holloway"}, {"id": 5474, "name": "Rachel Baker"}, {"id": 5462, "name": "Jeremy Wheeler"}, {"id": 5464, "name": "Wendy Boyles"}, {"id": 5470, "name": "Kate Collins"}, {"id": 5475, "name": "Sam Baker"}, {"id": 5476, "name": "Amanda Mason"}, {"id": 5478, "name": "Frank Appleton"}, {"id": 5480, "name": "Clive Smith"}, {"id": 5481, "name": "Terry Fletcher"}, {"id": 5461, "name": "Rhys Shipley"}, {"id": 5463, "name": "Howard Lantham"}, {"id": 5469, "name": "Graeme Sampson"}, {"id": 2895, "name": "Japanese Voice Cast"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "Stephen Appleton"}]}
