Start your campfire, find weapons and forage for food before the night sets in. \nYou scavenge what you can from what's washed up on the beach; but from then on, you're on your own. \n \nHundreds of items interact in strange and unexpected ways. \nAttach glow worms to spears to light your way. Attach explosives to make them deadly. Attach a rifle because - well, why not? \nCraft your own shelter, bridges and walls. Build traps to snare animals. \n \nTravel through beaches, caves and jungles. Swim through lakes and raft over oceans. \nSearch for exotic crafting materials in hidden and deadly locations. \nFind your way home.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 17490, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LfS_iX-xCPA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfS_iX-xCPA", "title": "Under the Ocean - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LfS_iX-xCPA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
