{"id": "cieZfcB74a4", "snippet": {"title": "Datura Time Alpha Trailer", "description": "\"Hey D, you know what time it is? Don't forget, you can never be late in this place.\" \n\nDatura Time is an experimental 3rd person action-adventure game. The game is currently being released as a public alpha version, and it will probably be expanded into a bigger and longer game in the near future.\n\nThe game setting takes place in an alternate reality where the fall of communism is a never ending process. The player is transported to a city known as the \"Zone\", where they meet different characters (some friendly, some not), who soon make it clear to the player that they are not where they belong.\n\nThe visual style of the game is heavily inspired by the look of 90's games, specifically those that were developed for the original PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. Low polygon models, pixelated textures, jerky animations and low-resolution CRT screenspace effects dominate the visual style to help create a nostalgic and visually delicious vibe.\n\nYou can download the Datura Time public alpha now from itch.io: https://vladstoj.itch.io/datura-time", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cieZfcB74a4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cieZfcB74a4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cieZfcB74a4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Datura Time Alpha Trailer", "description": "\"Hey D, you know what time it is?
