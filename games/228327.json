It was released only in Japan in 1995 after Shin Megami Tensei: if... and on the heels of Majin Tensei II: Spiral Nemesis. It was published by Atlus and developed by Opera House [1], which did not take too many liberties with the original gameplay. A few portions of the dungeons of the first game were redone, along with a new save game and teleportation Terminal feature which previously did not exist. The graphics and music were enhanced to match the capabilities of the Super Famicom.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
