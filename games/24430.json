The gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Resident Evil, with 3D characters moving across pre-rendered backgrounds most of the time. Each character can be switched with another one almost anytime; in fact, if the characters are split into 2 teams, the player is able to explore 2 areas separately as well. It's notable that there aren't new weapons to be picked during the main game; instead those are obtained only as unlockables after the game's completion.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 10056, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "rBxicxhrat8"}]}
