The first version was developed by Brand Fortner with Kevin Gorey in the summer of 1974. After its release, it became the most popular game on PLATO until Empire became more popular. This software probably inspired the UIUC student Bruce Artwick to start the company Sublogic, which was acquired and later became Microsoft Flight Simulator.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/airfight", "videos": [{"id": 109052, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jDkQFYWcSIg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDkQFYWcSIg", "title": "Airfight (1974) - First 3D flight simulator", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jDkQFYWcSIg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
