{"id": "TsM4bS70tB8", "snippet": {"title": "OMG Zombies Steam Trailer", "description": "OMG Zombies is based on OMG HD Zombies (Vita), a massively enhanced remake of the critically acclaimed OMG-Z (PSP), which currently sits in the top 10 PSP games of all time on Metacritic.  For those of you who never experienced the simple joys of zombie-popping first time around, the zombie virus in OMG HD Zombies is the result of a virulent fungus that causes its zombified victims to EXPLODE when attacked. That's pretty cool in itself, but if any infected matter lands on another zombie then they'll explode too, causing a chain-reaction tsunami of gore!  Wise to this, as a highly trained Riot Cop, you're able to take down hordes of the undead with a single well-placed rifle round.\n\nOMG Zombies features:\n\n1000s of zombies! -- Each of our 8 zombie classes destroys its fellow walkers in a unique way, from random gunfire to electric shocks!\n\n100 levels! -- From Redfield City centre to the rural outskirts and a secret military base. Unlock diverging levels depending on your performance.\n\n100 Upgrades --Unlock medals to increase your ammo, power up explosive barrels or increase the death effects of zombie classes.\n\nShow off your Skills -- 12 varied trophies to unlock, drawing on all your zombie-slaying skills.\n\nPrestige Mode -- Complete the game to 100% \"Platinum\" standard to Prestige Mode and receive a Leaderboard multiplier.  \"Prestige\" up to 20 times for truly HUGE scores!\n\nFor the Steam release we've also added PC-specific features such as resolution settings, Steam leaderboards, mouse/keyboard and gamepad support, trading cards and cloud saving.\n\nOMG Zombies is coming to PC on Thursday 13th February\n\nhttp://www.laughingjackal.co.uk/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TsM4bS70tB8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TsM4bS70tB8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TsM4bS70tB8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TsM4bS70tB8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "OMG Zombies Steam Trailer", "description": "OMG Zombies is based on OMG HD Zombies (Vita), a massively enhanced remake of the critically acclaimed OMG-Z (PSP), which currently sits in the top 10 PSP games of all time on Metacritic.
