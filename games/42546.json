A tile matching puzzle game that plays like a mix between Bomberman and Puyo Puyo.\n\nTiles fall from the top of the screen, when three are matched bombs are dropped. Occasionally one of the dropped bombs will be lit, which will explode and cause a chain reaction with any bombs already present. Game over happens when the screen is filled with blocks or bombs.\n\nIt was released for the Super Famicom and was only released in Japan. It features a single player mode and a multiplayer one that supports up to four players.\nThis game also implements a Dokuro mode which involves status effects. These can do everything from reduce blast radius to igniting bombs on screen.", "videos": [{"id": 41914, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2fI0urctBzs"}]}
