Fortunately, Ultraman arrives just in time to battle the creature. Ultraman proves to be stronger than Bullton, and destroys it. Afterwards, Ultraman then crushes the two rocks that Bullton left behind. Later, Ultraman confronts and battles the ancient monster, Gomora. After a quick battle, Gomora tries to escape but Ultraman grabs his tail to stop him, which forces Gomora to detach it before burrowing underground. Red King then appears and attacks Ultraman from behind. Engaging in a violent battle, Ultraman defeats Red King and flies away. Suddenly, a mysterious UFO uses a purple mist on Red King. Meanwhile, Ultraseven battles Eleking at a dam and manages to defeat the monster. Unfortunately, the purple mist appears again and changes Eleking into EX Eleking. Despite the monster's increased power, Ultraseven defeats EX Eleking. The mysterious UFO then flies away.\n\nLater that night, in another city, Ultraman Tiga duels with Kyrieloid. However, Kyrieloid escapes to a cave. There, Ultraman Tiga finds the injured and sleeping Gomora, who awakens and attacks him. After battling him, the monster, still weak from his fight with Ultraman, decides to retreat. Suddenly, Gomora is then killed by Chaos Kyrieloid. Though he had evolved, Ultraman Tiga defeats Chaos Kyrieloid. Ultraman Taro fights the rampaging Tyrant in the city, defeating him after a brutal battle. Taro then quickly heads to a volcano, where he battles with EX Red King. The EX monster is defeated by Taro. Later, Ultraman Cosmos arrives to stop a rampaging Gomora, who has been turned into EX Gomora. However, the military attempted to kill EX Gomora, which Cosmos tries to prevent as he only wants to calm Gomora. Fortunately, Ultraman Cosmos uses his Luna Extract to return him back to Gomora. Gomora then leaves in peace.", "summary": "Ultraman Fighting Evolution Rebirth is the 4th game in the Ultraman Fighting Evolution series.
