While it may look like a perfectly normal game of Minesweeper, every board contains a 50/50 guess and the hint system makes fun of you for being bad. Yes, really.\n\nEvery time you start a game, Evil Mineswifter secretly runs an advanced Minesweeper AI to see if the board can be solved without guessing. If it solves the board, it randomly generates another board and tries again. This swiftly takes you to the boards no one wants to play.\n\nWant to play the nice version?
