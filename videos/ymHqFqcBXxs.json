A stack of random colored bubbles descends from the top. Players pull bubbles down, shifting the colors and toss them back up into like-colored bubbles, making the whole chain disappear. Chains are formed either when a single drop causes a chain reaction or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. A player is defeated when his bubbles hit the bottom. In two-player mode, you really get the competitive rage going as you fight your friends for bubble supremacy.\r\n\r\nFor more information and contests on everything MonkeyPaw Games, LIKE us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/monkeypawgames or FOLLOW us on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/monkeypawgames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymHqFqcBXxs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymHqFqcBXxs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymHqFqcBXxs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ymHqFqcBXxs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Dezaemon Kids (PSN)", "description": "NOW AVAILABLE on PlayStation Network for $5.99.\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR PAGE IF YOU WANT MORE!
