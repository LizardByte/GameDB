You\u2019ll lose yourself in settings inspired by the works of poets Keats, Byron, and Shelley, and use the game's system of writing prompts to help create your own masterpieces. Explore 27 different writing challenges, through which you create narratives about the worlds you visit, from multiple perspectives. In one challenge, you play an archaeologist, uncovering clues and writing about a city's final days; in another, you're a thief, composing a song about searching the wreckage for valuables; and in another, you're a bard penning a lament in rhyming couplets.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elegy-for-a-dead-world"}
