Self-medicate to give yourself an edge in combat, so pop those pills and grab your guns... and embrace your Downfall!\n\nhttps://www.indiedb.com/games/project-downfall\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mgpstudios\n\nWorth noting: The first sequence when the stronger beat kicks in comes from a Work in Progress version of Level7.Less than zero. Most of the level is ready, however it still need some tweaks and adjustments before it can be offically added to the game. It should be good enough and available in a update within  a month. More info on this below.\n\n------\n\nA quick summary of the earliest Early Access updates:\n\n22-24 March 2019: First update. 1 new pill(berserk pill), 1 new level (Level6. It's Personal) with dedicated dynamic tune and updated gore system. Lots of other smaller tweaks, fixes and adjustments (ie itemdrop pickup arrow making it easier to spot pickups in dark areas, adding quality setting presets to game settings \u2026 more detailed info will be in the update notes)\n\nAlso worth noting is that the update will be on a newer version of Unity. Upgrading engine versions is very often a case of \u201e3 steps forward, 2 steps back\u201d, seeing as certain aspects and/or features might not work as they should. Usually these are simple fixes and I think we got most of the issues sorted out. Currently back in progress mode.\n\n6-10 April 2019: Second update: 1 new level(Level7. Less than zero), 1 new pill(combo pill) and possibly also a part of the freeroam hub. Tweaks/fixes/adjustments\n\nAfter that, we plan to add  at least one new level a month, along with dev and implementation of features set for the full version. However, most likely will be adding smaller updates in between. And just to be clear: the upcoming gore update is not going to be the final word in this regard. The first upcoming update will feature gore effects depending on where strikes/bullets connect/weapon etc. So a shotgun blast to the gut might result in shredded intestines spewing out, a lead pipe or precision rifle to the head might smash it into little bits and so on.\n\n----\n\nThis game inlcudes:\n\n\n-a really nice free car asset from the Unity Store https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/racing-cars-pack-1-2195 by Cerberus", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSTtO1rwKWU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSTtO1rwKWU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSTtO1rwKWU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSTtO1rwKWU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSTtO1rwKWU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Project Downfall Early Access Release Trailer", "description": "Coming to STEAM Early Access 15.III.2019\n\nWishlist: https://store.steampowered.com/app/992730/Project_Downfall/\n\nhttp://project-downfall.com/\n\nThe Project DownFall Early Access Release Trailer.\n\nProject Downfall: A dynamic, stylish, trippy and brutal FPS with adventure elements.\n\nBust through the multiple levels inspired by the likes of HardcoreHenry, or John Wick.
