Auriga is a small world!!! \n \nHere\u2019s a quick overview of what you can expect from the \u201cVaulters\u201d DLC: \n \nA new civilization means a new way to play, the Vaulters will have the ability to teleport and use the Argosy - their legacy super colonizer ship featured in the Prologue video. \n \nThey will also have their own heroes (including the famous Opbot), technologies, buildings, a new starting special node, the Sisters of Mercy minor civilization that they brought with them from Auriga, and of course, a brand-new main quest. Will they discover the truth about their Gods? Will they find a new home to start all over? Will they save their people that stayed on Auriga? \n \nThe Expansion will also feature new exotic combat modules like boarding and taking control of ships, as well as the Pirate Diplomacy gameplay enabling negotiations with their leader.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/endless-space-2-vaulters", "videos": [{"id": 17729, "name": "Prologue Trailer", "video_id": "uiYwseuQj5g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiYwseuQj5g", "title": "Endless Space 2: Vaulters - Prologue Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uiYwseuQj5g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
