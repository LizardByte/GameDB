Problem is that she\u2019s been sick for too long and she may have to repeat the year, or worse drop out of school.\n\nSo their parents being the most clever people in the world, decided to send him, the splitting image of his sister, over to the all-girls prestigious school to go undercover as his sister, and live her life for a while so that when she comes back, she can take his place without dropping out of school or repeating. Of course it\u2019s a stupid idea and he resisted, but him, being someone who is easily swept away, gave in.\n\nSo thereon starts his incredible life in an all girls school.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hana-to-otome-ni-shukufuku-wo-harukaze-no-okurimono", "videos": [{"id": 144061, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iR_fSucGOcE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR_fSucGOcE", "title": "(\u30a2\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3&\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30e0\u88dc\u9593)[PS2] \u82b1\u3068\u4e59\u5973\u306b\u795d\u798f\u3092\uff5e\u6625\u98a8\u306e\u8d08\u308a\u7269\uff5e \u65b0OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iR_fSucGOcE/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 11481, "name": "Hana to Otome ni Shukufuku wo"}]}
