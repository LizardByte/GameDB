BETRAY YOUR QUEEN. MURDER A SUN.\nSet a course for the heavens in your steam locomotive! Lose yourself in a changing universe where even time can be bought. A Victorian Gothic adventure for PC, Mac and Linux.\n\nIt is the dawn of the 20th century, and the British Empire has taken to the stars! As the captain of a spacefaring locomotive you\u2019ll behold wonders and battle cosmic abominations in the heavens.\n\nThe stars are alive. They are the Judgements: vast intelligences that govern all things. But they are dying. One by one, something is snuffing them out, leaving their thrones empty.\n\nUnfettered by trivial things like gravity, the Empire\u2019s ambition is savage. They have built a new Sun. The Empress reigns from the Throne of Hours, which gives her control over time.\n\nYour Captain and crew must carve out a life between the stars. Will you support her majesty and the establishment, or the working class rebels who yearn for freedom from the Workworlds?\n\nLearn who you are, in the dark.
