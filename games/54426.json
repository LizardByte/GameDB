Both players have a health bar similar to the ones used in fighting games. The objective of the game is not to score points to win games & sets, but to deplete the health bar of your opponent. This can be done in several ways:* First you can try to play the ball past your opponent. The higher the number of times the ball bounces on his side of the court before he returns it, the more damage is done to his health bar.\n\nYou can also collect & use power-ups that turn the ball into a bomb or a plasma weapon to hurt your opponent. Other power-ups available include ones that temporarily increase your running speed, give you the ability to steal a power-up from your opponent or give you a shield.\n\nFinally, if you hold down the swipe button long enough your character will launch a special attack at the other side of the court. However, while you're building up this attack you can't hit the ball.\n\nPlayers can refill their health bar by eating fruit & candy that appears on the court during gameplay. The first player to win the required number of rounds (1, 3, 5 or 7) wins the match.\n\nIn the single-player story-mode you start with only one character and collect 19 other characters by beating them in the 3 available episodes. Unlocked characters can then be used in exhibition games. The 3 episodes take place on a pirate-themed galleon court, a horror-themed graveyard court and a Christmas-themed wonderland court.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tennis-antics"}
