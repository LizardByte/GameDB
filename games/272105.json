Duke was abducted and must find a way back to earth, unfortunately this ship won't turn around and even if it did, it was too badly damaged in the crash to survive the journey or re-entry into earth's atmosphere. As such, the best course of action is to cripple the ship so that it never flies again and find a way back before it's too late, the aliens probably won't treat you very nicely if the ship makes it back to their home world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-abductee"}
