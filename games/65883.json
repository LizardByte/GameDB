In the main Competition mode, players move through different stages patterned after the TV series, from auditions to shows with a live audience and hopefully the finals. Between performances, outfit, hair style and color and make up can be customized, since not only the singing but also the style will be judged.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pop-idol-the-official-video-game"}
