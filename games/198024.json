While none debate its historical impact, little documentation survived the generation ship's early grounding days; we are left trying to piece together a story from re-used and re-made artifacts, decaying machinery, and contradictory and incomplete family legends. The last remaining survivor of the journey, the ship's own intelligence AMM-NET, has been famously quiet about what, if anything, it remembers of the journey.\n\nHowever, the ERCMS is thrilled to announce that AMM-NET has broken its silence, and allowed the museum access to a selection of its records of the journey. Under AMM-NET's supervision, our staff have meticulously created ten interactive experiences so visitors can experience life during the Adamant Gambit's journey. We are thrilled to welcome the public to participate in this groundbreaking new exhibit, where they will be able to perform routine ship maintenance, visit the ship's library, cook traditional Adamant Gambit meals, and more.\n\nThis new addition to the museum's permanent collection is now open.", "summary": "This anthology of ten short slice-of-life games explores life aboard a generation starship, originally made over ten days in December 2021 for the Variety Megajam.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
