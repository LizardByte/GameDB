Not only does this rewrite fix some of the bugs in the original game, but also adds a bunch of new features, tweaks and improved graphics.\n\nPerhaps the most notable additions to this new engine are solid 60 FPS support, widescreen support and clearer graphics. The end result is probably the best version of OutRun that you can expect to play and is definitely worth a look!\n\nThis video shows the buttery-smooth 60 FPS mode in widescreen with enhanced graphical clarity.\n\nLink: https://github.com/djyt/cannonball/wiki\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHyWzYou_8E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHyWzYou_8E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHyWzYou_8E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHyWzYou_8E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LHyWzYou_8E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "OutRun: CannonBall Engine (Bonus Video) [60 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Chris White and available here: https://github.com/djyt/cannonball/wiki\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nSo, here's a little bonus video about an extremely cool find I made whilst recording my OutRun longplays.\n\nChris White has ported the original OutRun assembler code to a new, modern version of of the engine he has written in C++.
