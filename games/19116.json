There is no dialogue or literary exposition of the plot. The main goal of the game is to collect colored balls of light while you explore the world. Seiklus has no weapons and no violence. There are various \"hostile\" lifeforms in some areas, but at worst they only set the player back a little. It is impossible to die or get stuck.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
