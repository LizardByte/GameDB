Realistic hunting simulation is the aim, and CABELA'S BIG GAME HUNTER: Ultimate Challenge delivers on many levels. Two different career-oriented modes allow you to hunt for elk, deer, and other tricky prey over the course of numerous detailed levels. You'll have all of the maps, vehicles, and weaponry you could ever need in order to get the job done, and you'll need all of the help you can get The wilderness never seems to end in this expansive title. If you need some justification to kill animals, you can join forces with the Department of Natural Resources and help to keep the wolf and bear populations in check (just as brutal a process as deer hunting, mind you). There are adjustable skill settings to ensure that gamers of all walks get their money's worth, and you can even select an x-ray option that aids you in lining up your shots by showing you your prey's internal organs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cabelas-big-game-hunter-ultimate-challenge"}
