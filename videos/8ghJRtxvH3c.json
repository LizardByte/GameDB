It was originally titled \"Meesters van Macht\" and released in 1997. It was later localized by Tivola and released in English in 2000. Masters of the Elements is a game primarily designed towards children, but doesn't necessarily qualify as an \"educational\" game. Its game design is a bit unclear in many ways, so I'll explain here how everything works.\n\n-There are five rooms in the game, each associated with one of the elemental masters: Gravity, Time, Light, Warmth, and Electricity. \n-You can travel between the rooms by finding special areas of the room where objects will be highlighted. Pointing at one will take you to a storybook, where a page will be read to you, and you can warp to another room.\n-Each room has a secret page in it, and all five pages are required to reach the final level, the Garden of Chance.\n-The Garden of Chance is extremely deceptive. Getting to the end of it will allow you to play the \"shell game\", where the ball is hidden underneath one of three hats, and the hats are shuffled. However, the hat you choose here actually doesn't matter at all. Instead, your success is a percentage chance based on how many clovers you've collected.\n-Clovers are hidden secrets that can be found throughout the game. Some of them are easy to find, others are extremely hard. If you collect all 10 of them, you'll always win the shell game at the end of the Garden of Chance. Conversely, from my testing, I was completely unable to win the shell game with 0 clovers (I tried around 10-15 times). I didn't test it thoroughly, but I believe each clover boosts your chances of winning the shell game by 10%. Here is a list of clovers and the rooms to find them, along with a timestamp showing the point in the video where I get it.\n\n4:49 Room of Gravity: Throw the ball at a specific point on the right side of the screen. You should hear a crash, and you'll get the clover.\n4:59 Room of Gravity: Balance the horse until you get the clover.\n6:10 Room of Gravity: Balance the pencil until you get the clover. **This is nearly impossible if you're playing on a fast system. I recommend using a CPU throttle to slow your game down if you're trying to run it on a modern PC.**\n8:59 Room of Warmth: Shake the cereal box to get the clover.\n10:00 Room of Warmth: After lighting the stove, pull another match and light it using the stove instead of the matchbox.\n19:07 Room of Electricity: After completing the circuit, go under the desk and attach both wires to the plug. This will turn on the mixer and you'll get the clover.\n22:00 Room of Light: Use the colored glasses to look at the red painting on the wall.\n22:28 Room of Light: Set your system clock to nighttime and go into the dark area. Catch all of the fireflies.\n23:12 Room of Light: Set your system clock to nighttime and go into the dark area. Catch two fireflies at the same time to get the clover.\n25:27 Room of Light: Set your system clock to daytime. Catch the fish as he jumps out of the fishbowl to get the clover.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ghJRtxvH3c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ghJRtxvH3c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ghJRtxvH3c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ghJRtxvH3c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8ghJRtxvH3c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[PC] Masters of the Elements (1997) - Full Playthrough", "description": "Masters of the Elements\nPlatform: PC\nRecorded on VMware Workstation emulating Windows 98.\nThis game is currently available for download on the Internet Archive for free.\nhttps://archive.org/details/masters-of-the-elements\nAdventure game playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL6IvCPYLqOXm-E-peJ-sVjmt8EOXQ83x\n\nThis is a playthrough of a puzzle adventure game developed by Ijsfontein.
