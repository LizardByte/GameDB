In this excellent sequel, Space Harrier II goes in to change the situation in true shoot-em-up style.  Blast the terrifying end of level monsters in order to face the next challenging round battle your way through to the ultimate level to meet and destroy the awesome \u2018Dark Harrier\u2019.  12 fantastic levels of frenetic activity, 2 bonus rounds on your jet board, amazing sound effects, music and graphics all go to create on of the most authentic conversions ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe I was a bit harsh in the Space Harrier description as this game is not nearly as good even if it looks better graphically.  The game seems faster, smoother and a little more polished but the levels are long and there is not much variety between the 12 stages.  Only music or weak sfx are available and not mixed together like the previous game.  For some reason the game is a multiload , loading each level separately which is even more annoying when you get to the boss rush at the end of the game.\n\nNot much else I want to say on the game. It\u2019s Space harrier but worse than the previous game. Play that one instead.\n\n00:00:00 Title screen, uninterrupted music.\n00:01:40 Gameplay starts Here!!!!!!!! -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PK3c2nzc9Bo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PK3c2nzc9Bo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PK3c2nzc9Bo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PK3c2nzc9Bo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PK3c2nzc9Bo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Commodore 64 Longplay [059] Space Harrier II (EU)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nSpace Harrier II, Published by Grandslam in 1989.\n\n\u201cSet in the Fantasy Land, the Dark Harrier has taken control and has imposed a cruel tyranny.
