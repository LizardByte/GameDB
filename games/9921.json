You travel with your combat vehicles and convoy across a wasteland to find parts needed to repair your broken spaceship. During your journey you will encounter strangers in randomized scenarios by picking up radio signals.\n\nDepending on the choices you make, signals can either lead to tactical combat, text based dialogue or chance based role-play. Whatever choice you make, you need to keep your convoy and its cargo safe from raiders, privateers and other enemies. Keep upgrading your vehicles, as death is permanent in Convoy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/convoy", "videos": [{"id": 6981, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "S0JPB4b3Zck", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0JPB4b3Zck", "title": "Convoy Release Announcement", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S0JPB4b3Zck/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
