The player takes the role of an ambitious citizen who wants to become the mayor of L\u00fcbeck. To reach this goal he has to get rich by trading with other cities of the Hanseatic League.\n\nThe basic gameplay principle is simple: shipping salt and exchanging it for other goods which then can be sold in L\u00fcbeck for a good price. This means the current salt price is the most important part when planning shipments (besides the weather). Of course the player also has to purchase and maintain other things, e.g. a trading station, ships and cannons. Alternatively the player can also participate in smuggling.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hanse"}
