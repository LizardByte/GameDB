He is a loner, working the days away in his tiny laboratory, mostly known to fellow scientists for the unconventional and daring character of his work - often conducted at the borders of the code of scientific practice. His most recent experimental setup, called the Plateaus of Oblivion, was intended to explore human memory and conditions of forgetting, remembering, grief and remorse - but somewhere along the way, in the heat of the moment, Timothy loses control of the situation.\n\nAn effervescent whirlwind of pure emotional code unfolds, and he soon finds himself confronted with memories from an uncertain past, with fears he had long forgotten and suppressed - and with love, where he least expects it. Can he, a man who has long lost track of the world, handle this digital emotion overload?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fragment--3"}
