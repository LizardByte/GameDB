One of these creatures has stolen the voices of children from the first city.\n\nYour journey begins when Aeloras, a police student in the city of Visthansia, needs to defeat a memories manipulating creature to graduate.\n\nAlong the way you will fight unique creatures, meet interesting people and be presented with conflicting and thought provoking concepts that aim to give you a fresh experience that will remain with you for long time.\n\nThere is only one controllable character and the combat system consists of classical turn-based battles that include meelee and magical attacks along with usage of items. This is a story-driven game where there is a main quest and also side quests. Choices are not the main focus on this game but the player can choose between alternative outcomes in some side quests.\n\nThe final goal of the game is to create an experience that will provide food for thought, something that's sorely missing from the gaming industry these days.", "summary": "A classical RPG about Utopia/Dystopia balance that aims to present some interesting concepts.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
