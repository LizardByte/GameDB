Bounce around in Reality Falls, brave the Screwballer coaster, ride atop creatures, and revel with new arsenal. Drop into Season 3 and spread the good vibes!\n\nThe Reality Tree has blossomed on the Island, forming a new biome in the process! This location called Reality Falls is a lush forest of mushrooms, bouncy mushrooms, and trees of purple. When you\u2019re not browsing its flora, swim beneath its waterfalls, seek loot in its cavern, and spring from its geysers. \n\nBallers are back! Roll around and grapple onto surfaces, but don\u2019t just roll as you did before. In the spirit of celebration, get on the (totally safe) Screwballer for a high-flying amusement park ride. \n\nDon\u2019t let the high-speed fun stop with Ballers: jump on a wolf or boar to ride on it! You don\u2019t have to dismount to fight \u2014 shoot and throw weapons while atop your steed.\n\nReality Seed Pods are spreading from the Reality Tree. Plant a Reality Seed to grow a Reality Sapling \u2014 which grows in the same place match to match! Saplings bear better loot each time you weed them, so keep weeding a sapling until it bears Mythic loot. When it wilts away, plant the seed left behind!\n\nBring good and evil together with this Season\u2019s Battle Pass. In addition to Darth Vader himself, the Chapter 3 Season 3 Battle Pass includes the anti-hero Evie, the defender Adira, and five more Outfits.
