It seems as if all citizens disappeared in a matter of hours. The public is scared of whatever happened. A terrorist attack? A failed experiment of the GENE Company? Or maybe aliens?\n\nA team of policemen go to Azure City. Only 4 of them come back after realizing that they can't find their colleagues. The investigation posed more questions than answers.\n\nAfter a month of silence, a young investigator named Jack heads for Azure City. His goal is to solve the case once and for all, no matter what it takes. Why is he trying to accomplish what a team of policemen failed to do? Why is he risking his life for such a feared case? Is he going to make it out alive?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-nightmare-version-invasion"}
