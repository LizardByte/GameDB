The basic gameplay is extremely simple, and only requires two buttons: The left click of your mouse will drop lines from the sky, while the right click will make those lines dash forward. As the pace of the opposition gets faster and the line start splitting and crossing LineDash becomes a hypnotic and ever-changing visual experience. And you can also get high scores and stuff if you really lean that way!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/line-slash-dash"}
