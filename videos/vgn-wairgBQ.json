The powerful, faceless Iron First Corporation has replaced the last forms of free government. Now, they are developing a new, 42-foot, armed robot known as the Iron Soldier. With the Iron Soldier, no one will be able to stop the Iron First Corporation. The only hope is the Resistance, a group that has managed to capture one of the Iron Soldier prototypes. You are a pilot for the Resistance. It's up to you to pilot the robot and bring down the Iron Fist.\n\nIron Soldier is a mech sim played from an in-cockpit view. There are 16 single player missions. Objectives involve taking out certain targets, defending convoys, collecting items, and so on.\n\nWikipedia:\nGameplay\nThe player controls a robot spanning 42 feet or 13 metres in a series of 16 missions consisting of destroying certain enemies and buildings. Some missions require the player to obtain new weapons from an enemy base or destroy other robots.\n\nThe player has a wide variety of weapons like rocket launchers, a chainsaw, Gatling gun, shield, and self-controlled rockets, which can be equipped on any part of the robot.\n\nDevelopment\nIron Soldier was in development since November 1993 and many of the personnel at Eclipse Software Design, including his founder Marc Rosocha, previously worked at Thalion Software and developed titles such as Wings of Death and its sequel. Originally the team pitched a on-rails 3D shooter game similar in vein to Namco's Starblade to the executives at Atari Corporation, but it was rejected for not being a free-roaming title. The team kept developing tools and prototypes for the Jaguar but had nothing in regards to a full-fledged game until Marc and his team meet with Sean Patten, the game's producer, who is \"a big mecha and Godzilla fan\". He suggested to develop a mech game and the team agreed as long as they could destroy everything up, with Marc explaining that the three pillars that formed the final product were \"heavy property damage, a mech theme and a game that was open world and not on rails\".\n\nThe game made its appearance at SCES 1994 in an early playable state. Iron Soldier runs at 30 frames per second and the three-dimensional models consist of 200 polygons, with some of them having texture mapping applied.\n\nGamePro magazine reported that Iron Soldier would support two-player gaming via the Jaguar Voice Modem by Phylon, Inc. However, the Jaguar Voice Modem was never completed or released, so Iron Soldier was released as a single-player game only.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vgn-wairgBQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vgn-wairgBQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vgn-wairgBQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vgn-wairgBQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vgn-wairgBQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Iron Soldier - Atari Jaguar Gameplay (Longplay) Footage", "description": "Iron Soldier running off an Atari Jaguar captured via an AV Adapter.
