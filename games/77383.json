The quality of your wine depends on the type of vines, when the grapes are harvested and how they are fertilized.\n\nYou must deal with hiring personnel and buying equipment, registering your wines with the authorities and advertising your products. You can also sabotage your competitors or illegally water down your wines.\n\nYou win by reaching a score of 1000 points.
