They can also adopt a cat with a unique personality and watch them interact with their dogs. Petz on Nintendo 3DS introduces two vibrant towns where players and their dogs can freely explore, complete quests, meet new villagers, and expand their community.\n\nIn Petz Countryside, players exchange sandy beaches and venture inland for fields of golden wheat and lush acres of green. Petz Countryside also has 28 dog breeds, six cat breeds, more than 200 in-game collectibles, and exclusive Petz at home on land such as a lion, a tiger, and a bear.\n\nPlayers with both games can transfer the unique Petz and items between the different titles. Or, players can visit a friend's village with a wireless connection for the opportunity to buy and collect some of items not found in their version of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/petz-countryside"}
