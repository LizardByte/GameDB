The choice of weapons is not very large, but there are things with which the player interacts with the environment. In each mission, in addition to the main task, there is an additional (destruction of propaganda leaflets, disabling equipment). For the most part the player uses the weapon, but sometimes you can use a strangulation or quietly pass through enemy territory. Also in the game there is a system to improve the character on points earned during the game. You can improve the properties such as quietness, accuracy, health.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pilot-down-behind-enemy-lines", "videos": [{"id": 132266, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nb0vodHMurM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb0vodHMurM", "title": "Pilot Down: Behind Enemy Lines | Playstation 2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nb0vodHMurM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
