The Over-Mind is tyrant of the red and blue planets; part machine, part spirit of evil. Long ages past, it cleverly overthrew the great King Alacazar, but the king escaped to safety and planned revenge that has taken a thousand years to fulfill. Now, at the Conjunction of the Seventeen Planes, the stage is set for YOU to travel to the Empire of the Over-Mind and destroy the infernal abomination.", "summary": "In this text adventure it is the player's goal to reach the red planet that gloomily hangs above its alter ego's head. Contrary to most text adventures of its time the player does not use directions like north, south, up etc. to maneuver through the game world. Instead he gives instructions to head to a specific location. Therefore the player has the ability to look ahead. Clues to the solution of the game are hidden in a poem which came along with the game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/empire-of-the-over-mind"}
