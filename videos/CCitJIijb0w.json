While I didn't have much power left on the phone and there wasn't much light sources to use, I thought I'd take the oppoturnity to do a demonstration of a handheld console. And this is the Atari handheld I had since around 2020 as one of my birthday gifts.\n\nAs you can tell, this is the updated version of the 2018 handheld made by Blaze Entertainment, the creators of Evercade. In fact, the Pac-Man edition came out the same year as the original Evercade handheld. While it was ok in terms of quality back then, emulation seriously pales in comparison to the Atari Collections 1 and 2 for the Evercade. The sound is seriously bad (look how this device butchered the Food Fight music) and then there is the disaster that's related to some of the 2600 games. I mean, look at games like Crystal Castles or Demons to Diamonds. Normally this is due to the issues with the capture card when recording games from the 2600+ or both Atari Flashback Classics 1 and 2 compilations, but this is from a handheld device that had NO HDMI output and it has a built in screen. No idea if it was due to age or from the get-go, this is VERY inexcusable, since the Evercade was made by the same company and it did a far better job. And yes, this device somehow managed to make the already weak Pac-Man 2600 port even more busted. And since there was no brightness options or HDMI output, it was kinda hard for the camera to focus on the screen, especially in case of 7800 games.\n\nThankfully this is from a different era of Blaze Entertainment. Evercade set a proper standard for them and seeing the results from the Atari Collection 1 and 2 carts, we can all say that we are thankful this handheld exists, even if all the Atari carts (Console 1 and 2, Lynx 1 and 2, Atari Arcade 1) are now in the Legacy category, due to the license expiring and partnering up with MyArcade instead.\n\nAs for this handheld, at least it has a micro-sd card slot, so you can load your own 2600 and 7800 games... though the compatibility and quality may vary depending on what game you're playing.\n\nI gave it a 5/10 on InfiniteBacklog, by the way. https://infinitebacklog.net/users/aklim95/reviews/atari-retro-handheld-console-pac-man-edition\n\nAtari 2600, Atari 7800 (C) Atari SA\nPac-Man (C) Bandai Namco\nRecorded via Motorola Moto G 5G Plus\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #atari #blazeentertainment #atariretrohandheldconsole #retrohandheldconsole #retrohandheld #retrohandhelds #pacman #pacman2600  #atari2600 #atari7800 #ataripacman #pac_man #atarigames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CCitJIijb0w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CCitJIijb0w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CCitJIijb0w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CCitJIijb0w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CCitJIijb0w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Atari Retro Handheld Console: Pac-Man Edition - Console Demonstration (Live)", "description": "While the entirety of Ireland was dealing with the power outage for three days as a result of Storm ISHA, I needed to find something to do to keep my sanity in check.
