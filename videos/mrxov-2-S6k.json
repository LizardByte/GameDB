Produced by ACTIVISION with a copyright of 1981, Laser Blast is an old school retro arcade style classic video game for the Atari VCS.  You command a flying saucer like UFO whose job is to fire lasers at three moving targets on the ground also equipped with lasers.  If you like laser beams then this is the game for you because all the combatants use lasers.  This isn't one of the best of the early Activision titles like Pitfall or River Raid, but it's a good time for a brief time.  I wouldn't expect to see this on Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 or Wii any time soon.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, PS2, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360.
