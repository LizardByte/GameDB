This video was originally uploaded to my Twitter account. I've decided to make it public here since I know that not everyone follows me there. More info below!\n\nA lot has changed since the 2021 update. For those unaware, here's a quick summary of what's changed so far:\n- The visual style is being updated to resemble that of Yuji Uekawa's art style. Please note that not everything has been updated yet.\n- A partner / tag action system has been added. It works similarly to the one from Sonic Advance 3. In the full game, this'll be an unlockable feature. Once unlocked, you'll still have the option to play through stages without a partner. \n( Also for those that haven't seen the tag action system in action, here's an older video of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7SCb-tGpsY )\n- The UI has been redesigned.\n- A combo system has been added. Well, actually this has been in for quite a while. It was just disabled in the 2021 videos. However, the way it works has been completely revamped. How so? That'll be explained at a later date.\n\nI hope to share more information sometime later this year.\n\nAlso if you wish to be kept up to date with this project, please join the Discord: \nhttps://discord.gg/73Gt2Fuu3z\n\nSongs Used:\nRight There, Ride On - Silent Dreams Remix ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwgoNrKakYY )", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MD72jAFotjg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MD72jAFotjg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MD72jAFotjg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MD72jAFotjg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MD72jAFotjg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic (Project) Advanced - 2022 Short Preview", "description": "This video was unlisted prior to 3/21/2022.
