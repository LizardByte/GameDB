Make a row of 3 tiles of the same color and the tiles disappear. \n \nIf that sounds too easy, don\u2019t worry \u2013 this game can be devious and you\u2019ll find yourself in situations that require clever manipulation of the game board. There\u2019s an assortment of objectives to keep you on your toes: tiles that chase you, tiles that must be matched within a few moves, tiles that must be protected, and lots more. \n \nAs well as 38 free-form stages which play out differently every time, we have created 75 challenges with unique solutions, so the game is crammed with content to keep you busy!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/swaperoo"}
