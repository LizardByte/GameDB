You are a Hand of Avadon, warrior and spy, judge and executioner, with nearly unlimited power to fight the enemies of your homeland. Your word is Law. However, your lands have been invaded. Barbarians and monsters are rampaging through your home, and you are the only one who has a way to stop them.\n\nAvadon 3: The Warborn is an epic, retro adventure in an enormous and unique world. Choose from five different character classes, each with dozens of unique spells and abilities. Explore cunning dungeons, hunt for hundreds of magical artifacts, and pass judgment on your enemies (or just people you don\u2019t like). Avadon 3 features many different endings. Will you save your people or betray them? Follow orders or claw for more power? We leave those decisions for you.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/avadon-3-the-warborn", "videos": [{"id": 9595, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dI6fwtZL_bM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI6fwtZL_bM", "title": "Avadon 3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dI6fwtZL_bM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
