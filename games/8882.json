Much of the game play is based in the huge cottage, though other areas include a stroll through a giant hedge maze, a journey through dangerous fields filled with snakes and bees, as well as travelling to a mysterious planet in a phone booth. Overall, this is a very enjoyable addition to the series which has the same fun and interesting atmosphere as the original.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 67540, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0GW0LXM78H4"}]}
