The more you play, the more pro moves you'll discover, from double-jumping to the deadly \"TURBOFLIP\"!\n\nAfter each goal, a random gameplay variant is selected. New ball physics, lava pits, portals, moving platforms or explosions\u2026 No two matches are the same! The game includes a total of 24 unique variants, not counting modifiers like the size of toasters or the number of toasts which can add even more possibilities.", "summary": "A ball, two goals and... toasters! Welcome to Toasterball.\n\nPlay against your friends in this physics-based multiplayer sports game, where toasters are athletes, bread flies everywhere and the gameplay changes every time you score a goal!\n\nToasterball is a multiplayer physics-based sports game, quick to learn and perfect for good old game nights on a couch with friends (1-4 players local multiplayer). Because you are playing as toasters, you can naturally expect some chaotic physics, random situations, electrical hazard, and more burnt toasts than you can ever imagine.
