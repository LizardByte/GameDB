Then i play 3 races in head to head mode to show traffic and police (they only appear in head to head mode and only on those 3 street tracks). I also show the car videos at the end.\nMy opinion on this game is it sucks, especially in tournament mode (main mode of the game). The main problem is that on the sides of the road there are these \"invisible walls\", so if you go a little offroad your car will be pushed back on the track and you are slowed down a lot. Now, the ai cars dont have this restriction, they  can drive on the sides of the road and dont slow down at all! Also, the ai can take turns at much higher speeds than you. All this makes the game incredibly hard and most of all, unfair! And the controls are also pretty garbage, the car turns way too slow. I really dont know how someone can play this game and enjoy it. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32TVEkGLNtA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32TVEkGLNtA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32TVEkGLNtA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32TVEkGLNtA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/32TVEkGLNtA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "PC Longplay [772] The Need For Speed SE", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: mihaibest\n\nI win all 8 races in tournament mode.
