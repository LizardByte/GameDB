Think Peg Solitaire with cute creatures instead of pegs and feature-filled terrains instead of a wooden board with holes in it. Add innovative gameplay mechanics, lush graphics, charming atmosphere, and over 100 challenging puzzles and you get Oddhop! Oddhop is a unique puzzle game, where each puzzle takes place on a hexagonal terrain populated by a group of creatures. The goal is to collect points by eliminating the creatures one by one until a single survivor remains. This elimination is carried out by making the creatures jump, \"hop\", over other adjacent creatures. In this core gameplay, Oddhop resembles the classic Peg Solitaire. However, Oddhop utilizes a wide range of features to take the gameplay to the next level!"}
