The goal was to make bases where rock and grass were still barely clinging along as they floated in the lonely void, perhaps after some disastrous teleportation experiment. It's mostly a visual theme and the gameplay is otherwise classic styled, so you won't have to worry about falling into the void while killing demons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starshine"}
