Aragon was one such planet. The last message from Aragon was received two standard days ago which means that due to the delay in cross-galaxy communications the planet has been alone for five years!\n\nAs commander Kreigson of the small fleet recon ship \"Wrath\" you have been instructed to land with caution to assess the situation and restore comunication with earth. Fitted with the latest automated Bio-Tech suit you land and are immediatly aware that whatever took control of Aragon was not of this galaxy.", "summary": "Wrath of Earth is a first-person shooter that incorporates traditional action-oriented mechanics with tactical decisions and interaction with the environment. The protagonist is often underpowered, and running for cover to gain advantage over the foes is sometimes the only way to survive. The player character's exoskeleton can recharge its power and repair itself using energy from a light source, effectively healing the protagonist. Stepping out of the darkness to recharge becomes therefore another tactical alternative.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wrath-of-earth", "videos": [{"id": 119629, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZcPjeskJX94"}]}
