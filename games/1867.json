The player reassumes the role of Sev, a surviving member of the Special Forces unit Alpha Squad, who must fight against vindictive, merciless enemy forces in a desperate attempt to escape Helghan alive.", "summary": "Killzone 3 is the fourth game in the Killzone franchise. Several improvements have been made over its prequel, and it can be seen in overall smoother and more balanced gameplay. As in previous game, you will commandeer various turrets and vehicles which will add to firepower but will leave you with rails-driven gameplay. One of the new weapons is a jet-pack which lets you jump and semi-fly with unlimited ammo as a part of new exoskeleton. The environment can sometimes be destroyed or used to your advantage, shooting barrels or certain plants will take out nearby enemy soldiers. Beside single-player campaign, Killzone 3 offers an upgraded version of Killzone 2's multiplayer. The game is also the first in the franchise to support 3D TVs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/killzone-3", "videos": [{"id": 36851, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "oFOCZ6riK7c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOCZ6riK7c", "title": "Killzone 3 - Cinematic Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oFOCZ6riK7c/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36850, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "P5ORTIHfBWQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5ORTIHfBWQ", "title": "Killzone 3 - Story Trailer (HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P5ORTIHfBWQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 350, "name": "Killzone"}]}
