Aspen was the last person to see Mrs Leigh alive, and she was the first person to find the old woman\u2019s body.\n\nAfter this unfortunate discovery, Aspen becomes something of a celebrity in her dreary seaside home town, Scarborough. She\u2019s bombarded with intrusive questions about Mrs Leigh\u2019s death every day, and her friends are insatiably curious about the incident. Despite Aspen\u2019s best efforts, she\u2019s unable to move on from the past, even as time passes.\n\nThe winter months segue into the summer, but Mrs Leigh\u2019s home remains unsold. Eventually, the house is boarded up, and rumours begin to spread that it\u2019s haunted by her restless ghost. Then, during a sleepover with her friends Pippa and Lakhi, Aspen is made to confront her fears all over again. Pippa dares Aspen to break into Mrs Leigh\u2019s home to search for this elusive ghost, and Aspen is too weak-willed and anxious to refuse.\n\nUnder the cover of the night, Aspen returns to Mrs Leigh\u2019s home - but she doesn\u2019t find eerie spectres awaiting her arrival. Instead, she meets a strange girl called Althea, who seems to know more about Aspen than any stranger ought. Aspen soon finds herself enchanted by the beautiful Althea, and she resolves to discover who (or, indeed, what) she really is.", "summary": "A lesbian romance story with mild horror elements set in the rainy English seaside town of Scarborough.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rituals-in-the-dark"}
