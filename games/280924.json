By either pressing Enter, or patiently waiting, you'll uncover what lies on each of floating islands. Each time you'll be granted one of few randomly chosen worlds to uncover.\n\nEvery island shows a small scene with one of characters that I created over time. Sometimes you may get a scene where you'll simply observe character in its own world, and some other time you may encounter a scene depicting certain moment from character's life.\n\nAlthough you may find scenes from character's story implemented into the game, they're not part of game's plot. Like in snowball glasses (on which this game was loosely based), here you're simply granted with a scene to which you - player - can add a story, if that is your desire.", "summary": "Small idle game that I started working on out of boredom.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gardens-of-the-void"}
