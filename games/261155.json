Use your flippers to destroy enemy buildings and defense your kingdom. You play like a regular pinball, but the goal is different. You must defend your kingdom against a pinball ball and destroy enemy buildings using the same ball. The Pinball Kingdom game starts with a very simple kingdom, but you can upgrade it to become a very defensive one. In Pinball Kingdom season one, players play versus humans, but in season two we plan to add Orcs, Monsters, new bosses with skills, more kingdoms, and balls with passive effects.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-kingdom", "videos": [{"id": 95613, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "klCCLMUYWqg"}]}
