So much so that he drinks himself into amnesia and forgets he has had any in the last 30+ years so he's constantly asking Billy to go fetch him some more from the store. Today, however, was different. Today, he asked Little Billy to get a case of Dr. Pepper from THE SHED. OooOOoo spooky. No really, the shed is crazy scary. Good luck, have fun. Gameplay is 30+ minutes depending on how much you explore. \n \nThere are two endings. One of which is pretty elusive. You'll have to big-brain think outside-of-the-box to figure it out. \n \nThis game is a parody of Dr. Pepper and Silent Hills P.T.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 42756, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "HCuPU4PYyxM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCuPU4PYyxM", "title": "dP.T. - dr Pepper Terror", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HCuPU4PYyxM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
