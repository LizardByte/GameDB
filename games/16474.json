Its story is unrelated to the original FINAL FANTASY, and its gameplay is a major departure from the previous title for eliminating the traditional experience-based progression system.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-ii--1", "videos": [{"id": 107829, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xfaQG0dKzQk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfaQG0dKzQk", "title": "Final Fantasy II (FC) [part 1/2]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xfaQG0dKzQk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 107828, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nzy8jBZw_to", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzy8jBZw_to", "title": "1988 Final Fantasy II Nintendo Famicom JP Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzy8jBZw_to/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 39, "name": "Final Fantasy"}]}
