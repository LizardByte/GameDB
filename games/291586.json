Flesh-hungry tentacles, mafian zombies, and the occasional missing sock are no match for The Darkside Detective.\n\n- About The Darkside Detective\n\nWhere cultists crawl, where demons dwell, where the occult\u2026 occults? *ahem* That's where you\u2019ll find Detective Francis McQueen, the lead investigator of the criminally underfunded Darkside Division. When evil darkens the doorsteps of Twin Lakes City \u2013 hell, even when it just loiters around shop fronts or hangs out in shady alleyways \u2013 he\u2019s there, ready to investigate the cases that nobody else will.\n\n- About The Darkside Detective: Fumble in the Dark\n\nTwin Lakes is a cursed city. Less cursed than say, \u201cDemons are tearing it apart\u201d but more cursed than \u201calways loses its keys\u201d or \u201coften steps in puddles\u201d.

Cursed enough that somebody has to deal with it\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s where The Darkside Detective comes in. Whenever you hear a bump in the night, feel a tingle up your spine, or smell something fishy, Detective Francis McQueen isn\u2019t far behind. No, he doesn\u2019t smell of fish - it\u2019s a phrase, come on...", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-darkside-detective-duology"}
