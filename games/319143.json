Creatures and other weird phenomena haunt the hallway with anomalies that you must look for with the help of your flashlight to discover any anomalies that have changed the corridor. If an anomaly has been spotted, you must return to the airlock you came from to progress to the next section. Successfully make it to section 10 to board the last escape pod to survive.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anomaly-corridor"}
