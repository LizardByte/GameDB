This Deluxe version was published first to the SNES, then the Mega Drive and finally the PlayStation. Without any doubt introduced many new features over its predecessor, such as improved artificial intelligence, opening scene, new difficulty levels (5 in total), climatic differentiation in stadiums, stadium names, new game modes (like an a co-up for 2 and 4 players), new reserve players for each team, graphics improvement, more voices in the narration and many more things. Really cool, really a deluxe version. No doubt for me is the best football game for videogames of all time, a classic. I said it once and I say one more: Allejo is the best player of this magnificent game. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DLhCjqzZwc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DLhCjqzZwc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DLhCjqzZwc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [262] International Super Star Soccer Deluxe", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nInternational Superstar Soccer Deluxe (known as Jikkyou World Soccer 2: Fighting Eleven in Japan) is a football game and the sequel to International Superstar Soccer developed and published Konami's, KCEO division.
