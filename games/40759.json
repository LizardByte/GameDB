In this version there are two balls and they each have a mind of their own! Sometimes the ball will double back at you after you hit it, other times it might just spin around in circles for a bit, keeping you on your toes as you wait for it to shoot off in some direction (hopefully not at you!)\n\nThere are several game variations that allow you to select one or two players and a score limit of 15 or 45. There is also a normal vs. hard option, but that is not implemented in this version of Mondo Pong.\n\nThis is an Alpha Version of Mondo Pong as it was never completed! Therefore, the game doesn't have the polish you might expect from a finished game and there may be a few bugs. Nevertheless, it's still an interesting concept and a hoot to play.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mondo-pong"}
