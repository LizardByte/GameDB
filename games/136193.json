Taking a unique and meta approach towards the Gundam universe, Gundam Breaker 3 continues the formula of bringing action-packed mecha-on-mecha battles that revolve around one of the core aspects of the series: the building of Gunpla model kits! The management mechanics revolve around the creative choice of building your own model kit based on their real-life counterparts.\n\nThere are over 100 Gunpla kits to choose from, which gives you endless building opportunities! You can colorize parts, define material types such as plastic or chrome, add decals, scale optional loadouts, and save your kits into a list to restore whenever you want to fight with that model.\n\nAside from customizing the entire body, you get a shield, melee weapon, and ranged weapon slot for your primary arsenal, 4 Ex-Actions for explosive attacks, and 8 slots for your optional loadouts which can include missile pods, rail cannons, beam launchers, beam sabers, axes, and all sorts of other offensive and defensive mechanisms. This is one of the most freeform combat experiences ever made in 3rd person arena combat.\n\nTwo escorts join you in most of the battles, performing healing and attack actions while also rescuing you from being knocked out. You can also instruct them to do certain actions.\n\nA new \"Bounty Hunter Mode\" has been added to the series. In this mode, players will be able to battle against Gunpla that have been uploaded by other players, and the victor will walk away with in-game currency and all parts that have been broken off of enemy kits.\n\nThe Break Edition includes all the DLC of the normal edition.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gundam-breaker-3-break-edition", "collections": [{"id": 5301, "name": "Gundam Breaker"}]}
