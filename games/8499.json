However, due to a number of incidents including the kidnapping and implied murder of five children by a man wearing an empty animatronic suit, sanctions by the Health Department over the numerous reports of dirtiness, and \"The Bite of '87\", the pizzeria has fallen on hard times. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is set to close by the end of the year, as potential buyers do not want to be associated with the tainted reputation of the company.\n\nThe four mascots - Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate had a particularly foul odor and what appeared to be \"blood and mucus\" around their eyes and mouths, which concerned parents had interpreted as \"reanimated carcasses\".", "summary": "Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys", "videos": [{"id": 51604, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RP4UTOek0-Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4UTOek0-Y", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RP4UTOek0-Y/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 70751, "name": "Clickteam Xbox Trailer", "video_id": "cIt8h49oFII", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIt8h49oFII", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's 1 - Xbox One Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cIt8h49oFII/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 85831, "name": "Pre-Release Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GS-VcKmK7Gc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS-VcKmK7Gc", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GS-VcKmK7Gc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90077, "name": "Clickteam PlayStation Trailer", "video_id": "yjTIz5nE-Y0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjTIz5nE-Y0", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's - PS4 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yjTIz5nE-Y0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90468, "name": "Clickteam Switch Trailer", "video_id": "1tAUiP3MX_Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tAUiP3MX_Y", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's - Nintendo Switch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1tAUiP3MX_Y/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90469, "name": "Clickteam Android Trailer", "video_id": "u8H0pazYY5I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H0pazYY5I", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's Remaster - Android", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u8H0pazYY5I/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90470, "name": "Clickteam iOS Trailer", "video_id": "KMdmrwxaGAc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMdmrwxaGAc", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's Remaster - iOS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMdmrwxaGAc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90471, "name": "Clickteam Mobile Localization Trailer", "video_id": "0d138okcKmk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d138okcKmk", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's 1 - Localization update for Mobile Released", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0d138okcKmk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90477, "name": "Clickteam Console Update Gameplay", "video_id": "Lm8CdI5VDEU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm8CdI5VDEU", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's - Upcoming Console Patch Update - Jan 2022", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lm8CdI5VDEU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 90478, "name": "Clickteam Console Update Trailer", "video_id": "MCjsSf-BkzA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCjsSf-BkzA", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's Console Update - Subtitles & More", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MCjsSf-BkzA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
