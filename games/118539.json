The City is not a physical place: It is beyond the dreams and the trip will definitely be hard and dangerous for our characters, who now have not only Nubla to achieve their goal but with many other characters and inhabitants of that world will be finding in their way.\n\nNubla 2, as its predecessor, not only combines the narrative of the videogame and the concepts behind art and pictures in the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, but rather to tell us much more: If the recurring theme in Nubla was the search for identity and memory, now the subject of borders, time and space, which makes us all refugees in a world that is no longer ours will be the main theme of Nubla 2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nubla-2"}
