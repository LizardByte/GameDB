That means hunting and scavenging for food to stave off hunger, and it means choosing safe campsite locations to sleep at to avoid exhaustion. It also means concocting antidotes and healing tonics for poison and injuries, as well as staying warm, crafting clothes and building fires as I move from forests, through plateaus, to frozen peaks.\n\nIt also means defending myself against attacks from the predators that share this world with me. Song in the Smoke\u2019s beasts move with a weight that\u2019s only possible in VR, and their attacks feel like being hit by a furry train. But while they\u2019ve got their teeth and claws, I\u2019ve got a weapon of my own - a crafted club - that I can use to block and parry their attacks. Facing down 200 kilograms of angry lion isn\u2019t easy, but if I time my deflection just right, I can disorient the beast long enough to escape his attention. Or I could even strike back, swinging my club with my Move controller to send him running for safety with his tail between his legs. If I\u2019m really lucky, my blow might take him down for good, allowing me to plunder his corpse for trophies and other valuable resources.", "summary": "Song in the Smoke immerses players in a beautiful and deadly VR world where they must craft, forage, hunt, and fight to survive. Take survival into your own hands, and stay alive by gathering materials to make tools, weapons, clothing, medicine and shelter.
