Swap blocks to reproduce the desired island and the city will emerge.\n\nThere is no time limit, logic challenges, or resources to manage, so you can calmly focus on the core mechanics while listening to a soothing soundtrack.\n\nSee your island come to life as you complete certain sectors.", "summary": "Arrange the town islands and see them come to life.
