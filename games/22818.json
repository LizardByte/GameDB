Not knowing about his deadly allergy to plums, Skinny didn\u2019t think twice about eating it, and immediately went into anaphylactic shock which caused his sudden death. Ronald ran off, terrified.\nWhen he woke up, Skinny discovered that he had become a skeleton and been sentenced to live in Ronald\u2019s bedroom wardrobe forever. Since then, Skinny has watched over Ronald constantly, without his knowledge\u2026 but now things are going to change!\nTo save his best friend\u2019s soul from eternal damnation, Skinny will be forced to reveal himself and make Ronald admit his 'crime'. Not a simple challenge at all!", "summary": "The Wardrobe is a visually-rich 2D point and click adventure game inspired by the great '90s classics.
