And please don't come away from the game thinking that I hate Pac-Man; I still have a great fondness for the pucky little game.\n\nAs with my other Bitsy games, Pareidolia was another attempt to push the engine as far as I could. This time I delved into modifying the javascript engine code itself. Which is, I suppose, the Bitsy equivalent of wall-hacking but it proved to be a nice way to work.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}]}
