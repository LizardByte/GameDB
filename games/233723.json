And then, having passed, you feel completely satisfied.\nOn the playing field of TRUpuzzlE there are groups of green pieces of several colors. The player\u2019s task comes to moving the green group of pieces into a specified location. In fact, it\u2019s not easy, you will have to make up multi-steps combinations trying to remove unnecessary pieces from you path.\nVisually the game looks really attractive \u2013 it is developed in steam-punk style. TRUpuzzlE provides several dozens of levels and the application is universal."}
