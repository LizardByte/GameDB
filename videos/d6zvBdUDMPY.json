Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. Create an economy and government of real people, create laws that are enforced across the server. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction. Can you save the world without destroying it in the process?\n\nNow available on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/382310/Eco/\n\nEco update 10, over a year in production, will be launching on 12-12!\n\n*****New in Update 10*****\nBoats and Coastal Construction\nThe waterways of Eco are now open for business! From the small canoe to the fishing trawler to the mammoth industrial barge, the rivers and oceans of Eco will be come expansive trade routes and fishing sources. We've added tons of new building materials for seaside towns and constructions, docks, anchors and much more.\n\nTowns/Countries/Settlements\nBefore 10, all players lived under a single global government. Now, there are many governments, each with different tiers and their own laws and civics. A few players can band together to found a Town, a few Towns can band together to form a Country, and a few Countries can band together to found a Federation (think United Nations). With this addition collaboration and competition reaches a new level, as Citizens must work together not only as individuals but as representives of overlapping governments.\n\nCulture\nSimulating human history isn't only about work, its also about the creativity of the human spirit. To this effect, a new Culture system has been added, where citizens create creative works to increase cultural value, which in turn determines the influence radius of your town/country/federation! Paint pictures, take old-timey photos, and use modern cameras to create works that you can display on cultural sites. The more reputation these works have, the more influence they cast, and an art trade will emerge as their value increses.\n\nAnnexation\nIn addition to influence, a settlement with much higher culture can annex a lower culture neighboring settlements, incorporating them into the settlement by force. This comes at a high cost though, making it always better to solve settlement integrations with diplomacy, but rogue polluting towns can be captured this way and their laws changed. \n\nNew Avatars + Face Tracking\nWe've revamped our character creation to give it much more detail and many more options, as well as adding an option to turn on your webcam and animate your avatar with your facial expressions and hands. Combined with lipsynching tech matching audio phenomes, the level of fidelity for interactions with other citizens is like never before. Now a citizen giving an empassioned speech to a town hall meeting can broadcast their every emotion and gesture.\n\nRender to Horizon\nWith an upgraded lodding system, you can now configure your world to display to the horizon, showing the curvature of the world and giving you a sense of its grandeur. Watch a sunrise over the curved horizon as you paddle your canoe through a river.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6zvBdUDMPY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6zvBdUDMPY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6zvBdUDMPY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6zvBdUDMPY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6zvBdUDMPY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Eco 10 Release Trailer", "description": "Enter the world of Eco, a fully simulated ecosystem bustling with thousands of growing plants and animals living their lives.
