We're so excited to share it with you.\n\nSmack Studio is a platform fighting game with powerful built-in animation tools. You're able to animate 3D fighters from 2D sprites - you can upload your own sprites, map them to a fighter's skeleton with our tool, and export your creations. \n\nPAX West 2021 was a blast. It was so good to meet everyone and see the creations you came up with in such a short time. We can't wait to see what you do next now that the tool is available for you to use at home.\n\nMusic provided by Argofox\n\"Zentra - Siege\"\nhttps://soundcloud.com/argofox/zentra-siege\n\n\"Animated Pixel Adventurer\" by rvros\nhttps://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gd_hHlw8mIc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gd_hHlw8mIc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gd_hHlw8mIc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gd_hHlw8mIc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gd_hHlw8mIc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Smack Studio (Early Access) Release Trailer - sandbox fighting game with bulit-in animation tools!", "description": "Download on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1739300/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=description\nVisit our website: https://smackstudio.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=description\nJoin our Discord: https://smackstudio.com/discord\n\nSmack Studio Early Access is out now!
