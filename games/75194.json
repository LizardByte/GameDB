You control an overpowered attack helicopter with the objective to drive the enemy out of your land and make your way to the enemy base and eliminate the threat. They don't know what's coming, but neither do you!\n\nThe game has an isometric view on the level, which stands out from the typical for this genre top-down or side view and adds some depth to the environment. The graphics are simple yet eye-catching, with lots of stuff happening on screen. There's no room for boredom.\n\nKey features include most of what you'd expect to see in an arcade shooter: fluid controls, a variety of enemies, power-ups, changing environments, player progression, score, etc.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/preventive-strike", "videos": [{"id": 27758, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lCJ9CllDVI4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCJ9CllDVI4", "title": "Preventive Strike for Nintendo Switch - Release Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lCJ9CllDVI4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
