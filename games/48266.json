All of the traditional rules of basketball apply as you take control of a fictional team from one of seven American locales. Each team has its own full roster of players as well as unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, Houston has a tight defense and can shoot the three, while Dallas excels at the passing game.\n\nThe point of view is horizontal for the most part. Occasionally, you will get a close-up action scene on plays such as slam dunks and free throws. There are also two different play modes, \"Tournament\" and \"One Game.\" You can play by yourself, against a friend, or with a friend against the computer.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-basketball"}
