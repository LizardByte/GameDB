These experiments deal with intense anti-mass spectrometer radiation.\n\nIt is the hope of the underwater scientific community that none of these experiments will fail; but, if they do, that none of the ill effects of the failed experiments will ever reach the surface. One man, Gordon Freeman, has volunteered some of his time to assist in these underwater experiments.\n\nFreeman has had some experience in the past with anti-mass spectrometer radiation, and his resume was well received by the Challenger Deep complex. Freeman was brought to the complex and led to the radiation test chambers.\n\nUnfortunately, a resonance cascade scenario took place, unleashing alien beings into the Challenger Deep complex. Also, the outer hull of the Challenger Deep complex was breached. The complex began to flood. It is now a life and death battle between alien creatures and a flooding complex. Thus, this is the story of THE CHALLENGER DEEP.", "summary": "This is a remake of the original Half-Life mod The Challenger Deep. This re-designed mod has been in development for more than 7 years.
