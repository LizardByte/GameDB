Harry is a simple, not very social guy. His best friend is his dog. Unfortunately, he lost his dog. And since his dog is the only thing that is important to Harry, he starts looking for it, willing to do everything\nas long as he gets his dog back. And that\u00b4s where the story begins. Harry is only a very small piece of the puzzle, but in the end, he could be the most important one. The one piece that holds the universe together or is responsible for the demise of the universe and therefore the demise of all life not only on earth but on all the planets.\n\nYou are responsible to aid Harry in his adventures, help him to choose the right decision, and solve puzzles and riddles that come across Harry's long journey of finding his dog and hopefully not destroying the universe.\n\nPandorex is a humorous and funny point and click adventure with a small tick of social criticism and a lot of pop\nculture and subgenre references.
