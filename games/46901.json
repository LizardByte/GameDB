Another version of the game was released by Bit Corporation under the name Dancing Plates which features oriental-themed graphics and adds eight game variations. Dishaster was inspired by the circus tradition of keeping spinning plates suspended on poles. The player controls a girl attempting to keep a group of several spinning plates balanced on poles from falling. The game received negative reviews; criticism focused on the game's repetition and monotony. The girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears at the top of the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dishaster", "videos": [{"id": 132056, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gtswgaNQ_2E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtswgaNQ_2E", "title": "Dishaster for the Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gtswgaNQ_2E/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
