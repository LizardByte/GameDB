In each level the dots are placed in different patterns and the numbers of enemies vary. There are two types of enemies. One type (that you may not touch at all) puts electrical charges on the dots, which you have to catch. The other type is also deadly, unless you hit it when you are charged, which gives you bonus points. You can move your yo-yo in four different directions and it grabs onto the dot which is nearest in each direction. The longer the distance to the next dot, the more points you get.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-electric-yoyo"}
