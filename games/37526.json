It contains a variety of maps with different terrain, such as mountains, which restrict movement. Combat is turn based, and the harpooning of territory works off vectors not restricted to cardinal directions. Before and during battle there are illustrated cutscenes with text explaining the story.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
