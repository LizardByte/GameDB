Ruff goes to search for it, but when he finally notices it, it falls into a tree, which leads him underground and into a cave. The cave is full of bones and he isn't sure which one is his. When he finally does, it's too late and a caveman tosses it out of the cave, which leads Ruff into the clouds in the sky digging for it. It falls into a jungle, and then into a sunken ship in the ocean. Ruff then sees a ladder that goes into space, and finally lands on a bone planet. He at last finds his bone, and an alien takes him back home in a UFO space-ship. Once he makes it back home, his master congratulates him, only to throw his bone yet again.", "summary": "Ruff's Bone is the sixth Living Books game (or fifth if you were to go by the PC release dates) released in 1994. Written by Eli Noyes and co-produced by Colossal Pictures, it is exclusively Living Books' second original story not being an adaption from any pre-existing titles (first if not counting Mark Schlitching's adaption of The Tortoise and the Hare).\n\nThe story is about a dog named Ruff, who fetches his bone that was thrown by his master.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/living-books-ruffs-bone"}
