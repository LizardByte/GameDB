Wallie himself is separated from the wheel and floats above it but both will move together left or right when moved except if Wallie moves up, the wheel stays on the ground. There are various baddies that scroll from the left or the right and cannot be touched by Wallie or his wheel or you lose one of five lives. The top of the screen will also kill Wallie. There are other obstacles that need to be timed like water where the wheel will leave the ground but slowly floats down and can only be controlled left or right. Opening and closing platforms need to be timed to cross as well.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wheelin-wallie", "videos": [{"id": 116763, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "60hptZo0O5w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60hptZo0O5w", "title": "Wheelin' Wallie c64 e 7970", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/60hptZo0O5w/sddefault.jpg"}]}
