He\u2019s the first of his group of friends to go. It was unexpected and everyone is a bit worried. Being made of bricks and mortar doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have your own things to worry about. This ragtag group of friends were there, right from the start, when it really became a city. With them they brought the titans of the industry, hundreds of jobs, and hundreds more houses. But the Linen Mill\u2019s not been getting many textile orders come through this year, the Warehouse lost another contract from the neighbouring city and the Old Bank\u2019s having money troubles. Something\u2019s not quite right. Change is coming. What if they\u2019re next? Fortunately, you, The Halfway Hotel, are at hand to step in and reassure everyone that things will be ok. But what starts off as small odd jobs ends up unravelling into more problems, as history moves faster than you can keep up with.
