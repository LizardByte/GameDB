Lisha, a few seconds older than Aisha, is gifted with a highly rational mind but nearly incapable of perceiving emotions or affection. On the other hand, Aisha is very sensitive and susceptible. She loves to go on advanturous trips and often gets injured, but she cannot feel any pain.\n\nDuring one trip, Aisha discovered an abandoned temple that exists in a folklore told by local people. The legend has it that all the priests served in the past at the temple are all twins. Furthermore, Aisha learns that a certain mysterious appliance in the temple can integrate the souls of twins. Eager to solve the mystery, Aisha urges Lisha to go exploring the temple together. Though not convinced, Lisha send her AI robot \u201cAMBU\u201d to go on the advanture with Aisha as her urge persists.\nThroughout the game, Aisha and the AI robot \u201cAMBU\u201d explore the temple together. Players are challenged with great eye-hand synergetic skills to role-play Aisha and a cool rational mind to role-play \u201cAMBU\u201d.\n\nThe game will be most well played with complementary \"asymmerical information\" sharing and coorperation. There are multiple choices for players to make and different choices may lead to different endings. Try it out with your friends, lovers, or family members and see how well you make a team.
