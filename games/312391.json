She's been lying low for the past few years, running a modest operation near the borders of Wychwood.\n\nShe has reason to believe a famed artifact can be found there, and not just your average, dusty relic.\n\nIt's a long road through Wychwood. Superstition prevails that the woods are evil, filled with devils and spooks... you know, the usual. But I could use some quiet time in the country for a change, and the deep woods have plenty of shadows for me to feel... at home in.", "summary": "Originally released as part of the Thief: The Dark Project 20th Anniversary Contest, The Scarlet Cascabel (v2) is an improved version of the original fan maps that adds new content and applies many gameplay fixes", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-scarlet-cascabel"}
