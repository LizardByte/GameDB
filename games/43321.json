The game will feature two new additions to the classic 1991 debut, including Sonic's famous Spin-Dash move and a new save ability.\n\nBurst the videgame speed barrier wide-open with Sonic the Hedgehog. Blaze by in a blur using the super sonic spin attack. Loop the loop by defying gravity. Plummet down tunnels. Then dash to safety with Sonic's power sneakers. All at a frenzied pace. Sonic has an attitude that just won't quit!"}
