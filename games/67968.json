Gameplay is comprised of multiple missions, each broken up into two parts. The first half involves using a catapult to fling penguins through a gap in the wall. Those penguins that make it through are then brought into the second half, in which the player drops the penguins into an area filled with polar bears. If enough polar bears are hit by the penguins, the missions is completed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-penguin-catapult-2"}
