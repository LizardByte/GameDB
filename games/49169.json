It is based on The King of Fighters 2000 and is the sequel of The King of Fighters EX. It was also ported for the N-Gage as The King of Fighters Extreme.\n\nLike its predecessor, The EX series takes place in an alternate timeline where the events of the NESTS Saga did not occur, as Kyo Kusanagi was found by Moe Habana rather than NESTS at the end of KOF '97, thus this game took place instead of KOF 2000 in the EX continuity.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-king-of-fighters-ex2-howling-blood", "collections": [{"id": 854, "name": "The King of Fighters"}]}
