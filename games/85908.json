Players are required to shoot different coloured balls into a existing queue to make groups of three or more of the same colour, scoring points for larger groups and activating powerups.\n\nThe game takes place across over 30 distinct backgrounds and over 70 different levels which are divided into 12 stages and 5-8 rounds per stage.\n\nThe story is based around the hero, Tumble, who is saving her tumblebug friends from the evil Black Bug Empire. Tumble is the mechanism by which the player shoots the balls to make matches."}
