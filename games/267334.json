It's our opinion that many other versions of the game sort of take the fun out of it. They won't let you enter in wrong numbers, and if you ask for a hint they straight up give you the answer to a cell. Why not just put up a puzzle and solve it for you? I'll tell you why, cause that's not fun! Our approach is a lot different. Our hints guide you to answers without flat out giving it away. We provide the tools you need to solve the puzzle with your brain, just like a real paper sudoku book but better!", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/big-bad-sudoku-book"}
