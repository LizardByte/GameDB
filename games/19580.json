This is your punishment for not fitting in, for speaking out against the powers that be, for being an inconvenience to the government of the cruel Emperor Hawthorne. You have been sentenced to life imprisonment in the caverns, eventually to die there, forgotten and unmourned.\n\nBut you need not accept your fate. There are those who wish to struggle against this injustice, who wish to return to the surface world and to fight against tyranny. But first, they need a hero, they need inspiration, and, most of all, they need someone who can find an escape route. Can you help them?\n\nWill you be the first person to escape from Avernum?", "summary": "A fantasy role-playing game following the adventures of a group of characters cast down from the surface-world Empire into a prison underworld known as Avernum and their interactions with the society that has formed below.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
