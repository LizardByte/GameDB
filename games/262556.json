Sink into the depths of the old tomb and carve through flesh and blood to your freedom. I put an emphasis on both the visuals and the combat design, and this represents the most complicated map I've completed, mechanically speaking (close to 100 unique sector/linedef tags and multi-stage voodoo doll closets for scripts). I chose to work with only vanilla textures to get back to basics and challenge myself on the visual design.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-of-the-old-lords"}
