In that case you know what Silhouette Stories is about.\n\nThe objective is to uncover the silhouette portion of background with a marker until at least 80% of the silhouette is uncovered. When capturing background, only the enclosed area without the stage boss is uncovered, so it is possible to capture 100% of silhouette without capturing the entire background, by limiting boss's movement to an area without silhouette.\n\nThe plot of Silhouette Stories begins when a young kid finds a strange star that talk to him and start to go with him around the town where they will meet different characters until the puzzle game starts. To advance in the game the player have to solve every silhouette but the difficult part is that there is only one life to do it and limited number of continues, and the silhouette starts from the beginning every time that the player use a continue.\n\nThe game got lots of humour, nice cartoon graphics, excellent audio tracks and a 2 player mode.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/silhouette-stories"}
