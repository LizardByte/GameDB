The original Monster Prom is a multiplayer dating sim that shines for its beautiful art and unapologetic humor.\n\nThe sequel brings you into a new setting (summer camp) with new characters to romance, including old faces and new ones: Damien, Calculester, Milo, Dahlia, Joy, and Aaravi. But that's not all: Monster Camp comes with other new twists here and there, from the campfire mechanics to a new stage full of magic mixed drinks. But that\u2019s not all! The XXL version includes ALL of the non-Kickstarter exclusive outfit packs! We're taking the best parts of the popular \"Monster Prom\" formula, but adding some new spice to it.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-prom-2-monster-camp-xxl"}
