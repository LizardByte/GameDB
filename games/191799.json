What is the Lore?\nMost people like simple games and skip quest storylines, so we're keeping the lore pretty simple. Basically the game takes place in medieval times, and demons from Hell are taking over the world. Most of humanity has been wiped out, but there is a resistance on 2 continents; the South continent in this large open-world 646km game has been completely taken over by demons. You start South and around level 70 you finally make it to the North continent which is only about 30% taken over by demons. At this stage in the game, the best warriors in the world gather and train to like level 90~100 and plan a retaliation attack in Hell's core to save the world. 100s or 1000s (our goal) of players enter a giant portal to Hell, which can only be opened when community-driven prominent players collect the essential religious items to sacrifice. Basically its a RAID, taking place with tons of fire, lava, ghosts, extremely difficult mobs, bosses, then you and the remaining end-game players kill Satan for the most Exotic gear, and if Satan is killed and the world is saved, all mobs in the game will be in a weakened state for a few days with higher looting and exp. We're just making this game up as we go, the focus is maximizing fun.", "summary": "Agony Online is the world's first ever mix of MMORPG & 10,000 Player Battle Royale on a monumental scale that is made by independent developers that want to play their own game.
