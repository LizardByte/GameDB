Linxicon is a game teaches you what words mean!\n\nYour goal is to connect two random words by creating a chain of new words that bridge the gap in their meanings. For example, the words \u201clink\u201d and \u201clexicon\u201d don't have much in common, but you can create a bridge between them.\n\nThere is only one pair of words to connect per day, but you can practice as much as you'd like. A new game will start at 20:00 EST every day.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/linxicon"}
