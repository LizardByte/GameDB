At the time of the game\u2019s original release, most adventure games were played using a \u201ccommand input\u201d system, where the player was asked to type in text to decide the actions of their character. Free text input systems like these allowed players to feel a great deal of freedom. However, they did come with one common source of frustration: players knowing what action they wanted to perform but being unable to do so because they could not find the right wording. This problem was caused by the limitations of PC performance and NLP technology of the time.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/square-enix-ai-tech-preview-the-portopia-serial-murder-case", "videos": [{"id": 88123, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "V79jja9qvto", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V79jja9qvto", "title": "SQUARE ENIX AI Tech Preview: THE PORTOPIA SERIAL MURDER CASE\u3010English\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V79jja9qvto/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
