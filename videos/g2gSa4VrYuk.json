The player controls a paddle and a ball and tries to destroy all bricks. If he succeeds, he enters the next level. A major difference to the original 'Krakout' and other similar games is that the levels are generated by your computer.

If you choose 'Team' you can directly click on the 'Go' button. If you selected 'VS' you should take a look at the other options first. Use the arrow buttons at the bottom of the window to select the value that either stands for points or levels. If it stands for points there is a K behind it. Example: 100K = 100.000 points.\n\nBeside the win/loose option there is another one which is not related to them:\n\nBad extras for opponent means that your opponent gets the trouble when you hit a black brick (and you if he does). However, this doesn\u00b4t count for Flash, Thief and Flipper.\n\nEqual to all options there is something special in VS mode: If you get a '5 Hits' the next brick your opponent destroys will become a worthless ice brick. If you get a '10 Hits' the next brick he destroys will become either a Flipper, a Thief or a Flash. Of course the same counts for you.\n5.
