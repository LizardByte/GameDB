As in regular beatmania, notes descend from the top of the screen toward a bar, timed to cross the bar in time with elements of the music. Each note has a letter above it, which must be typed on the keyboard at the proper time to play the music. At certain points in each song, notes with phrases will appear, and the full phrase must be typed before the note reaches the bar in order to play it. This version includes a total of 26 songs, and comes packaged with a USB keyboard.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatmania-da-da-da"}
