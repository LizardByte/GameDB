As humanity\u2019s technological prowess increased, so did its appetites, and soon\nconsumption far outstripped what the Earth could supply. Resources became scarce, and\ncompetition for them intensified. Corporate moves became corporate raids; national manoeuvring\nturned to war; advancing your career left actual bodies trampled underfoot. Class difference became\nclass divide as the wealthy built gleaming technological towers filled with tech, medicine, and luxury\nbarely comprehensible to the teeming masses left fighting for the scraps.\nIt soon became apparent even to those who controlled empires that the end of humanity would\ncome soon. No technological breakthrough was imminent, no consensus would be achieved to settle\nconflict, no social solution would put an end to the divisions of the remnants of humanity.\nAgainst this looming doom, a mysterious substance was discovered. Seemingly appearing from\nnowhere and spread among the have and the have-nots without regard for status, this mystifying\nnew material was available to all. This new material, \u2018Flux\u2019, allowed people and objects to move\nthrough time. Sudden access to the resources of the past offered humanity new hope. This hope\ncaused the rise of a new profession: \u2018Time Raider\u2019 Those brave enough, reckless enough, or\ndesperate enough to take the risk could move across time to make their fortunes or meet their fate\nat the hands of their ancestors.", "summary": "Time Raiders is high-octane arcade action in an 3D top-down shoot n\u2019 loot with time as your playground.
