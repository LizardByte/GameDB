Home to the peaceful Knacks, the world has been engulfed by the mysterious Miasma, plunging everything into darkness. As the chosen Lightbearer, you\u2019re equipped with a lantern filled with radiant Ember. With its light you can cut through the thick shroud, allowing you to venture out across different biomes and save those who strayed from the path and became lost in the darkness.\n\nIn this cozy exploration game with a rogue-lite twist, you have a clear mission: Rescue the Knacks that lost their way out in the wilds and lead them back to safety. Collect a wide assortment of resources to rebuild and expand the village, and transform it into a safe haven for the Knacks! But be aware: If your lantern\u2019s light fades while you\u2019re out in the wild, you will become a lost one yourself, and the next Lightbearer will need to step into your shoes\u2026\n\nTraverse various treacherous yet fascinating procedurally generated landscapes and biomes that make each new adventure different from the last. Every biome offers unique challenges and encounters, each needing you to adapt your playstyle if you want to succeed.\n\nSpeaking of encounters: The Emberlands isn\u2019t just home to the Knacks, but to many other fantastical creatures! From lazy trolls and crazy scientists, to\u2026chickens?! They all offer their own quests and bargains to you. While some may seem rather dubious, they all promise unique rewards, from resources and tools to upgrades to your equipment. Choose which offers you are willing to take \u2014 it\u2019s all up to you!\n\nAs you bring back precious resources and answer the calls of the Knacks, aiding them in rebuilding stores and homes, your village will expand and thrive, paving the way for future exploration. Each addition to your village brings you one step closer to unlocking the mysteries of the Miasma.\n\nInto the Emberlands invites players to venture out, explore the secrets that the vibrant Emberlands hold, and meet its many quirky inhabitants along the way. Embrace the call of adventure, banish the Miasma and bring light back to the Emberlands!", "summary": "Venture out into the Emberlands and uncover an ever-changing world filled with surprising encounters and mystical creatures!
