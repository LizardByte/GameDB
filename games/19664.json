Featuring six playable characters\u2014Ratchet, Clank, Jak, Daxter, Sly Cooper, and Bentley\u2014the game comprises a total of 50 levels categorized into five \"archetypes\", five weapon classes, and four environments. These environments include Paris from Sly Cooper & Bentley, Metropolis City on Kerwan from Ratchet & Clank, Haven City from Jak and Daxter, and Planet X, an original game-created environment.\n\nPlayers have the flexibility to choose their character for each level, with each character offering a distinct gameplay style and potential advantages on specific levels. In cooperative play, the second player assumes the role of the first player's sidekick character. For instance, if the first player selects Jak, the second player automatically becomes Daxter.\n\nThe five weapon classes\u2014Disc, Whip, Bowling, Projectile, and Melee\u2014each bring a unique gameplay element. The Disc is thrown akin to a frisbee, with players controlling its navigation remotely using the Move controller to achieve objectives like hitting moving targets. The Whip is operated via the Move controller with 1-to-1 movement. Bowling functions similarly to the Disc, where players throw a bowling ball and guide it using the Move controller. Projectiles involve various guns and weapons, such as grenade launchers. Melee utilizes each character's distinctive weapons\u2014Sly's cane, Ratchet's wrench, or Jak's gunstaff\u2014to engage enemies in a manner reminiscent of their original games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/playstation-move-heroes", "videos": [{"id": 47087, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kEpNdSofvwM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEpNdSofvwM", "title": "PlayStation\u00aeMove Heroes Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEpNdSofvwM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119525, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1PI9ShG-ZTY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PI9ShG-ZTY", "title": "Heroes on the Move E3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1PI9ShG-ZTY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
