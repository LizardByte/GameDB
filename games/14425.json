Gameplay-wise and visually, the game is very similar to the previous installments. The player creates a party of adventurers (up to six active combatants, including the series' trademark \"random creatures\", such as ogres, minotaurs, lizardmen, etc.), which then roams the top-down world-map, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. Battles allow specific commands such as \"Thrust\", \"Parry\", \"Throw\", etc., and - similarly to the third game - placement of the characters in rows on the battle screen.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phantasie-iv-birth-of-heroes"}
