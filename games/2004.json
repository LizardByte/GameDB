The current age is called the \"Ninth World\" by its scholars, who believe that eight great ages existed and were destroyed or disappeared for unknown reasons before their time, leaving ruins and various oddities and artifacts behind. These artifacts are known as the \"numenera\" and represent what is left of the science and technology of these past civilizations. Many of them are irreparably broken, but some are still able to function in ways that are beyond the level of understanding of most humans, who believe these objects to be magical in nature.\n\nThe protagonist of the story, known as the Last Castoff, is the final vessel for the consciousness of an ancient man, who managed to find a way to leave his physical body and be reborn in a new one, thus achieving a kind of immortality by means of the relics. Unknown to him, however, every time he abandoned \u2013 or \"cast off\" \u2013 these host bodies, they awoke with a consciousness of their own, having no memory of their former master or his deeds. The actions of this man, known as the Changing God to some, attracted the enmity of the \"Angel of Entropy\", who now seeks to destroy him and his creations. The Last Castoff, being one such \"creation\", is also targeted by the Angel, and must find their master before both are undone. To do so, the protagonist must explore the Ninth World, discovering other castoffs, making friends and enemies along the way. One means of such exploration are the \"Meres\" \u2013 artifacts that let their user gain control over the lives of other castoffs, and experience different worlds or dimensions through them. Through these travels the Last Castoff will leave their mark on the world \u2013 their Legacy \u2013 and will find an answer to the fundamental question of the story: What does one life matter?", "summary": "Torment: Tides of Numenera is a game set in the world of Monte Cook's new tabletop RPG setting, Numenera. Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment, the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With Torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores similar deep, personal themes.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/torment-tides-of-numenera", "videos": [{"id": 2940, "name": "Kickstarter Video", "video_id": "r4NkADMQwzg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4NkADMQwzg", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Kickstarter Pitch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r4NkADMQwzg/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 2941, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Gd43NYBzHuk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd43NYBzHuk", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - First Glimpse", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gd43NYBzHuk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 8447, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "RjOZ2JfoWRQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjOZ2JfoWRQ", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Teaser (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RjOZ2JfoWRQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9662, "name": "Gamescom 2016 Trailer", "video_id": "Dcr-8LYqGwk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcr-8LYqGwk", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Gamescom 2016 Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dcr-8LYqGwk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11028, "name": "Glaive Class Trailer", "video_id": "xoywiJ65h4o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoywiJ65h4o", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Glaive Class Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xoywiJ65h4o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11029, "name": "Nano Class Trailer", "video_id": "mIJ4vAMub9o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIJ4vAMub9o", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Nano Class Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mIJ4vAMub9o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11030, "name": "World Of Numenera Trailer", "video_id": "4uxaj5Jr0tE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uxaj5Jr0tE", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - World Of Numenera Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4uxaj5Jr0tE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11233, "name": "Jack Class Trailer", "video_id": "HJv98UkEaQs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJv98UkEaQs", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Jack Class Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HJv98UkEaQs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12052, "name": "Story Trailer", "video_id": "bWx4hBzHjBw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWx4hBzHjBw", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Story Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bWx4hBzHjBw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12574, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "jWZ2avJcWKM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWZ2avJcWKM", "title": "Torment: Tides of Numenera - Launch Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jWZ2avJcWKM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
