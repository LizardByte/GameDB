It was developed as part of a joint research project between the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of Westchester County, New York and IBM in 1964\u20131966 for investigation of the use of computer-based simulations in schools. It was designed by Mabel Addis, then a fourth-grade teacher, and programmed by William McKay for the IBM 7090 time-shared mainframe computer.\nThe Sumerian Game has been described as the first video game with a narrative, as well as the first edutainment game. As a result, Mabel Addis has been called the first female video game designer and the first writer for a video game.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sumerian-game"}
