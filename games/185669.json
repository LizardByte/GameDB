Tetris is one of the great many versions of the famous soviet block-stacking game. Pieces made up of four blocks (dubbed \"tetriminoes\") fall into a 10x20 square well, and must be arranged into complete lines, which then vanish and clear more space on the board. As lines are cleared, the game speed increases until either the tetriminoes reach the top of the well or the player completes the goal for the current mode.", "videos": [{"id": 62179, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JNznZOLynQo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNznZOLynQo", "title": "Tetris (2002) [WSC] - RetroArch with Beetle Cygne", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JNznZOLynQo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
