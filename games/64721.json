The gameplay is similar to previous instalments, with the focus being on finding items scattered across a diverse collection of scenes. Some items are placed in the player's inventory and need to be used in other locations to advance in the game. The game does feature some variations on the basic hidden object formula, with many hidden object scenes being two screens wide, and some items only being revealed by the manipulation of other items.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hidden-expedition-the-uncharted-islands"}
