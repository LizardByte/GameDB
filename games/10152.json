The game starts in 2105 with the emergence of a new team, Brutal Deluxe.", "summary": "Speedball is a futuristic football-like game which takes place on a steel walled floored pitch, 160 feet long by 90 feet wide. There are two teams, and the team scoring the most goals wins. There is a goal at each end of the pitch and a ball warp tunnels in each side of the wall. The warp tunnels can warp a ball from one tunnel to another. The ball is launched from the center of the pit by the automatic launcher in a random direction. There also bounce domes, off of which the ball will be deflected, but over which players are free to move. This version of the game comes with a much better VGA graphics and Sound Blaster sounds. The game-play is also greatly enhanced.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 4129, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "H41gzVn_pYg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H41gzVn_pYg", "title": "Speedball 2:  Brutal Deluxe (Sega Mega Drive)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H41gzVn_pYg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
