However, throughout the past four Holy Grail Wars, history has yet to see a single victor.\n\nDuring the Fourth Holy Grail War ten years ago, Shirou Emiya was saved from amidst the fires of war by the self-proclaimed mage Kiritsugu Emiya. The young Shirou started living with Kiritsugu and persistently asked for instruction in magecraft, much to the mage's disapproval. On the night prior to Kiritsugu's death, Shirou promised his adoptive father that he'll become a Hero of Justice.\n\nFast forward to the present. On one quiet eve, Shirou gets involved in the Holy Grail War and is assailed by a Servant. Just as the glint of steel threatens to take his life, a girl clad in knightly armor appears to stop the fatal attack. The Servant, who came to the rescue of the would-be Hero of Justice, and the Master, saved by the Heroic Spirit of the Sword; their fates are in motion...", "summary": "A remastered version of Fate/Stay Night, a fantasy action drama visual novel and TYPE-Moon's first-ever commercial release in 2004.
