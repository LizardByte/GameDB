You could say it's one part action game and two parts dating simulator, plus a teeny tiny bit of \"stealth mission\" thrown in. And the creator freely admits that while she's tried to tell a nice story, gameplay (and occasional silliness) sometimes takes precedent over logic here. \n \nEden is also a game containing many secrets. Six known endings. Several achievements. Various subtle and not-so-subtle story and gameplay differences that depend on the choices you make. Be warned, though: once you commit to a choice, there's no turning back. At least not until the next playthrough. \n \nGood luck, and enjoy!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eden"}
