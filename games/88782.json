The more accurate you flick your finger to hit the ball; it is more likely that you will be a home-run hitter.\nThe rule is simple. Flick your finger with the same feeling in which you would swing a bat in real life. Think of your finger as a bat, and flick it with speed and accuracy. That\u2019s all.\nVarious kinds of throws are materialized into \u201creal-life like\u201d feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
