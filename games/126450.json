So he accepted and went; because even though the mansion was suspicious and secluded, it was also fancy and had a parteh.\n\nIn fact, it turned out to be so fancy that there was a time machine in its bathroom. Quincy could wash his hands and time-travel while he was at it. Talk about a time-saver!\n\nBut of course, then people start dying, because that's what they do. And somewhere along the way, things get a little Lovecraftian and tentacles are involved.\n\nAnyway, that's around 1/3 of what the game is really about.", "summary": "A bonkers time-loop tragicomedy murder mystery thriller featuring multiple casualties and a suspicious cat, from the creator of To the Moon.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/impostor-factory", "videos": [{"id": 31474, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bi0EN6pPYwE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi0EN6pPYwE", "title": "To the Moon 3 - (Spoof) Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bi0EN6pPYwE/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2924, "name": "To the Moon"}]}
