That's up to them. I won't release this patch due to its machine-translated nature. I just wanted to share something I enjoyed. \n\nOne could say this was a long time coming. My first video was on its \"demo\" and I promised to get to the full game as soon as I could. The full version came out in February of this year. Whoops. But I promised I'd get to it, so even if it took this long, I might as well.\n\nI could've just done a part 2 but uhh... I think there were some significant changes here, such as an art update and new puzzles. I like to think I've improved on my video creation as well, so that's another reason. \n\nGave me a chance to improve some text since machine translation will never be accurate but y'know... Only can do so much with not much language knowledge. I tried my best though. A good portion of the text is unchanged from the first video though. So apologies for any confusing /wrong/bad dialogue. English is hard and translating Japanese from what a machine assumes it means into English is even harder. (Translating Japanese is hard too, but you know what I mean...)\n\nBut I still spotted typos and errors during recording despite checking the translation multiple times :)))) I just didn't want to go insane checking it like 100 times... So my bad. \n\nI'll admit that I could've fixed up a lot more. The nonsense text is actually decipherable in Japanese, but I didn't know it at the time of making my initial translation and the second half of the game doesn't contain it that much. I did however for the only instances of it in the second half make it \"make sense\" of what it was saying. It's not like a cipher, but if you look at it hard enough, you'll realize (probably). I didn't bother fixing up the earlier nonsense text since I'm lazy and also because I doubt most people would bother deciphering it through a video... \n\nI decided to also only do Ending 2 since the end requirement require a bit of backtracking from the end, and End 1 and End 2 don't have differences aside from an extra scene after credits. And I am still coping that this might get officially translated to English one day. \n\nSo...! What did I think of the game? I liked it! It's not the best RPG Horror, but I really enjoyed it. I like the characters, the story is nice (especially since I realized there's quite a bit of foreshadowing), I like the art as well. The music is also nice and atmospheric. \n\nI was also pleasantly surprised at this being a puzzle game. There's different types of puzzles here and I enjoyed them. I kind of breezed through them here since I've already played this a few times to check the text, but I like the variety.\n\nI do have some critiques though. While I love the mapping in some more detailed areas of the game, for some simpler maps, the walls not being defined bothered me. It's a personal preference thing though... Perhaps even a nitpick.\n\nI also wish there were more CGs. The art is very pretty so I wish there was more of it... \n\nGood game, hopefully, it gets an English translation one day.\n\n(If I had a nickel for every time I played an RPG Maker game with creatures called \"Creepies\" in it this year, I'd have two nickels but it's weird that it's happened twice, right?
