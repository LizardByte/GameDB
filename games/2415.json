Most of the time, while exploring the over world, the game is shown in a 2D top-down view. It gives you much freedom: there's more to do than just stick to the main quest. Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints.\n\nDuring dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character's weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/abandoned-places-a-time-for-heroes"}
