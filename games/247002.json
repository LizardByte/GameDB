It has just a composite video output and monaural audio.\n\nThe InterAct comes with four controllers. One of which resembles a typical game console controller. Another one is attached to the user's leg and used for playing the Soccer game. The other two are called GenieCons, but resemble Wii remotes. All the controllers are flimsy and cheap like the InterAct console and could break in half during hard play.\n\nIt comes with two cartridges which are extremely small. Most of the games on the console are multicarts. The games found on it are mostly by Waixing.\n\nOne cartridge is the Sports cartridge which contains 8 games. The other cartridge contains 32 games, which brings the total to 40. All of them have equally poor control mechanics, are poorly designed, and are extremely difficult to play.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/interact"}
