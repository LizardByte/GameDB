Use the shoulder buttons to rotate your paddles to shoot your orb in any direction. Find and utilize various power-ups throughout your journey to aid you in your fight against evil. There is a total of 5 levels (with several sub-levels within each) with new and unique challenges and varying environments. Each level has a unique end boss that must be defeated to continue.
