You follow a baby eldritch abomination-type entity named Vis as it \"grows up\" at the behest of its parent, a giant red eyeball who lives in a sewer. The game has two main segments: Reality, and Dreaming.\n\nReality: Vis explores sections of Ashvale city to find whatever body parts its parent requests for the night. Gameplay in reality involves exploration, item collection, solving simple puzzles, and maybe killing people for body parts. Vis can get advice from its fellows in the sewer, alongside Visybil, who can provide more information on the objective and plot.\n\nDreaming: Vis explores their dreams as they sleep during the day. Gameplay in dreams involves exploration and item collection, and later on will include puzzles. The dreams end abruptly and without warning, so thoroughly exploring one THEMED location (such as the entirety of a hospital) before moving to the next will reward Vis with the best experience each dream has to offer.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
