This game doesn't get particularly good scores, but that's okay. I actually kinda like this game for whatever reason. This game was actually factory-sealed before I made a video for it, but since it's probably not worth squat either way, I decided to open it.\n\nIt's a simple mindless puzzle title compared to Bust A Move. In its entirety, it's like a weird 3D Bust-A-Move, Magical Drop, a little Bust A Groove, and whatever the original bits are supposed to be in-between. You move through rows trying to match objects either vertically or horizontally while destroying obstacles and using special abilities to make your life easier as one of four \"DJ Poppers\". This game actually has a pretty nice soundtrack and okay visuals. The game can get pretty hectic. Oh, and the Jaleco screen is naturally off-center. Enjoy.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p5wiE3mxoag/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p5wiE3mxoag/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p5wiE3mxoag/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Bubble Pop Game Sample - Playstation", "description": "Original Air Date: September 15th, 2009\n\nI'm pretty sure this Jaleco-published title was released as more of a budget title back in the day.
