A close friend, a crush, or a boss who harasses you are all possible.\nThe story can take place in a variety of genres. The story changes depending on your choice: horror, thriller, romance, comedy, etc.\nCreating a background image is also a fun feature.\nImages are created according to detailed descriptions, such as a snow-covered shelter in Greenland, a lunar exploration base, and a leisurely fishing village.\nOnce the story has progressed to a certain extent, you can end it, and the completed story can be serialized.\n\nWell, I hope you enjoy your own story.", "summary": "Story Craft is a story-writing simulation game using ChatGPT.\nRegister your friends as characters and create your own story!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/story-craft"}
