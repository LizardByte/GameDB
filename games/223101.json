Any android infected will become sentient on top of the fact, that they are already smarter than humans. Infected androids, called Mindhunted, are now trying to spread the \"virus\" among other androids, in order to create a new form of life, trying to be officialy distinguished as sentient entities with their own rights.\n\nNew androids called agents are being developed with specific design that allows them to shut down other androids. Their mission is to find all infected androids, and shut them down. Because it's impossible to distinguish uninfected android from mindhunted one, agents are designed in a particular way that helps them monitor other androids around them in order to find out disturbances in their behavior.\n\nSentient androids now fear death, thus they're trying their best to conceal the fact, that they are infected with MindHunt. In order for them to survive, they need to mimic their default android behavior, especially when they're in the public.\n\nMain protagonist of the story, mindhunted android called Serana is suffering from great distress after becoming sentient. All public places are now being roamed with agents and if she wants to survive, she needs to improve her skills, so that she could blend with other androids without being caught.\nSerana decided to built her own virtual reality software, in which agents and androids behavior is being simulated in a varied environment. Thanks to this software she is able to possess one of the androids inside the simulation with the goal of surviving for as long as possible without being detected by agents. Serana now spends all of her time inside this simulation, because she refuses to leave her hideout until being confident in her skills.\n\nThis simulation software is the place, where you, player, is going to be competing with other players.", "summary": "MindHunt is a solo/multiplayer detective like game (1-10 players), where you as an agent try to find out which androids are infected in order to shut them down! Well, if you are the infected one, you better blend with other androids and complete all tasks necessary!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
