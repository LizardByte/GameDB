Judge went on to have a record-breaking rookie season in 2017, was named an All-Star, and won the Home Run Derby, overcoming a brutal 22 homer first-round and hitting a total of 47 throughout the derby. 16 of those with exit velocities of 115 mph or harder and a few 500+ foot blasts. \n\nTo add to his already massive resume, Judge has hit 52 home runs as a rookie, breaking legendary Mark McGwire's MLB rookie record of 49; and also hit 33 home runs at Yankee Stadium, breaking the record of 32 set by legend Babe Ruth in 1921. This rookie is the living, breathing example of Road to the Show - create a player with massive stats and trek on to becoming a legend - which is why we are proud to announce him as the cover athlete for The Show 18.\n\n\nHome runs, steals, and epic catches \u2013 get deep into the action and experience your favorite parts of baseball with MLB\u00ae The Show\u2122 18.
