Each player is in a hurry to be like the first and get rid of all their cards. At the same time from level to level the reaction rate of rivals increases and it will be harder for you to win. \nAs in any other game, much depends on your luck. Perhaps the sequence of cards will be perfect and you will have time to get rid of them in the very first seconds of the round. But in more difficult conditions, the game can be very long.
