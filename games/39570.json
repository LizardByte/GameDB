The only player controlled car is a Ferrari 330 P4 type prototype racing against computer controlled opponents driving generic cars. The player would race with fifteen other rivals across the track, all attempting to prevent the player from winning. During some of the courses the player would have the opportunity to activate different controls, which include headlights for night driving and windshield wipers during rainstorms. If the player does not activate these controls when prompted, effects such as a restricted view of the road or a wet windshield will occur.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 25709, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "-AXaEGhFDqs"}]}
