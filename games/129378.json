Is this a joke, a crazy experiment, or... a game? You'll find out soon enough, just try not to die first!\nYour puny squad is capable of much more. Choose your loot and transform the squishy humans into wizards, cultists, ninjas and dozens of other heroes, including the mythical stale pretzel throwers. With perks and class combos, there are thousands of ways to build your army. The man-eating cabbage will appreciate the variety in its diet!\nIf you can survive the labyrinth, you'll meet THE UNSTOPPABLE END-GAME BUILDS OF OTHER PLAYERS! You'll beat each other to death and only one will be spared by d'Spot. No offense, but in his own game he writes the rules!\nPrepare your warriors and let them fight it out on their own! Indirect combat allows you to focus heavily on tactical considerations rather than reflexes. Strengthen your front line with fridge-movers, aim your food-throwers and look after your Forbidden Summoners!", "summary": "A mix of a turn-based roguelike, an epic battle simulator, unexpected cultural references and an atmosphere of despotism in the far future. Up to 49 units in the team! Deep turn-based gameplay with epic fights in real time.
