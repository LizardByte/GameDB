In the game, players travel via a special book to the island of Myst. There, players solve puzzles, and by doing so, travel to four other worlds, known as Ages, which reveal the backstory of the game's characters.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/myst-masterpiece-edition", "videos": [{"id": 45578, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "c5Fxc72NVhM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Fxc72NVhM", "title": "Myst: Masterpiece Edition | Full Playthrough | No Commentary", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c5Fxc72NVhM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
