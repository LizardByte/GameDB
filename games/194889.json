This mod introduces rebalanced gameplay with changes to enemy placements, attack patterns, and AI behaviours, making encounters more unpredictable and difficult. It adds new weapons, armour, and items, some of which have unique abilities and effects not found in the base game. Boss battles are made more challenging with altered move sets and increased difficulty, requiring new strategies to defeat. The mod often includes improved textures and visual effects, enhancing the game's overall aesthetic. Some areas in the game are redesigned to offer new exploration opportunities and hidden secrets. Additionally, new narrative elements and item descriptions are introduced, enriching the lore of the Dark Souls universe.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-souls-ascended"}
