With a trail of damaged planets left in the black hole\u2019s wake, the space travelling animals board the Space Ark and fly across the galaxy on a mission to repair the damaged worlds. At each planet your Arkonauts must bounce in the air and bag DNA combos, power-ups and all the fruit they can catch so ultimately inhabitants can return. \n \nA colourful, original arcade action game with the golden age of \u2018one more go\u2019 gaming running through its DNA, Space Ark is that classic title, which is easy to play yet difficult to master for both casual and hardcore gamers alike.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
