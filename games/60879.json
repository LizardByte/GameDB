He has a Female Allergy Improvement System used to measure how long he's been near girls and how severe his allergic reactions have become. If he spends too much time around girls, he will faint. If he manages to spend enough time with girls without getting allergic, his resistance level gets higher. He can choose to be with Miharu, Kirie, Koyomi, Tomoka, or a new character named Kanata. Whoever he spends the most time with becomes his lover and determines the ending of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/girls-bravo-romance15-s"}
