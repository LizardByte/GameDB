If two people confess their feelings for one another at the turn of the millennium, they will be destined to be together in a thousand year fairytale romance! Who will choose you on New Year's eve?\n\nWelcome to Escafeld College, the school in which you spend the next year meeting a cast of 13 unique characters. Taking them to a variety of locations and making new friendships along the way!\n\nBuilding your skills is going to be vital to maintaining your standing at the college and with the cast. A delicate balance that will allow you to grow closer to the people you like. While also keeping you in the good graces of everyone else you meet at Escafeld.\n\nRather than the standard dry AI experiences trained on large sets of data from the internet, the cast in Millennium Whisper is played by AI that are exclusively trained on in-house creative work and runs entirely on your own hardware!\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and the way you play the game will be entirely unique to you. Each of our (13) characters has their own unique personality and behaviours powered by their own separately trained model. In Millennium Whisper you can have complex relationships and deep conversations, or enjoy a more light hearted experience, having fun with the characters.\n\nPlay the game your way, and write your own story.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/millennium-whisper", "videos": [{"id": 140418, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p4WkC8vOnR8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4WkC8vOnR8", "title": "Millennium Whisper - Official Game Trailer 2025", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p4WkC8vOnR8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
