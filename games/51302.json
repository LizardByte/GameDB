With the exception of Episode III, the PSO games themselves are hack and slash role-playing games where the player slays monsters, levels up, buys new equipment, etc. The online Phantasy Stars differ from the previous games of the series by offering a real-time \u2013 rather than turn-based \u2013 approach to combat, seamlessly integrating this with exploration and plot developments.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phantasy-star-online-blue-burst", "videos": [{"id": 34118, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "u5XuHUG_R4M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5XuHUG_R4M", "title": "PSO - Episode 4 (a.k.a.
