She quits her job at the factory and starts looking for a new job. That\u2019s when she bumpes into Egawa Chitomi and Arita Kisuke, who are looking for a new maid for the Miyanomori family. Haru applied for the job on the spot, leaving her hometown to work in their mansion in Tokyo. She thought working as a maid would be fun.. until she meets the six Miyanomori brothers.\n\nThe brothers each have different mothers, all divorced from their father \u2014 the head of the family, Miyanomori Genichirou. Being born in a big family, most of the brothers treat Haru like crap. They call her trash and view her as a lowly servant who doesn\u2019t have any right to talk back to them. Not to mention Tae, her new tsundere friend there, keeps lying and gets her in trouble. Haru quickly realized that her new job isn\u2019t by any means easy, but she needs to work hard for her family.\n\nNot too long after Haru starts working there, Genichirou announced to his sons that he\u2019s retiring soon and he\u2019s making a game to determine who will be the next head. The brothers have to entertain him and collect points. The first one who reached ten points will be the new head, and they have until March to please their father. This is the reason why the brothers all have different mothers: Genichirou wants to put them into a battle for the position.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "videos": [{"id": 39163, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "VQLwxSKq1d0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLwxSKq1d0", "title": "PS Vita\u300c\u83ef\u30e4\u30ab\u54c9\u3001\u6211\u30ac\u4e00\u65cf \u30e2\u30c0\u30f3\u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30a3\u300d \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VQLwxSKq1d0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
