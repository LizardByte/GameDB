The game uses five buttons; light attack, medium attack, heavy attack, escape action, and heavy action. The escape action button can be used to perform evasive maneuvers and guards while heavy actions can be used to push an opponent back. Players can perform Infinite Blasts, which can interrupt an opponent's attack, Variable Rushes, which allows for surprise combos, and Lethal Blazes, which serve as the game's super combo attacks. Players can also choose two support characters which they can summon to assist them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 48648, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "0BP7iu9xXR4"}, {"id": 48649, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "I2UKHlNBVC8"}, {"id": 48650, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "riZZmosjsW0"}]}
