Every word you write will give you points and a bonus in seconds to extend the length of the game. So remember: longer words can be harder to find, but they mean more points and extra time! Be aware that once a letter is used to write a word, it disappears and it will be replaced with a new one. So a bit of strategy is needed because you have to take care even of the letters you don\u2019t use to write a valid word. Too many equal letters (or \u201crare\u201d ones) left, or few vowels can really lower your chances to keep on playing. Anyway, if during the game you cannot find any word to enter, and you\u2019ve got reached enough points, you can ask for a suggestion. A suggested word won\u2019t let you earn points or seconds, but it can be essential if things become too odd, and time too short, to clean up your board.", "summary": "Chalk Up! is a fast-paced anagrams/word game.
