Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Merge Town!, the newest title from Gram Games. The concept of the game is simple - you have a plot of land, and it\u2019s your job to turn it into a town. Every so often, you\u2019ll be gifted with a house. Each house can be merged with other houses of the same variety to form a bigger home. Every house built on the land will earn you money - the bigger the home, the more you will earn. The more you earn, the more houses you can purchase, and the more you can push the clock to develop faster. Use your spoils to discover new homes, and to expand into all new towns.\n\nYou have a singular goal: make your towns the best they can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures development - Merge buildings to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space in your plot for you to develop, which will only allow you to develop your town to even further greatness. Once you develop into new towns, keep an eye on all your land, ensuring that you\u2019re merging and developing to your full potential.\n\nMerge, build, and develop your very own towns with Merge Town!"}
