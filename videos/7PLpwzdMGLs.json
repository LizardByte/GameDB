A look back at the past 2 decades of gaming that will make you think about the good, the bad, and the ones left behind.\n\nThe story follows a group of players on a massive multiplayer game called Convento. An online ecosystem of players grinding for gear, cosmetics and currency, with a huge trading scene. Our characters dream of making it big, trading and selling their in-game currency for real money so they can live as comfy neets in the real world.\n\n\nIn a way, Convento is a love letter not just to videogames, but to the gaming community as a whole. Greatly inspired by our own experience and knowledge in games such as WoW, TF2, GMOD, among others.\n\n#ConventoGame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PLpwzdMGLs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PLpwzdMGLs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PLpwzdMGLs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PLpwzdMGLs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7PLpwzdMGLs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Convento Crowdfunding Campaign Announcement Trailer #indiegogo", "description": "Convento's crowdfunding campaign is now live on Indiegogo!
