The background music for this level is an arranged version of the well-known military march by Franz Schubert.", "summary": "Play as Challenger, a brave archeologist whose mission is to rescue a princess who's been kidnapped by a secret evil organization. The game offers four different types of adventures in four different ways to play, starting with a runaway train battle, exploring a vast island, and facing off against a boss.\n\nOriginally planned as a port of the ZX Spectrum video game Stop the Express, which was released by Sinclair Research Ltd in 1983. Stop the Express only contained the first train level, and 3 levels were added for the release of Challenger.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/challenger--1", "videos": [{"id": 39627, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Ec_-q4Kyme4"}]}
