A novel\u2019s worth of handwritten lore is knit into a procedurally-generated history that\u2019s unique each game.", "summary": "Caves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retro-futurism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. The game weaves a handwritten narrative through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted & procedurally-generated world where you can do just about anything. Assemble your character from over 70 mutations and defects, and 24 castes and kits - it\u2019s all the character diversity you could want.
