All 30 teams from MLB and their stadiums are included, as well as their player rosters. The Wii version of this game is controlled by flicking the Wii remote and Nunchuk. These motion controls include drumming the remote and nunchuk when trying to speed up and using the remote as a bat when hitting."}
