Tempted by the sweet aroma of the pomegranate which I so love, I ate it.\nI was then suddenly struck by great sleepiness.\nUnable to fight it off, I went to bed. It was then when I heard a sweet voice that made me shudder in disgust.\n\n\"Welcome home. Finally, I'm able to be in the same place as you.\"\n\nWhen I shot up awake in the morning, I was holding a hand-mirror that I've never seen before.\nA voice from the hand-mirror- calling itself the mirror's spirit- in a whisper, tells me to \"save the fated one\".\nAnd then, I met the guys I first saw at the exhibition again.\n\nWhen I drew closer to them, they invited me into the unreal and mad world; the \"Mirror World\".\nThe guys in the Mirror World will only call me \"Snow White\", and had crazed expressions unlike when they were in the real world.\nI learned of the \"Queen\" as I became closer to them.\n\n\"Capture Snow White.\"\n\nThe Queen is trying to capture me- Snow White.\nThe guys' madness. The Queen drawing closer. I wonder why I'm called \"Snow White\", and why I\u2019m being targeted...\n\n\"Now it is your turn to have taste of loneliness. Go on, try and escape. I'll chase you to the ends of the world. I'll definitely capture you.\"", "summary": "Kyoukai no Shirayuki is a Japanese otome visual novel.
