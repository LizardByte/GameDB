You suspect she's run off into the woods across the street, a bad habit she does whenever she manages to get a paw out the door behind your back.

Lucky for you a kind (but odd-looking) stranger stumbled upon you before anything bad happened.\n\n...Let's hope he only has good intentions in bringing you home.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mushroom-oasis"}
