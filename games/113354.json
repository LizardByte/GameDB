Sure, if you took off driving to the east of the city, you will eventually hit the Ederas Sea' But if you go southwest, you can drive until you run out of gas' But if you had enough gas, you could keep driving that direction and end up driving all the way around the planet to end up in Deois again (after about 18,500 km)'\n\nSo maybe you are an explorer, a ground vehicle isn\u2019t going to cut it so you build your finances to purchase an aircraft like our A-4 Wanderer model' Sleek and fast, economical fuel burn, but only holds one cargo container and a handful of passengers' Maybe your dream is to build an empire far removed from the capital city' You can purchase property from the government or each other to build mining colonies, farming communities, and even your own townships'\n\nWhat if you dream to fly in space? A majority of our players share this aspiration' The model E-10 Saint is your bird' But the steep price tag and difficult reentry might make you consider taking a day off as a taxicab driver and taking a ride aboard another player\u2019s ship!", "summary": "Rise is a persistent science fiction sandbox strategy MMO set on Vieneo, a moon orbiting an exoplanet.
