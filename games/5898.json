You fight as one of nine characters--three of which are unlockable--with looks, moves, and taunts based on kung-fu movie icons. Your quest for movie stardom places you on a dynamic movie set, and when the director yells \"Action!\" you fight against multiple enemies either by yourself or with three friends. Perform over-the-top, Hong-Kong-style combat--including leaps, and flying kicks--and you'll become a star in no time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kung-fu-chaos"}
