After an amazing day, in which their institute club has obtained for the fourth time in a row the Science Olympiad 1st award, the happy couple can at least relax in the city cliff, looking at a great star-filled night sky. But the happiness will not last as much as they expected\u2026\n\nSuddenly, a thunderbolt felt from the sky and hit Ned\u2019s car. When Ned managed to react, he saw a horrible image: a huge evil shadow had fallen over the city and kidnapped Linda. With an evil laugh, the demonic entity slipped through the windows of the school, taking his girlfriend inside and plunging the city into chaos and darkness. Ned, still stunned by the lightning strike, believed that the end was near for all\u2026\n\nBut when the evil forces rise over the good ones, the moon cast its spell on the hero, the chosen one, the one designed to save us all. And the moon threw its power beam on Ned, he felt strange and full of power again! Now, with his new powers, he will start his quest to save to save his girlfriend and destroy the Evil One. Are you brave enough to face your destiny?\n\nREVIEW:\n\nWhen the game starts there is an intro sequence telling pretty much the same history as the above introduction text, and this is accompanied by nice graphics and a good soundtrack! Back in the days there was two great arcade games named Ghost\u2019n Goblins and the sequel Ghouls\u2019n Ghosts, and they were also great games on most of the systems they were ported to. I wrote \u201cmost\u201d because the ZX Spectrum versions were very poor. Invasion of the Zombie Monsters is heavily inspired by these games, and shows that if the ZX Spectrum is programmed correctly it can easily run such games.\n\nThis is a platform game with five levels and it features new enemies in every level and a boss fight on each level. Your weapon is a magical projectile of moonlight power and it can be upgraded four times. The power ups you collect to upgrade your weapon is constantly changing between weapon upgrade, weapon downgrade, weapon reset, a nuke bomb that kills everything on the screen, and a time bonus, so you have to choose what you want. The power ups is dropped by dead enemies and dead enemies is also dropping coins you have to collect to receive extra lives. \n\nThe soundtracks in this game is very special, it is not something you will sit down and listen to, but they are very good for this game. It is clearly that they are made especially for a game with graveyard levels and zombies.\n\nIf you are into the Ghost\u2019n Goblins / Ghouls\u2019n Ghosts genre you should play this game instead. Invasion of the Zombie Monsters offers what the other two does not: A full color scrolling screen without color clash and in-game soundtracks! The gameplay is somewhere between not too hard and not too easy, which means that it plays very well and has good and responsive controls.\n\nIt is a great game with intro sequence, five levels with different soundtracks, boss fights and an ending sequence, and a fine Ghosts'n Goblins clone.\n\nRating = 92%\n\nThe game is made by Relevo Video Games in 2010.\n\nDownload here: http://www.relevovideogames.com/invasion-of-the-zombie-monsters/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DbM-FhB-zI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DbM-FhB-zI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DbM-FhB-zI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DbM-FhB-zI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DbM-FhB-zI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Invasion of the Zombie Monsters (2010) Walkthrough + Review, ZX Spectrum", "description": "Huge playlist archive with games from 2005-2013: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxOanVBhqd3uodzx7gXgN_6LpHWIKwjww\nINTRODUCTION (From Relevovideogames.com):\n\nFinally, Ned and Linda can enjoy a little time together.
