However, V.S.S.E. agent Christy Ryan discovers that the company's CEO, Ernesto Diaz, plans to launch an experimental nuclear satellite into space and sell it to the highest bidder. Escaping to a safehouse with a suitcase of incriminating data, she quickly finds herself tracked down and captured by NeoDyne mercenaries, led by Jakov Kinisky, moments before V.S.S.E. agents Keith Martin and Robert Baxter arrive to collect her. While Christy is taken to Diaz, Kinisky flees with the suitcase, forcing the agents to pursue him. After killing him during a boat chase, the pair retrieve the case and learn that the experimental satellite is being transported via train.\n\nLocating the train, Keith and Robert board it, and attempt to destroy, but are thwarted by NeoDyne's mercenaries and security, who manage to extract the satellite. Learning that Diaz is preparing to launch the satellite from a remote spaceport, the pair travel to the site, encountering further resistance led by Wild Dog - a former crimeboss that was defeated by the V.S.S.E. but whose body was never found. Both agents quickly are forced into a firefight with Dog, who keeps them at bay with a prosthetic mini-gun that replaced his right arm and additional assistance, but is defeated. Before he can be forced to surrender, he commit suicide with explosives, leaving the agents to focus on the satellite.", "summary": "Time Crisis II is a light gun arcade game and the second installment in the Time Crisis series.
