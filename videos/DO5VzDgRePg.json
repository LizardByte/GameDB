It\u2019s easy to learn but hard to master due to these random gravity factors. The unpredictable force of the gravity means that if you time it just right, for example in one game, you can glide from planet to planet.  It is both frustrating and addictive to play.  \n\nThere are nine game modes \u2013 3 single player and 6 local multiplayer.  The multi-player mode includes diverse and entertaining mini-games to play \u2013 something I love!
