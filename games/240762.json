As The Universe began to take shape, so too did space. But space is unpredictable, and creating life is tiresome work. So, the Sprites took it upon themselves to create a pastime. The Space Olympics.\n\nEach event features its own unique bite-sized challenge where up to 4 players can compete. Eject your friends into space as you race across gravity fields, score a goal with an entire moon, leap across planets to escape a black hole, and capture and hold zodiacal constellations.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/which-way-up-space-olympics"}
