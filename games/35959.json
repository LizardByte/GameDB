The game places the player in the role of a rogue music-processing algorithm from a computer's sound systems. From this role, the player can view the world only through audible means. When idle, the player views the game world as only a plain, black void. However, each sound in the game sends out a pulse of energy, illuminating a small portion of the world around that sound's source. Through this function, players can visualize their surroundings and learn to navigate through a strange and complex computer world."}
