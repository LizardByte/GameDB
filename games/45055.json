Zip across the winding canals of Venice or speed through twisting sewers beneath Paris. For the truly adventurous jet skier there is even a Loch Ness course, complete with sea serpent.\n\nThe game has two different physics model settings - a simulation mode for a realistic feel and an arcade mode for fast, forgiving gameplay. Seadoo HydroCross is built on the tried and true Polaris SnoCross game engine."}
