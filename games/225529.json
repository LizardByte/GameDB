It was labelled either Football or Football I (after the release of Football II). Early models of Football had an AC Adapter jack which was removed on later models (which would only run on batteries).\n\nFirst released in June of 1977 as the second game released by Mattel (Auto Race was the first) and sold through Sears. After less than 100,000 were made, Sears (using a computer model based on initial sales figures) determined that the games would not be big sellers, and most of the production for Football and Auto Race was stopped. Within 6 months, it became obvious to Sears that their prediction was wrong, and production was started up again and reached previously unknown levels! (Reaching as many as 500,000 units a week by mid-February, 1978).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/football--8"}
