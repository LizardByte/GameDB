The aim of this hack is to make a compliment to the original game. Super Mario Kart featured courses named for Mario, Koopa and Bowser. This has new themes for the other 5 characters plus a revamp of the Mario, Bowser and Rainbow Road courses. In addition to 20 all-new standard tracks, it also features 4 new battle courses.\n\nThe roster is mostly the same but Donkey Kong Jr. has been replaced with regular Donkey Kong and Koopa is replaced with Paratroopa.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
