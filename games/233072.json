It was a collaboration between Sega and Nike to promote Nike's Vapor shoes. The graphics and gameplay are based on those of the original 16-bit Sonic the Hedgehog, though Sonic's sprites have been altered so that he wears the eponymous shoes.\n\nIn the game, Sonic runs endlessly through a level. The player must destroy Badniks and collect Rings for points. The player will encounter soccer balls, which can be kicked to destroy Badniks. Speed increases as the game goes on. Losing a life ends the game. After the game ends, the player may post their score on their Facebook or Twitter account."}
