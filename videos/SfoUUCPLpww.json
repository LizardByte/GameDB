Design and optimize factories to create cubes, used galaxy-wide as crates, musical instruments, octopus housing, sculptures, and more. Rewind and replay the action to hunt for improvements. Compete with your friends, work out why the factory robots keep misbehaving, and unmask a cube conspiracy.\n\n*Design*\nFill a cube factory with a variety of devices and program them to work together to produce the required cubes. Each workstation's grid command system allows you to create complex loops, and branching logic flow is enabled by using measurement devices such as lasers to observe the factory's state. Pull apart and reassemble cubes, merge them, paint them, teleport them, set fire to them, add payloads, and ship them off to the customer.\n\n*Rewind*\nGrab the timeline handle and crank time backwards to see the state of the factory in the past. Replay past steps and spot where a solution has a bug or could be made more efficient.\n\n*Optimize*\nCompete against your friends and the rest of the world to produce the quickest, or simplest, or least wasteful solution to each puzzle.\n\n*Create*\nBuild your own puzzles using Hexahedra's built-in level editor and share them with friends or via the Steam Workshop.\n\n*Save (or rule!) the Galaxy*\nCubes have become the galaxy's most important commodity, a fact that some intend to exploit to their own advantage. Track down the conspiracy, infiltrate it, and bring it down. Or don't, and take your place amongst the new rulers.\n\n\n\n\nHexahedra soundtrack by James Elsey: https://www.jameselseymusic.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfoUUCPLpww/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfoUUCPLpww/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfoUUCPLpww/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfoUUCPLpww/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfoUUCPLpww/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hexahedra Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Wishlist and Follow Hexahedra on Steam: https://s.team/a/1248420\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/BfYyvgC\n\nHexahedra is an open-ended programming puzzle game.
