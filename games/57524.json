She goes to McDonald's to enjoy some greasy food, and discovers a vampire slouching in a booth.

She lures vampire into traps so her teammates can slay them. So she can't confront the vampire directly and instead needs to be creative.", "summary": "A game written by Abigail Corfman for the Annual Interactive Fiction Competition."}
