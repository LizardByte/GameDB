The reason? Without fail, the girl sees a \u201cblack thread\u201d whenever a disaster will occur, her unsettling ability predicating calamities with absolute certainty.\n\nThen, one day, men claiming to be members of the mysterious Oniwaban appear before her, saying she is needed in Edo. Soon, the girl\u2019s power, which previously only brought her misfortune, will become an invaluable asset to the Oniwaban and their efforts against the monsters\u2026", "summary": "A fantasy set in historical Japan in the spirit of the first localized console otome game, Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom.
