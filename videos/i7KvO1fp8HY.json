{"id": "i7KvO1fp8HY", "snippet": {"title": "Enclave HD Limited Run Trailer", "description": "One Game. Two sides. This is Enclave HD. \n\nThis classic returns to consoles for the first time in nearly a decade, and comes to PlayStation for the first time ever. Fight in a dual campaign during the Great War of Celenheim in this enhanced and upgraded version of the beloved medieval action combat game. \n\nThis is the battle of the Enclave. \n\nThe Light\n\nCenturies passed since the Great Wizard Vale sacrificed himself to save Celenheim from the hands of Vatar and his legions of Dreg\u2019Atar. The Enclave, the last bastion of the side of light, remained safe enclosed by fortress walls and bottomless chasms. However, the land is beginning to heal and the cliff sides are knitting together. The Shadow forces seek to reignite the war that almost destroyed Celenheim and steal the sacred magic held within the walls of the Enclave. It is up to you to keep the light from being extinguished. \n\nThe Dark\n\nThe control of Celenheim was ripped from the hands of Vatar and his legions of Dreg\u2019Atar. For years the prosperous magic sought by the darkness was hoarded in the Enclave by the soldiers of light. The great rifts surrounding the city kept Vatar and his Outlanders from breaching its walls, but their luck is beginning to change. The land is seaming itself together and the time to invade is near. The legion of Darkness is ready and it is up to you to gain back what is rightfully yours. \n\nBegin your campaign as a soldier of the Light, defending Celenheim from forces of darkness and the horrid demon king Vatar. Change sides and complete an alternative campaign as a minion of the dark tasked with infiltrating and destroying the Enclave you just sought to protect. Twelve different classes and multiple weapon options create great replayability as you descend dungeons, complete missions, and vanquish your enemies.\n\nThe award-winning original version of Enclave was developed by Starbreeze Studios and released in 2002 on Xbox, and 2003 on PC. TopWare Interactive successfully re-released HD versions on Windows, OSX, Linux, and the Nintendo Wii in 2012. Enclave HD is developed under license of TopWare Interactive and will arrive on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch with upgraded visuals and SFX, an enhanced soundtrack with over 20 new tracks, remastered music from the original game's soundtrack, and more! \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopyright 2002-2021 by TopWare Interactive - ACE Enterprises e.K.
