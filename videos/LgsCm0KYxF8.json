Permission was given by Nowieso for me to release.\n\nMerry Christmas Toads and Toadettes! It's the time of year where hollies and jollies run amock and as such another Mario World Christmas Hack is born! Well sorta. What you will find here is a new edition of the previously released Super Mario World: Christmas Edition with added Just Keef flair!\n\nNow you may thinking why should I bother with that?\n\nWell this isn't simply a new coat of paint, this is a complete overhaul of Nowieso's classic original and transforms the entire experience into a Super Mario Christmas story that you will want to experience and share for generations to come! Enjoy not only the fun and playful level design that Nowieso once introduced us all to but enjoy all the new graphics, mechanics, bosses (both old and new tweaked to match the difficulty style of the game) additional levels, character selection (fully integrated character swapping), secret unlockables,  animated cutscenes with a heartwarming story ta boot, and more all SA1 enabled for a smoother more expansive experience brought to you by Just Keef (aka Bensalot)! \n\nIt is a short and sweet experience for the whole family to enjoy and can be beaten in a short amount of time making it the perfect \"Night Before Christmas\" tradition. So from both Nowieso and Just Keef, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!\n\nMario and all characters related are owned by Nintendo. This is a non profit fan project.\n\n\n\nTo play yourself, download this patch and use flips (an ips/bps patcher) to apply to a clean Super Mario World rom. \n\nPatch can be found at:\n\nhttps://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7400/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgsCm0KYxF8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgsCm0KYxF8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgsCm0KYxF8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgsCm0KYxF8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgsCm0KYxF8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Mario Bros - Merry Mountain Christmas Adventure - SMW Christmas Edition V3.0", "description": "Full playthrough showing off all of the various changes I have made.
