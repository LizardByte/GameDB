In this forgotten classic of Golden Age Hollywood, a vedette fallen on hard times (Salom\u00e9 V\u00e9lez) finds herself enmeshed in a tangle of political intrigue, romance and betrayal in a Caribbean republic. Torn between her love for a smuggler, the lust of a corrupt policeman and the machinations of a Soviet intelligence operative, the protagonist navigates the dangers of a high-society party on the eve of revolution. As she tries to survive through that fateful night, the memories of her past will come to haunt her. Controversial at the time for its depiction of Cold War politics and morally ambiguous protagonist. (120 minutes, Technicolor, in-game hint system).", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/1958-dancing-with-fear"}
