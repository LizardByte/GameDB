(English and German translations available for this deck at this time)\n\nWinner of the 2013 Board Game of the Year from Pocket Tactics!\n\nEurope is recovering from some hard times. You and a spouse must grow your 2-room hut and empty farmyard into a productive farm. You must sow and reap, raise animals and expand your family in order to thrive. Europe in the 17th century: a tough time to be a farmer!\n\nAgricola is a family-friendly strategy game. Simple to understand and great fun, Agricola lets everyone play to the end in a race to see who can build the most productive farm.\n\nEasy To Play\nAgricola is a turn-based game, played in six Stages and 14 Rounds. On a turn, players place a family member token on a location in town in order to collect resources or to take actions to improve their farm. They can get building materials such as Wood and Clay, plow fields and sow crops, or build fences to keep animals. New actions become available at the start each round and resources get replenished on any taken in the previous round.\n\nAt harvest crops are reaped, newborn animals arrive and you must feed your family. Growing your family gives you more actions but means you have more mouths to feed!\n\nThe player with the most productive and advanced farm at the end of 14 rounds is the winner. Victory points are awarded for the number of fields and pastures you have, as well as for crops and animals. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family\u2019s home, for the number of family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement cards. Players lose one point for each unused farmyard space.\n\nAn award-winning board game and player favorite since 2007, Agricola is now available as a universal game application.\n\nBrought to you by Playdek, Agricola establishes a new benchmark for iPad board gaming.\n\nFeatures:\n\u20224 Game play modes: Family Game; Basic Game; Solo Play; Solo Series\n\u20221-5 players\n\u2022Included AI opponents\n\u2022Pass-and-play multiplayer (2-5 players)\n\u2022Asynchronous or real-time online play (2-5 players)\n\u2022Universal game application \u2013 buy once and play on all your devices\n\u2022Game Center Achievements\n\u2022Selectable Online game clocks\n\u2022Rematch button for online and offline matches\n\u2022\u201cNext Game\u201d button takes you to your next asynchronous online game\n\u2022Matchmaking\n\u2022Player Rankings\n\u2022Multiple Player Profiles (for households)\n\u2022Select your Family Token art for your profile\n\u2022Game tutorials for interface, game play and strategy\n\u2022Rule Book and Card Gallery to review game text and effects\n\u2022Options for Music and SFX, game speed and animation speed, and confirmation pop-ups\n\u2022Game overview, turn log and game event calendar to support asynchronous play\n\u2022Retina support\n\u2022iPhone / iPod 5 screen support\n\u2022Localizations: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese\n\nFrom Playdek, the award-winning publisher and developer:\n\u2022D&D Lords of Waterdeep - 5 stars on PocketTactics & AppAddicts!!\n\u2022Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer (Golden Geek, 2011 \u2013 Boardgamegeek.com)\n\u2022Summoner Wars (Golden Geek, 2012 \u2013 Boardgamegeek.com; Game of the Year 2012, Pockettactics.com; Game of the Year, Board/Card, 2012 - Gamezebo)\n\u2022Tanto Cuore\n\u2022Nightfall\n\u2022Fluxx\n\u2022Penny Arcade the Game: Gamers vs Evil\n\u2022Can\u2019t Stop\n\u2022Food Fight iOS", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/agricola"}
