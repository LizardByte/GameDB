It is reportedly dotted with obelisks emitting some kind of holographic glyphs and binary controls. Set a course for TRAPPIST-1, intercept the monolith, and investigate.\n\nDue to the nature of this voyage, your screen has been outfitted with vacuum-tolerant pixaels, a more resilient form of pixel. This does however preclude the use of advertisements or in-visor purchases. A complimentary synthwave mix-tape has been included to mitigate space-madness.\n\nINSERT COIN", "summary": "Raster Prime: Remix is a new edition of an original mobile game released in 2017.\nYour mind will short-circuit in this atmospheric pixel sci-fi puzzler with eight levels of increasing difficulty.
