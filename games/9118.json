As Captain John O'Neil, you are physically unharmed, but suffer from a complete and permanent loss of memory. Beside you are three other sleep chambers. One is empty. In another lies a beautiful woman, still in hibernation. The final chamber contains a 300-year old corpse. The ship's computer, Westwick Main, has also had much of her memory deleted by someone unknown. Your wits are your greatest weapon in this story of suspense and interplanetary intrigue. Nothing is as it seems and despite the icy, cold silence... you're not alone.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/darkstar-the-interactive-movie"}
