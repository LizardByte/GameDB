But no one could also prove that \"the past\" is real. It's possible that I just \"existed\" now, and my memories were just fabricated.\n\nThis is me right now, lost, confused, and don't know where to go. Maybe I was just being born last night, but somehow, \"my past\" still haunted me. I can't remember it, but they said I am the one responsible who dropped the helicopter.\n\nFuck! If only I could remember something. I can't even remember my own name. But why?! Even though I can't remember my own name, but I can remember the one who made me like this?!\n\nIt's not only that....I'm not even sure if I'm a human being. Not after what happened today. I can stop the rain. No, it's not like I can change rain to sunny weather...I make thousand droplets of rain stop falling, hanging it in the air like defying the gravitation around me. \n\n.... Far from the bottom of my heart, I'm sure that I have to end all of this.\n\n\nMy name is --------------, let me tell you my story.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nDETAILS\nFormat : Kinetic Novel\nGenre : Action, psychological, sci-fi\nLength : 10k words/chapter (6 chapter ongoing)\nLanguage : English\nPlatform : Browser (html5),  PC (Windows, Mac, Linux) and Android (4.4 and up)\n\n\nTEAM\nOriginal story : fsc\nVN Adaptation : TNR \nMade with Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine\n\n\nVIDEO ANIMATION\nConcept/Creator : TNR\nVA (male) : Cristian.
