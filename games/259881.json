The single-player story follows the plot of the anime unchanged, giving the player a chance to take part in many of the fights from the original series. The game itself is a full-3D beat-'em-up style brawler, and the goal of each stage is to simply defeat every enemy. Ran has a wide variety of different fighting techniques available to her, and can even switch between several different fighting styles on the fly. Items can also be collected that will let the player use extra-damaging special moves. In addition to the main story mode, there is also a two-player versus mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kakutou-bijin-wulong"}
