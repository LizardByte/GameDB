I hear you thinking, \"What?! Humans never lived amongst dinosaurs!\". Let me enlighten you.\n\nFor a long period of time humans lived in the shadows of dinosaurs. The animals were always on the top of the food chain, and finally the humans just had about enough of it. The only way to break free from the constant threat was to eliminate the enemy.\n\nThere have been many theories about the extinction of dinosaurs. A meteor impact, a vulcanic eruption, sea-level regression, or even cosmic radiation from a nearby supernova. Now, the reason these stories exist is that people were actually a bit ashamed of the mass killing that went on in that age, so people were not speaking about it. After decades of generations the real story was lost, and people came up with there own theories.\n\nBut back to the real story. The age where humans finally stood up against their enemy.\n\nLet's make a visit to the Age of Jura.", "summary": "Prepare for an extinction in a long forgotten age, the Age of Jura, where humans are still living among dinosaurs.
