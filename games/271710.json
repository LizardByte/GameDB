However, everything changes when one day he comes home and discovers that his insane father has created a female cyborg. His previous attempts failed because he used an artificial brain; this time, to avoid this mistake, he takes out his son's brain and puts it into the cyborg. Poor Kenji gains a second life - as a beautiful artificial woman, whose task is to oppose a dubious world government organization.\n\nSuper Ultra Machine Cyborg Marilyn DX is an adventure game with very light RPG elements. The interaction is point-and-click; the cursor changes to icons corresponding to examining, talking, and exiting commands when placed upon an object on-screen (during sex scenes, the cursor may change to icons representing sexual actions). The player will also have to explore maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons, encountering enemies at pre-set points, and fighting them in simple one-on-one turn-based battles. The player character can use various moves, some of which deplete special energy bars, which can be replenished with items found in the dungeons. Enemies are mostly female and undress upon defeat. There are no equipment, money, or experience system of any kind.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-ultra-mucchin-puripuri-cyborg-marilyn-dx"}
