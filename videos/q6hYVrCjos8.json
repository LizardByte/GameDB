But what if a studio of indie developers tried to combine both of those genres into one video game? Enter The Deep End Games and their new game, Romancelvania, which is now live on Kickstarter. Romancelvania is self-described as \"a hilarious video game genre mashup,\" and attempts to blend together the characteristics of classic game series like Castlevania with the whimsical and sometimes-raunchy nature of romance-focused titles like Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator. \n\nJoin Jeff Cork, Liana Ruppert, and Kim Wallace for a look at exclusive gameplay of Romancelvania, the genre-bending Kickstarter game from the minds of previous BioShock developers.\n\nIf you enjoyed this episode of New Gameplay Today, be sure to check out the playlist below where we play Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition on PS5, and more: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoAFmgzYW18L4xZDyls4V6OGj6XmnTArT", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6hYVrCjos8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6hYVrCjos8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6hYVrCjos8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6hYVrCjos8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6hYVrCjos8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Romancelvania - New Gameplay Today", "description": "Throughout the 2010s, the Metroidvania genre was reinvigorated with hit indie games like Hollow Knight, Ori & The Blind Forest, Dust: An Elysian Tail, and Axiom Verge; and in the latter years of the decade, it seemed that indie game developers aimed to do the same thing for romance-based experiences.
