The story and game are completely different from those of the game with the same name published by Ubisoft for the Playstation 2.\n\nIn line with the franchise, this is a realistic first-person tactical shooter in which you are given command of a handful of soldiers which you must use and direct to accomplish a series of missions. This particular game offers storyline-type missions which can be played in either single player mode or co-operative multiplayer. It also offers competitive multiplayer game modes: deathmatch, survival and defend.\n\nStory: The year is 2010 and the situation in Bogota explodes. Explosions, gun fights and general mayhem trouble major Colombian cities as the ever-fragile cease-fire between guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries has just been broken. The driving force behind the violence has been identified as the MFLC (Movimiento de las Fuerzas Libres Colombianas), a paramilitary group funded by drug cartels. Washington, in collaboration with the Cuban and Colombian governments who are clearly overwhelmed by the current events, has chosen to put an end to the MFLC once and for all. Enter the Ghosts.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-jungle-storm"}
