Two factions have warred over a relic left behind by the first Smasher, Pandora.\n\nLuigi daVinci, with overwhelming support from players who backed the supervillain faction, makes off with the relic after making a pointed jab at Demolicious.\n\nDemolicious, for her part, retreats to lick her wounds. She later requests the player (if they backed the superheroes) to assist her in investigating Franklin Apartments where the robotic genius Azimoff lives. They find few leads about this and return to Herospire.\n\nLuigi daVinci reveals to the supervillain player that he intends to bring back his deceased brother, which presumably shocks them. He becomes irate when they keep pressing the question.\n\nLater on, an alien invasion takes place in a suburb outside of town in Pleasanton Oaks. The player heads there and after driving off the initial recon forces, manages to ring the mastermind behind the invasion. Clock Blocker reveals that he means to freeze time in order to prevent a bad future from taking place, despite being presumably from the same alien faction he is avoiding.\n\nIf the player was subscribed to the game, they could glimpse the bad future. It's strongly implied that humans have been killed or enslaved as the guidebot in that future remarks that \"The Oblivion rule this city and have enslaved the human race. They have no problem \"taking care\" of rebellious humans, so watch your step.\"\n\nOtherwise, the game's story ends there with no way to actually prevent the bad future alluded to or Clock Blocker's time freeze.", "summary": "HeroSmash was a Flash MMORPG developed by Artix Entertainment, using a modified version of the AdventureQuest Worlds engine. HeroSmash had a distinct art style and world setting based on superheroes and supervillains, rather than Artix Entertainment's traditional fantasy settings. Instead of using classes with unique abilities, players could equip any combination of abilities to suit their play style.\n\nHeroSmash's public Alpha testing began in December 2010 followed by a public beta launch in April 2011. The game failed to gain traction outside of the company's core fans; paid subscriptions were removed in 2014, updates were discontinued in 2015, and the game never left its beta phase. HeroSmash was officially shut down in 2020 when browser support for Flash Player ended; players were able to access the game through alternate means for a time until the servers were completely removed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/herosmash", "videos": [{"id": 101897, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YsOZHtHBlwU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsOZHtHBlwU", "title": "HeroSmash, free browser game trailer!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YsOZHtHBlwU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
