Regulating every major facet of life throughout the world from politics and security to economics, MESIA was thought to be the savior of mankind. Over the years however, MESIA would have detractors who did not favor the path in which it set for man. This opposition of skilled intellectuals, warriors, and scientists, known as the \"OROPPAS\" (or opposition), would eventually corrupt MESIA and make it become self-aware, where it sought to eradicate all mankind.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stop OROPPAS and subdue MESIA, everyone poured their remaining resources into an experimental, high-quality battle armour complete with a sophisticated A.I. known as \"Randy\", a powerful saber which cuts through nearly anything, and the most skilled pilot that they could elect, Ken Ryugasaki. Now, in the year 2230 AD, you must trudge through towns, jungles, and wasteland defeating mechanical menace, killing mutated creatures, and making your way to MESIA to defeat \"The Supreme Guardian\".", "summary": "A side-scrolling mecha-themed action game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/genocide", "videos": [{"id": 33647, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "ynHV04VkOGY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynHV04VkOGY", "title": "Genocide [\u30b8\u30a7\u30ce\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9] Game Sample - X68000", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ynHV04VkOGY/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3104, "name": "Genocide"}]}
