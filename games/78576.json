Final (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Final\") is an electric train driving simulation game developed and published by Taito for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on May 27, 2004. It was later ported to the PC by Unbalance on December 17, 2004.\n\nPart of the Densha de Go! series, Final features a significantly upgraded graphics and audio, a revamped penalty system (using a point-based system from Densha de Go! Ryojou-hen and Densha de Go! Shinkansen), a combo-based scoring system, an improved Navigation System display, and unlockable route extensions.\n\nIn addition to standard play, the game includes an alternate play-style where players can instead (or alongside the driver player for two-player multiplayer) act as the train's conductor. Train Conductors must open and close the train doors at the correct time, choose the next correct station to stop at, and make in-car announcements.\n\nThe game includes four routes: the Yamanote Line, the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line, the Osaka Loop Line, and the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line. Playable in both directions, it features the entirety of the Yamanote Line and Osaka Loop Lines, the Rapid section of the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line between Tokyo and Takao, and the section of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line between Kyoto and Kobe.\n\nThis version of the game was later ported to the PlayStation Portable in piecemeal, all part of the \"Densha de Go! Pocket\" line of releases:\n- Densha de Go! Pocket: Yamanotesen-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Pocket: Yamanote Line Edition\") was released on September 29, 2005, including only the Yamanote Line.\n\n- Densha de Go! Pocket: Chuuousen-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Pocket: Ch\u016b\u014d Line Edition\") was released on January 19, 2006, including only the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line.\n\n- Densha de Go! Pocket: Osakakanjousen-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Pocket: Osaka Loop Line Edition\") was released on March 30, 2006, including only the Osaka Loop Line.\n\n- Densha de Go! Pocket: Toukaidousen-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Pocket: T\u014dkaid\u014d Line Edition\") was released on July 27, 2006, including only the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line.\n\nTo celebrate the series' 20th anniversary, the game was later released as a standalone plug-and-play unit on February 8, 2018 as Densha de Go!
