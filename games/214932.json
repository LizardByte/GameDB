Advances in biotechnology and nanotechnology have allowed for biological enhancements that raise the bar for the quality of life. The government has decided to relax laws limiting cloning and intrusive surgical procedures in the interest of these advances. Serpent Industries, on the other hand, has found another application for these breakthroughs. They have developed a patented method of creating personal soldiers with distinct abilities and no remorse. The result is the perfect killing machine. Informant leaks to the media have partially exposed Serpent Industries shady projects and the public has risen in outrage against them. Constant rallies and protests have followed Serpent Industries CEO, Frank Serpent, for months, yet his only answer is that these are only false accusations crafted by rival corporations. Serpent Industries claims to be nothing more than a high-tech biopharmaceutical conglomerate dedicated to improve the quality of life for all.\n\nThe pressure is mounting on Serpent Industries as politicians start to back down to the public and introduce more restrictions in the biotech field. Violent outbreaks have taken place as the public decide to take action into their own hands, forming resistance groups. H.A.B.I.T. \u2013 Humans Against Biological Intrusive Technologies being the most radical of all resistance groups. H.A.B.I.T. wish to eradicate SI and everything they think it stands for, claiming that SI will not improve the quality of life, only the quality of death \u2013 as in the death of humanity. Nevertheless, Serpent Industries uses its massive stranglehold on the biotech and pharmaceutical markets while promising better life through nanotechnology to maintain power and control in and aging techno savvy culture.\n\nYou will play the role of Vince Petero as you awake within a mysterious underground facility and discover you have been subjected to experimental confidential military testing. The military has contracted Serpent Industries to do genetic experiments in order to create the ultimate soldier. As the 7th and most advanced serpent prototype revision, you are sent out against your will to complete a \"field test\" that coincidentally benefits Serpent Industries.", "summary": "7th Serpent: Genesis is a Max Payne 2 modification and the sequel to the acclaimed 7th Serpent: Crossfire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/7th-serpent-genesis"}
