Cyber Knights wraps a world full of consequential story choices and character development around an extensive core of classic and new tactical RPG mechanics.\n\nCyber Knights strikes a unique tone with a futuristic setting that has passed through the messy near-future to arrive at dystopian 2231. Man-made environmental disasters have ravaged our biosphere. Artificial consciousness has been created, subsequently murdered, and then strictly outlawed at a global level. Megacorporate colonies and research stations dot the solar system from Venus to Jupiter. Quantum computing has radically altered the digital landscape and the very meaning of privacy and digital security.\n\nThe game's threaded stories originate from both inside and outside your team -- weaving together threads from your hired mercenaries, criminal connections and history that just won\u2019t die. These stories operate on three interconnected and at times overlapping levels -- personal stories (your team), contact stories (your employers) and event stories (city-wide).\n\nAnd every choice you make and mission you run will impact your character's permanent Traits, changing them in both subtle and big ways. Their stories and your choices combine to create a unique narrative for every game, every Knight and every team.", "summary": "Cyber Knights is a tactical RPG in an original cyberpunk setting ten years in the making. Build your team of hackers, mercs and malcontents wisely; their stories will become interwoven with your own. Use powerful cyberware, shady connections, stealth, hacking and more to rise in the neon-soaked future.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyber-knights-flashpoint", "videos": [{"id": 112410, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DoeJcXZY7Uc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoeJcXZY7Uc", "title": "Cyber Knights: Flashpoint - Squad Tactics Heist RPG - Early Access Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DoeJcXZY7Uc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
