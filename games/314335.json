It only has one drum pad and one symbal pad, but can be played by 2 people at once.\n\nPlayer's get to choose from over 25 songs, which features many themes from teenage anime, as well as popular J-Pop \"anthems\" by popular artists. Each tune is rated in difficulty from 1 to 5 stars. When the music starts players must match the coloured symbols on the correct pad. Blue note equal drum, Yellow equals cymbal and Blue line equals rapid drum beating.\n\nAfter the music stops, a result screen displayed the correct notes each player made and the winner is announced.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/toysmarch"}
