Though alone in the cave the player hears a voice telling them to go and explore, to seek treasure and bring it back to the shop in payment for misuse of the wand.\nSo begins the adventure that will see the player encounter the serpent in the Garden of Eden, the Ancient Mariner, an invalid old lady, a whale and many other strange characters and places.", "summary": "Philosopher's Quest is a single player text adventure.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/philosophers-quest"}
