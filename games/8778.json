The game is played in four-minute deathmatch rounds. If the player is killed during a round, they are required to sit out the round until it ends, either when time lapses or the mission objectives are completed by one team. Players earn money when achieving feats such as killing enemies, finding contraband throughout the level, and completing mission objectives. In between missions, money can be used to acquire new weapons, armor, grenades, and utilities such as night vision goggles. The single-player mode of Tactical Ops allows the player to compete in 30 maps against computer-controlled bots.", "summary": "Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror is a first-person shooter video game developed in 2002 by Kamehan Studios and published by Infogrames as a MicroProse title. The game is a standalone retail version of a multiplayer modification of the same name published by Kamehan Studios in 1999 for the game Unreal Tournament. The game features match-based missions in which two teams, themed as Special Forces and terrorists, battle to complete mission objectives and kill their opponents. Upon release, Tactical Ops received mixed to average reviews, with critics faulting the game's similarities to the non-commercial version and lack of defining features compared to other multiplayer first-person shooters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tactical-ops-assault-on-terror"}
