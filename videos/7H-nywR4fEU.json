It is effective against every class, which in essence gives it a whopping 36 Mt - he will one shot every enemy bar a few bosses later on. It also has 15 crit, which pairs well with John's innate 30 crit. John needs to reach at least 10 speed by the final chapter, as well as a few procs of either HP or Res by Chapter 4, but this is not hard to get thanks to his crazy high exp gain. Oh, he also has Silencer, but since literally nothing can survive a Mohannad crit, it's pretty much a 25% chance of getting double exp on kill, which is pretty neat. Sadly, because he needs to seize in 3 maps, recruit a bunch of units in another, and gets a very unfortunate spawn location in yet another map, this run doesn't get nearly as much mileage out of John as more conventional (and certainly more reliable, because that 120 hit would be so nice) playthroughs. Note that all infantry units in this hack has 6 movement.\n\nJoe - You can probably expect the Jeigan of a 6-chapter long hack to be some of the best units in the game. Paladins in this game gets 9 mov, and combined with practically exclusive access to Silver Lance (which hits Res in this game, along with every other Silver weapons and Iron Ballista) and good bulk, he can one shot most generic enemies in the game. He does fall off in the final chapter, surprisingly, but we get other tools by then.\n\nEkram - He has sky high bases in Str and Def and 6 mov, and promotes into an 8 mov Great Knight while starting off at Level 10. When he does get his promotion item, he will be one of the more useful units thanks to having good stats on a horse, but for now, he's mostly relegated to helping around with side objectives. He sees a lot of unnecessary self-improvement throughout this playthrough because I needed him to reach A lances (because Silver Lance OP) by the final chapter while routing the game on an older build, but the map has changed so much since then (literally like, 2 days ago) that he doesn't need to reach it anymore, but it certainly would've helped.\n\nSaif - A myrmidon with extremely poor bases. John is literally right there.
