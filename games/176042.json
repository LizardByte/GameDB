It was developed by DMA Design, who also developed Lemmings and Uniracers.\n\nWhile very few details are known about the gameplay, a former DMA employee revealed official artwork and maps from the game.\n\nThe game was designed to be played with the SNES Mouse, but as sales of the mouse were declining, Nintendo wanted the game to play with a controller instead. The gameplay suffered as a result, and the game was eventually cancelled.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kid-kirby"}
