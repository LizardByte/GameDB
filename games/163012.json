You have to respect the rail signals and driving instructions, adapt for rail switches, and manage speed. Make sure you keep an eye on braking distance when you pull into the station and open and close the doors for your passengers. There are also unforeseen situations to manage, such as fallen trees, stalled cars, and trains rolling on your track.\nThe dynamic weather and day/night cycle mean you have to adapt the way you drive to avoid accidents and damage to the tracks."}
