At the end of the game, the daughter goes into a line of work; what this work is, how much talent she has for it, her marital life, and her overall happiness all depend on the player's actions throughout the game.\n\nIn Princess Maker 3, the daughter is a young fairy who desires to become a human princess. The player's task is to help her reach adulthood. In this version, everything said to the player's daughter and done will help determine the daughter's attitude, social status, and outlook on life. Unlike the previous game, the player has a chance to choose between six occupations. The occupation determines the player's social status in the kingdom, cash at hand, and the amount of yearly wage. The occupation will also affect various factors in the main character, starting with the attitude with which she begins. Along these lines, unlike the previous games where she was either happy, sick, or rebellious, the daughter's attitude can range from happy, to average, to worried, to spoiled. Her attitude will be determined based on both the player's job starting off (Merchant, Performer, Fallen Nobleman, Priest, Retired Knight, and Bard) and how well is she treated by the player during the game. There are 60 endings in this game ranging from the typical ones like General and Hero, to some more distinctive like Gambler and Freelancer. There are also many \"magical\" endings, with not only the princess ending, but princess of darkness, cats, etc. She can also marry a variety of people.", "summary": "A collection of Princess Maker 2 and 3 for the Sega Dreamcast.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/princess-maker-collection", "videos": [{"id": 106137, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "ata_MK2mLpk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ata_MK2mLpk", "title": "Princess Maker Collection   \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 Opening Dreamcast,2001", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ata_MK2mLpk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
