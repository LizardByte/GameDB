It was also one of the first games to include a life meter (along with Flash Boy and Punch-Out), known as vitality in this game. The game featured side-scrolling platform gameplay and a hub \"world view\" map similar to the later Super Mario Bros. series. It also featured hack & slash combat, like the later Tritorn and Legend of Zelda series.\n\nDragon Buster was developed and published by Namco. The game is a side-scrolling dungeon crawler, where the goal of the game is for the hero, Clovis, to rescue Princess Celia. Dragon Buster was later ported to a variety of home consoles, notably the Nintendo Entertainment System and the MSX.\n\nIt runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware, modified to support vertical scrolling", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-buster", "collections": [{"id": 5154, "name": "Dragon Buster"}]}
