The expansion pack introduces a new continent, Kunark; a new player race, the Sarnak; and raises the level cap for adventure, tradeskills and guilds to 80. Over the five hundred years transpired between the setting of the original EverQuest and EverQuest II, the continent of Kunark has changed in many important ways. The various cataclysms that occurred during this period in Norrath had a tangible impact on Kunark, with many areas of the geography being unrecognizable to those familiar with the continent from EverQuest.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/everquest-ii-rise-of-kunark", "videos": [{"id": 22690, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eQSG5CJMdlU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQSG5CJMdlU", "title": "EverQuest II Rise of Kunark Expansion [OFFICIAL TRAILER]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eQSG5CJMdlU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
