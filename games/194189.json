This is a tomb of the brain! Tomb of the brain aka Temple 3 is a unbelievably addictive brain workout. Feed your logic skills with this game.\nAfter a year and a half of work, finally the Tomb of the brain was finished. Several times have changed graphic design, music and sound effects. I changed the size of the board puzzles have been added and received some elements repeatedly redesigned boards and finally was completed. This game buried my brain. I wanted to do it as best suits me and I hope it will also suit you. Try to play and see if it will get you fit. Why did I do? This game could do it faster but did not want to, I wanted to do it according to my vision (which is changing and so I changed the Tomb of the brain aka Temple 3 too)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-of-the-brain"}
