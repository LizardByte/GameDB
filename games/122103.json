She's been invited by her aunt, Mary Allen, to spend a few days in a quiet cottage by the sea. What she doesn't know is that, next to the cottage, there's a large, run-down house from which emanates a macabre atmosphere. You play as Nancy Evans and it's up to you to investigate the strange phenomena coming from this gloomy house. According to Mary, it's haunted by ghosts. Indeed, her interest in mysticism has her thinking that the creaking that can be heard, the shadows wandering the halls, and the strange smell that sometimes prevails there are all supernatural in origin.
