The longer you hold the tap the higher the jar will go. Tilt your device left or right to move the little girl. The jar will move with the girl even while in the air.\nYour aim is you catch the yellow fireflies on each level. Each new level will have more and more fireflies.\nBe careful of the red ones. They fly slower but they'll make you lose a heart. If you lose all your hearts the game is over. Now and then a very fast pink bug will appear. If you catch it you'll get a bonus life!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/firefly-sky"}
