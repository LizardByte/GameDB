Now, buried in the heart of a dilapidated university, they\u2019ve found it.\n\nIn Human Error, relish the opportunity to join Civil Protection and stop the Xenians from ever finding peace! Step into the jack boots of Anders, and follow his story through a moral quagmire of thinly disguised genocide and raging psychotics. Vortigaunts, Alien Grunts and Controllers stand in your way from dashing the hopes of an entire civilisation, but worry not: you have at your disposal all the perks of the Combine empire. Step into the APC, equip your manhack and stand side-by-side with equally disgruntled traitors to the human race, Eloise, Noah and Larson.", "summary": "Human Error: Episode One tells the story of a civil protection officer called Anders fighting Vortigaunts, Alien Grunts, and Alien Controllers using the Combine's forces as his allies.\n\nYou can also play in Traitor & Alyx Modes with three of your friends in Human Error: Co-op.\n\nAlyx Mode is enabled in Beta 1.0.6 and later versions.\n\nIn Alyx mode one of the players is selected as Alyx, before everyone selects their character. While in Traitor Mode selecting the Traitor is always random, in Alyx Mod it's based on who has longest time since he or she was last Alyx. In short Alyx Mode is like Traitor Mode with the Traitor starting as Revealed with some additions to her abilities.\n\nAlyx has a fixed set of weapons, she can't pick up or drop weapons (except grenades). She always spawns with the Gravity Gun, Alyx Gun, Shotgun, and the Emp Tool. The Gravity Gun can be used to disable Combine Generators. Alyx also regenerators ammo for the Alyx Gun.\n\nYou can currently play Alyx Mode only in Backbone (althought there will be seperate maps for it in future releases). Instead of having to destroy the Main Frame, Alyx has to hack it. None of the Hostiles do damage or try to attack the Main Frame, they are there just to help Alyx hack it. Hacking it will take a lot longer than it takes to hack a normal Combine Interface.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/human-error", "videos": [{"id": 74586, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nlhJrKShqXQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlhJrKShqXQ", "title": "Human Error - 2010 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlhJrKShqXQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 74587, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "jl42zwS_AGU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl42zwS_AGU", "title": "Human Error - Gameplay Teaser 2008", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jl42zwS_AGU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134856, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "EDeXgztXCRs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDeXgztXCRs", "title": "Human Error - Traitor Mode Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EDeXgztXCRs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134857, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "Tae6dKRXtEo"}, {"id": 134858, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "g89cFNKX4YI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g89cFNKX4YI", "title": "Half-Life 2: HUMAN ERROR - Full Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g89cFNKX4YI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
