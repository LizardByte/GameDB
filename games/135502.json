Armed primarily with mobility, a series of battle chips for extra combat data, and a variety of utensils installed into her gauntlets, she zips from place to place to gather additional combat data. And to help out wherever she's needed, admittedly. Helping feels nice.\n\nInspired by Mega Man X, gameplay feel is a little bit more cartoony and high-tech than usual, with some pretty outlandish weapons doing some silly functions.. Designed to act as a complement for sci-fi/space-age mapsets, the gameplay mod acts as a direct contrast with High Noon Drifter. Rather than being very simple and low-tech, this mod is a little bit more complicated and hi-tech.\nIf you've been looking for a mod where you can play as a robot, android, gynoid, or you've been looking for something to compliment Stardate 20X7, this might be up your alley.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/highway-acceleroid-booster", "videos": [{"id": 37990, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "mKCSNSkxd_o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKCSNSkxd_o", "title": "Highway Acceleroid Booster - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mKCSNSkxd_o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
