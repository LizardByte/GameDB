As the new night shift security guard, Jeremy Fitzgerald has to work the night shift, from 12-6 AM, for 5 days. Jeremy's job as the night guard is to watch over the animatronics via cameras around the pizzeria, using a flashlight to see inside dark areas - including the shadowed, doorless hallway that leads into the office.", "summary": "Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys-2--2", "videos": [{"id": 97585, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "e8OoZhzmUzk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8OoZhzmUzk", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's 2 Remaster - Mobile", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8OoZhzmUzk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97586, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AczTLPz-NOg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AczTLPz-NOg", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's 2 - Nintendo Switch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AczTLPz-NOg/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97587, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-czk89Iwat8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-czk89Iwat8", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's 2 - PS4 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-czk89Iwat8/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97588, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Qq5FJAZRpbQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq5FJAZRpbQ", "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's 2 - Xbox One Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qq5FJAZRpbQ/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97589, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RJFqdYTCZFw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJFqdYTCZFw", "title": "Five Night at Freddy's 2 - Subtitle Update on Mobile", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJFqdYTCZFw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 97590, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5WZqoJp6P-A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WZqoJp6P-A", "title": "Five Night at Freddy's 2 - Subtitle Update on Console", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5WZqoJp6P-A/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1150, "name": "Five Nights at Freddy's"}]}
