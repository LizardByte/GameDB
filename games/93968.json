Apollo, humankind's first interstellar vessel, dispatched at light speed to investigate the source of a signal broadcast at Earth from one hundred and fifty light years away. On reaching the source, the crew is told that, due to relativistic effects, Earth has by now been taken over by the religious Cantharan Order, and the signal was a ruse from the friendly Ishiman, who wished to maintain humanity as a free race; the Ishiman planned to find a new world for the crew of the Apollo. Although the advanced but peaceful Ishiman are unwilling to enter into direct war with the Cantharans, the Apollo's crew is able to persuade them to supply a limited amount of their technology in an attempt to free Earth. Upon undertaking their new mission, the ship is renamed the Ares.", "summary": "Ares is a sci-fi real-time strategy action game developed by Nathan Lamont from Bigger Planet Software and published by Changeling Software in 1998 for Mac OS 9. Nathan didn't earn any profit from the sales of the game, due to Changeling's poor marketing. Changeling Software became defunct later that year, so Nathan modified Ares and re-released it as shareware by Ambrosia Software in 1999. Thanks to Ambrosia's marketing efforts, the game became successful and reached its peak in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2008, Nathan Lamont released the original source code to Ares under the GNU GPL 2.0, and most of the media under the CC Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license. This has produced Antares, which is a port of Ares for Mac OS X and Linux.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ares"}
