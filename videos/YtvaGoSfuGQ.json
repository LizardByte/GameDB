Opposite color does more damage, but can die if opposite color hits you. Not the first time system was used (Silhouette Mirage uses similar system, also by Treasure). This game also has a chaining system similar to Radiant Silvergun, but it's more forgiving: no need to worry about powering up and you arent stuck on one color.\n\nI no-skill this game on Normal while trying to attempt. Gave up chaining a bit later in Stage 4. There were also parts where I just straight-up didn't chain.
