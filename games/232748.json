Emerging from the charging bay, it finds the crew dead and the ship damaged. The Redemption's main computer has set main propulsion operating at full capacity to prevent the ship from falling into the gravity well of a nearby black hole. Though not quite at the event horizon yet, the Redemption is slowly being drawn in, unless CD-24 can find a way to escape certain doom.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-telescopium-incident"}
