Using advanced bioships, star fighters and motor vehicles, the Galden invaded Mu, destroying many of its cities and taking the planet's ruler Queen Sheeta hostage. \n \nThe remaining royal guards of Mu are deployed in space fighters that can transform into cars to rescue the queen and crush the Galden forces.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
