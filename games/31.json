Roger also visits Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros (whose title is a parody of Infocom's game Leather Goddesses of Phobos) and Space Quest I; in the latter, the graphics and music revert to the style of the original game and Roger is threatened by a group of monochromatic bikers who consider Roger's 256 colors pretentious. None of the gameplay takes place in Space Quest IV. In fact, the \"actual\" Space Quest IV is only seen briefly in the introduction.", "summary": "May the farce be with you!

In their latest spaced-out space opera, the Two Guys From Andomeda take on science fiction (and just about everything else!) is a spoofy sendup that will leave you laughing.\n\nRoger Wilco embarks on a topsy-turvy trip through space and time in this fourth chapter in the award-winning Space Quest series, Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers. From a nostalgic look at his past in Space Quest I to a terrifying visit to the future of Space Quest XII, Roger's on the run again.\n\nAnd hot on his ion trail are the Sequel Police, deadly crosstime assassins who are out to put an end to Roger and all of his Space Quest nonsense once and for all.\n\nOnce again it's up to Roger Wilco to save his future- or is that his past?- of the Space Quest series, and keep the universe safe for fair play, bad jokes, and lots more Space Quest Games.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-quest-iv-roger-wilco-and-the-time-rippers", "videos": [{"id": 17251, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "R6R8j8hzu2Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6R8j8hzu2Y", "title": "SPACE QUEST IV (VGA Version) Adventure Game Gameplay Walkthrough - No Commentary Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R6R8j8hzu2Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
