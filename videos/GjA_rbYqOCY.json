The game is fully playable, but some areas still need polished. You may encounter bugs.**\n\nPokeWilds uses procedural generation to create large worlds with different biomes, each with their own unique monsters. The levels of wild monsters will increase the further you explore, meaning that some biomes with rare monsters will be difficult to get to. Your Monsters can help you explore the world by usual means (cut, fly, etc), but there will also be new field moves that allow you to interact with the world in new ways, like building structures/houses, jumping up ledges, starting fires, and more.\n\nYou can let your monsters out to roam around, and build fenced-in 'poke-farms' for them to live in. If your monsters are happy, it may give you items that will aid you in your journey! Items can be combined and crafted at a campfire - some ingredients may be more difficult to find than others.\n\n**v0.8 Updates and Changes:**\n - New biomes - volcano, tidal, wooded lake, graveyard, and savanna\n  - Each contains unique monsters, buried items and activities.\n  - An odd keystone can sometimes be found in the graveyard.\n - Tundra and Wooded Lake house variants added.\n - You can build an upstairs to houses. Place new floor in an upstairs using 'Floor' tiles.\n  - A house can contain a number of floors equal to the number of exterior walls it has, extending vertically.\n - Water types can Surf.\n  - Surf or Fly to the edge of the map to generate a new World (you can always travel back to your current world)\n  - The new world will contain content from the most recent version of the game (even if an old save file is used)\n - Psychic types know Teleport. Build warp tiles and teleport to them (from the Menu or the Map)\n - Berry trees can now be found in different biomes.\n  - desert: rawst, beach: pecha, forest: persim, snow: aspear, savanna: cheri, graveyard: chesto, secret: lum.\n  - Berry seeds will grow different types of berry trees depending on the soil they are planted in.\n - Monster storage box added\n  - Monsters can be nicknamed or released while using the storage box.\n - New playable character types added (Thank you to everyone who contributed backsprites! they look awesome :))\n - Improvements made to a certain legendary battle (WIP).\n - 'Kiln' can be built indoors. Balls can be upgraded at the Kiln (new Balls include quick ball, timer ball, net ball, dive ball, nest ball, dream ball, heal ball. Dusk ball, great ball and ultra ball moved to the Kiln)\n - Many new Monsters added.\n - Mods support added for music, graphics and monster stats.\n - UI's updated to Gen 2 style.\n - More comprehensive list of changes: https://github.com/SheerSt/pokewilds/releases/tag/v0.8.0\n\nPlease subscribe if you would like to be notified whenever I update this project.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjA_rbYqOCY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjA_rbYqOCY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjA_rbYqOCY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GjA_rbYqOCY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PokeWilds fan game v0.8 Update - New Biomes", "description": "Tidal beach biome video: https://youtu.be/rGuL1gEvJPI\nGraveyard biome video: https://youtu.be/rjbAB-L0Xq8\n\nDownload: https://github.com/SheerSt/pokewilds/releases/latest/download/pokemon-wilds-windows64.zip\n - Extract files, open the unzipped directory and run pokemon-wilds.exe\n\n**To update an existing version:**\n - Download pokemon-wilds-windows64.zip and extract.\n - Copy .sav and .png files out of the old directory and place them in the new directory (the v0.8 directory).\n\nHow to Play and Instructions: https://github.com/SheerSt/pokewilds/blob/main/README.md\n\nFull list of game credits: https://github.com/SheerSt/pokewilds/blob/main/README.md#credits\n\n**Disclaimer: this project is currently in Alpha.
