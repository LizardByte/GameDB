Historically it was a WWII RAF airfield for planes such as the Hurricane, and also Oban Bay was home to the RAF Sunderland and Catalina flying boats.\n\nThe add-on includes many additional features that greatly enhance the experience of pilots - accurate taxiway support, custom night-lighting and improved runway lights make take-off and landing very immersive, and when pilots have touched down an extensive range of 3D objects, including airport clutter and static aircraft, add realism.\n\nThis add-on includes a separate configurator tool which enables you to configure settings such as AI traffic and scenery compatibility. This tool can be accessed in the Steam client under the Library/Tools menu.", "summary": "Oban Airport has been crafted as a match for the real world airport. It features a high-resolution ground polygon model, high quality photo-real textures and custom made and placed buildings.
