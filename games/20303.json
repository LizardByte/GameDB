Observe as they transform into more powerful classes. Clerks evolve into high clerks monks into master monks and conjurers into mighty summers. Unravel complex secrets in two richly textured views, explore in lush top-down isometric view and battle savage enemies in full 360. Grow stronger and smarter, with each victory your swordsmanship increases in power and your magic will swell with potent energy. Use supreme magic to summon monsters, fatal storms to hurl tormentors into another dimension or drown them in a boiling sea of fire."}
