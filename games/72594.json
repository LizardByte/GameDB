Rito's class is off to a beach resort for a four-day school trip, meaning lots of fun and lots of cute girls in swimsuits. The story is told from Rito's perspective as the trip progresses, and the player is regularly given choices that affect the story path and which character's ending the game leads to. For example, while riding on the bus to the resort, the player can choose to sit with either Haruna or Lala.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
