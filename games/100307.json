You just want to cut some wood to sell so your family can eat but an evil witch has put a spell on the animals so they are attacking you. Well, no matter, one way or another you'll get your tree!\n\nYou must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over.\n\nAlso to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/forest", "videos": [{"id": 116352, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hHQP5MDKg70", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHQP5MDKg70", "title": "Atari 2600 Longplay [051] Forest", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hHQP5MDKg70/sddefault.jpg"}]}
