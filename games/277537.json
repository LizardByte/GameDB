The spacecraft is equipped with a simple peashooter and has limited energy. When the energy runs out, the spaceship explodes. Upon finding a treasure, the unused energy is converted to points and a new level starts. There is also a 2-player mode where two people can take turns in order to find out who can amass the highest score.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-maze-attack"}
