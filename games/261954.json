It features up to 4 abilities at the same time while every single Pokemon & Trainer has been rebalanced manually. There are tons of QoL enhancements and zero grinding. It features over 100 new abilities and some new moves for more variety. It's inspired by hacks like Inclement Emerald, Radical Red, but it's unique in the sense of 4 abilities, tons of QoL mixed with manually-created Trainers.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-elite-redux"}
