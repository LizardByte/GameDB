It hasn't had that much coverage despite you know, vgperson translating it. The one RPG Maker translator most people into it know.\n\nIt's not really horror but it's tagged as such on Freem! (I looked) so whatever I can't bother to edit my thumbnail format sorry. It's very mild horror let's go with that.\n\nAlso no subtitles for this one. Look at the length and you'll probably understand why. I hesitate on anything that's one hour long let alone three hours long.\n\nThis game goes wild after a point. Like what. Why. I do like the game even with it's... weirder elements. I've played it a few times before but this one was the I think first time I didn't use a walkthrough constantly haha. I did use it since I can be dumb. Very much so. \n\nI don't have much to say as I've played this one quite a few times before but I just wanted to show it since it seems to be not that well known. At least I haven't seen it much.\n\nThis game also has weirdly smooth walk animations.
