Your goal, as you venture into the wizard's realm, is to avoid his capricious tricks and learn to control his magic.", "summary": "The adventure begins in the Barrow from \"Zork I\" armed only with the trusty brass lantern and sword of elvish antiquity. The purpose of the game is not initially clear.\n\nLike its predecessor, Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt. Unlike the previous game, the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot. Finding the treasures does not end the game, nor are all the treasures needed to finish the game. Instead, the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game's finale.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zork-ii-the-wizard-of-frobozz"}
