It was named as the inaugural winner of the Machaward at the 2017 Cacowards, and was one of three maps that earned Steffen the title of \"Mapper of the Year,\" the others being Saturnine Chapel and Devil's Den. It uses the music track, \"The Village that Time Forgot,\" composed by Tristan Clark.\n\nThe map requires a limit-removing source port with an increased SEGS limit to play, such as PrBoom+ or GZDoom. Due to the map consisting of one gigantic area with a high level of detail, players may suffer performance issues. A second WAD file (TheGivenLD) is included, and is an alternate version with reduced detail so as to improve performance.\n\nWith an emphasis on atmosphere and exploration, the map contains no monsters or hazards; instead the player must navigate a series of puzzles scattered across the map in order to access an island at the map's centre. Inside the WAD is a plain text lump named PROLOGUE. It contains over 2500 words of lore that provides the context for the WAD.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-given"}
