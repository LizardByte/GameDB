And to top that, you have plenty of new moves, counterattacks, powerups, and key combinations to use.\n\nWhereas Cotton 2 was more of a tactical shooter (whenever that is applicable to the game) with its chain combo and life/experience system, Cotton Boomerang is an all-out shooter due to the added moves, different level layout, and generally faster and crazier gameplay."}
