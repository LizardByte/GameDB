It was also released with a localized label as Myth Struggle, although the in-game content is unchanged. The game is based on the 16th century Chinese epic novel of the same name, also called F\u0113ngsh\u00e9n Y\u01ceny\u00ec (\u5c01\u795e\u6f14\u7fa9) and often translated to Investiture of the Gods or The Creation of the Gods.\nThe game is essentially a hacked version of Hummer Team's earlier bootleg version of DragonBall Z: Super But\u014dden 2, which was originally released on the Super NES. The change by Waixing was made to legitimize the content as to not run into copyright laws, as this version was also released (although still unlicensed by Nintendo) in Japan and with likely intent to distribute outside of Asia.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/feng-shen-bang"}
