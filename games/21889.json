The game tasks players with battling against hordes of zombies in order to clear each level's objective. Miis that are encountered via StreetPass can be found across each level, each carrying a unique weapon such as a Wii Remote, a bowling ball, and a paintbrush, which each have a limited number of chargeable special attacks. Players receive these weapons by encountering each Mii, with some Miis offering to team up and fight alongside the player. If the player takes too much damage, they will lose their current weapon, and the level ends if the player loses all of their weapons or fail the main objective (the player has three chances to attempt each level per session). Clearing various criteria, such as beating a level within a time limit, earns medals, with additional levels unlocked after obtaining enough medals.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battleground-z"}
