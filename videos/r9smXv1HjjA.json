While very human-like in their nature, both of these races have evolved to use specially-built robot mechs (or Robos) in their everyday lives. \n\nIn the game, players follow the story of the dog-like Red Savarin, a young adventurer and hunter who has set off with his Robo companion Dahak on a quest to retrieve a stolen file of the utmost importance, only to be thrown into an altogether deeper adventure along the way. As the story of Solatorobo: Red the Hunter develops further, Red and Dahak will travel throughout the Shepherd Republic, meeting new characters along the way and uncovering the truth behind a mystical artifact he has discovered.\n\nCurrently in production, Solatorobo: Red the Hunter will be released this fall in North America by XSEED Games for Nintendo DS. XSEED Games will release more product information in the coming months.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9smXv1HjjA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9smXv1HjjA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9smXv1HjjA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9smXv1HjjA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Solatorobo: Red the Hunter - Opening Trailer", "description": "Released in Japan last October, Solatorobo (literally translated \"sky and robot\") takes place in the Shepherd Republic, a series of floating islands that are populated by two distinct races of anthropomorphic dog- and cat-people.
