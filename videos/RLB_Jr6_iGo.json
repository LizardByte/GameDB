It had a limited release in December 1994, followed by a wide release in July 1995.  It ran on the Namco System 22 arcade hardware.\n\nThe player uses a handlebar controller to move a skier down a course situated on a snow-covered mountain, the objective being to make it to the end of the course without falling off the slope or colliding with obstacles. It features three different courses to select, alongside a standard race mode and a time-attack mode where the player must pass through gates to replenish a time limit.\n\nIt was an arcade hit, among the top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1996 in both Japan and the United States. The arcade success of Alpine Racer led to a wave of similar sports games capitalizing on its success during the late 1990s.\n\nAlpine Racer is a racing video game based on the sport of alpine skiing. It uses a handlebar controller for movement with rotating foot pedals to simulate real skis.  The player moves the on-screen skier down a course, while avoiding collision with obstacles, such as trees and rocks, or falling off the edge of the slope. Three different courses are selectable, each increasing in difficulty with the addition of fast-moving obstacles and sharper turns, alongside three difficulty levels: \"Novice\", \"Intermediate\", and \"Expert\".\n\nTwo game modes are present: \"Race Mode\" and \"Time Trial Mode\". In Race Mode, the player is pitted against five computer-controlled opponents to try and make it to the bottom of the course, the goal being to finish in first place. Finishing in first place will show the player a replay of their performance in the game. Time Trial Mode has the player going down a course solo; this mode adds a time limit that counts down as the game progresses, and will cause the game to end if it fully depletes. A second of time can be restored by passing through large gates found scattered across the course. \n\nAlpine Racer spawned a series of sequels and remakes. Alpine Racer 2 was released in 1996 for arcades, featuring three selectable skiers, new courses to race on, and a multiplayer mode made possible through linking multiple cabinets together. A spin-off snowboarding video game, Alpine Surfer, was released the same year.\n\n#alpineracer #namco #theclassicandretrogamer\n00:00 Speed Racing - Novice Course\n03:06 Speed Racing - Intermediate Course\n06:15 Speed Racing - Expert Course\n10:13 Gate Racing - Novice Course\n13:11 Gate Racing - Intermediate Couse\n15:35 Gate Racing - Expert Course", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RLB_Jr6_iGo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RLB_Jr6_iGo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RLB_Jr6_iGo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RLB_Jr6_iGo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RLB_Jr6_iGo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Alpine Racer - Gameplay All Courses, All Modes (Arcade)", "description": "Subscribe:  https://www.youtube.com/@TheClassicAndRetroGamer\n\nAlpine Racer is a racing sports video game developed and published by Namco for arcades.
