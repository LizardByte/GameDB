Like in the original game the player needs to shoot bubbles until they will disappear in order to go to the next level. There are power-ups that help the player (e.g. more points, other weapons, an extra life, a shield, extra time and more). If a bubble hits the player he will loses one life. The game is timed and if time runs out before the player shoots all the bubbles, he will also lose one life. The game supports local multiplayer with a second player.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
