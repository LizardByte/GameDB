After their meeting, Bond fights off dealers from a drug organization spread throughout the train and kills the boss who was invited to the Casino Royale game of Le Chiffre and replaces him in the game (a notable difference from the film). After combat, Bond arrives in Montenegro, where he comes face to face with Le Chiffre. After defeating Le Chiffre in the poker game, Vesper is kidnapped. Bond pursues the kidnappers but crashes his car and is taken hostage. He escapes and battles through Le Chiffre's barge to rescue Vesper. While he is successful, Bond and Vesper are re-captured by Le Chiffre's body guards. Near death, they are saved when Mr. White kills Le Chiffre for his recent actions, leaving Bond and Vesper alive.", "summary": "007: Quantum of Solace is a James Bond video game based on the films Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Several different versions of the game were released across seven platforms, with the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and PC designed as first-person shooters and the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS as third-person shooters. It is powered by the Call of Duty 4 game engine.\n\nThe core gameplay in Quantum of Solace is that of a first-person shooter. Throughout the game, however, the view will switch to a third-person view to emphasize that the player is playing as James Bond. This third-person view will be used with a cover system and quick time events, among other scenarios. An example is using quick time events to chase Mollaka during a level that is a recreation of the construction site chase at the beginning of the Casino Royale film.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/james-bond-007-quantum-of-solace", "videos": [{"id": 34129, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sxLyoUopPP8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxLyoUopPP8", "title": "007: Quantum of Solace Video Game trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sxLyoUopPP8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119400, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "saPfmul8nQw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saPfmul8nQw", "title": "007 Quantum Of Solice E3 2008 First Look Game Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/saPfmul8nQw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
