{"id": "uoPC1vsIL6Y", "snippet": {"title": "Official Denny's Atari\u00ae Remix (iOS / Android) Launch Trailer", "description": "Denny's Atari\u00ae Remix by Denny's Inc (iOS / Android) \n\nWe've been wondering... There are video games. There are also diners. So where are all the diner-themed video games? Luckily, Denny's has partnered with Atari\u00ae to fill that gap in the gaming world. Introducing, Denny's Atari\u00ae Remix app. Take a nostalgic trip into the past with three classic Atari\u00ae games infused with breakfasty goodness for a new spin on old favorites. Destroy hashteroids, fight off the centipup and break down walls made solely out of breakfast foods. But these great games are only available for a limited time, so download today and get 'em while they're hot!\n\nHashteroids is an action-packed arcade ketchup shooter where your goal is to destroy the clumps of golden-brown potatoes before they destroy you. Blasts of ketchup will break the hashteroids down, but it will take a bit of strategy and a whole lot of skill to survive. Make sure you also avoid other breakfast items like fried eggs and coffee killers!\n\nCentipup is a fast-paced arcade survival game where you must use your magical bottle of syrup to fight off the hypnotized creatures of the Wonderfood Forest. Shoot blasts of sticky, syrupy goodness to transform enemies into eggs and defeat the evil Nannerpuss once and for all.\n\nTake-Out is the brick-by-brick breakfast wall destruction arcade game you've been waiting for. Use an egg and your plate to destroy the wall of Denny's food items. The more you clear, the more points you score!\n\niTunes Store Page:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dennys-atari-remix/id876461831?mt=8\n\nGoogle Play:\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dennys.mobile\n\nHomepage:\n\nhttp://greatesthitsremixed.com/\n", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoPC1vsIL6Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoPC1vsIL6Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoPC1vsIL6Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoPC1vsIL6Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uoPC1vsIL6Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Official Denny's Atari\u00ae Remix (iOS / Android) Launch Trailer", "description": "Denny's Atari\u00ae Remix by Denny's Inc (iOS / Android) \n\nWe've been wondering...
