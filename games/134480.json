Raidy can't just walk away, she decides to venture into the tower and release all the girls. \n \nThe entire game takes place in the tower - there is no overworld and no friendly areas whatsoever. Raidy moves through the 3D dungeon, encountering random enemies on the way whom she must fight in turn-based combat, while gaining experience points and randomly dropped items. Enemies are mostly female monsters who lose their clothes upon defeat. Raidy must rely on potions which are either found in chests or dropped by enemies to replenish her health and mana reserves. In certain places Raidy triggers plot event before boss battles, releasing girls from prison cells, etc. These events also usually contain explicit sexual situations, mostly of lesbian nature.", "summary": "You take the role of Raidy in this first person RPG dungeon crawl, aiding her on her quest to clear the Cubust tower of the monsters that dwell within and liberate the village of Saad. Featuring hours of classic 3D RPG-style gameplay, dozens of beautifully drawn monster girls from artist Kazuma Muramasa, and strong yuri (lesbian) themes. It's a fresh style of game, from G-Collections and developer ZyX, famous for titles like Sagara Family and Tsuki - Possession.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 36835, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NWm72F_ULpU"}]}
