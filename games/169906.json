You, and two others are washed onto a tropical island. The island is a paradise, with trees, bananas, coconuts, and vines. However, you suddenly remember the long range weather forecast. A tornado will form in this area in about one week. You must work hard to build a raft to get off the island, but also make sure you keep alive by eating, drinking and sleeping. The other survivors must build their own rafts too. You must decide if and when you help them, or if you line your own pockets with gold.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beached-ii"}
