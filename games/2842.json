The player receives money upon successfully dropping off each passenger, and bonuses are obtained when they are transported in a short amount of time. Players have to avoid certain hurdles, such as other vehicles and Burns' nuclear transit buses.\n\nThe game contains sixteen different collectible vehicles, six starting locations, and ten different missions. In order to collect the vehicles and unlock starting locations, players must earn progressively more money for each vehicle or starting location they want to get.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-simpsons-road-rage", "videos": [{"id": 87947, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "44iLl38DgcU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44iLl38DgcU", "title": "The Simpsons Road Rage-Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/44iLl38DgcU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 87948, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TNa-SdrrOf0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNa-SdrrOf0", "title": "The Simpsons: Road Rage FULL GAME Longplay (Gamecube, PS2, XBOX)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TNa-SdrrOf0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
