At the request of a visitor named Mr. Smith, archaeology professor and adventurer Indiana Jones tries to find a small statue in the archives of his workplace Barnett College. After Indy retrieves the horned figurine, Smith uses a key to open it, revealing a sparkling metal bead inside. Smith then pulls out a gun and escapes with the two artifacts, but he loses his coat in the process. The identity card inside reveals \"Smith\" to be Klaus Kerner, an agent of the Third Reich. Another pocket of the coat holds an old magazine containing an article about an expedition on which Jones collaborated with a young woman named Sophia Hapgood, who has since given up archeology to become a psychic.\n\nFearing that she might be Kerner's next target, Indy travels to New York City in order to warn her and to find out more about the mysterious statue. There, he interrupts her lecture on the culture and downfall of Atlantis, and the two return to Sophia's apartment. They discover that Kerner ransacked her office in search of Atlantean artifacts, but Sophia says that she keeps her most valuable item, her necklace, with her. She owns another of the shiny beads, now identified as the mystical metal orichalcum, and places it in the medallion's mouth, invoking the spirit of the Atlantean god Nur-Ab-Sal. She explains that a Nazi scientist called Dr. Hans Ubermann is searching for the power of Atlantis to use it as an energy source for warfare.", "summary": "As of March 2017, the development of the fan remake came to a halt as Disney and LucasFilm games stated they didn't want to share the Indy license at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe have been told that Lucasfilm don\u2019t want to share the Indy license with anyone right one,\u201d the team\u2019s Facebook page reads. \u201cWe will keep in touch with Lucasfilm people and continuously trying to obtain a deal for a full project development.\u201d\n\nIndiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis Special Edition is a remake of legendary game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992) made by Lucasfilm games.\nSpecial Edition features high definition digital artwork, smooth, realistic animation, high quality music, sound effects and voice overs.\n\nThis game is in beta and it will not be released publicly until approved by Disney / Lucasfilm!\n\nIndiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is a point-and-click adventure game by Lucasfilm games, originally released in 1992.\nDisney.
