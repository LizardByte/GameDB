Plus, one particular relic will receive a power-up under the right conditions. The launch of this update coincides with release version 1.3.0.\n\nThe Chaos Update's new stage is titled \"Bat Country\" and features only the titular winged creatures for players to take out in droves. The Chaos Malachite was revealed as one of the relics, which is stated to have a special interaction with the skeletal Mortaccio upon attaining level 80.\n\nThe update's name and the new level are clear homages to the Sonic the Hedgehog series. In a gameplay trailer for the update, special stage elements inspired by 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog and 1994's Sonic the Hedgehog 3 were seen, with the Bat Country level's background referencing the latter's Blue Spheres stages. Even the Chaos Malachite relic is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Chaos Emeralds from the Sonic series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vampire-survivors-chaos-update", "videos": [{"id": 84017, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "a9REb2CEzV0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9REb2CEzV0", "title": "[SPOILERS] Vampire Survivors - v1.3.0 Chaos Update - Feb.9th - (PC/Mac, Xbox, Mobile)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a9REb2CEzV0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
