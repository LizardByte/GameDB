Up to five players can race each other on twenty five tracks (five courses of five tracks each) as they vie for the first place. Unlike other games of the series, each track is constructed of a single static screen and is reminiscent of the arcade classic Super Sprint. Each race is made out of eight laps where anything goes! Cars are invincible and can fire an unlimited amount of rockets and bombs which, consequently, leads the gameplay more towards speed and attack. All the racing tracks display a showcase of exquisite themes - from classic \"City\" and \"Nature\" scapes to more elaborate designs such as the fantasy \"Marchen\" or the unique \"Special\" courses. Road hazards also spice up the game and make each play session unique - from classic pits, speed boosters to shortcuts and disorienting teleporters."}
