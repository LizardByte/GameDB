The top of the levels are blue tunnels and bottom are purple. Aliens in the purple can build new ones in any direction. You can either destroy or shoved the blue tunnels to prevent the aliens from completing its mission. Purple ones cannot be destroyed but they can be shoved. If the alien succeeds, then more additional enemies will occur and the challenge increases. Each rounds show the blocker aliens beng destroyed. \n\nThere are four types of enemies :\n\n\n1  BLOCKERS - These foes build the tunnels and they can exit the tunnel system or be forced out. If they exit the tunnels, they produce 'Expelers' (see below) and quickly make their way to the bottom of the screen to re-enter the tunnels. This is the only time that they are vulnerable.\n\n\n2  EXPELERS - These enemies, produced by the Blockers, chase the players around the screen and attempt to corner them. They travel at different speeds, generally moving faster as they get closer to SWAT agents.\n\n\n3  ANNGRERS - These cubed-shaped foes are invulnerable to the SWAT agent's fire. Shooting this type of enemy will cause it to chase the players very quickly. They can be destroyed by using bombs, but a new Anngrer will be created in its place at the bottom of the screen. These enemies can travel in and out of the tunnel system wherever they choose.\n\n\n4 SWEEPERS - Along with additional enemy fire, these foes appear in pairs on the left and right sides of the tunnel along if the bottom and top portions of the screen are connected by one continuous tunnel. They will line up with each other on either side of the players' SWAT agents and fire at them. Sweepers require multiple shots to be destroyed.\n\nThe game is endess. After 7 levels, level 8 becomes level 1 again so I decided not to continue the game nor recording any further after playing through the whole game.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ggeOjClMig0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ggeOjClMig0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ggeOjClMig0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ggeOjClMig0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Game: SWAT (1984 Coreland/Sega)", "description": "A shooting 'em up game where you aim to shoot to destroy a swarm of aliens in a building from a sectional tunnel.
