Skull Kid turns Link into a small plant-like creature known as Deku Scrub and takes away his horse and his magical ocarina. Shortly afterward, Tatl joins Link and agrees to help him revert to his native form. A meeting with a wandering mask salesman reveals that the Skull Kid is wearing Majora's Mask, an ancient item used in hexing rituals, which calls forth a menacing moon hovering over the land of Termina. Link has exactly three days to find a way to prevent this from happening.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time, it utilizes the same engine and visual style as its predecessor. The game retains the traditional elements of Zelda games as well as those introduced in Ocarina of Time, such as active blocking with a shield, various throwing items, and the usage of melodies played on the ocarina to solve puzzles. Compared to the previous Zelda games, this installment is more oriented towards interaction with NPCs and has a larger variety of items, optional quests, and mini-games. It also includes a time system that spans three days, and this cycle must be reset periodically to progress through the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majora-s-mask", "videos": [{"id": 62848, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "Zn6LM3AuRvM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn6LM3AuRvM", "title": "Majora's Mask Intro [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zn6LM3AuRvM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62849, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "5c2Kb2RI2es", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c2Kb2RI2es", "title": "The Legend of Zelda : Majora's Mask - Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5c2Kb2RI2es/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62850, "name": "TV commercials and promotional videos", "video_id": "nC066Esv0lI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC066Esv0lI", "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask - Commercials collection", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nC066Esv0lI/sddefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 3691, "name": "Character Voices"}]}
