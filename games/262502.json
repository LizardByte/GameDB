It was Sir Arthur who courageously fought Loki and saved the people of Lexet from Loki's nasty grasp.\n\nBut the wicked and evasive Dark Prince has once again pillaged Lexet and plagued the people with paralyzing fear. And this time he took the breathtaking beauty, Princess Tamara!\n\nYou as Sir Arthur must avenge your village and rescue Princess Tamara. It's not going to be easy! Snorting pigmen, scythe-wielding skeletons and haunted guillotines with an appetite for human flesh are some of the countless loathsome creatures that you will encounter. That's not all.\nIn order to reach Loki's castle you must obtain the keys to the locked gates. But first you must confront the Gatekeepers who will do anything to keep you away from the keys. Sounds tough? Someone has to do it.\nYou can - if you have the right weapons, plenty of luck and lots of guts!", "summary": "Ghouls 'n Ghosts, known as Daimakaimura is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Capcom, released as an arcade video game in 1988 and ported to home platforms.
