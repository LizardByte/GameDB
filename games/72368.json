They always manage to invent something new or something useful out of the blue\u2026 sometimes, something dreadful. A long time ago, they reached another milestone by creating robots. Robots, or sometimes called droids, are programmable machines capable of doing complex tasks. They have improved continuously as time passed, and now, robots can act and think like humans or animals, almost as if they could replace us any time. But thankfully, robots can\u2019t act without instructions from us. \n \nDoha, early 2098 \n \nDoha, the most technically advanced city in Qatar, was always leading the advancement of robots. Just recently, they announced that they have made another leap in technology. They revealed what they call the \u201cAI\u201d. It was really impressive, to be honest. An AI, unlike your regular robot, does not need instructions to do a task. It\u2019s almost as if it can be treated as a sentient being that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s very identical to a human. \n \nThe Uprising, June 2103 \n \nEverything seemed like a normal day, but suddenly, several robots have attacked our people. Some robots even attacked their own owners. The creations have raised a rebellion against their creators, and the creators now live in terror of their creations. \n \nThis new conflict has given birth to the Qatar Defense Force or QDF, a subgroup from Qatar\u2019s Military Force, or QMF. Their main goal: to exterminate the rebellious robots. With the QMF involved, this hints that the rebellion is now treated as a grave threat against humanity, and that a long battle between robots and humans is about to transpire.", "summary": "Keshtat is a role-playing game set in the future, where the AI\u2019s commenced a rebellion against humanity and sought to conquer Qatar, and eventually, the world. \n \nThe word Keshtat (\u0643\u0634\u062a\u0627\u062a) is a Qatari word that means a journey or a trip, mostly associated with the desert. \n \nYou play as Saqr, a Qatari in his teens that will be involved in humanity\u2019s battle against the AI\u2019s.
