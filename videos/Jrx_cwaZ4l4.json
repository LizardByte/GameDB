It will extend to a campaign of up to 28 maps in a single playthrough, including a substantial midgame route split as was present in the original, and a playable cast of 58, of which 20 are route-exclusive. It will benefit from more recent advances in hacking QoL and more modern approaches to game design, while retaining the old atmosphere and aesthetic flair that gave it its original appeal. The writing has also been overhauled significantly, rather than replacing scenes like-for-like down the line.\n\nhttps://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-fire-emblem-dream-of-five/21043", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jrx_cwaZ4l4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jrx_cwaZ4l4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jrx_cwaZ4l4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jrx_cwaZ4l4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jrx_cwaZ4l4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "FEE3 2023: FE: Dream of Five", "description": "Dream of Five was an FE7, FEditor-era hack made in the early 2010s by a team of teenagers with too much time on their hands.
