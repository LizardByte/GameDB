This one is specifically based on v1.2.0 by BeerMat software, the version that the author grew up with. The UI also imitates Windows 98 since that's where the author played it first.\n\nIn Watch Trader, you don't trade illegal substances. As the name obviously states, you trade something that can also be addictive--watches.\n\nThe author made this because it's a simple game that the author want to play occasionally on his computer or phone. There are several games similar to Dope Wars in the market, but a few have left the author satisfied.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/watch-trader"}
