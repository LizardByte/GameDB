Instead, a wild Pikachu that Professor Oak catches becomes player's Pok\u00e9mon, while the rival character takes an Eevee that was intended for the player. The plot takes from the anime, and features characters that were not featured in the game or have been enhanced to resemble their anime characters, including Jessie, James, Meowth, Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny. Similar to the anime, Pikachu refuses to evolve. Players are also given the opportunity to obtain the original three starters. As players quest on, they collect more Pok\u00e9mon and use them to defeat the eight Gym Leaders and eventually the Elite Four, all the while battling Team Rocket, a gang devoted to using Pok\u00e9mon in order to make themselves more powerful.", "summary": "Pok\u00e9mon Yellow is an enhanced version of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue that allows you to start the game with your very own Pikachu following you around on-foot and collect the 3 other starters from strangers you meet around the region.
