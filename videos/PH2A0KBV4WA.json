It was created by the very talented mod and music maker Reaktor, and can be downloaded here:\nhttps://www.moddb.com/mods/the-trap/d...\n\nI noticed with all the walkthroughs of this mod out there, there were none that showed or documented how to obtain 100% of the achievements, or even show the alternate ending. This ending is what I would consider the true \"canon\" ending, and is so much more satisfying than the traditional which leaves you wanting more. I hope this guide helps you achieve the game's full potential, and I recommend playing the alternate ending yourself before watching it here!\n\nThanks again to Reaktor as well as everyone who took part in making this incredible mod.\n\nhttps://thetrap.ucoz.ru/\nhttps://deltamod.ucoz.ru/\nhttp://hl.loess.ru/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PH2A0KBV4WA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PH2A0KBV4WA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PH2A0KBV4WA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PH2A0KBV4WA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PH2A0KBV4WA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Half-Life: The Trap - Walkthrough (100% Achievements & Alternate Ending)", "description": "This mod is one of my all time favorite Half-Life mods.
