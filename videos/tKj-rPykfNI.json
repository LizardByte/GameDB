Living the dream as a suave secret agent, completing top secret missions, and dating some of the hottest women on earth. He had it all until one mission changed everything.\n\nFeeling cast out and betrayed, Vanilla left the agency, his only desire to fade into oblivion. Everything was going according to plan until someone, something, started murdering local ladies of the night in Vanilla's town. These treacherous deeds removing both erotic talents and public services from the streets will not go unpunished as Vanilla awakens from retirement to equalize those responsible for the removal of the women he held so close to his... heart.\n\nPlay as VanillaBeast as he makes his comeback against the forces of evil as they try to remove his night life, and everything he holds dear. Make your way through an amazing retro-style adventure of open world exploration as well as a huge variety of levels spanning across beaches, casinos, flashbacks, race tracks, Camp Crystal Fake, and tons more locations in Venereousville USA. Fret not, for Vanilla isn't alone on his quest for night life justice, you'll meet a massive cast of current and former Adult Entertainers willing to aid you on your journey through power-ups, items, and other means of \"support\".\n\n#VanillaBeastGame #CasinoRoyale #IndieGame #Parody", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKj-rPykfNI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKj-rPykfNI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKj-rPykfNI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKj-rPykfNI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKj-rPykfNI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "VanillaBeast: Ace in the Hole | Demo Intro", "description": "VanillaBeast: Ace in the Hole - A Parody Game\n\nCheck out Ace in the Hole on our Kickstarter pre-launch page!
