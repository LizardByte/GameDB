{"id": "yptpWO66HA4", "snippet": {"title": "NARC Longplay (Arcade) [QHD]", "description": "Game Info\n---------------------------------------------------\nDeveloper: Williams Electronic Games\nPublisher: Williams Electronic Games\nYear of Release: 1988\n\nGame Impressions\n---------------------------------------------------\nAnother release from coin-op auteur Eugene Jarvis, NARC is one of the first games I'm aware of to use digitised sprites, and it's quite amazing just how good the graphics are for the time of release. The base resolution from the video output is 1024 x 768, which is insanely high compared to pretty much any other arcade machine of the time, and this is definitely reflected in the quality and sharpness of the graphics.\n\nAs for the gameplay, NARC is a further iteration on Javis' modus operandi: besiege the player from all sides, blow stuff up, collect stuff for bonus points, and make sure the difficulty is stupidly hard. The game tries to be super-edgy by having the players, a pair of bike-helmeted SWAT cops, busting drug dealers and street punks and collecting their stashes for points. Although its possible to actually arrest criminals by walking into them, it's far safer to simply blow them away with your machine guns and rocket launcher, with the latter sending severed limbs flying in all directions. Terminated perps often leave behind baggies full of drugs, or extra ammo for your weapons; you'll need every single bullet and rocket dropped because the sheer number of enemies can be overwhelming, and the amount of ammo you actually receive is severely limited.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the best strategy to beat the game involves racking up enough points to earn sufficient bonus lives to deal with final boss. I couldn't find a strategy that worked, other than to try and brute force my way through the encounter and rely on extra lives to win through.\n\nOf Jarvis' games that I've played, I personally prefer Smash T.V. to NARC. The concept is better, and the mechanics are less fiddly. I found it difficult to actually pick items up, and the added controls for crouching and jumping just made things feel overcomplicated. This may have been technically impressive, but it lacks the fun and stupidity of putting your life on the line for a new toaster...\n\nVideo Notes\n---------------------------------------------------\nN/A\n\nRelated Longplays & Videos\n---------------------------------------------------\nSmash T.V.
