The player woke up in a jail in Rungistan and must find a way to escape the country.\n\nThe game incorporated several real-time elements that also appeared in a later Sirius adventure game called Critical Mass (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXz9U_I8-is). For instance, if a snake is moving on screen, the player will die if he types in anything.\n\nHope you enjoy the walkthrough! The long play is done with the help from Smartadventurer, a program that I wrote to automate the playing for vintage Apple ][ games.
