I am using Ken Blocks Ford Fiesta in this video, But videos coming soon may include gameplay footage of other cars such as a Mini Cooper S on this track. Overall this track is great and is very fun to drive through at 120mph+!\n\nSo I hope you enjoy the video, feel free to like, comment and subscribe! This was filmed with an HD PVR so 720p HD is recommended for best quality. \n\n***Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
