The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score). However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burnout-dominator", "videos": [{"id": 13183, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vqUEy9BNyIs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqUEy9BNyIs", "title": "Burnout Dominator Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vqUEy9BNyIs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
