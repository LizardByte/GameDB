Finally, now you can suck at golf virtually as much as you suck in real life.\n\nYou'll learn the art of golf on your own terms: picking clubs, assessing the wind, and, of course, tracking down that stray ball no matter where it lands. It\u2019s a game for those who want to discover, adapt, and make every inch of progress on their own.\n\nBeyond the golf course, life goes on\u2014literally. You're living out entire days, where golfing may or may not be part of it, it's entirely up to you. You\u2019ll have to keep yourself alive, managing food, water, and sleep while earning enough cash through odd jobs to keep your golfing dream alive.\n\nIt\u2019s a game that tests patience, resourcefulness, and adaptability. If you\u2019re willing to roll with the quirks, laugh off the Early Access growing pains, you might just discover an experience that\u2019s both unexpectedly rewarding and thoroughly unconventional.\n\nWelcome to An Other Golf Game. Good luck out there, and happy golfing\u2026 if you can survive long enough to get to it!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/an-other-golf-game", "videos": [{"id": 131899, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qsP5qTRE2FE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsP5qTRE2FE", "title": "Launch Announcement - An Other Golf Game - Steam Early Access", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qsP5qTRE2FE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 131904, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "vU9zawKsIog"}]}
