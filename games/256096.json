It was originally intended to add a few new features for a personalised experience, but has since grown into a full-fledged fork of Minecraft, adding dozens of new features for players to enjoy. Its philosophy is to add new gameplay that enhances and improves on the existing aspects of the game, without drastically changing the core experience. The question we like to ask ourselves is, \"Would Mojang have added this to the vanilla game back in 2011?\" If the answer is yes, it's probably a good candidate for BTA.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/minecraft-better-than-adventure"}
