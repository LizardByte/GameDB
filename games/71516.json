The two work for a Los Angeles newspaper called The Quill but dislike each other and are bitter rivals. In the introductory scene we see the Quill editor telling Ron about a \"Monsters' Ball\"\u2014a social event where all the Hollywood movie monsters have a big party at the mansion of Otto Hanover, a film producer. The editor stresses that The Quill must cover the event because it is too important to miss. Ron is not enthusiastic, but when Sue comes in Ron tells the editor how important it is that The Quill sends its best reporter and that he is the only one capable of accomplishing the task. This has the expected effect: Sue proclaims that she is the best journalist The Quill has and that there is no way Ron could do a decent job. Sue then proceeds to the Hanover mansion in her little sports car.", "summary": "Hollywood Monsters is an adventure game by the Spanish developer Pendulo Studios which was originally released in 1997. Due to the bankruptcy of Dinamic Multimedia by 2001, Pendulo's publisher, Four Fat Chicks doubted that an English version of this \" little-known and much sought-after\" game would be released at the time\n\nHowever the game was re-released for iOS in 2012. The game received an indirect sequel in 2011 known internationally as The Next Big Thing and in Spain as Hollywood Monsters 2. Its style is reminiscent of Lucasarts adventure games like Grim Fandango.[2] The iOS release was localised for English, French, German, Spanish and Italian", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hollywood-monsters", "videos": [{"id": 17532, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "xilncffGNQY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xilncffGNQY", "title": "Hollywood Monsters - Part 1 Game Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xilncffGNQY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
