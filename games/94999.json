It features faithful 3D recreations of two pachinko machines made by Sanyo Bussan: CR Hyper Umi Monogatari in Carib MTA and CR Hyper Umi Monogatari in Carib MTB. There are two modes available: Ts\u016bj\u014d (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. Scores from Jissen mode could be uploaded to a national leaderboard, which was also used for a promotional contest shortly after the game's release. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed. There is no story mode."}
