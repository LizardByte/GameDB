A faithful adaptation of the classic Warhammer 40,000 board game of Man versus Alien in desperate battle, Space Hulk: Tactics brings new twists to the formula along with extensive customisation, two full campaigns, and much more.\n\nIn today\u2019s trailer we profile the Genestealers, the festering malice at the heart of the Space Hulk, ready to cut down any and all Space Marine Terminators that come aboard. Their strategies and playstyle are completely different, creating truly asymmetrical multiplayer. Using their numbers and agility to their advantage, the Genestealers are a more aggressive force, but one with less options on how to handle each situation.\n\nIn the Steam pre-order beta, players can look forward to playing the Genestealers and the Terminators, in skirmish and multiplayer across five maps. Also available is the full customisation system and the map editor, letting the creatives in the community get started early on new creations and master plans.\n\nA preview of each faction\u2019s campaign will also be playable, serving both as a tutorial and a taste of what awaits in the full game. Save games will be compatible with the release version, so players can immediately continue their mission on October 9. The pre-order bonuses will also be available in the beta, giving access to second founding chapters and other alternate versions of the base game\u2019s Blood Angels, Space Wolves, Dark Angels, and Ultramarines chapters.\n\nThe pre-order beta will run up until the launch of the game, with regular updates to address bugs and balance issues as reported by the community. On launch day, October 9, players will gain access to more official maps as well as the two complete, massive single-player campaigns. All Steam pre-orders have a 10% discount up until launch and will give instant access to the beta, as well as the pre-order cosmetics.\n\nThe Space Hulk: Tactics pre-order beta begins September 25 on Steam.
