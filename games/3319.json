The premise is that, as a street racer, the player must impress other drivers with quick but stylish driving in a series of challenges. These challenges are in sets of ten (called Chapters - there are 25 in total), with completion of all challenges opening the next chapter (assuming the player has enough Kudos, see below) and unlocking a new car. Each challenge is on a different track, and unlocking a challenge unlocks that track in the time-attack and multiplayer modes.", "videos": [{"id": 1849, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p0OzDfR63d0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0OzDfR63d0", "title": "Metropolis Street Racer - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0OzDfR63d0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
