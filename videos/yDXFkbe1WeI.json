It was developed by Interplay Productions. The game was a platformer with a wacky storyline in which the eponymous main character explored multiple planets and fought enemies while jumping through levels. The game was notable for a level in which the protagonist was drawn upside down and gravity was reversed. The main character had a comically large head, and his early game attack consists of a sort of a lightsaber.\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est 2007 includes gameplay captures from all commercial releases from the US market with a few extras (like famicom releases) just for fun.
