The game's plot is quite simple involving the adventures of Kerorican, a female astronaut wearing kemonomimi-style frog-helmet, as she walks along accompanied by jazzy techno music. As Kerorican continues her walk, she encounters more and more enemies and obstacles. Kerorican must jump, duck, kick aside, or otherwise dodge these obstacles to progress and as she does so, the actions she takes add notes to the song such that the player's actions results in a generative melody. By successfully clearing strings of obstacles, Kerorican's combo count increases and this can result in a reward to the player of a crown that acts to skip the player over obstacles. This game is played with the WonderSwan Color held diagonally, the only game on the system to do so. This is why all text in the game is oblique.\n\nThe game has been criticized for difficulty of gameplay as timing and tricky button combinations often result in the player's death. The game also only contains 4 levels so replayability-value has also been considered a negative factor.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
