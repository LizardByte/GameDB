Become an Agent and blast away bad guys approaching from either side of the screen. You will do this by matching the direction and type of swipe that each bad guy has floating above his head. Some enemies have red colored arrows over their head, which indicates you will need to swipe in the OPPOSITE direction! Be aware that the gameplay will twist your brain into knots as the speed of the game increases and the pressure mounts up. Be fast or get hit! Don\u2019t mess up a swipe or the Agent Wonky gets scared and runs away arms flailing!\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
