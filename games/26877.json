Jon Dagger, a lone soldier who must travel through the ruins of America into the Great White North on a rescue mission to save the President. He's joined by a former Soviet engineer who has uploaded himself into Sgt. Dagger's brain.\n\nIn your mission, you must run and gun your way through a variety of environments, fighting post-apocalyptic barbarians, Canadian soldiers, fiendish robots, and powerful ninjas.\n\nCold Vengeance is a 3D run 'n' gun game that is a tribute to late 90s early 3D games, as well as to 80s and 90s action games and movies.", "summary": "When Canada invades the USA, Sgt.
