After that the player should direct trains between towns (the red train should go to the red town, and the yellow one - to the yellow one) using of railways switchers and traffic lights. \n \nVarious relief obstacles (rivers and mountains) appear further in the game, as well as bridges and tunnels. Next we tried to create difficulties in the paths construction. There are only 6 rail shapes, so it is necessary to create additional loops or railway sidings for some cities connection (puzzle elements). \n \nAlso there is a quest part in the game - the player can spend the earned money to restore locomotives in the hangar.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-railroad", "videos": [{"id": 27510, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "syFl-m4dw2w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syFl-m4dw2w", "title": "My Railroad", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/syFl-m4dw2w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
