The developers decided to abandon its development in 2014, leaving the game in an unfinished state but available for purchase. \n \n\"The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features.  \n   \nIn Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?  \n  \nBoth the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.  \n  \nAttract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!  \n  \nCraft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/towns"}
