The game is based around an alien invasion during a festival, and the four heroes (Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Knight Gundam from Gundam and Fighter Roar, a character created for The Great Battle series).\n\nThe game has a mix of genres. The chief gameplay is a platformer where the player can leap up and down floors similar to Ninja-Kid or Mr. Goemon. If the player enters a flying gate, they are escorted to a shoot 'em up stage in which they control a flying lobster fighting samurai heads and Maneki Nekos.\n\nThe Great Battle Gaiden 2 follows the Game Boy game Tekkyu Fight! The Great Battle Gaiden, released the previous year. Like every The Great Battle game and its Japanese pop culture-specific heroes, the game was never localized into English.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
