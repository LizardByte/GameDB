It features faithful 3D recreations of two pachinko machines made by Sanyo Bussan: CR Shin Umi Monogatari M56 and CR Shin Umi Monogatari L52. There are two modes available: Ts\u016bj\u014d (Normal) mode allows the player to modify a wide range of settings for each machine, while Jissen (Battle) mode challenges the player to win as many balls as possible on the default settings with a limited starting pool and time limit. There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed.\n\nThe popular Pachi-Pro F\u016bunroku story mode returns with Pachi-Pro F\u016bunroku 2: Senjukannon no Nazo, a direct sequel to the first installment which picks up the story right where it left off before. The protagonist has just arrived at Shinkai Town, following a lead to find his father's killer. The game proceeds much the same as before, with the player moving between different locations speaking to other characters and playing pachinko. In addition to the three pachinko halls and the player's apartment, there are also now a restaurant and a shrine, where different story events may occur. It is also now possible to learn and use special moves for use in the pachinko battles. As before, it is possible to pursue a relationship with one of five different girls, with the game's ending changing accordingly.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sanyou-pachinko-paradise-9-shin-umi-okawari", "videos": [{"id": 136549, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tVxUbQM6ad0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVxUbQM6ad0", "title": "\u4e09\u6d0b\u30d1\u30c1\u30f3\u30b3\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b99 ~\u65b0\u6d77\u304a\u304b\u308f\u308a!~ OP (PS2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tVxUbQM6ad0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
