There, a young girl named Eruruu carried a young man, who was on the brink of death, back to her village. Though he was gravely injured, her family was able to nurse him back to health. However, he lost all of his memories. Needing something to call him, Eruruu's grandmother named him Hakuowlo. After recovering, he quickly adapted to life in the village. While struggling with the mysteries of his past, he used his knowledge to help the village prosper. Perhaps thanks to his kind personality and diligent work ethic, everyone around him began to depend on \"Hakuowlo.\" Before long, it was time for the harvest, which\u2014thanks to everyone's hard work\u2014was unexpectedly bountiful. Rumors of their success reached the ears of the feudal lord, who sent troops to Yamayura to seize the fruits of their labor. A single incident on the outskirts of a rural land served as the prelude to a conflict that would reverberate across the entire world...", "summary": "A remake of the first Utawarerumono title featuring remastered artwork and battle sections are now in 3D.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the origins of the Utawarerumono saga are coming overseas!\n\nUtawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen is the first chapter of a tale years in the making.
