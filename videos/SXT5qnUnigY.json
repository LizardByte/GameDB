Earn that sense of pride and accomplishment in the way that only repetitive clicking can deliver. It's a clicker game, so chill out, have a few chuckles, and watch numbers get bigger while the industry burns around us all.\n\n\nFeatures:\nLots of clicking. But not, like, too much clicking. You can get upgrades that automate things.\nNumbers that get bigger.\nSome numbers that get way big. No, even bigger than that.\nSense of pride1\nSense of accomplishment2\n\nAbout this game\nMy secret shame is that I really like clicker games and lose a lot of time to them. I also make games for a living and have always wanted to try making a clicker game myself. This game is part of a challenge to design, develop, and publish an entire game (solo!) in one week and this is what I came up with. There are many clicker games but this one is mine. I hope you like it!\n\nAlso please don't ruin the games industry.\n\nSincerely,\n- Ben\n\n\n1Unlikely\n2Not guaranteed\n\nRELEASE DATE: 13 Dec, 2017\nDEVELOPER: Going Loud Studios\nPUBLISHER: Going Loud Studios\n http://store.steampowered.com/app/758500/Loot_Box_Quest/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXT5qnUnigY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXT5qnUnigY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXT5qnUnigY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXT5qnUnigY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXT5qnUnigY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Loot Box Quest Release Trailer 13-12-2017", "description": "HEY DO YOU LIKE CLICKER OR IDLE GAMES?\n\nIf you don't like clicker or idle games, then you shouldn't buy this game because it is an idle clicker game and you just said you don't like those so you won't like this one.\n\nABOUT THIS GAME\n\nThe spiritual successor to DLC Quest!
