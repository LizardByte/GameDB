I cannot yet confirm it hurtling towards that lovely hybrid system I'm such a fan of, as I'm entirely self funded so far, and so have a few hurdles I need to clear in the coming year.\n\nIf you want to help me reach my goal of bringing ZONERS to console, then help spread the word!\n\nDesign, Art, Animation & Programming by me, Paris Stalker.\nTwitter: @paris_stalker & @ALLiN_indie\n\nSFX: Max Newton\nLinkedin - www.linkedin.com/in/maxnewtonaudio\n\nFeaturing music from:\nCRYSTALBOY \nWebsite - www.crystalboy.com\nTwitter+Instagram - @crystalxboy\n\nRoBKTA\nTwitter - @RoB_KTA\nInstagram - @robktastagram\nFacebook - www.facebook.com/robktamusic\nSoundcloud, Spotify, Bandcamp - RoBKTA\n\nShadow Mantra Steve\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3tw4ZlRfkTkQ_r51RqG9aA\nWebsite - https://www.shadowmantra.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYca-Yb33KI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYca-Yb33KI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYca-Yb33KI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYca-Yb33KI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYca-Yb33KI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ZONERS - Reveal Trailer", "description": "ZONERS is an entirely fictional, and very over the top 1vs1 sports game, kind of like a cross between Air Hockey, Football, Fighting Games and Saturday morning Cartoons.\n\nAt launch, ZONERS is planned to feature:\n\n- 8 distinct, easy to use but difficult to master characters with their own abilities and personalities\n- 10 playable stages, each with their own gimmicks that can be turned off for those looking for a more pure experience\n- Extensive match customisation options with the ability to save favourite templates for future use\n- Plenty to unlock by playing the multiplayer match maker or single player Galactic Cup and other modes\n- Free post launch support\n\nCurrently I can only 100% confirm the game coming to PC like my previous title ERSATZ (https://store.steampowered.com/app/703720/ERSATZ/).\u00a0However, I've designed the game from the ground up with the Nintendo Switch in mind.
