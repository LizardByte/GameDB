Yes! Well, now you can read on, though you may have an idea of what we are talking about. Everything is pretty basic here, and all in all it doesn't make for a bad gaming experience. Absolutely no multi-player, decent sprites graphic, plain sounds and no music and pretty enjoyable although hard at the beginning gameplay. This is 'The Broken Land'. At the beginning you choose amongst four characters, being all pretty ugly. Well, everything you may think of in such a game is there, manna/magic, huge inventory, healing potions, swords, bows, huge looking monsters. Dear guys at A.P.F. with this game you are only 4/5 years late, anyway still an acceptable effort.\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 PC Hardware \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7 8700K\nRAM: 32 GB\nGPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080\nOS:  Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 Recording HW/SW \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nNvidia Share", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R92MboyG1J0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R92MboyG1J0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R92MboyG1J0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R92MboyG1J0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R92MboyG1J0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Broken Land (2000) - PC Gameplay / Win 10", "description": "The Broken Land (2000) - PC Gameplay / Win 10\n\nSubscribe here \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FirstPlaysHD\nAlso SHARE, COMMENT, LIKE \u263a\n\n\nDiablo wannabe?
