The central idea is a temple built on a huge piece of rock floating in an abyss with an abundance of vertical gameplay. Due to pursuit of the architectural complexity, in the spirit of Quake, map has performance problems.\n\nThe player's goal is to explore temple complex and find 3 runes. After installing them on the pedestals to open the exit and leave map. I'm sure sometimes players will find short cuts. Note that these are not bugs (although they were originally), since do not break the map progression.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/infraworld-coma-moonlight"}
