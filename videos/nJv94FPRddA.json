The wireframe 3D environments and spacecraft were truly breath-taking to behold, not to mention the speed and relative smoothness at which the game operated.\n\nThe game is set during the final, climactic moments of the of the film, as the Rebel Alliance launch an assault on the under-construction Death Star. Players must engage in frantic dogfights with Imperial Tie Fighters, making efforts to not only take down the craft, but to nullify their \"fireball\" blaster fire as well. Darth Vader himself will show up on later difficulty levels, kitted out in his own personal Tie Fighter, equipped with a shield.\n\nBreak through the fighter defences, and you'll skim across the surface of the Death Star itself, dodging blaster fire from turrets and laser towers. Make it through, and you'll embark on the iconic - not to mention deadly - trench run, attempting to knock out the super weapons platform by firing a pair of proton torpedoes into the exposed exhaust port. Succeed, and you'll be hailed a hero of the Alliance and earn a serious amount of points; fail, and you'll be forced to run the trench all over again.\n\nAlthough I was far too young to ever experience the real arcade machine (I'd have been barely 1 year old at the time of release), I certainly remember playing the C64 and Amiga conversions many years later. These really don't do the arcade game justice, and I can only imagine just how mind blowing this must have seemed back in the day. The music, graphics, not to mention speech effects, really were a showcase for Atari, a company clearly at the top of its game.\n\nAs for the video, I played up till the completion of wave 10 before consigning myself to the void.
