After the events of the first movie the self-proclaimed Kick-Ass superhero is largely by himself. His sidekick Hit Girl lost her father Big Daddy and has to live with a friend called Marcus. Now Kick-Ass roams the streets by himself, bringing villains to justice, while Hit Girl promised to abandon her old ways. She now stays in contact with Kick-Ass through her phone and does not fight along with him. Eventually Kick-Ass will join the band of superheroes called Justice Forever.\n\nThe game consists of several locations explored through a linear path. Each location largely consists of a series of fighting encounters, with a small puzzle every now and then where electricity has to be disabled through a short timing sequence to progress. Kick-Ass fights using two main moves that can be combined into several combos. Certain combos stun opponents, allowing lengthening the chain. After a certain amount of combo hits finisher moves can be confirmed. Kick-Ass is also able to dodge and roll to avoid incoming attacks and certain enemies, wielding baseball bats or guns, can be disarmed. Every now and then there are boss encounters.\n\nThere are two types of optional objectives. The game contains 24 pieces of offensive graffiti that need to be located to spray over them. There is also a symbol for a Wi-Fi signal. At certain spots Kick-Ass can use the Weeter social network (a spoof of Twitter) to broadcast a message about his exploits.", "summary": "Dive into an exciting, action-packed adventure and relive the incredible scenes from the Hollywood blockbuster 'Kick-Ass 2'.
