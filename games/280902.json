Are they really fighting for what they think they are fighting for?\n\nStep into the shoes of a lowly villager, Dahnzell, entranced by images of glory and a reclusive prince, Nero, starved of answers for profound questions in a fight for clarity and change.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rune-rhetoric"}
