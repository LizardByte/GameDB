Little by little, life began to reassert itself as people formed civilizations around Basel, but as more and more people withdrew into this tiny world constructed by man, they came to repeat the mistakes of the past... Thus begins the story of a world nearing it's end, and the intertwining fates of those who inhabit it.", "summary": "In this sci-fi rpg you will follow the three protagonists - Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron - as they form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel.
