Due to my grandmother\u2019s recent illness and hospitalization, however, she was forced to close the caf\u00e9 until further notice. When I heard about my grandmother\u2019s situation from Chisato Komada (a childhood friend who is like an older sister to me), I looked around the desolate caf\u00e9 and my heart was filled with a sense of loneliness. It was then I immediately thought:\n\n\u201cI want to bring the shop back to life again and show it to grandmother\u2026!!!\u201d\n\nWe renovated the inside of the shop and gave it a new name. We prepared a new menu and caf\u00e9 uniforms and began the hiring process to find new, part-time staff. Right away two girls, Niwasaka Rira and Shionomiya Rishie, came into the cafe.\n\n\u300c\u201cUm\u2026 would it be ok if we worked here?\u201d\u300d\n\nAn unusually strong breeze blew cherry blossom petals inside the shop and they fluttered and danced around the cafe, myself, and the girls around me. This could only be a premonition of the bittersweet tale that would soon follow\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
