Players must progress from season to season to compete in the WRC category and ultimately become world champion. By following several teams in different rallies, the developers managed to capture the key aspects of a successful season. \nPlayers must excel in three major areas that have been included in the game: \n\n\u2022 Planning the calendar to decide which events to do in between rallies: training, manufacturer challenges, rest, classic events, etc.\n\n\u2022 Managing a whole crew comprising six different and interconnected job roles. Players must consider each of their unique characteristics and use them strategically in each rally.\n\n\u2022 Upgrading the crew through R&D and a skill tree, which evolves depending on player choices. Every decision has an impact on progression and on the morale of the crew (performance, reliability, etc.).\n\nThe statistics available at the end of each rally also help players to refine their strategy, compare themselves to competitors and adjust their set-ups as necessary to climb the rankings, upgrade their car and recruit the right people for their team.\n\n#WRC8 will be available the 5th of September 2019 on PlayStation\u00ae4, Xbox One, PC and in October on Nintendo Switch\u2122.\n\n-------------------------------\nFor more news on WRC The Official Game, follow us on:\n\nFacebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/WRCOfficialGame\nTwitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/WRCTheGame\nInstagram \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/WRCTheGame\n\n-------------------------------\nFor news about our other games, you can also follow us on: \n\nFacebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/bigbengames\nTwitter \u25bahttps://twitter.com/Bigben_Games", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzRhVg5z8Cg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzRhVg5z8Cg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzRhVg5z8Cg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzRhVg5z8Cg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzRhVg5z8Cg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "WRC 8 | Career Mode Overview", "description": "The new Career Mode in WRC 8 mimics the real world and allows players to become a driver for a WRC team for the first time.
