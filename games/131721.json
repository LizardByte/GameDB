With few options and less money, they are forced to rely on their only marketable skill. Hacking. \nThe character will encounter many people and organizations, and their hacks will impact the world around them. \nHacking isn't easy, however. Our character will need extraordinary computing power to create viruses capable of compromising their targeted systems. The player will need to expand their living space and secret server room to accommodate computing racks, which can be customized to provide the power, traits, and abilities that their viruses require to overcome even the most secure of systems. \nHacking isn't only about computers though. What information can be gained from people close to the target system? What value will come from a well thought out disguise? Will other hackers met along the way be willing to help in a time of need?", "summary": "HackRack is a game where you live in a city and use your hacking skills to influence the world around you. \nThe player will encounter many people and organizations, and their hacks will impact the world around them.
