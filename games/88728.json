Pinball Massacre is an arcade style pinball game (we know that sounds silly but it makes sense when you play). This first table in the Pinball Massacre series features two unique twists on classic pinball conventions. With MASSACRE MODE you need to get your flippers ready because you\u2019re about to get hit with an angry pinball blitz. Score as many points as you can in a very short time. With the LEVEL BALL, we add an RPG twist that makes each pinball count. While a ball is in play, it gains experience and Levels Up. Scoring you more points and generally behaving more awesomely.\n\nBased on the Stabb Gunner Universe, Pinball Massacre brings unique energy, art, humor, and 8bit culture to the pinball scene.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinball-massacre", "videos": [{"id": 25032, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "tBCgVgbThXk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBCgVgbThXk", "title": "Pinball Massacre Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tBCgVgbThXk/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8908, "name": "Stabb Gunner"}]}
