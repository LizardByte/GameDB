In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse, and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading \"Cheetamen II\". This cartridge is now very rare and hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet.\n\nIn Cheetahmen II the player again assumes the role of one of the three Cheetahmen (Aries, Apollo and Hercules); after defeating a boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels, as in the Action 52 version. Due to a bug, it is impossible to get to the levels in which one plays Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or experiencing a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cheetahmen-ii", "videos": [{"id": 136308, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HOxBnsozyuc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxBnsozyuc", "title": "NES Longplay [288] Cheetahmen II (Unlicensed)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HOxBnsozyuc/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1079, "name": "The Cheetahmen"}]}
