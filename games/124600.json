Each turn one player will get a special event that gives or takes away items or money. If there is time left at the end of the development phase the turn can be ended at the pub to receive a little bit extra money for the time that remains.\nAfter each player has completed their rounds the Production phase begins where the droids that are installed will produce items that can be traded or used in future turns.\nFollowing the production phase a global event is likely to happen. The global event can change the next development phase or change something for a player.\nThe trading phase comes next and gives players a chance to trade items with eachother or the store for money. The price of items is set by walking up and down on the screen to trade with other players willing to match the price or the store for the less profitable deal.\nAfter a score update where the player with the most value is at the top the next round of phases begins until the last round where the result is tallied.", "summary": "Four Player Competitive Strategy Game\nTaking inspiration from M.U.L.E., a classic strategy game from 1983, Space Moguls pits four competitors (the computer handles any competitors not being controlled by humans) in an off-world production/trading strategy challenge. Whoever ends the game with the most cash and assets is declared the winner!\n\nThe game is played on a fixed screen hex grid of land cells with a central town in the middle. There is a river meandering through the land that changes the properties of the land cells. There are various types of land which each produce different amounts of items such as food, energy, ore, materials or rare material. The items are necessary to expand and survive!", "videos": [{"id": 55662, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dnpZWcQkm9w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnpZWcQkm9w", "title": "Space Moguls Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dnpZWcQkm9w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
