There are slight changes to the overall game flow; namely, lateral movement speed is constant when the D-Pad is held left or right (most Puyo Puyo games increase movement speed when the joystick/D-Pad is held), and there is also a notable delay when the player fully offsets Nuisance Puyo. Visually, the game replaces Puyo with the Gundam franchise's iconic mascot, Haro.\n\nThe game features single-player, multiplayer, and Endless modes. The single-player mode is an AI gauntlet akin to most Puyo Puyo games, with cutscenes featuring Mobile Suit Gundam's most iconic characters; there are multiple potential scenes for each character matchup that encourage repeated playthroughs. In Endless mode, players attempt to match Puyo until they are defeated while fending off periodic garbage attacks.\n\nThe game places a heavy emphasis on \"chain phrases,\" the vocal clips that play when characters make chains. In Haro no Puyo Puyo, each character's phrases are fully customizable, with several phrases unlocking whenever the player clears the single-player mode. The player can also choose to either make the character restart their chain phrases with each new chain sequence (as in most other Puyo Puyo games), or loop. (For example, if the player made a 5-chain, the next chain sequence would start with the 6-chain phrase.)", "summary": "Gundam-flavored Puyo Puyo.\n\nKidou Gekidan Haro Ichiza: Haro no Puyo Puyo is a Puyo Puyo game based on the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise, the original TV series in particular. Puyos are replaced by Haros, and several Gundam characters are playable. The game features a story mode, a verses mode, and a survival mode where random characters throw garbage Haros into the player's field.\n\nWhenever a chain is completed, the chosen character will shout a famous phrase from the anime series; the game provides a large number of phrases that can be assigned to each character by the player.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kidou-gekidan-haro-ichiza-haro-no-puyo-puyo", "videos": [{"id": 91037, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fwt9bcWcaxk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwt9bcWcaxk", "title": "Game Boy Advance - Kidou Gekidan Haro Ichiza - Haro no Puyo Puyo \u00a9 2005 Bandai - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fwt9bcWcaxk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
