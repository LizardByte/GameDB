It is a unique combination of the two modes of play, and has an in-depth and interesting story-line which has not yet been used in WWII computer games \u2013 the greatest civilian Uprising against Nazi occupying forces \u2013 the Warsaw Uprising. It is a story of the Silent Shadows - forerunners of modern day special forces - paratroopers dropped behind enemy lines to organize resistance and use diversionary tactics in the fight against the forces of the Third Reich. An appropriate audio-visual setting combined with cover system (an excellent, proven method of game play), the story-line, and diverse settings ensure a dynamic and enjoyable game not only for players familiar with this type of theme, but also those merely wanting casual entertainment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/uprising44-the-silent-shadows", "videos": [{"id": 13650, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6WzvcpU9Zls", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WzvcpU9Zls", "title": "Uprising44: The Silent Shadows - Pre-Order Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6WzvcpU9Zls/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 13651, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "99w-0nGzBKY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99w-0nGzBKY", "title": "Uprising44: The Silent Shadows Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/99w-0nGzBKY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
