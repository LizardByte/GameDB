You will be sent down to Dash Island with the sole purpose of liberating the Island and returning peace to the citizens. Your character must make their way through a maze with the objective of reaching the end, while avoiding enemies. The level will reset if the enemies catch you! Some levels will be timed and some will require you to activate switches throughout the maze. \n- Fast & Fluid game-play, no boring tutorials, start playing within seconds. \n- Play in 2 bonus modes: Run Around collecting Pysankas (Little Eggs) while keeping your head up for enemies on your tail. Up the ante with the creatively named \"hard mode\" where the faster (angrier) enemies come out to play.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dash-island"}
