Its flagship feature is the Jump Pad, an Engineer building that allows taking to the skies. The Anti-Aircraft Cannon was designed for Heavy to swat enemies out of the air, while the Twin Barrel affords Pyro greater mobility. The Brick gives Scout a hard-hitting projectile, while the Heavy gains Chekhov's Punch and the Pyro gains the Harvester - both weapons that store critical hits for later. Finally, L'escampette gives the Spy an alternate watch, allowing for easier escapes.\n\nThe update also introduces the Arena map Floodgate, the Four-Team King of the Hill map Frigid, the Payload map Jinn, the Four-Team Medieval Mode map Krepost, and the new Territorial Domination game mode with the map Caper.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/team-fortress-2-classic-fight-or-flight"}
