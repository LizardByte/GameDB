Gates were one-way trips to random destinations, often taking one far across the galaxy. No-one knew a new gate's ultimate destination until it was finished and the first journey undertaken.\n\nGatestriders, a nomadic colony of humanity, took pride in gate travel and the discovery of new areas of space. When resource rich planets were discovered, they would send Reaper teams to terraform the planet and mine its wealth for fortune and glory.\n\nOne such foray inadvertently led them into a region of space deemed forbidden by the reclusive, yet powerful, Enshigi.\n\nThe retaliation was swift, and ruthless. Within a week the Gatestriders lost their homeworld, their star sent nova by the Enshigi.\n\nThe shattered society took to finding a new home for themselves. It was during this search that they came across the planet Em-8ER. This was where they encountered the Tsi-Hu: sentient, shapeshifting aliens who command huge creatures, known as Kaiju, into battle. This was how the war started.", "summary": "What is EM-8ER? (pronounced Ember):\n\nEM-8ER is a multiplayer, open world, co-op shooter that pits players against a ruthless, shape-shifting, alien army called the Tsi-Hu. The game is a simulated war where massive battles ebb and flow across the planets surface. Hundreds of players will be fighting at any given time in skirmishes involving mechs, giant monsters, and military bases. EM-8ER combines high action, 1st and 3rd person shooting with crafting and RTS-like elements in a vast open world. We call this genre: Massive Planetary Wargame.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/em-8er", "videos": [{"id": 45549, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xQ2Nlf54kuY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ2Nlf54kuY", "title": "Em8ER First Playable Achieved!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xQ2Nlf54kuY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 45550, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "KStbrb3JIDU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KStbrb3JIDU", "title": "Em8ER Introduces Crodus, Kaiju PRIME!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KStbrb3JIDU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 45551, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "dHHWN7YQ_-Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHHWN7YQ_-Q", "title": "Em8ER Update - Multiplayer & Dropships!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dHHWN7YQ_-Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 45552, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "73LLh97pNo0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73LLh97pNo0", "title": "Em8ER - $250 PC + New Hair = 60fps", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/73LLh97pNo0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
