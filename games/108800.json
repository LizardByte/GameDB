The places in Skyrim, creatures, monsters, actions, they are all there but with limitation on how you can interact with them and in what capacity. \n \nThe player initially starts with level 1 character. While traveling Skyrim many characters will ask for player's help. Whether their possessions have been stolen by the bandits, or some dangerous monster burnt down their village and whatnot. The player can accept each of the quests, or simply refuse and keep on going. By accepting the quest, the story will lead you to retrieve some item and face the next villain. The story will constantly let you choose your path by asking you which path you wish to take, more dangerous but quicker one, or safer but longer one. Player's journey will stop the moment an opponent (a bandit, a monster, enemy soldier, a dragon, etc.) blocks the way ahead. In that moment, the battle commences. There are three types of attack; using a weapon (sword, mace, or any other equipped weapon), shouting the dragon tongue, or casting a spell. There is no weapon, shout or spell selection, instead, the player character uses what he has equipped or what best serves the purpose at hand. At the end of each quest there will be a boss battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 41375, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BQl3T0uD5Aw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQl3T0uD5Aw", "title": "Skyrim Very Special Edition Amazon Alexa Trailer - E3 2018", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BQl3T0uD5Aw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
