Yes it appears that Warren was tinkering with a sequel to his smash hit Adventure in his spare time while working at The Learning Company which he founded in 1980 after leaving Atari. It\u2019s unknown if Atari actually ordered a sequel or if Warren was doing this on his own and hoping to sell it to Atari.
