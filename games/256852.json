The maps were converted to use vanilla resources only (except for the sky).\n\nE2M5-E2M9 however are brand new levels for this release. The wad is tested to be vanilla compatible, though during mapping it has mainly been tested with ZDoom for convenience's sake. Also found to work with Eternity. But as it is vanilla compatible, any port should work.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/back-to-basics"}
