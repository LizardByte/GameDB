They were two peas in a pod, always competing against each other, seeing who could create better stories. However, as they grew older, their thoughts and mindset slowly started differing more and more from each other. In the end, Aisa moved with her family to Tokyo.\n\nThe now separated Aisa and Toshiki would still send letters to each other, talking about their current lives and, of course, sending each other stories for the other to read. However, once the prospect of entering high school drew ever so closer, the letters from Aisa all but disappeared.\n\nNonetheless, Toshiki continued writing stories, making doujin games and eventually, he would debut with his first commercial light novel.\n\nAnd while the cultivation of his creative prowess was growing steadily, he hit a slump half a year ago. And so, he postulated that perhaps spending time with similarly aged creators would help him break free of his slump. Steeling himself, Toshiki enrolled in Saika Private Academy, a school designed for creators to gather in one space.\n\nWith that, spring rolls around and Toshiki is in Tokyo, ready to start his new school life. And it is there that he reunites with Aisa once more.", "summary": "Our protagonist, Toshiki Kagami, is headed to Tokyo, where he will begin living with his cousin and her family. Unbeknownst to others, he harbors a desire within himself.\n\nHe wants to rekindle that creative spark he all but lost now.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sousaku-kanojo-no-renai-koushiki"}
