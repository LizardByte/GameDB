{"id": "4YMJHK8p1S0", "snippet": {"title": "Tomb Raider 3: The Lost Artifact - Shakespeare Cliff (Level 3) [Walkthrough]", "description": "Minor does a walkthrough of Tomb Raider 3: The Lost Artifact, the expansion pack to the third Tomb Raider game that came out in 2000, exclusively on the PC. This game follows Lara Croft from where Tomb Raider III left off. Immediately following the mad Dr. Willard's demise, Lara Croft discovers his billfold. Inside is a cryptic telegram urging him to return to Scotland immediately to take delivery of a fifth meteorite artifact. Lara sets out to retrieve the stone, rumoured to be the legendary Hand of Rathmore, following a trail that takes her from Willard's subterranean laboratory to the Paris Catacombs for a hazardous reunion.\n\nThis is level 3, Shakespeare Cliff, where you evade the many gauntlets that Willard has set out in his lair.\n\nThis walkthrough will show you where all the secrets are, where all the pick-ups are, and where to kill all the enemies by only using pistols, or harpoons in underwater sections. Essentially, a 100% completion walkthrough.\n\nI used Stella's Walkthroughs as a guide on how to complete this level.
