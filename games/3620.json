Unlike the character-specific endings of the Nintendo 64 game, the PlayStation game features two separate stories, one for each faction, that generally leave things roughly back where they started by the time is all said and done.\n\nMaximal story\nThe Maximals are jostled as the Axalon comes under Predacon fire. As their shields begin failing, Cheetor is itching to take the attackers down, though Rattrap points out doing so alone will only lead to him getting scrapped. Optimus Primal, however, sees an opportunity and formulates a plan: he and a team of Maximals will defeat the attackers, pursue them back to their base, and take advantage of their weakened state to reclaim the Golden Disk. Cheetor, Silverbolt and a begrudging Rattrap join Primal's team while Rhinox stays behind to provide support and guard the ship.\n\nPrimal and his team then repel the four attacking Predacons, chasing them back to their ship. Defeating Megatron on the bridge of the Darkside, Primal waxes poetic about the nobility of their heroic motivations as Rattrap flaunts the Golden Disk now in their possession. With the other Predacons out of commission and the Predacon computer disabled, the battle seems won, but Megatron laughs and reveals the remaining Predacons have successfully infiltrated the Axalon during the Maximals' absence. As Megatron flies off, Optimus orders the others to hurry back to base.\n\nPredacon story\nAs Megatron greets \"another glorious Predacon day\", he confirms his latest plan with Tarantulas: lure the Maximals to the Darkside, beat them mercilessly until they're forced to retreat, then follow them back to their base to finish them. The rest of the Predacons are largely on board, but Rampage remains skeptical until being forcibly persuaded by Megatron. As a group of Maximals take the bait and arrive at the Darkside, Blackarachnia and Waspinator leave to lure the rest out of the Axalon.\n\nMegatron then leads a team consisting of Rampage, Tarantulas, Quickstrike and himself, beating back Optimus Primal's team across the planet, all the way back to their ship. After taking down Primal on the Axalon's bridge, Megatron and his team gloat, mocking Primal's claims that he's not done yet. Before they can finish him, Rhinox appears and activates Sentinel's auto-guns, catching the Predacons off guard. Their advantage having been lost, Megatron swears vengeance as Rampage blows a hole in the wall and they make their escape.\n\nCharacters", "summary": "Now, experience a Transformers battle you've never seen before!
