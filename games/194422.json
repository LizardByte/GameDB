In a hyperspace subdimension far removed from Einsteinian physics, you must hold back a flood of vicious aliens and their hostile technologies. As you destroy the horde, your score (and multiplier) increases, but so does your enemy's effort to destroy you, as they send new creatures and ships against you: Enemy ships can be docile and aimless, or aggressively fire weapons of their own. Some pursue you when angered, or become more dangerous when killed. Others recklessly explode when activated by a nearby starfighter - can you use this to your advantage?\n\nMore kills means a higher score multiplier, but don't get hit! You'll lose a life and halve your multiplier. Grab powerups to boost Points and Multiplier further, enhance your Laser to cope with the onslaught, or detonate a Bomb to buy a second of breathing space. Score high enough and you might even get an extra life.", "summary": "Chase the high score as you fight wave after wave of enemies intent on your doom!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zzap", "videos": [{"id": 65445, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NmFuH1lZKwQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmFuH1lZKwQ", "title": "Zzap!
