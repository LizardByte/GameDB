It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/singstar-bollywood"}
