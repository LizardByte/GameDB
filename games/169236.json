Each animal is unique and has its own personality and preferences so pay attention to your animal needs and they will give it back to you by becoming the most loyal of friends. You can even teach your pet tricks and train them to enter competitions and unlock rewards & new accessories. Participate also in various activities like exploring your neighborhood to find treasures, visiting the meadow and the dog park or go to the shop to acquire new items. Engage with other pets whist walking your companion so they can make four-legged friends to play with and get advice from other owners on how to raise your puppy well.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-universe-puppies-and-kittens"}
