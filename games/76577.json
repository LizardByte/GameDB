Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October.", "summary": "Based on the film or the same name, you control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-hunt-for-red-october--3", "videos": [{"id": 119733, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "RF4a3zeL4Xo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF4a3zeL4Xo", "title": "NES Longplay [901] The Hunt for Red October", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RF4a3zeL4Xo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
