Stairs descend on a 38 degree angle for 13 steps before reaching a platform of approximately 3 meters in diameter. Descent direction rotates 180 degrees at each platform. The design of SCP-087 limits subjects to a visual range of approximately 1.5 flights. A light source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-087, as there are no lighting fixtures or windows present. Lighting sources brighter than 75 watts have shown to be ineffective, as SCP-087 seems to absorb excess light.\n\nAt this time, it is unknown if SCP-087 has an endpoint.", "summary": "An SCP-087 remake, which involves a seemingly endless set of descending stairs.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scp-087-b--1", "videos": [{"id": 86241, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fP7BiTvr6UI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP7BiTvr6UI", "title": "[ONE OF THE BEST] SCP 087-B - Full Walkthrough Gameplay (ENDING)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fP7BiTvr6UI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
