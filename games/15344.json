Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine. \n \nThere are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games. \n \nEach planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/powerdrome"}
