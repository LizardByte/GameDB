Each stick has a fire button mounted on the top. The players fly in simulated jets around the screen, engaging in a dogfight and attempting to score hits on their opponent within a limited amount of time. When a player is hit, their plane spins around and an explosion is heard. After a few seconds, the plane recovers, pointing at a random direction.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jet-fighter"}
