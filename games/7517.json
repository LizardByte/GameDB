Based on the fantasy film Labyrinth, it tasks the player with navigating a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers. The player's goal is to find and defeat the main antagonist, Jareth, within 13 real-time hours. Unlike other adventure games of the period, Labyrinth does not feature a command-line interface. Instead, the player uses two scrolling \"word wheel\" menus on the screen to construct basic sentences.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/labyrinth-the-computer-game"}
