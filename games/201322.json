It is a unique entry in the series, exclusive to the console, and implements many elements not seen in most other installments of the franchise.\n\nThe game was entirely developed by Virgin Interactive, with no involvement from Techn\u014ds other than its licensing; as such, it implements many aspects not seen in most other installments of the Double Dragon franchise, such as the ability to use firearms. Furthermore, in contrast to the gameplay style and aesthetics already established by previous games, the Game Gear version takes a unique approach that is more similar to other beat 'em ups, such as the Streets of Rage series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dragon--7"}
