Then we tried the Vive. \n\nThe new Fantastic Contraption has been designed from the ground up to be a room-scale VR game. Imagine walking around a grassy island floating in the sky making a contraption the size of a horse with your hands then watching it roll out into the world. It's a VR experience you and your friends will play for hours. \n\nFantastic Contraption will be at PAX on show in Vive demo rooms. \n\nFor press inquiries write us at FantasticContraption@gmail.com\n\nDeveloped by:\nNorthway Games - http://northwaygames.com/\nRadial Games - http://radialgames.com/\n\nVideo by:\nWorkshop Media - http://workshopmedia.ca/\n\nMusic by:\nA Shell in the Pit - http://www.ashellinthepit.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14lkK6ckDXc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14lkK6ckDXc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14lkK6ckDXc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14lkK6ckDXc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/14lkK6ckDXc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fantastic Contraption Teaser", "description": "Fantastic Contraption was originally a building game made way back in 2008.
