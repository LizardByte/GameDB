Update was a class update for the Demoman and the Soldier. It was the second multi-class patch, and was the sixth major content pack released.\n\nThe WAR! Update differed from previous updates by including two competitions, operating inside and outside the game. The first was announced at the start of the update; a kill tracker appeared in the HUD of anybody playing as a Demoman or Soldier, with the counter increasing each time they (as a Soldier) killed an enemy Demoman or they (as a Demoman) killed an enemy Soldier. The personal totals of each player were added to a mass tally, and with each day of the update a running total score for each side was displayed on the update page. The Soldier won with 6,406,065 total kills to the Demoman's 6,372,979, granting the Soldier the prize of an extra unlockable weapon, the Gunboats.\n\nThe second competition was the Propaganda Contest. Users were encouraged to design propaganda posters for the side of their choice, supporting either the BLU Soldier or RED Demoman. The posters were then submitted to Valve to be judged through the Propaganda Contest website. The three leading prizes were later revealed to be J.Axer's Dapper Topper, Amber's Rad As All Hell Hat, and Uncle Sam (for first, second, and third place respectively).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/team-fortress-2-war-update"}
