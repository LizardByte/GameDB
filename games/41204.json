The parts must be collected in the correct order. Whenever a part is found, a new transporter destination is unlocked. All parts must be found within a time limit of 15 minutes in order to complete the game.\n\nThe game is a very basic platformer with rather weired controls. You can only shoot or jump while walking. Moreover, you keep walking in one direction until you press the joystick down, which feels very odd in the beginning and makes the game quite hard to play.\n\nClystron was originally released for the C64 and later ported to the Commodore Amiga. Especially the C64 version was lauded for its great music and graphics.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clystron", "videos": [{"id": 100979, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KXs5bMbosNg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXs5bMbosNg", "title": "[C64] Clystron - Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KXs5bMbosNg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
