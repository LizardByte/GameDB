Hordes of terrifying creatures out of our worst nightmares ravaged the Earth, destroying every living thing in sight.\n\nWe few survivors fled underground, desperately searching for the tech and resources to survive - and fight back. To battle the monsters we created an armada of war machines called Mechs.\n\nThanks to ground-breaking replicator tech these Mechs could be generated almost instantly in the battlefield, turning the tide of what seemed to be an unwinnable war. As we pushed back, we used every resource to power our way forward to destroy the Swarm.", "summary": "Mech Armada provides a fresh combination of turn-based tactics, deckbuilding and rogue-likes. You are in command of a team of custom-built Mechs. Push your strategic skills to the limit as you save what's left of the Earth from the Swarm.\n\nYou'll need to plan carefully if you want to overpower the invading Swarm in a series of small tactical battles. Upgrade and build your deck of available Mechs, manage your resources and leverage your territory wisely. Get it wrong and it's game over. Start again with a whole new experience as monsters, maps, resources and rewards are all randomly generated.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mech-armada", "videos": [{"id": 48122, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "y9Ejk65HAco", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Ejk65HAco", "title": "Mech Armada - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y9Ejk65HAco/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 57607, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hZOWUOn56K8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZOWUOn56K8", "title": "Mech Armada - Early Access build stream", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hZOWUOn56K8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 57606, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "QyoCfeIOtmc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyoCfeIOtmc", "title": "Hands on with Mech Armada", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QyoCfeIOtmc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 57608, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "h9bb6Mvx41s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9bb6Mvx41s", "title": "Mech Armada - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9bb6Mvx41s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
