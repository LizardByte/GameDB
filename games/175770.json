Choose a game, buy it, wait for it to load and voila! It's on your desktop. Everything is almost like in life.\n\nSeveral mini-games are waiting for you, which will definitely not let you get bored, and will challenge you to a new record.\n\nIn Platform Hero you have to literally survive using a grappling hook and a firearm, clinging to platforms. But this will not last long: the hook does not hold up, and the platform keeps dropping. It's time to catch on to another, but no matter how it is: the enemy is moving towards the hero. It's time to use your weapon.\n\nAnother mini-game in the space network is Planetoids . The goal is the same - to get points, simultaneously destroying asteroids. Here you have complete control over the ship, and the asteroids themselves are split into pieces, which can be caught game over once again.\n\nDino Island - a runner in which you play as a dinosaur. You have to jump over stones and trees and periodically turn into a pterodactyl, also flying around obstacles.", "summary": "A.S.T.R.A. - a game made in 2D hand-drawn graphics, which is a collection of various mini-games in different genres.
