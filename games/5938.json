MotoGP 3 is based off the 2002 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, but with the introduction of four stroke bikes, the gameplay has some slight differences. The new 990cc 4-stroke bikes are faster, but tend to be a bit of a handful while the 500cc 2-strokes are less faster but slightly better to handle.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/motogp-3"}
