The land is crying for help. As one of the Devoters, you must restore peace and return hope to the hearts of ordinary folk. While investigating many hideous crimes, you will also have to make some grueling choices that will inevitably affect the whole country.\n\nOn December 31, 999 AD, Pope Sylvester II, an infamous blasphemer, who received his post by beating the Devil at dice, solemnly celebrated the last Mass. The bell rhythmically tolled the last moments of mankind before Judgment Day. \"Our Father in heaven, save and protect us, sinners, from the infernal flames and the hellhounds that bared their fangs to tear our souls.\" It didn't help. The end of the world came right on schedule and showed no mercy.\n\nOnly a fortunate few escaped the cataclysm on a remote and unknown island. This community spawned the first Pastor, the hierarch under whose wise government the new state grew and flourished with time.\n\nEventually, some new Pastors arrived, and with them changed the flock. Society was adjusted until the handmade paradise was stricken with the deafening thunderclap - a murder! Then another, and another. At the same time, arsons, cattle rustling, and robberies. Gradually, the darkness superseded the sunlight.\n\nLambs grew weary of being laid under a hatchet, so they cried and crawled to their Pastor, begging the Father to deal with the flayers hurriedly and restore order. Thus, the Devoters appeared, the hope and support of ordinary people, their defenders, and protectors bringing a silver lining into the hearts tormented by injustices.\n\nThere is no cold fierce enough, no heat hot enough, no storm or hurricane deadly sufficient to stop the Devoters from fighting the wicked with seething zeal and ready swords. They live for the sake of their people. And for the sake of their people, they would die. This is their story, unveiled and unadorned, precisely as the Pastorate chroniclers told it over many generations.\n\n\"First, love dies. Then hope is gone. There's only one thing immortal \u2014 faith. Faith will stay alive and roam the Earth forever, even after the last human's breath. The stones and the wind will treasure it until new souls come, ready for His words, eager to let them in. Thus spoke the Pastor. And our faith grew stronger.\"", "summary": "Knowing neither sleep, rest, nor gratitude, Devoters carry out an immense service for the benefit of the people they once had sworn to protect. The Devoters' only reward is another saved life, they are willing and ready to die for it.\n\nProject Pastorate is a visual novel set in the land of crime and sin that needs to be cleansed. Such tasks are taken up by the Devoters, the special service whose main purpose is to preserve the safety of the country, and the Pastor \u2014 leader of this post-apocalyptic community. While investigating the most hideous crimes you will have to make some grueling choices that will inevitably affect the whole country.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-pastorate", "videos": [{"id": 74390, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GnOMmF1xK5w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnOMmF1xK5w", "title": "Project Pastorate | Visual Novel Card Battler In A Dystopian World", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GnOMmF1xK5w/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 5425, "name": "Project Pastorate"}]}
