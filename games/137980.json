The farmers of Lourdes were poor, and the king was ruthless. Their only hope was a prophecy from long ago. As said by Saint D'Allones, \"a child will be born with light. During a time of great evil, that child will set out on a journey to cleanse Lourdes of its grief.\n\nThis year was terrible. It was truly astonishing; crops were destroyed due to extreme weather, and tyranny reigned since the crown prince became consul. Then one day, as Christ walked in despair through the destroyed land, he was suddenly wrapped in a bright light and received a divine revelation.\n\n\"Christ, my child. Save those who are suffering. I will give you a holy staff. Cast on them the light of love. However, you must never fight.\"\n\nAfter the light went out, a staff was left for him. Christ took the staff in his left hand and began to walk the path towards a cruel salvation.", "summary": "People are suffering, waiting for a helping hand. Christ, only you can save them.
