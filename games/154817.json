Each virus starts contained to a single cell. The player virus can only be controlled by splitting its numbers evenly between two cells, by clicking and dragging from one to another. Each cell slowly generates new viruses for the player who controls it.\n\nEach color of virus has different stats:\n\nSpeed - how far the virus moves with each contraction of its muscles.\nAgility - how often the virus contracts.\nStrength - how effective the virus is at eliminating enemy viruses. Viruses of equal strength trade 1 for 1 when attacking a cell, with stronger viruses seeing better odds.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phage-wars"}
