Life is not kind to you, and your prospects are certainly not looking good. You're a metalhead, a member of a \"different\" thinking group, listening to \"different\" kind of music, a member of a rebellious subculture, who always has a slightly different opinion on things than society expects. In many ways, of course, you are the same as everyone else. You want to live a normal life, as much as possible, and you want to have fun. But in this world? You realize that your life might not be very long, so you want to go to one last concert of a famous metal band. The problem is, it's in another city not too close by, and you'd need a functioning vehicle to cross the wasteland. Maybe a partner wouldn't hurt either. So you decide to get to that concert, no matter what, and move mountains to get there.", "summary": "You are playing a metalhead in a post-apocalyptic point&click adventure game. Your wish is to go to one last metal concert, because who knows what tomorrow will bring. But to do that you need to create the conditions in the form of some equipment and a car.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/im-a-rocker"}
