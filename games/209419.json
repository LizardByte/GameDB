Instead of hitting directly your opponents, you attempt to crush or hurl them off-screen by throwing pieces of the level.\n\nSince the procedurally generated layout of the battlefield is being continuously altered, opportunities to shine but also to die can occur at any time. To survive you must think and react fast.\n\nEvery character got their own moveset and abilities, so that any battle to come will deliver for sure its share of unexpected outcomes and crazy comebacks. Indeed, the game is actually providing a lot of space to set up creative strategies, tricks and traps.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ninza", "videos": [{"id": 71845, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "lEOGyQVhe5c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEOGyQVhe5c", "title": "Ninza beta: Butterfly version out NOW! - Frantic platformer fighting game -", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lEOGyQVhe5c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
