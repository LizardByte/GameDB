Suddenly and mysteriously the planet stopped spinning. Volcanoes awoke and oceans moved. Kingdoms and civilizations were buried or drowned. Soon, the scourging sun took hold of one side of the world, while dark winter seized the other. Today the glory and might of the old world is buried and the only habitable region can be found in between.\nThe evidence of Umbra\u2019s past lies scattered about as ruins, treasures and artifacts. In the new world, rebuilt but far from as advanced as the old one, archaeologists and scavengers supply the rich and powerful with ancient technology and magical artifacts exhumed from ice, sea and sand. It is a world divided by those who dabble in magic and those who tinker with technology.\nYou start off as Amon, an audacious scavenger from a small desert town, who gets embroiled in a treacherous conflict between the mighty Suvian Empire and those who want to bring Suvia down.\nYour quest for peace will take you to the corners of the world to unlock the secrets of Umbra\u2019s mysterious, catastrophic past. Along the way you\u2019ll explore oceans, vast deserts and snow-buried lands, rebuild your island base, gather seeds to sow and harvest ammo, get more allies to join your quest, crack puzzles and overcome fierce monsters.", "summary": "An original turn-based role-playing game set in a world of machines and magic, a world that stopped spinning thousands of years ago.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/earthlock-festival-of-magic", "videos": [{"id": 90427, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RT2SY8WeLGQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT2SY8WeLGQ", "title": "EARTHLOCK: Festival of Magic - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RT2SY8WeLGQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
