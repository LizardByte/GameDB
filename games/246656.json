As opposed to the first game, overworld occupies the majority of the screen, and towns can be physically explored in a top-down fashion. Another change is elimination of random enemy encounters in favor of enemies visibly roaming the overworld. Characters can now join the protagonist and participate in battles. Battles are viewed from first-person perspective (with large enemy portraits) and feature simple turn-based mechanics.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mugen-no-shinzou-ii", "videos": [{"id": 88329, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "f-xcB7AqLCI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-xcB7AqLCI", "title": "Mugen no Shinzou II THE PRINCE OF THE DARKNESS Disks2 Program scebario disk FUJITSU FM 7 NEW FM 77AV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f-xcB7AqLCI/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 7287, "name": "Mugen no Shinzou"}]}
