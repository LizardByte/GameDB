Set in a haunted mansion on Huckleberry Hill, players control a character tasked with eliminating ghosts by consuming dots in a maze. The game supports both single and simultaneous two-player modes, pitting players against four increasingly aggressive ghosts across 15 pre-designed levels and a random level generator. Ghost Hunter introduces innovative features such as an \"instant-hide\" ability, allowing players to temporarily vanish to evade ghosts once per life. Additionally, players can collect character fragments scattered throughout the maze to earn extra lives. With its familiar maze-navigation gameplay, power pellets for ghost vulnerability, and progressive difficulty, Ghost Hunter offers a fresh take on the beloved arcade classic while adding its own supernatural twist.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ghost-hunter--5", "videos": [{"id": 131529, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1YvBVFY3m8g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YvBVFY3m8g", "title": "Ghost Hunter (1981)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1YvBVFY3m8g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
