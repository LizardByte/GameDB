The game is based on the player(s) trying to destroy a medallion which possesses great power. Many of the bosses use the medallion as a weapon. At the end, it shows that an evil man who pilots a ship called the \"Stranger\" is the real person who is in control of the Medallion, and was responsible for the war, as well as other conflicts in the past including World War II, and you fight him three times as a mini-boss and as the last boss. He appears to be a friend of Stuck 30 years ago when you fight him with Stuck. There are four different characters in the game: Sinnosuke, Ruby, Isha, and Stuck; and each of them has their own individual storyline. Players can also do team play mode that has two characters at once, creating a new storyline. In each storyline, there are two endings. In the bad ending, the character the player uses will sacrifice their life in a kamikaze attack that destroys the Medallion. In team up mode, generally one of the character does this, but sometimes both characters survive. In the good endings for either solo or team play, the characters do not sacrifice themselves.", "summary": "Vertically scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Takumi Corporation and published by Capcom on their CPS-2 arcade system board and ported later that year to the Dreamcast console.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/giga-wing", "videos": [{"id": 14113, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "j56eUNx4sZk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j56eUNx4sZk", "title": "Arcade Longplay [392] Gigawing", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j56eUNx4sZk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14114, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZAr_4BYj-7s"}], "collections": [{"id": 1236, "name": "Giga Wing"}]}
