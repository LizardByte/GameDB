Guided by the spirit of her deceased mentor, she navigates a divided world, forging bonds and uncovering secrets that redefine the meaning of family. Experience an emotionally charged adventure where every decision shapes Inayah's destiny.\n\nINAYAH \u2013 Live After Gods takes place in massive, self-sufficient towers called arcologies, constructed on a post-apocalyptic Earth by an alien race known as the Forerunners. The Forerunners, defeated in an interstellar war, sought refuge on Earth to rebuild their forces and exact revenge using humanity, their ancient creation. However, they arrived to find a ravaged world. Undeterred, the Forerunners built the arcologies, resurrected humanity through cloning, and created a haven within the towers.\u200b\n\nDriven by their need for an army, the Forerunners accelerated human evolution through mutations and cybernetic enhancements, transforming them into \"super soldiers.\" This plan, however, was doomed to fail. The fleeing Forerunners carried a virus from their enemies, a plague that ravaged their bodies and turned them into monstrous \"statues.\" In a desperate bid for survival, one Forerunner created hybrid offspring from human and Forerunner DNA. INAYAH herself is one such hybrid. These hybrids, along with pure humans, remained immune to the devastating virus.\u200b\n\nFive centuries later, humanity has fragmented into tribes within the arcology, clinging to survival and viewing the Forerunners' advanced technology as magic. Their attempts to harness this power has led to the arcology's deterioration. Some tribes revere the Forerunners as gods, worshiping their \"statues,\" while others fear their return and prepare for conflict. The game's events unfold against this backdrop of tribal strife, brutal customs, and bloody rituals within the confines of the crumbling arcology.", "summary": "INAYAH - Life After Gods is a thrilling action-platformer with metroidvania elements.
