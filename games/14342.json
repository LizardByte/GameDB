Although the basic story of the game remains true to the original release, this iteration features a first-person perspective instead of the side-scrolling gameplay of the original game. The gameplay can be compared to the popular Doom game released the same year.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bram-stokers-dracula--3", "videos": [{"id": 15708, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "hmW4V9qq_vs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmW4V9qq_vs", "title": "Bram Stoker's Dracula gameplay (PC Game, 1993)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hmW4V9qq_vs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
