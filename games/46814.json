The cabinet consists of a 13-inch video screen seated above an elevated horizontal pinball game, and the combination fits into roughly the same size space as an upright arcade machine.\n\nThe development of Baby Pac-Man was not authorized by Namco. It was designed and released entirely by Bally-Midway (as were Pac-Man Plus, Jr. Pac-Man, and Professor Pac-Man), which eventually led to Namco canceling its relationship with Bally-Midway. 7,000 units were produced.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/baby-pac-man", "collections": [{"id": 2095, "name": "Pac-Man"}]}
