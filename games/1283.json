Your surreal journey will twist even the sharpest of minds. Traveling through a vast weirdly beautiful terrain, you must concoct potions, cast spells and lure the help of some very bizarre inhabitants to uncover the secrets that doom Kyrandia.\n\nCrafty Kyrandian veterans from the first Fables & Fiends adventure, The Legend of Kyrandia, may recognize their favorite land of giant frogs, talking trees and really strange berries. But this isn't just the same old Kyrandia! Challenging puzzles, new characters, and lots of self-conscious wisecracks from our heroine make Hand of Fate more challenging than it's predecessor.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-kyrandia-2-the-hand-of-fate", "videos": [{"id": 136377, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1um4RPvn2q4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1um4RPvn2q4", "title": "The Legend of Kyrandia 2 : Hand of Fate - video game loop demo PC MS-DOS, 1993", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1um4RPvn2q4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
