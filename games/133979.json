It's a quick, simple, stressful, high-score shooter designed to be played between other, more substantial games. \n \nEach enemy starts with a unique behaviour (they can shoot, weave, or orbit) and they each leave a different coloured ink on the playfield. When another enemy crosses this ink later it will learn the behaviours of those that went before! \nThe more ink, the more difficult the game becomes!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/central-limit-theorem", "videos": [{"id": 36058, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "Lw2SghgC-Co", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw2SghgC-Co", "title": "Central Limit Theorem - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lw2SghgC-Co/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
