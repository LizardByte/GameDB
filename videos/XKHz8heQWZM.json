It follows the same story of the book, where Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of symbology, is called to the Louvre museum in Paris, to investigate a murder. The victim is the museum's curator, Jacques Sauni\u00e8re, who has left a series of cryptic clues that Langdon and DCPJ cryptographer Sophie Neveu must decipher in order to uncover a secret that could shake the foundations of Christianity. As Langdon and Neveu follow the clues, they find themselves embroiled in a dangerous conspiracy involving the Priory of Sion, the Knights Templar, and a search for the Holy Grail. They must solve the puzzles and outwit their adversaries to uncover the truth and prevent a devastating revelation from being exposed.\n\n===== Mods Used =====\n\u2022 dgVoodoo2 (by Dege): http://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/dgVoodoo2/\n\u2022 Widescreen Fix (by Automaniak and me): https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/2443-the-da-vinci-code-widescreen-fix/\n\u2022 Higher Quality Music: https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/2522-the-da-vinci-code-higher-quality-music-and-ambience-xbox/\n\n===== Game Info =====\n\u2022 Developer: The Collective, Inc.\n\u2022 Publisher: 2K Games\n\u2022 Initial release date: May 19, 2006\n\u2022 Platforms: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox\n\u2022 Themes: History, Europe, Renaissance, Middle Ages, Mystery\n\u2022 Genres: Action-adventure, Puzzle, Stealth\n\u2022 Engine: Slayer (DirectX 8.1)\n\n===== Walkthrough Info =====\n\u2022 Platform: Microsoft Windows\n\u2022 Difficulty: Hard\n\u2022 Recording: Bandicam\n\u2022 Editing: VEGAS Pro 19\n\n===== Additional Info =====\n\u2022 Plot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code_(video_game)#Plot\n\u2022 Essential improvements: https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code\n\n===== Timestamps =====\n00:00:00 - Logo Intros\n00:00:41 - Intro Movie\n00:01:53 - Main Menu\n00:02:17 - Mission 1: Louvre Museum\n00:50:37 - Mission 2: Saint Sulpice\n01:33:04 - Mission 3: Normandy Mansion\n02:01:18 - Mission 4: Bank of Zurich\n02:36:38 - Mission 5: Chateau Villette\n03:10:00 - Mission 6: Biggin Hill Airfield\n03:34:17 - Mission 7: Temple Church\n04:26:34 - Mission 8: Westminster Abbey\n05:12:31 - Mission 9: Rosslyn Chapel\n05:36:35 - Outro Movie\n05:37:37 - Credits\n\n#thedavincicode #2kgames #alphayellow #walkthrough #longplay #adventuregames #adventuregame #puzzlegames #actionadventuregames #licensedgames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKHz8heQWZM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKHz8heQWZM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKHz8heQWZM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKHz8heQWZM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKHz8heQWZM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Da Vinci Code - Full Game Walkthrough", "description": "The Da Vinci Code is a third-person action-adventure puzzle video game developed by The Collective, Inc. and published by 2K Games, originally released in May 2006.
