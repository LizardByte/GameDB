Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos. \n \nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity\u2019s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny. \n \nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy. \n \nTake the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion \u2013 a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion", "videos": [{"id": 4004, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RMUWzMV7wH0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMUWzMV7wH0", "title": "Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RMUWzMV7wH0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
