It is a posthuman being, which means it has a computer brain. Each time Flick makes a backup of its mind to free up space, Flick forgets parts of its life. Flick wanders the universe in order to document unknown parts of the cosmos, but what it really wants is to find a friend. It has been centuries since Flick has talked to anyone! One day, when an unknown bug attacks its operative system, Flick falls to the ground in what appears to be a tiny, tiny planet. There, Flick meets a nameless robot that swears it's not alive, and enrolls it in a strange scavenger hunt to (literally) make a friend.", "summary": "%s, Computer Love is a narrative-focused adventure game.
