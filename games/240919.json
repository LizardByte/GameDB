This time the challenge is to remember a picture list and not their position. First, you memorize all the images of fast food and then you match the cards in your kitchen. A fun game to help improve the concentration of children and adults.\nThe game is easy at first, but the difficulty increases with time as the customer will order more meals in your restaurant. The ingredients are chosen randomly, so you will get a new list for each new game even if you choose to play constantly at the same level.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burger-memory-game"}
