The weather was so lovely, and the pilot of the small plane was a hot girl named Tonya, who expressed a clear interest in Lee. Everything was going so great until the situation turned into a total disaster\u2026\n\nAnd, suddenly, there\u2019s no more sky, no plane, no hot pilot girl, just the deserted beach, pain, and thirst.\n\nInstead of a calm and cushy job in the hotel, Lee will have no other option than to learn how to survive. The so-called island paradise appears to be no safe place at all. It quickly turns out that Lee is not alone on the island. But he still needs to find out what the creatures (animals or beasts) that frighten him with scary sounds at night are. He would also have to find out \u2014 what happened to Tonya, if she\u2019s still alive, and if there is any way to escape this strange island.", "summary": "In Tame It! you end up stranded on a tropical island, with the many challenges ahead, as well as hot but dangerous creatures.
