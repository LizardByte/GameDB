Throughout 16 different missions (and 1 extra bonus) in Metro City, you try to achieve various goals like keeping property damage to a minimum or capturing a specific criminal in real time. The game lets you command an increasing amount of pre-selected units and use them to achieve your goals as you see fit. The civilians respond to your actions directly, where capturing a criminal will make them happy and assaulting an unproven suspect will create rioters.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/riot-police"}
