This action-shooting game was released in 1985.\n\nThe player takes control of the hyper dual-armor \"THEXDER,\" which can transform into both robot and fighter forms, and throws himself into the battle to destroy the magnetic field generator of the asteroid Nediam. The game is played in side-view and consists of 16 stages (plus 16 back stages).\n\nIn the battle against the enemy, you can use either the robot form, which has a tracking laser but inferior mobility, or the fighter form, which can only attack in the direction you are going but has superior mobility, depending on the situation. Barriers are also available, but if they are used too often, they will run out of energy, so they should be used only when the situation calls for it! You should use them only when you need them.\n\nThe game is based on the life system with no save function, so you only have one shot each time you play! The difficulty level of the game is high, so if you are good at it, please give it a try.\n\nThis is a masterpiece that has been carefully crafted with a world view, excellent mecha design, and smooth animation during transformation, not to mention the addictive nature that makes you want to play it over and over again despite its difficulty.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eggconsole-thexder-pc-8801mkiisr", "videos": [{"id": 105102, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "L4el7U7s52A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4el7U7s52A", "title": "EGG\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb \u30c6\u30b0\u30b6\u30fc PC-8801mkIISR for Nintendo Switch\uff08EGGCONSOLE THEXDER PC-8801mkIISR\uff09", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L4el7U7s52A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
