She infiltrates Umbrella Corporation's headquarters in Paris, where she is captured and knocked out. When she comes to, she finds herself in a prison on a remote island. Freed by a friendly guard, Claire faces several problems. Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire's ordeals.", "summary": "Resident Evil Code: Veronica is the fourth video game in Capcom's Resident Evil survival horror series. The game continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, it is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles showing protagonists, monsters and rooms from different spooky viewpoints.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-code-veronica", "videos": [{"id": 88183, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zWRlfGuCL-Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWRlfGuCL-Q", "title": "Trailer Time: Resident Evil Code: Veronica ( Dreamcast, 2001)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zWRlfGuCL-Q/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88184, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gtG_z7ufEaA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtG_z7ufEaA", "title": "Longplay of Resident Evil - Code: Veronica", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gtG_z7ufEaA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
