Bushido is a 2D, side view, fighting game. As a skilled martial arts expert, you must face and overcome unending hordes of swarming ninjas and other enemies armed with various types of weaponry such as katanas and throwing stars. You're armed with nothing but your fists and feet but, through years of hard effort, you've trained yourself to use them as deadly weapons.\r\n\r\nOne solid punch or kick will normally kill a ninja but these opponents are armed with weapons that can also kill you with one hit. Through years of training, you've also developed some of the techniques of the cat and, therefore, have five lives to use before losing the game. Starting from a courtyard, you progress through a series of different background stages as you defeat your enemies.\r\n\r\nAs a martial arts expert, you can perform acrobatic jumps and rolls to quickly cover distance or evade enemy attacks. Bushido utilizes the keyboard number pad for movement and action. To enter punch or kick mode as opposed to movement mode, you must first press the F2 or F4 keys respectively. Once in these modes, pressing a number pad key causes your character to punch or kick in the appropriate direction. Return to movement mode is accomplished by pressing the F1 or F3 keys.\r\nIf anyone can confirm if the controls below here are correctly, comment and let me know.\r\nF3 - mode of action (jumping, walking)\r\nF4 - mode fight\r\nmode of action\r\nnum 8 jump\r\nnum 2 sit down\r\nnum 4 to the left\r\nnum 6 right\r\nmode fight\r\nnum 8 kick jump\r\nnum 2 kick sitting\r\n\r\nEmulator and Recorder: D-Fend Reloaded (a GUI for DosBox) with a built-in AVI Recording\r\nEditor: Virtual Dub\r\nEncoder: Avisynth + MeGui", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AgvYHO4EiS4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AgvYHO4EiS4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AgvYHO4EiS4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "DOS Game: Bushido (1983 Ebenel Enterprises)", "description": "A fighting game for dos game.
