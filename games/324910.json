The Arcade has currently never been officially ported to consoles or on PC, thus the game is rare. However, in February 2014, it was unofficially ported to PC (Windows XP & 7) by a group of talented fans known as Insert More Coins (more details here), although setting up the game may be difficult as it can only run on monitors that support 640x480 resolution and is apparently not Windows 10-compatible.\n\nOn Sept 2015, another fan known as Biffman 101 re-published the port on their blog and following a conversation with an anonymous commenter, in 2019, a Windows 10 compatible version was emerged and published, on their blog post (The Collection Chamber - SILENT HILL: THE ARCADE).", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/silent-hill-the-arcade--1"}
