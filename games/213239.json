Sonic arrives to reinvigorate the world and perhaps still be able to fight back the evil Doctor and hopefully somehow get back to his own time.\n\nThe GBA version was a revival of the cancelled PC version. While the GBA version is \"finished\", it was a rush job, more for the sake of filling the gap of the previous version's incomplete status, and did not completely honor all aspects of the original story.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-epoch-advance"}
