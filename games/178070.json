That is, however, until recently...\n\nThree attacks in the last ten days - families murdered, each time. It's a tragedy they never thought possible, not in their town, and they respond in the only way they can come up with: they don't.\n\nBut the danger still lurks, and not all of us are so keen on the idea of waiting out this crisis till it passes - or worse, till we're all dead.\n\nThere's a killer out there. And whoever they are, they will strike again.\n\nSo... who's stupid enough to take this mystery on?\n\nAt the heart of Penthos is its cast of characters. Throughout the story, you'll come to learn their perspectives and backgrounds - and perhaps even some of their struggles.\n\nAgnes (she/her), an ordinary wallflower, is roped into a local murder investigation by her paranoid friend Byrne (he/him). With the whole town under the mystery's spell, it's up to them to figure out what's truly hiding behind their hometown's small mountain values. But this vigilante behavior doesn't sit right with the rest of the group - fashionista Yumi (she/her), angry inch Axel (they/them), and stoner Guro (he/him) - and as the situation unfolds, this increasing tension will drive them to find out more about themselves and their friendship.", "summary": "Penthos is a full-length kinetic narrative experience, featuring limited voice acting and original music.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/penthos", "videos": [{"id": 57186, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tsSfDpvGc34", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsSfDpvGc34", "title": "PENTHOS - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tsSfDpvGc34/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
