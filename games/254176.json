It was released worldwide on December 23, 2019 and is available in four languages: English, Indonesian, Thai, and Traditional Chinese.\n\nThe game is hosted on Facebook's servers, either on the website or the app. In-game, players take turns placing down Pok\u00e9mon artwork to build a tower. The game ends when one person knocks over one of the Pok\u00e9mon on the tower, prompting the other as the winner. In addition, a Pok\u00e9mon can be switched out for another with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, which can be acquired by watching advertisements. There also are Ultra Balls, which have the chance to hold rare Pok\u00e9mon, and Master Balls, which guarantee a rare Pok\u00e9mon on use. These can also be obtained by watching ads, though are distributed randomly by watching videos in a row.\n\nThe game keeps track of the highest stack a player has built, allowing them to share it online through Facebook if they so choose. The game also has ranked seasons, allowing users to gain rewards through ranks by continuously playing the game before the season ends and said rank is reset.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-tower-battle"}
