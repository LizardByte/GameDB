This port is infamous for its protracted development, as it was originally announced as a HuCard for the PC Engine SuperGrafx in 1990 before undergoing various format changes, ultimately being released as a CD-ROM game for the Arcade Card add-on in late 1994. Its most noticeable changes are new animated cutscenes, arranged Red Book-quality soundtrack, and an optional bonus mission between the first and second stages, set in a desert. Otherwise, the game plays similar to the coin-op. The new cutscenes appear to have inspired the later Strider 2, as both games use similar wireframe maps for their stage introductions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/strider-hiryuu"}
