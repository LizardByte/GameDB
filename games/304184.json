It contains 56 levels and features work by more than 60 different contributors, created over the months of April and May 2018 in two phases, with the first consisting of collaborative work on levels like the previous iterations (labeled KAWAIII) and a latter phase focused on the creation of custom boss fights (labeled KIMOIII), which later were merged into a single project. The level pack was initially released on August 17th, 2019, and is specially notable for bringing about the last patch of its current version of SRB2, v2.1.25, that catered to PolyObject bugs and a further expansion in the number of freeslots.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kimokawaiii"}
