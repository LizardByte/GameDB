The gameplay is similar to its predecessor; it is confined to large-scale strategic battles, in which the player commands different types of units, in an attempt to reach the enemy base, protect his own, and exterminate all enemy units. Like in the first game, the units have distinct strengths and weaknesses, as well as attack range. The game includes even more various types of units, including the traditional infantry, rocket launchers (mobile and stationary), different kinds of tanks, planes, helicopters, etc. The plot is more elaborate than in the first game, and the cut-scenes between the battles typically include more plot-related information. Scenes with nudity and mild sexual content are kept intact.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/foxy-2"}
