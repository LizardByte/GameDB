In this game you play as an actual Goomba, in order to fulfill his quest to hunt eggs hidden around few areas. Unlike in Thwomp's Easter Egg Hunt, there are no star descriptions in this mini-hack, and it employs a non-stop system, which means Goomba does not get kicked out of a level after getting an Easter Egg.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/goombas-easter-egg-hunt", "videos": [{"id": 37571, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "MidJIP0u8BY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MidJIP0u8BY", "title": "Goomba's Easter Egg Hunt - Easter Special!
