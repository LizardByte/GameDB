Old Village Simulator will take you back in time to mid sixties, so you can sit behind the wheel of vintage tractors and harvesters.\n\nYou'll also participate in many unique events to see, who's the fastest in ploughing and seeding the field, baling straw, harvesting wheat or mowing grass. There are even tractor races! But you have to pay attention - older machines required much more precission and skill from their operators."}
