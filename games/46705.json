{"id": 46705, "name": "BattleStar", "slug": "battlestar", "summary": "On Monthly Disk Presents: Battlestar is a competent PC version of popular Battleship board game -- no more, no less. The game replaces the ships with nice-looking spaceships, but otherwise the gameplay remains identical: try to correctly guess the locations of the opposite player's five spaceships before your ships are discovered and destroyed. You can play against the computer or another human player, and the computer's AI is not half bad.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battlestar"}
