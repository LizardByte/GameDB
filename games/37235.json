There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.\n\nThe game was initially released for the Amiga and Atari ST computers in the beginning of 1990.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/supremacy-your-will-be-done"}
