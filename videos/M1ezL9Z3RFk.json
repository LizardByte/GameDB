Will you be able to reach the moon?\n\nDiscover Jumperino: an easy to learn but hard to master platformer where every jump matters. Plan your jumps carefully: a slight mistake can get you all the way down. Practice makes perfect! Try different jump angles and power, experiment and discover new worlds. There's only one possible way: up! Master the gameplay and you'll master the Moon!\n\nFACE DIFFERENT WORLDS\nAs you go up, you\u2019ll start discovering new worlds, each one with its own style and mechanics. On top of that, all levels in Jumperino are handcrafted. No random generation, no content fillers, nothing but a carefully crafted and always increasing difficulty curve.\n\nREWIND YOUR FALLS\nDid your last jump mess everything up? Use the UNDO button to undo your falls. If you fall from very far up or if you just don\u2019t feel like repeating that last jump, you can just undo your last move and go back in time, just as if you had never fallen!\n\nFACE EVEN MORE HARDCORE LEVELS\nAlong the climb, you\u2019ll discover dark portals. Risk entering them and you\u2019ll get teleported to mini worlds where you\u2019ll face extreme experiences. There, the real challenge awaits. If you get stuck, you will always be able to exit them and come back later, but beating them will be more than worth it!\n\nADAPT YOUR PLAYSTYLE\nAre you getting stuck too often? Are you one jump away but it\u2019s never enough? Try the different BOOSTS to help you along the way! They won\u2019t last forever, but they can for sure be handy.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? The Moon is up there!
