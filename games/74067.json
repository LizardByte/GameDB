Shortly thereafter, Kyouji is found dead under suspicious circumstances. The protagonist is then trapped inside of a warehouse and murdered by a deranged killer named Sid. Rather than stay dead, the player finds himself in the reanimated body of the slain Kyouji, and escapes from the morgue. With the help of Kyouji's voice, which guides the player from inside his head, the main character joins up with Kyouji's female partner Rei in order to save the life of his girlfriend, who is still in danger.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 47909, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3il18gogB04", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3il18gogB04", "title": "Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner Sony PSP Trailer - PS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3il18gogB04/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
