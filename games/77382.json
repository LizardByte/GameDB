Each level has an extensive amount of variations that can be defined precisely or left to chance. With a variety of weapons, including colts, a shotgun and a machine gun, you have to sweep the levels before getting killed or running out of time. Weapons reloads happen both manually or automatically. \n \nThe gameplay is spiced up with innocent civilians wandering about, hidden and special targets and parachutes with bonuses. These bonus objects include multipliers, sticks of dynamite, extra time, slowdown, bonus scores or new weapons. Sometimes, when shooting a parachute, a focus event is started, a small action sequence with different gameplay: \nArmageddon: Wipe out swarms of enemies with your machine gun \n \nDuel: One bullet, one enemy playing dead. Be the first to shoot before he stands upright completely. \n \nHit 'em All: Make successive shots to increase your multiplier. If you miss or hit a civilian, the multiplier is reset. \n \nHit 'em Hard: The targets require multiple hits to disappear. \n \nSniper Time: A single enemy is hiding in a group of civilians. Shoot him before he vanishes. \nYou can replace in-game targets with your own pictures and the best highscores are saved on the internet.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smoking-guns-shooting-gallery"}
