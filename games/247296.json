It was developed by Gamtec. It was released by BIC and likely Gamtec or a related company in other countries.\n\nIn 1993 a Mega Drive version of the game was released by Songtly and Jumbo. On the box this version is called L\u00f3ng X\u00edng Ti\u0101n Xi\u00e0, on its title screen it is just called L\u00f3ng, and on a splash screen that appears when the game is booted up, it is called Link Dragon. This version features new music and a music test option.\n\nA Gameboy version was also released. This version appears most similar to the Mega Drive version. In an early build of the game found on Vast Fame's multicarts it is called L\u00f3ng X\u00edng Ti\u0101n Xi\u00e0 on the title screen. It would later on be published by Gowin as Gu\u0101 Gu\u0101 Hu\u01d2 L\u00f3ng. In situations where an English name is displayed it is referred to as Fire Dragon. This version features the same music as the Mega Drive version, but lacks a music test option.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-dragon"}
