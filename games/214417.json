It is the greatest virtual game show on the planet, with a large, global fan base, and considered a window to a bigger world outside of the real one - known as the Meatspace.\n\nVirtual reality is where most people spend their time, and THE FINALS allows them to join as contestants to play in hyper-realistic arenas and fight for fame, money, and the favor of generous seasonal Sponsors. Both THE FINALS and the showrunners appear to be overseen by MultiCo, a company with origins dating back to the 1980s.\n\nRecently, THE FINALS was hacked by a rogue group known as CNS, who claimed they were taking back what was theirs and changed the game by adding new items, maps and modes. Although their existence was acknowledged by MultiCo and THE FINALS commentators, Scotty and June, CNS true motivations are still unknown.\n\nAfter the CNS take-over, the showrunners brought in cybersecurity experts VAIIYA, to stabilize the game show. During their shutdown attempt, it was revealed that THE FINALS is a sentient AI program capable of defending itself. Under this threat, THE FINALS AI deployed countermeasures that rebooted the system into a different time and era in the 1500s.\n\nWhile the system appeared to stabilize, the introduction of Terminal Attack was received poorly, forcing MultiCo to send one of their own to meet with the sponsors and set the stage for Season 4. It welcomed back the heart and soul of THE FINALS with Ranked Cashout and a new map that featured sectors dedicated to different sponsors. CNS activities remain unknown, with the exception of a few hidden messages in the Kyoto arena.", "summary": "Join The Finals, the world-famous, free-to-play, combat-centered game show!
