{"id": "VI38BjxXWvc", "snippet": {"title": "Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix - Promotional video (Genki Racing Project) (2005)", "description": "Genki's racing games have typically fallen into the Shutokou Battle series, a collection of late-night racing games that put you on the highways surrounding Tokyo. The company's latest PS2 racer, Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix, maintains many of the same gameplay mechanics that Genki's other games contain, but this time it takes the cars off of the streets and drops them onto proper racetracks.\n\nRacing Battle will contain licensed cars. The version on display only has a handful, including an RX-7, a Supra, an Integra, an Impreza, and an S2000. The car models in the game look decent. They're nice and smooth, but they don't seem to be quite as detailed as the car models in some other comparable racing games.\n\nLike most other racing games, Racing Battle has multiple camera angles. But the first-person angle is pretty interesting. From this view, you get indicators that show how hard you're steering, accelerating, or braking. You also get a second, TV-style camera angle in a small window at the top of the screen. This is cool because it gives you a good idea of what's going on near your car. It's easy to see cars coming up behind you with this view and more effective than a standard rearview mirror.\n\nThe gameplay in Racing Battle is roughly the same as what Genki has done with Shutokou and Kaido Battle series. Each car is associated with a fighting gamelike life meter, and the car in second place constantly loses pieces of its life meter. When one car runs out of \"health,\" the race ends and a winner is declared.\n\nGenki's been making highway racing games for years now, so it's interesting to see the company take the same gameplay concepts in a slightly new direction.\n\nBy ZA-7 | Donations? https://www.paypal.me/ZAz7\n\n**IMPORTANT* If u subscribe to my channel, remember that I upload random content, so, if u like some specific videos, try to support and by that way I'll do more of that u liked**\n\n===========================================\nFollow me!\n\nDonations?: https://www.paypal.me/ZAz7\nDeviantart: https://za-7.deviantart.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZA7Team\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/ZA7Ayume\n===========================================\n\nTags: Racing Battle C1, tokyo, tokyo xtreme racer, series, circuit, grand prix, \u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb -C1 GRAND PRIX-, Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix , sim game, simulator, japan, initial d, eurobeat, showroom, test, pcsx2, ps2, kaido battle, music, race, drift, Promotional video, japan, genki, licensed cars, Shutokou Battle, Genki Racing Project", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VI38BjxXWvc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VI38BjxXWvc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VI38BjxXWvc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VI38BjxXWvc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VI38BjxXWvc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix - Promotional video (Genki Racing Project) (2005)", "description": "Genki's racing games have typically fallen into the Shutokou Battle series, a collection of late-night racing games that put you on the highways surrounding Tokyo.
