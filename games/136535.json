Eight thousand years before Jon Snow took the Black, the Night\u2019s Watch was formed to secure the Wall and defend the border of Westeros against the perils of the North, and all that lies beyond. Into these untamed wilds, sworn brothers and their allies set out on rangings to face the dangers that would threaten the realm. But the Wall is a blade that cuts both ways.", "summary": "Guide the decisions of Lord Commanders through the seasons and mount expeditions beyond the Wall. As ravens travel to and from your expeditions in real time, their messages are delivered to you throughout your day. Respond with your command right away, or whenever you see fit. \n \n \nLong is the history of the Night\u2019s Watch, and many are its stories forgotten. It\u2019s time the realm remembers them."}
