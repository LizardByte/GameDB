Collect eggs for bonus points. Complete levels before the timer runs out for extra bonus points.\n\nFive skill levels cater for casual gamers to arcade gods and everyone in between.\n\nDeveloped by an Ex Commodore 64 game designer and pixel artist, Nest Lander is the first game from Clockwork Hippo Games. Bringing back the challenge!\n\n35 levels of skill based, rage inducing, addicting retro arcade gameplay!\n\nTim Ruswick of GDU during a stream. \"Sometimes I forget I'm on a Feedback Friday and I just try to land the bird in the nest.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nest-lander"}
