JODI made the piece by altering the graphics of Quake as well as the software code that makes it work. Their mods reduced the complex graphics of Quake 1 to the bare minimum, aiming for maximum contrast between the complex soundscapes and the minimal visual environment. For the mod 'Arena,' JODI took this principle to the extreme: they completely erased every graphical element of the game, turning monsters, characters and backgrounds all to white. The more psychedelic 'Crl-Space,' the earliest of the set, is not based on a static image. Instead, it features a swirling black-and-white background. The game engine generates this effect as it continuously tries, and fails, to visualize the interior of a cube lined with black-and-white wallpaper.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/untitled-game"}
