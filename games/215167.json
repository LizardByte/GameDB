Enemies don\u2019t take more hits then usual, the difficulty lies more in the design.\n\nIt\u2019s much longer because of a bigger overworld which has more caves and bridges. There are longer caves and deeper palaces.\n\nThere are a couple custom changes to gameplay which include enemies that respawn & you can restart at the palace if you game over.\n\nThis romhack will give a feeling like it\u2019s a totally new Zelda II game because none of the design is similar to the original.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zelda-ii-the-nightmare-of-ganon"}
