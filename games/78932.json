Why don't we go investigate?\"\nIn that kind of noncommittal fashion they went to look into it.\n\nAt the shrine Hamura and Kuga were waiting.\nThey weren't really on good terms with those two, they were more like complete strangers.\nWith a quick greeting the investigation started.\n\nThe shrine was pretty old and even though it wasn't locked the door wouldn't open.\nIt seemed like it was rusted shut, when they tried to pry the doors open they quickly crumbled.\nWithin that dirty rubble they saw \"something\".\nAs they blankly gazed at that \"something\" suddenly smoke started pouring out.\n\n\"What if it's poison gas!!\"\n\nWith all their might they threw the \"something\" as far away as they could.\nBut after all that they were still enveloped in the smoke coming from that \"something\".
