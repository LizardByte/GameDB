The maximum speed of the hovercraft increases throughout the game, as your skills improve. What makes this even more challenging is that your reaction time decreases as your speed increases, so hugging the curves of the track gets even more difficult.\n\nAlong the track, you can grab pickups, such as Cloak, Stun, and Shield, that add temporary powers to your vehicle.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-haste", "collections": [{"id": 1889, "name": "Space Haste"}]}
