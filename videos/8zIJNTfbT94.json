In this video, I'll cover topics such as \"What is AltverZ?\" \"How can I download it?\" and many more! Let's get started!\n\nAltverZ is a PvZ2 mod created by me and poss, along with bits of help from people in the modding community, thanks to everyone who's involved!\n\nAltverZ is a revamp mod-- like ECLISE, but aimed to be closer to vanilla, both in terms of balancing and difficulty!\n\nYes, AltverZ is very easy compared to other mods that are floating around right now, and that's a good thing! Because there aren't really mods for casual players or players who just want to enjoy the game without too much thinking (no offense to them, otherwise I wouldn't have made this mod.)\n\nSo, how easy is AltverZ? Well, here's the chart comparing the number of zombies for each wave on the pre-final level of the first world of PvZ1, PvZ2, and AltverZ. As you can see, AltverZ send fewer zombies than in vanilla PvZ2! And we haven't taken plantfood into account yet! That should probably give you a rough idea of how AltverZ difficulty's like.\n\nHowever, we do plan on making the levels harder as the player progress, but it won't be as quickly and/or abrupt as ECLISE, pinky promise.\n\nCurrently, AltverZ has 3 worlds, with 20 levels, 8 plants, and 1 upgrade for each world, we'll be adding more contents in further updates, but currently, I want this project to be known to the public first.\n\nAlright, and that's AltverZ! If you still have any questions, feels free to join AltverZ discord server for more information! Link's in the description.\n\nNext, how do you download AltverZ?\nWell, the download link's in the description, and the installation method is exactly the same as ECLISE's! You can refer to ECLISE installation guide by goodpea2, I'll put the link in the description also, but if you have installed the latest version of ECLISE before, then it should be the exact same! The ONLY difference is that, ECLISE's OBB folder is \"com.ea.game.pvz2_ecl\", while AltverZ's is \"com.ea.game.pvz2_auz\". So, when naming the folder, be sure to enter the right one!\n\nAnd that should cover up most things I want to tell about AltverZ, but I'll also answer some questions you \"might\" have too!\n\nQ1: Can I install AltverZ when I already have ECLISE/other mods?\nA1: Yes, you can!\n\nQ2: Can I do a gameplay video of this mod?\nA2: Sure, no problem!\n\nQ3: Would you stream AltverZ?\nA3: I will, but it won't be soon, because I want people to experience the mod by themselves first!\n\nQ4: I'm a veteran PvZ player, would AltverZ be too easy and boring for me?\nQ4: Not really, because technically, you can add your own twist to your playthrough by giving yourself a challenge! Try completing levels without plantfood or with 5 slots or less! Further levels in each world also can be quite tough, so don't ignore this mod just because it's made for casuals!\n\nQ5: I think you should add [...]/I'd like to propose [...]\nA5: If you can any suggestions, feel free to suggest them in the AltverZ discord server! I'll take as many suggestions as I can!\n\nQ6: Why did you make a trailer like this instead of the exciting, fast-paced one like you did with ECLISE's trailer?\nA6: For that, it's because AltverZ is too close to vanilla, if I just make a trailer composing of just multiple in-game footages, it'd look like a trailer for vanilla PvZ2, also, I did community post teasers earlier, so I already show some in-game screenshots, I don't want to show people the same thing over again.\n\nAnd that's about it for this video! Again, if you have any questions/problems, ask them in the AltverZ discord server! I hope you'll enjoy this mod and this video! This is technically my first scripted video, so if it feels weird, big apologies.\n\nBefore we go, I'll show the gameplay of AltverZ's tutorial levels, which are remade, so you'll have a better understanding of how AltverZ's like! There's also one more thing that I want to show: dialogues! I've spent so much time on them and I hope that they won't be skipped...\nBut anyway, here's the gameplay! End the video now if you don't want to get spoiled!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItsP struggling to talk for 7 minutes and 15 seconds: https://youtu.be/FUcbzv9nzOg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8zIJNTfbT94/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8zIJNTfbT94/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8zIJNTfbT94/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8zIJNTfbT94/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8zIJNTfbT94/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Plants vs. Zombies 2: Alternate UniverZ release trailer", "description": "AltverZ is out!\n\nDownload link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ckXFy-1cv7Ka0eCxOXMweHWb_atzOc1z?usp=sharing\n\nECLISE installation guide (same installation method): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIj1hIgB6nc\n\nAltverZ Discord server: https://discord.gg/ee5dUt5\n\nSunflower Nation Discord server: https://discord.gg/FBasnrE\n\nHave fun!\n\nThe video's script: Hello and welcome to Plants vs. Zombies 2 Alternate UniverZ trailer!
