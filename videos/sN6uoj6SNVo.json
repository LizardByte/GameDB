It is some sort of Space Invaders variation, in which instead of shooting space invaders, the player has to shoot Sid the Spellbinder, a giant segmented snake. Sid comes snaking down the screen and the player has to shoot its segments before it reaches the openings at the lower sides of the screen. The player starts with 30 missiles (20 in skill level 2) and scores in an arithmetic progression: one point for the first segment, two for the second, three for the third and so on, up to 10. If the player's score is below 200, Sid will align its remaining segments together whenever it goes off the screen. If the player's score is 200 or more, the gaps will remain making it harder to the player to shoot Sid. If Sid gets into those openings, it will eat the missiles in the reserve. Sid eats five missiles for each of its segments left when it enters the opening.\n\nIf the player hits all of Sid's segments, or if Sid gets to the lower end of the screen and leaves the player with some missiles after eating, the game changes into a spelling game. The computer will speak a word and the player has to type it in. Each round has 3 words to be spelled and the player has two chances to spell each word. The player earns 10 missiles (5 in skill level 2) for each word spelled correctly.
