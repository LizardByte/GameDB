The dungeons are labyrinthine and are full of traps to avoid, monsters to battle and puzzles to solve. Boulders can be moved to trap nasties and to block arrow shooting walls. There are some monsters which cannot be killed by Sir Merdimek's arrows, though they are vulnerable to other things, and there are wizards who can raise the dead. Sir Merdimek can ride rivers to secret rooms and use teleporters which may lead more hidden treasures.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-dungeons-of-grimlor-ii"}
