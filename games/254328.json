Armed with the Poltergust 5000, a ghost-sucking, vacuum-like invention, Luigi must complete a number of missions assigned to him by Professor E. Gadd.\n\nShining a light on the ghosts is no longer enough to stun them into immobility. Players need to activate a new strobe function to stun the ghosts before sucking them up with the Poltergust 5000.\n\nEvery mansion is filled with unique puzzle elements and ghosts. Players must figure out how to defeat each one of them and find hidden clues and keys to unlock new areas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/luigis-mansion-dark-moon", "videos": [{"id": 92447, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dFd3qyr5v3Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFd3qyr5v3Y", "title": "Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon - Switch Teaser Trailer | Nintendo Direct 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dFd3qyr5v3Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
