{"id": "-vEftNmrHNI", "snippet": {"title": "Wild Card [\u30ef\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9] Game Sample - WonderSwan Color", "description": "Original Air Date: July 01st, 2009\n\nAnother day, another video or two or three or... who knows? Anyway, while Squaresoft made numerous ports of their popular titles to the WonderSwan, they did make a few original games as well, and Wild Card, like many Squaresoft titles, is not short of the nuances that make many Square games popular nor is it short of innovations. However, this game is clearly one of a love/hate nature.\n\nDo you like games that give you complete control of your characters? Do you like the SaGa series and its free-roaming ways? Did you hate games like Unlimited SaGa where luck played as much of a factor as skill? If you answered yes to any of those, then you'll want to keep your distance from this one.\n\nWild Card is all about the luck of the draw, and just about everything is done in card-style. The characters are in cards, you make decisions with cards, you travel with cards, even the amount of time you spend in towns can be attributed to a deck of cards (you have limited town time). Not only that, but you have a wide margin between success and failure. The game is more about accepting quests and finding secrets than actual storytelling, so the game is story-lite. The gameplay is simple enough to grasp but it does offer some degree of flexibility.\n\nStarting the game, you answer a questionnaire that determines who your main character will be. From there, you can go to town to take up quests and get characters, who appear at different locations at random. Different characters have different skill cards that allow them to do different things. Some characters also share skill cards but have more efficiency in using them. Some characters are good at running, some are good with magic cards, and some even have special map cards that allow them to do activities like jump and swim.\n\nThe hard part is surviving. The odds aren't typically in your favor and you'll have to out-last some missions simply by running away a lot in order to survive. As you clear missions, you can build a character's deck with better cards. Enjoy.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-vEftNmrHNI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-vEftNmrHNI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-vEftNmrHNI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Wild Card [\u30ef\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9] Game Sample - WonderSwan Color", "description": "Original Air Date: July 01st, 2009\n\nAnother day, another video or two or three or... who knows?
