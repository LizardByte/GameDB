A complete virtual-reality system meant for arcades, utilizing twin head-mounted vector monitors of the type used in games such as Battlezone, Tempest and Star Wars. \n \nSadly, funding for the project dried up before it reached completion, and the first game for the system - VekWars - never saw the light of day, continuing to exist only in rumor and a handful of blurry photographs from the period. \n \nWelcome to the year 2385. Humanity is locked in a deadly war with the evil Xilorian Empire. The key to winning this war lies in the unique properties of Vektrox Ore. Found on only one planet in the galaxy, human mining colonies are under constant attack by invading Xilorian forces.", "summary": "A sci-fi shooter with old-fashioned vector graphics designed for VR.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vekwars", "videos": [{"id": 46968, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nW4J06UOlXM"}]}
