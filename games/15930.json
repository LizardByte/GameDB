Crush evil, spread the truth.\n\nIt is said that each generation, upon reaching a certain age, all boys of the Susuharai family leave home and become independent. Then, relying only on themselves, they train body and soul until they are accepted as adults. And so I prepared myself for this day, learning a great many things so I'd be ready to live on my own.\n\nSusuda Prefectoral High School. My new school. Originally, I planned to enter in first year rather than transfer in second year. Life at school is carefree, and even pleasant. Everyone has a great time in class 2-A. There's just... her, Toe Kurokami. \"Weird\" doesn't begin to describe her. Always holding that Japanese doll against her chest, never letting go for a second. Some whisper it is a cursed doll, whose hair grows when no one is looking. But it's just an uncanny doll, with nothing special about it. Yet, perhaps my meeting that girl was fate...
