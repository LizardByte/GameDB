Light casts you in the role of a man with no memory. After waking up in a strange yet familiar location it\u2019s clear that something\u2019s very, very wrong. Who are you? Where are you? Perhaps most of all, what happened to you? As the protagonist in Light you must use stealth and cunning to navigate around a wonderfully minimalistic-looking environment. Can you succeed in your quest and thwart a plan on a global scale?\n\nDon\u2019t just avoid detection, use subterfuge as well. Hack computer terminals to disable security cameras, lock and unlock doors and more. Collect data, fragmented e-mails, memos and scientific reports to slowly piece together the story of Light.\n\nLight combines unique game mechanics, atmospheric visuals and a gripping narrative to breathe new life into a much loved genre. Combat is your last option and technology your first, can you evade capture and solve the mystery? Do you have what it takes to step out of the shadows and into the Light?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/light", "videos": [{"id": 9440, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jsqVLa1yy1M"}]}
