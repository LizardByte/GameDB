{"id": "KBKKAaDxpt0", "snippet": {"title": "[PREVIEW] PS1 - Black Matrix 00 (HD, 60FPS)", "description": "This is first 15 minutes of Black Matrix 00 for Playstation.\n\nIf you like and enjoy our video you can buy us a coffee.\nhttps://ko-fi.com/kawaiigames\nDONATIONS: https://streamlabs.com/kawaiigamesie\n\nBlack Matrix is a series of tactical role-playing games developed by Flight Plan and published by Interchannel. All titles in the series are Japan-exclusive.\n\nEach installment in the series combines standard tactical RPG gameplay with a pastiche of Judeo-Christian religious themes, particularly concerning the nature of good and evil and the interplay between Heaven, Hell, and Earth and the denizens thereof. One title was considered for North American release in 1999, and it is believed that it was eventually passed over due to its disturbing religion-derived themes.\n\nIn a world where angels, devils, and humanity are locked in battle, Black Matrix 00 focuses on a young man who is searching for his kidnapped childhood friend. Black Matrix 00 begins with a mute man being adopted by a woman who nurses him back to health from some traumatic experience. This differs from a Harlequin romance in several ways. There is the matter of the man having white wings and the woman having black wings: in this world black winged people are dominant. The black winged people also pay more than lip service to Satan. As expected in a world where Satan is omnipresent, love is a Bad Thing and once the woman admits to having feelings for the man, they are forcibly separated and the man meets up with allies in prison. Then a number of Biblical allusions are run through in the course of a battle against the oppressive forces of Satan (though figuring them out from the Japanese may take some effort).\n\nBlack Matrix 00 is set in the same fictional world as the original Black/Matrix game, though hundreds of years prior. Three divisions of humankind share the same world - white-winged people who are called angels, black-winged people who are called devils, and wingless people. Those who have wings have great powers and pay little mind to the wingless ones. The angels rule the world via a religious organization called the Prodevon Church, which ensures both the cooperation and ignorance of the wingless people.
