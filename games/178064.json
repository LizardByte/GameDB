Aginah and the hero travel to the Sanctuary at the foot of the mountain, but Zelda follows, claiming she had another prophetic dream, this time of her holding the Book of Mudora on top of Death Mountain. Zelda insists on traveling with the hero to the summit of the mountain, as she is the only one who can read the Book of Mudora. During their quest to obtain the final two tablets and reach the summit, the Fortune Teller sees the King of Evil in a vision. Ganon's malice had kept his spirit alive despite the destruction of his body. It was this lingering evil power that had drawn the Hero of Light into the land of Hyrule, and upon the summit the hero travels once more into another world to engage in a desperate final battle with the Demon King in a new version of Ganon's Tower. Ganon desires the power of the Hero of Light to be fully reborn, but is finally destroyed using the Silver Arrows once more.", "summary": "The fourth part (week) of BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-zelda-no-densetsu-inishie-no-sekiban-dai-4-wa", "videos": [{"id": 57317, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nNei8qtW2Tw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNei8qtW2Tw", "title": "BS\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\u3000\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u77f3\u76e4\u3000\u7b2c4\u8a71", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nNei8qtW2Tw/sddefault.jpg"}]}
