The player takes control of one of 30 comics characters and starts his way to the top.\n\nThe main motivational factor of the game is the tuning garage because every successful race brings money that can be reinvested into better gear or a different look. When the player has enough money he also can buy a new car, with a selection of twenty in total. There are also slight RPG elements because the character's stats improve with every success (the opponent's too). There are three playing modes: time races, checkpoint races and regular races.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/army-racer"}
