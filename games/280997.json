Only through exploration and the assistance of others can you stop the flow of evil into the world. Players will face many dangers in their travels, including horrible beasts like the Maple Goose or the Surly Caveman.\n\nBut the residents of this world are here to help, even if they sometimes need bribing or assistance themselves. If players can decipher the engaging puzzles, like which sandwich a guard might prefer as a random example, a world of possibilities will be revealed!\n\nThe game features 95 locations to explore, a plethora of enemies to battle, and a user interface developed specifically for the Rainbow 100 computer. Running in the Rainbow's rarely (possibly never?) used 66 column mode, the game caters to one of the most memorable personal computers of the 1980s that nobody actually uses anymore for anything. Developed entirely on an actual Rainbow 100, this game reflects dedication to a never-really-popular platform!
