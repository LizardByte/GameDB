Their are eight teams for you to captain: Los Angeles, New York, Vancouver, Montreal, Edmonton, Minnesota, Toronto and Chicago. You can challenge a friend, or take on a multi-talented computer squad. You can also choose from three difficulty levels - Junior, College and Pro.\nThroughout the game, you'll constantly be tested by every intense element of championship hockey, from Penalty and Overtime Scenes to Knockout Smash-Hit Fight Scenes. Speed, strength, quickness and instinct are talents you must possess if you plan to prevail, especially when the anger flares, gloves come off and fists start flying.\n\nIt's hard hitting action at its toughest. And you'll soon learn that in this league nothing's ever given to you, and before you can reach your goals - you have to score them. You've gotta master the artful skill of a finesse player and the bone crushing brutality of an enforcer. You'd better be versatile as well, because you must skillfully control your forwards, centers, defensemen and even the goalie, who'll defend the net against unrelenting Power Plays (which will occur if you lose a fight and have your battered carcass banned to the Penalty Box).", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blades-of-steel", "videos": [{"id": 99394, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "UQBubqPjxd8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQBubqPjxd8", "title": "Blades of Steel (version T) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UQBubqPjxd8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
