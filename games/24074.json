The main character is a boy allergic towards eggs, and you must get through a lot of challenging levels without getting into contact with eggs, chickens or mean auntie Doris.\n\nAll the games mechanics is based on the character throwing up, and the vomit has unique abilities based on what you eat. For example, you can make the ground icy in order to move faster, sticky in order to climb walls, hot in order to spit flames, make puddles you can swim over, and a lot more.\n\nThe game is a tie-in with the feature film under production by Maipo Film, and both the movie and the game based on the book Eggg by Stein Erik Lunde, will launch fall 2016.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eggggg", "videos": [{"id": 9980, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "yr4Uje8Rfh8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr4Uje8Rfh8", "title": "Eggggg: Sticky puke and other fun stuff", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yr4Uje8Rfh8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
