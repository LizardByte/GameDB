Within, players are able to take a break from the heat of battle to upgrade their Hero Cards and work on clan member relations by visiting the Sanctuary\u2019s many locations \u2013 the Tavern, Inn, Refinery, Practice Arena and Headquarters. The Tavern and Inn are where many heroes can be found participating in their favorite activities, whether they\u2019re spending time with friends or having a relaxing bath in the Hot Springs. As bonds between comrades strengthen, players are rewarded with unique cutscenes at the Sanctuary, providing a deeper insight into each character\u2019s backstory.\n\nStopping by the Refinery lets players enhance, create and sell Hero Cards found on the battlefield. Hero Cards are mystical objects that provide new skills and boost the abilities of the character they\u2019re equipped on. And at the Practice Arena, Warriors can improve their stats by exchanging their hard-earned gold for experience points. Once players feel rejuvenated and ready to get back to the action, they can visit the Headquarters to accept missions for their clan and plot their next course of action on the World Map!\n\nPre-order Links Available Below \nAmazon: http://amzn.to/2oFmBTz \nGameStop: http://bit.ly/2pXEgae \nBB: http://bit.ly/2shfy8F \nEBC: http://bit.ly/2sL16qD", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiSwlprHhcs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiSwlprHhcs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiSwlprHhcs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiSwlprHhcs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiSwlprHhcs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Warriors All-Stars: Shiki Clan", "description": "Warriors All-Stars is coming 8/29 for PC & PS4 #KTfamily #WarriorsAllStars\n\nThe trailer highlights the characters in the Shiki Clan:\n\nYukimura Sanada, Mitsunari Ishida, Naotora Ii from the SAMURAI WARRIORS series\nRyu Hayabusa and Ayane from the NINJA GAIDEN series\nHajime Arima and Darius from Haruka: Beyond the Stream of Time\nWilliam from Nioh\nShiki, the son of the monarch from Warriors All-Stars. \n\nWarriors All-Stars not only features an extensive battle system, but also an abundance of content for players to enjoy outside of combat!
