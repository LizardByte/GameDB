These rays of hope appeared before the Princess manifesting themselves as seven heroes, ready to answer the Princess' call for help. Why did the King abandon his daughter and his people? And why did he steal their ability to speak?", "summary": "Explore, fight, and produce items to grow stronger as seven distinct heroes in this silent world.
