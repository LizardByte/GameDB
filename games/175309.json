What's more, it is a game where the winning depends on your skills and not your luck!\n\nEach match consists of two rounds and the players exchange the cards after the first round. In this way the match result doesn't depend on the luck of the initial draw, but on the strategic skills of the players.\n\nYou may choose between two beautiful sets of cards, with chess and classic theme, displayed in native resolution on devices ranging from iPhone 4S to XS Max and iPad Pro. Gentle sound effects will also enhance your game experience.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chess-cards-mate-unlimited"}
