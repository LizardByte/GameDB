And the number of people who actually earned the title of Gauntlet Knight was even smaller. \nIn other words, it was becoming an era where all existing military forces would be obsolete, and where the military might of the world would be measured by the small number of boys and girls who could use Gauntlets... \n \nAfter competing against each other in the International Battle Standard Festival, a group of Gauntlet Knights from all over the world became fast friends, swearing to support the walls of peace from both sides and prevent another World War from ever occurring. However, World War IV was steadily approaching, like a line of falling dominos... \nThe young are supposed to be the main characters in their own eras. \n \nBut in reality, they're nothing but game pieces lined up on the board of those who are crafty and more experienced. \nMust these boys and girls be forced to kill each other as pieces? \nWho are the pieces, and who are the players? And who does the players' bidding? \nWhat victory conditions does each person have? Is it peace? War? Annihilation? \nIs the foretold tragedy a scheme or a delusion, the future or reality? \nNo. \nThere is no need to resist this tragedy. \nThe job of a game piece is to dance about within the tragedy's grasp. \nWhat are the rules of the game, you ask? How hard is it? That's for us to decide, so it's none of your concern. \nAll you people need to do is take pieces and get taken yourselves, entertaining us with the range of your emotions. \nAre you listening? You don't want to misunderstand your position. \n \nYou aren't my opponent. You're merely a piece that exists for my amusement. \nIn this next game, I won't give you the privilege of being a player! \n \nConfirmed for 4 Phases.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ciconia-when-they-cry", "videos": [{"id": 26695, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kiNSqXGgLTc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiNSqXGgLTc", "title": "\u300c\u30ad\u30b3\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u306a\u304f\u9803\u306b\u300d\u30c6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kiNSqXGgLTc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
