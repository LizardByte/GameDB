The Godkiller - Chapter 1 is designed by Erik Hermansen, creator of Deadly Rooms of Death, and shares that series' top-down turn-based gameplay. Puzzles are variations on Sokoban-like block-pushing gameplay featuring several unusual mechanics (e.g. dying to respawn the player character in a more favourable position). The storyline follows a newly-dead soul contending with God's plans, and features several original songs with vocal performances.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-godkiller-chapter-1", "videos": [{"id": 53396, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iSHxXNwWP8M"}]}
