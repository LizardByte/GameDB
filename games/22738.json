You\u2019ll scavenge for resources and then use those resources to craft your weapons and defenses because when the sun sets, Roguard falls fast asleep leaving you alone to fight back the Deadwood and protect your stone companion. With the right balance of strategy and skill you may just survive the night.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deadwood-the-forgotten-curse"}
