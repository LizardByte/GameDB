Will you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents' identity at any cost, at the price of being a permanent stranger in your home country? Or will you strike out on your own, turning against both your homelands to shape a destiny for yourself? Love is all you need...and also improvised firearms.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 68472, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qrhtj41oAxk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrhtj41oAxk", "title": "Four Horsemen gameplay footage", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qrhtj41oAxk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
