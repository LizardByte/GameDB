A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/7-wonders-duel"}
