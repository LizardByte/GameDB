It\u2019s your job to make sure the resupply H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) is successfully berthed to the International Space Station. But before you can do that you must prepare the ISS for the HTV\u2019s arrival.\n\nMoving in zero-g will be different than what you are used to on Earth. Spend some time flying, flipping, and spinning around the station without gravity to assist you. But be careful, you might get sick! While completing tasks and floating around the International Space Station you will learn about and experience the effects of microgravity on the human body.\n\nThe app contains information on the effects of microgravity on the human body for use in the classroom and at home."}
