Things in the game, custom AI, different tracks(new one just got released), 3 different cars(more coming soon), TimeTrial Mode and Racing Mode against Bots. Local Multiplayer is still on the works and possible coming within the next month. It will also be coming to mobile some time in the future. You can download and test the game for free and don't forget to let me know what you thought of it, it helps a lot with further progress in development.
