The catch? Not every patron orders the same beer, and you'll soon realize that you'll have multiple orders at once! \n \nAs the levels increase, the choice of beer changes, more orders come in, and it can become crazy in no time! To add to the pressure, the customers will only wait so long before they decide to go to a different bar! \n \nTo add to an already addicting good time, Beer Slinger uses voice samples for the patrons, stating the beer type they'd like. \n \nDo you think you have what it takes to be a true Beer Slinger?", "videos": [{"id": 44071, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "XGj7EktWXz8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGj7EktWXz8", "title": "Beerslinger - NES Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XGj7EktWXz8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
