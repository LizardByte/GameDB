Now you're sitting on a ton of hot truck in the desert, racing toward a heat-rippled horizon dotted with sand traps and tire ripping rocks. And you're wishing you brought more water along for the ride... \n \nOff-road racing is a test of speed and survival. First you pick your challenge: The Georgia Mud Fest, The Michigan Winter Wreck-Off, the Death Valley Trek or the Baja Challenge. Then you choose a truck, customize it and stock it with tools. And survival supplies like food and water. Just in case. \n \nThose guys in fancy race suits don't use winches to lift rigs out of mud bogs. They don't change tires punctured by razor sharp cacti. And when it snows - they don't even have to race. In Off-road racing these rough and tumble conditions are all part of the exciting challenge!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}]}
