The Time Attack Mode is based on time trials, and the Free Run Mode allows the user to drive the Shuto Expressway selecting his starting points without racing, and can drive anywhere on the Shuto Expressway. The One Match Mode is made for head-to-head quick games against the characters. Wangan Connection is the online game mode that allows people to create, host and join online games with up to three other players. Through the game's progression, the user can unlock two extra game modes, Survival Mode and Maximum Speed Mode. Survival Mode puts the player up against characters from the series. The goal is to beat a designated amount of rivals without losing. If the player loses, the game is over. Survival Mode is divided into three classes. Rookie has 20 rivals, and runs on the C1. Runner has 50 rivals, and runs on the New Belt Line. Monster has 99 rivals, and runs on the Wangan, part of the New Belt Line, and Yokohane. Maximum Speed Mode is where the player drives a car of his choice on the Yatabe Test Course.
