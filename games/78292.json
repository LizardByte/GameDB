This game allows you to race tiny little toy cars around various oversized environments. Most of the cars resemble super-deformed versions of popular automobiles, but the actual model names are not used. There are dozens of tiny cars to collect.\n\nSome of the tracks in this game appear to be scaled to the size of your racer, others take place in oversized real-world environments, like a house or a garden.\n\nThe usual racing game modes are present, single race, championship, and multi-player. Winning races allows you to purchase upgrades and other vehicles. You can also link this game with Road Trip: Shifting Gears.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 78400, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "bTqOGdrY9fg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTqOGdrY9fg", "title": "Road Trip Arcade Edition Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bTqOGdrY9fg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
