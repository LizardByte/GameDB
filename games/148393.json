Seeking greater power, he discovered the half-genie known as Shera who's power was pure and sent his 40 Thieves to steal her away so to absorb her power. Shera's son, Sarzha, is the only one left who is unaffected by Malice's blight. Armed with only a ring that staves off death, Sarzha marches into Malice's stronghold alone to save his mother - but time is not on his side. Malice's ritual to absorb Shera is nearly complete, and unless Sarzha can reach her in time she will be lost - and Malice will rule the land, forever.", "summary": "A NES Puzzle Platformer from Crazygrouptrio, more commonly known for their Game music arrangements.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shera-and-the-40-thieves", "videos": [{"id": 49582, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "S4NIsZnLcc0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4NIsZnLcc0", "title": "Shera & the 40 Thieves (A New NES Game!)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4NIsZnLcc0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
