Strong Bad is the most heavily affected. However, being unaware of the existence of the tax, he is put under house arrest (with an explosive collar around his neck), a predicament that leads him to unite the citizens to rise up against the authorities. Strong Bad then declares his own plot of land (an empty lot featuring a fence, a spare tire, and a graffiti'd stop sign, which Strong Bad has named \"Strong Badia\") an independent nation. The inspirational speech he gives to the citizens inspires them to create their own independent countries. In order to overthrow the King of Town, Strong Bad must work his way through the countries and unite Free Country USA once again under the Strong Badian flag. Strong Badia the Free's minigame, Math Kickers: Featuring the Algebros, a parody of beat 'em ups such as Double Dragon, involves the player solving math problems by punching enemies. In addition, the game also features a second minigame called Maps & Minions.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episode-2-strong-badia-the-free--1"}
