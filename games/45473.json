It is a 2D beat-'em-up based on the Crows manga series, where characters have super-deformed heads.\nPublished by Athena Co., it appears at first glance heavily inspired by Technos ' own hot-blooded Kunio/Nekketsu beat-'em-ups, going for River City Ransom 's fighting style and super-deformed looks in particular. As it turns out, it's no coincidence; a look at the credits reveals that quite a few former Technos employees worked on it, including executive producer Teruo Ishikawa, the composers, and about half the graphics team. Most notably, the person in charge of the visuals was Kouji Ogata.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crows-the-battle-action-for-sega-saturn"}
