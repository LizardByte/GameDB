They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire.\n\nPetun?little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map. But this is where it all started, where the undercurrent of disdain and hatred overflowed into a bloody torrent of death and destruction, drowning Neverland in war for years to come.\nThis is where our story begins?the story of the Seven Year War.", "summary": "\"Spectral Souls - Resurrection of the Ethereal Empires\" is a Full Size Tactical RPG.\nSimply \"a must have\" for all fans of \"Spectral Souls universe\" and for all fans of Tactical RPGs in general.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spectral-souls--1"}
