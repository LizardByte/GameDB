To say we were delighted by the reception would be an understatement, we were quite frankly blown away! \n\nWe cannot thank each and everyone of you that came to check out Snake Pass enough. With that said, we've been inundated with requests for some more gameplay footage from the game and we've certainly been listening.\n\nWithout further ado, jump in and check out this quick gameplay teaser. We cannot wait to share more with everyone in the near future! \n\nP.S. A huge shout out to the guys on Reddit for helping our first trailer reach a ton more people than we ever expected. You guys rock! \n___________________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\u25bahttp://www.twitter.com/Snake_Pass\nLike us on Facebook\n\u25bahttp://www.facebook.com/SnakePassGame\nVisit us on the web\n\u25bahttp://www.snake-pass.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2YRn8Q3fug/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2YRn8Q3fug/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2YRn8Q3fug/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q2YRn8Q3fug/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Snake Pass - EGX Rezzed April 2016 Gameplay Teaser", "description": "The second gameplay teaser for Snake Pass is here! \n\nIn early April, we attended EGX Rezzed, held at London's Tobacco Dock, to showcase Snake Pass for the very first time.
