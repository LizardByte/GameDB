Hundreds of animations, spectacular humour, full sound-track and a bunny's lair worth of easter eggs make this game a must play!\n\nYou play Charlie Foxtrot, a clone who rebels against conformity. Undertaking an intergalactic quest so that he can assert his autonomy, Charlie travels to strange planets inhabited by dozens of parodied sci-fi characters. The humour is somewhere between Space Quest and Red Dwarf, but the adventure is beyond comparison.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/charlie-foxtrot-and-the-galaxy-of-tomorrow"}
