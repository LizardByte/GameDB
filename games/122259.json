As usual, they drink some beer and play some dice.\n\nThe Dwarf Mechanic invented the game machine featuring all these activities at the same time. The Dwarf King praised this invention and put the machine in his palace.\n\nGet precious gem stones for poker combinations coming from the game machine. The dwarf who obtained most valuable gems after 12 turns gets a beer.\n\nDwarves leave no stone unturned to beat the opponent. Mirrors, x-ray glasses and mushroom sense are at your service. You can cheat only once per game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/7776-ii-dwarven-greed"}
