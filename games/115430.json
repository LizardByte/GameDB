The player explores Hogwarts, and must attend classes which often include a challenge of collecting a certain number of items, such as challenge stars or potion ingredients. This game features the familiar monsters from the other games in the series, such as snails and gnomes. By performing admirably in learning spells and completing missions, Harry can gain extra House Points so that Gryffindor might win the House Cup. If he misbehaves by attacking other students or being caught wandering the halls at night, points will however be deducted.", "videos": [{"id": 53646, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zWeizv-7gdA"}]}
