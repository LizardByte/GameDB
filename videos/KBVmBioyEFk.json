Can Pac-Man rescue Ms. Pac-Man from the evil ghosts in the world's first hack of the Game Boy Lock n' Chase?\n\nAll of the graphics have received a nice Pac-Man style facelift. Including the 4 different types of ghost.\n\nThe 2 doors at your disposal on each maze now stay permanently shut. (They only lasted a few seconds in the original Lock \u2018N Chase.) This adds more strategy to the gameplay. If you trap a ghost inside of these 2 doors you will recieve bonus points. Which also makes the rest of that maze easier. But be sure to not trap yourself\u2026 you will have to restart if you do!\n\nPac-Man (C) Bandai Namco\nMs. Pac-Man (C) AtGames...?\nLock n' Chase (C) G-Mode Corporation\nDownload: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/8055/\n\n#retrogames #retrogaming #dataeast #locknchase #gameboy #gb #gameboygames #pacman #mspacman #pac_man #gbhack #gameboyhack #romhacking #romhack #romhacks", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBVmBioyEFk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBVmBioyEFk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBVmBioyEFk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBVmBioyEFk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBVmBioyEFk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pac-Man Escape - Game Boy Hack Gameplay", "description": "You certainly didn't expect to see a hack for this particular GB game, now did you?\n\nDeveloped by thirtythree, this is a complete reworking of the Game Boy Lock n' Chase into a very fun Pac-Man game called \u201cPac-Man Escape\u201c.
