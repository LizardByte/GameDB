The stage is set in the \"Ritsuhashiin Gakuen\" where everything from the entrance examination to the board members of the student council is decided by a \"lottery.\" With its long history and vast land area, the school offers integrated elementary, junior high and high school education, and the authority of its student council is said to be equal to that of a small country. The main character, Chihiro Enomoto, was chosen by lot as a candidate for the next student council, and he and his partner had to undergo rigorous training and trials in order to become a member of the next student council.\n\nThe main part of the game is a 3D action that goes through an automatically generated dungeon in Ryubashiin Gakuen. If you choose one of your favorite characters before the start of the stage, subcharacters will follow and you will move on to the stage with a total of three people. A partner may initially be in a blunt \"tsun\" state, but regaining a damaged partner can increase his/her popularity, and a \"dere\" state can give him/her an advantage in the progress of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
