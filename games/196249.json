It was made by Jan Van der Veken, Anthony Soto, Nick Baker, and Travers Dunne who also worked on The Darkening series. The Classic Episode is one of the few PWADs that Compet-n allows recording on. Two versions of WAD exist: the original version from 2000, which must be used for Compet-n demos, and version 2.0 released in 2002. Only the latter is uploaded on the idgames archive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 66224, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "YAStSUjpW2o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAStSUjpW2o", "title": "Doom 2: Best of 2000: The Classic Episode - E2M2 - No Commentary", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YAStSUjpW2o/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 66225, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Uplyk6I_Wps", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uplyk6I_Wps", "title": "Doom 2: Best of 2000: The Classic Episode - E2M1 - No Commentary", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uplyk6I_Wps/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
