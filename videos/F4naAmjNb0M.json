I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to meet once again!\n\nThank to all of your love and support, we managed to release VenusBlood HOLLOW International with many improvements, extra features and content!

Gaia was immensely popular when the VB series was first picking up in popularity. We have prepared a variety of goodies and other rewards, and we hope that we can count on all of your support once again!\n\nIn regards to the Kickstarter, it is currently planned for a July 2022 launch.
