Battles are no longer fought by honorable knights loyal to a nation, but by mercenaries who sell their services to the highest bidder.\n\nAs the leader of a mercenary squad, the player will lead their troops across a battle-scarred continent, overcoming obstacles and adversaries as they complete quests doled out by each nation. In doing so, they will unravel the mystery behind the downfall of a mighty empire.\n\nWith an impressive battle system that combines fast-paced action with strategic planning, and featuring robust character creation and customization options, Grand Kingdom is a Tactical RPG the likes of which has never been seen before. Assemble a squad of mercenaries, form an exclusive contract with one of the Four Great Nations, and participate in war with other players online for the future of Resonail.\n\nBut remember- in this new age of war, there is only room for one Grand Kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grand-kingdom", "videos": [{"id": 8107, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9OjlQ2zQ3Ns"}, {"id": 63775, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ikf2kcLiiUs"}, {"id": 63776, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "dq-LypLATxs"}, {"id": 63777, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "iiGsPbHyA5s"}]}
