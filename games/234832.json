It only contains 4 characters drawn in an extremely retro, pixel-art style. Despite the small amount of content, it is pretty infamous for its larger filesize. It contains a full soundtrack and voice acting. The game requires that your computer's locale be set to Japanese in order to play.\n\nLooks can be quite deceiving with Dot Fighters, as it actually contains a fairly complex gameplay system, which is arguably better designed than Arm Joe's. Unfortunately, Takase has retained the same design ethic for Dot Fighter resulting in vastly overpowered characters and moves.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dot-fighters"}
