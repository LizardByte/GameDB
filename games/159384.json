Slash your foes with oversized axes, toast with fireballs hurled from magical wands or turn them into Swiss cheese with a pair of demonic daggers. Dungeon of Crawl is a modern take on classic sub-genre of RPG games - Dungeon Crawlers. Huge replayability is ensured thanks to many player classes, various ways and paths of character progression and equipment setup. Each challenge might require different approach and sometimes jumping straight into battle should be replaced with careful planning your steps. Don't let your guard down and get swarmed with monsters as each horde has a powerful leader who guards region's treasures.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
