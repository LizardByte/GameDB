You will encounter different maps, events, cards, items, etc., and will eventually match a different set of cards to create a unique adventure.\nWhich cards to immolate or use, where a minion to place, all of that means you have plenty choices.\n\nGame Features:\nUnique system -- Original combat system, it is quite different from other card games, and both sides are using cards.\nRoguelike -- Random dungeon world, every adventure is a new exploration.\nDynamic Deck-building -- The initial deck will be gradually strengthened during the adventure, and each adventure will create a different deck.\nAbundant contents -- The current version contains more than 240 cards, more than 70 items, more than 80 monsters, and 3 distinct heroes.\nTough Challenges -- There are 20 difficulty levels that can be challenged, every choice needs to be considered carefully under high difficulty.", "summary": "\"Devil's Deck\" is an Indie Roguelike game based on cards deck building, which has a unique honeycomb map and original battle rules.
