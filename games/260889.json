Each map should take only around 2-5 minutes to finish.\n\nIn addition to the 100 line limit, the other goal was to add variety to the megawad by alternating authorship with each map, combining Ninja's heavy emphasis on challenge and combat mixing with Arsinikk's more experimental maps of Vanilla tricks and exploits.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/100-line-massacre"}
