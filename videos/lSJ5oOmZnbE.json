Harvest resources and construct buildings, then raise an army and order your troops into battle. Search for secret maps and train Dragons to fight on your behalf. With a powerful army at your command, you'll be ready to besiege castles, conquer enemy hordes and drive your foe from the land.\r\n\r\nNote: I never expect to see a real time strategy game on the Gameboy color. Playing this for a while and have to say it's actually a decent game with simple control that isn't hard to pick up (have to as the GameBoy color have 2 buttons and a D-pad).
