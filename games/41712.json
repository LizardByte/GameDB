The gameplay is very similar to the Gradius games, with other aspects from games such as TwinBee. However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games, as well as Japanese culture.\n\nThe player can play as either Tako (father of Takosuke), an octopus, the Penguin (father of Pentarou) from Antarctic Adventure and the exclusive MSX game Penguin Adventure, Goemon from the Ganbare Goemon series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game Knightmare or the Vic Viper spaceship from Gradius.\n\nThe game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional Gradius enemies such as Moai. As with Gradius, the game utilizes a similar selection-bar based power-up system.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/parodius--4", "videos": [{"id": 103371, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CGrpJyLJMbE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGrpJyLJMbE", "title": "[MSX] Parodius - The Octopus Saves the Earth", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CGrpJyLJMbE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
