Work your way around the island\u2019s six neighbourhoods \u2013 from the rust buckets of Betty\u2019s Scrapyard to the spooky shores of Banshee Bay \u2013 challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town. Repair as many cars, trucks, choppers, tractors, mini-subs (and even UFOs) as possible to prove your worth in this hectic race against the clock.\n\nNo two games are the same as you work your way through 30 unique garage levels, each one more challenging than the last. Completing a garage is one thing, but mastering it and beating your best score requires coordination, skill and determination.\n\nOctane Isle is a great place to visit, whether you go solo or bring along your friends. In co-op mode, up to four players work together as a finely-tuned machine, tracking their team\u2019s best scores, unlocking new characters and discovering hidden secrets as they explore Octane Isle together. Or maybe you'll choose to head straight to the Versus Arena, split into teams and decide once and for all which crew truly rules the workshop? Whether you choose co-op or competitive, the action unfolds across local, wireless and online play.\n\nJust about anything can happen on Octane Isle... the faster you work, the more chaos is unleashed. Fuel ignites, tyres explode, robots short-circuit, cows stampede and aliens abduct, but with teamwork, skill - and maybe just a little luck - you'll earn the right to call yourselves a Manic Mechanic!\n\nManic Mechanics is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch and Steam. \n\nFor more information, go to:\nhttp://www.manicmechanics.game\n\nFollow 4J Studios\nhttps://twitter.com/4jstudios\nhttps://facebook.com/4jstudiosltd", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJ4j6NCJeJE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJ4j6NCJeJE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJ4j6NCJeJE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJ4j6NCJeJE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Manic Mechanics | All-Formats Launch Trailer | March 07 2024 | FULL (UK)", "description": "MANIC MECHANICS - CHAOTIC COUCH CO-OP ON PC AND CONSOLES\n\nIt\u2019s time to dust off your overalls and hitch on your toolbelt in Manic Mechanics \u2013 a chaotic couch co-op game where you and up to three fellow grease monkeys pay a visit to the car-obsessed Octane Isle. \n\nYour mission?
