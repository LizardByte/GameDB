To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a video has ever been posted showing any of this game's campaign outside of the first few levels.\n\nThis game was released in 2003 for the Nokia N-Gage platform. It was developed by Monkeystone Games - founded by John Romero and Tom Hall of id Software fame. It was published by THQ Wireless.\n\nI will admit I did have to cheat at 3 separate occasions throughout this playthrough - this game's difficulty level is absolutely crazy given how awful the hit detection and controls are. In two cases, I had to give myself some extra armor, and in one case some extra rockets. I did this by manually editing the savegame files for the game, and it's completely seamless to the viewer. I wanted to get through it 100% legitimately, but after trying these sections each literally over 100 times, I decided to just bite the bullet and edit the savegame files so I could at least show this campaign to the world rather than replay those sections until the end of time.\n\nQuick links:\n* http://RFChat.com - Red Faction community Discord\n* https://factionfiles.com - Red Faction community & custom file archive\n* https://redfactionwiki.com - Red Faction community wiki knowledgebase\n* https://redfaction.help - Red Faction quick links and FAQ", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFlmOOyMqxc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFlmOOyMqxc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFlmOOyMqxc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFlmOOyMqxc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFlmOOyMqxc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Red Faction N-Gage (2003) - Full Game Playthrough", "description": "Red Faction lives on the Red Faction Community Discord (FactionFiles)!\nJoin today: http://RFChat.com\n\nFull game playthrough (longplay) of the entire Red Faction N-Gage campaign - right from the mines, to the geothermal plant, to the Capek battle, to the vehicle sections, to the final Masako endgame boss fight.
