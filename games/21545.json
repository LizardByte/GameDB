The game was released on June 12, 2007. Time Ace is based on the concept that an eccentric inventor from 1914, Dr. Hugo Clock, has formed a plan to travel forward in time to end World War I, but the evil Dr. Klaus Scythe uses the time machine to further his own plan for world domination. The player's goal is to stop Scythe's nefarious scheme. The game is similar to Konami's earlier 1981 arcade game Time Pilot.", "videos": [{"id": 29866, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "iJ9LwPctbaU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ9LwPctbaU", "title": "Time Ace Nintendo DS Gameplay - Zoom", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iJ9LwPctbaU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
