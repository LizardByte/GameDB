You'll plant trees, chomp trees, and build a wide variety of things using the lumber that you gather!\n\nFind trees and cut them down to collect the wood. Take the wood to Mr. Chipper (your Dad) and he will make lumber for you. Using that, as well as the items you collect, you'll build things ranging from Lumberbots, to Totem Poles, to Crab Cabanas, and in the process you'll unlock new and more advanced blueprints!\n\nThere are also plenty of mini-games offered by the inhabitants of the forest, each rewarding you with unique and helpful items, such as fungal fertilizer and storm callers, which can summon a rain storm at the press of a button to help your trees grow!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chipper-and-sons-lumber-co"}
