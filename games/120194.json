Powered by a massive 5-liter V8 engine and delivering more than 428hp of power and 528 Nm of torque, buyers can choose between a full manual and automatic six-speed gearbox, the latter coming with genuine shifting paddles \u2013 a first in the long history of the Mustang.\n\nBased on the Porsche 911 3.2, the 1987 CTR Yellowbird is one of Ruf\u2019s most iconic models that has helped build Ruf's reputation for building no-compromise sports cars. The 3.4 liter twin-turbocharged flat six engine provided 469hp from two large turbo chargers & intercoolers and had been equipped with a new Bosch Motronic as well as an ignition setup originally designed for Porsche\u2019s 962 Group C race car. Thanks to extensive weight-saving measures such as usage of fiberglass and aluminum, the CTR weighs just 1150 kilograms, resulting in a very impressive performance.\n\nBMW's 2002 Turbo road car made the history books in 1973 by becoming Europe's first-ever mass-produced road car powered by a turbocharged engine. The 2002 Turbo's two-liter four cylinder engine provided 170hp of power, a figure that made the 2002 one of the most powerful cars on the road during its time. Unfortunately, the 1974 oil crisis forced an end to the 2002 Turbo's production after just one year as gas prices were soaring across the world. Only 1672 cars were produced during the model's limited production run, making the 2002 Turbo one of BMW's most iconic and most sought-after classics.\nBuilt to the Super 2000 touring car regulations, the 320TC is BMW's weapon of choice for competition in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) and countless national touring car series around the globe.\nWeighing 1170 kilograms, the car is powered by a 1.6 litreDI-turbo four-cylinder engine and a full adjustable six-speed sequential gearbox. Driven by veteran touring car aces such as Tom Coronel, Franz Engstler & Stefano D'Aste, the 320TC clinched five world championship wins.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-cars-old-vs-new-car-pack"}
