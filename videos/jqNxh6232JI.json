Only then can you confront his long-forgotten demon master, and save your world from being consumed by the endless hunger of demon hordes.\n\nDemon Crush is a fast-paced 2D sidescrolling combat-platformer that blends expressive, combo-based fighting mechanics with the charming visuals and intuitive controls of a bygone era. Play as multiple characters, master different weapons and combat styles, and plunge into adrenaline-soaked action in a fantasy Japanese setting.
