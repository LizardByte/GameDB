What would \"Super Mario Bros. Wonder\" be like in the NES style? Almost like that. Super Mario Wonderland is *NOT* a remake, it is just my version of the Wonderland theme. As if it were Super Mario Land for SMBWonder, just like Donkey Kong Country has an optional sequel for the Gameboy, Donkey Kong Land. Only this time a story and sequel created by a fan (me).\n\n*WARNING*\nFlashing lights. Warning for sensitive people.\n\nYes that's right! A fan sequel after the events of SMBWonder. DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS!\n\nIt's a different story. Bowser failed in yet another of his plans, this time with the Wonder Flower. But he thinks that no other lightning strikes in the same place. So he tries the same plan again but this time captures Prince Florian. Mario and his friends return to the flower kingdom to show that lightning strikes again in the same place. This time the they will explore places not explored in the original, as if it were a lost levels too.\n\nThe game is a tribute to all the 2D Mario games together + NES, including mainly the first Super Mario Bros. This adventure contains new custom and common characters from Super Mario Bros. Wonder.\n\nAnd now with a new mini boss: SteelBill Koopa. A rookie Koopa wants to prove to Bowser that he is capable and better than anyone else. So he tries to stop Mario and his gang on their journey to save Flower Kingdom again.\n\nAlong with him, Bowser will use the wonder power to make his koopas gain wonderful powers. Thus being the last bosses of each world. These are really fun battles that I made for you to enjoy. Anyone who is a fan of the NES and has had a childhood with the old games will love one of these bosses.\n\nAnd before anyone talks about it, yes there will be no total wonder coins in world 3 during this demo and all the rest of the bonus rooms will be fully present in the final version.\n\n*Would this game be possible on a real NES?*\nWhat is present in this demo with the exception of the end screens, yes! Still yes. But now about the game in general, I believe not because of the other giant bosses that lie ahead. However, I still think it's 100% possible on a SNES.\n\n*About the download:* Hey, it's back!\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14HX3s2qufP2p969u9tYVAQiW6lI4xgSc/view?\n*(Temporary download of the final demo 1)*\n\nCredits:\nNintendo\nGBFan45 (I used his music in the water theme)\nMix Channel (I used his \"Wowee-Zowee\" version)\nEdu (Buiu) Alves (The \"NI\" Nimaginendo logo)\nCharles Martinet (The clips are Charles Martinet voice made with an AI)\n\nAnd even a small excerpt from Kiddy Kong's Challenge. Are you afraid of ghosts or scary monsters that have eyes with flashing lights? Kiddy Kong's Challenge is the answer. The game will be more than a testable demo of Kiddy Kong's Showtime.
