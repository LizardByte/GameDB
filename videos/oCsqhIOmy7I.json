Most of the game is viewed from a top-down view. When the player enters a building, the gameplay perspective shifts to a first-person view. The game is significant for combining two different perspectives and for being an early game mastered in surround sound (Dolby Pro Logic).\n\nIn May 2015, approximately 300 copies of the game were listed for sale at a \"Buy It Now\" price of $1,500 on eBay.\n\nThe player controls Alan Grant. The objective of the game is to complete certain tasks in order to escape, such as clearing a raptor nest of eggs, and turning the generator on in a utility shed, allowing for opening and closing of gates and the like. Jurassic Park supports the SNES Mouse when playing first-person sequences or operating computer terminals. The player is given five lives, and two continues when all lives are lost.\n\nCommunication ports set up around the island allow characters in the game to communicate advice to the player, though some advice is deliberately malicious. The game's soundtrack consists of various music that corresponds to the area the player is currently exploring (except the two Tyrannosaurus rex who have their own theme track). The game typically takes anywhere from two to three hours to complete. Some objectives, such as collecting all 18 raptor eggs, can slow down the progress of a typical player. The game does not utilize a save feature. The player, therefore, is required to play through the entire game in a single sitting.\n\nJurassic Park was also released on the NES, Game Boy, Sega CD, Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear, Sega Master System, DOS, and the Commodore Amiga. No two games feature the same kind of gameplay, though they focus on roughly the same storyline. All versions, excluding those released on Sega video game consoles, were developed and published by Ocean Software.\n\nEdge magazine gave the game a six and criticized it for a lack of excitement, noting, \"To begin with a lot of time is spent aimlessly wandering around and avoiding the dinosaurs \u2013 very little help is given in which direction you should be going and exactly what you should be doing,\" while also writing, \"Nevertheless, given the quality of most film tie-ins, Jurassic Park is one of the better licences. With slightly improved game design it could have been the best.\"\n\nJonathan Davies of Super Play magazine gave the game an 89 percent rating and praised its colorful graphics, problem-solving tasks, and birds-eye perspective. However, Davies criticized the game for being \"a bit easy\" and for not incorporating the film's musical score.\n\nElectronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a 7.25 out of 10. Though they commented that the game is too easy, all but one of their four reviewers had an overall positive opinion of the game, particularly praising the sound and the use of the 3-D perspective.\n\nGame Informer magazine declared the Genesis version of the game somewhat superior to the SNES version in a 2012 comparison of the two games.\n\n\n...\n\n\nClever girl.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCsqhIOmy7I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCsqhIOmy7I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCsqhIOmy7I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Jurassic Park (SNES) Official Trailer (1993, Ocean Software)", "description": "Jurassic Park is an action-adventure video game for the Super NES based on the movie adaptation of the book by Michael Crichton.\n\nIt was developed by Ocean Software and released in 1993 in North America and PAL regions, and published and released by Jaleco in 1994 for Japan.
