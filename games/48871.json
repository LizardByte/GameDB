It was published by Taito for the Famicom in Japan only.\n\nYamamura Misa Suspense: Kyoto Hana no Misshitsu Satsujin Jiken is the second game based on the work of Japanese mystery novelist Misa Yamamura (the first being Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyouto Ryuu no Tera Satsujin Jiken) and, like the first, concerns a murder in the picturesque Japanese city of Kyoto.\n\nAs with the first game, and conversely to other Famicom adventure games around at the time, Hana no Misshitsu Satsujin Jiken has a dynamic bar of commands the player can perform; it changes to reflect what actions are currently possible for the player character in that area, so that they don't waste too much time trying every action in every location to find the next clue. These actions are also represented with symbolic icons, rather than typed out as words.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yamamura-misa-suspense-kyoto-hana-no-misshitsu-satsujin-jiken"}
