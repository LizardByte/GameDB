It\u2019s all the smashing, skidding, high-speed action you see on The Grand Tour without the irritating need to sleep in a tent, argue about directions or pay a sudden visit to a local hospital. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to be Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond or James May without the inconvenience of becoming tired and breathless and always followed around by two other middle-aged men, your dreams are about to come true. The Grand Tour Game is the first and only playable TV show in which you get to play the actual scenes you\u2019ve seen on screen. Buy a Season Pass for The Grand Tour Game and every Friday during Season 3 when a new episode of the show arrives, you\u2019ll get new vehicles and new tracks from that episode to play in the game. At last, all the fun of The Grand Tour with none of the callouses, neck strain and hospitalization. At least, we hope not.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hc0MGuLQ7GE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hc0MGuLQ7GE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hc0MGuLQ7GE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hc0MGuLQ7GE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hc0MGuLQ7GE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Grand Tour Game Announce Trailer", "description": "The Grand Tour Game gives you the unique chance to play the TV show, driving the cars you see on screen in the locations visited by Clarkson, Hammond and May.
