You play as Emi T. Fonon, a futuristic soldier from the years after World War IV, who wears a bio-powered suit that can fly back in time and destroy time travelling robots. Each level goes back to an earlier date and has more numerous and powerful enemies. \n \nThe game is completely controlled with the mouse. Left clicking fires the main weapon - yellow energy balls, while right clicking fires a sub weapon, which is chosen at the start of the level. There are four sub weapons to choose from: SPC that shoots powerful blue energy balls, Rockets, Homing Missiles and the most powerful sub weapon in the game \"???\" which is actually a bomb that can instantly kill all enemies on screen, including bosses but it also take out around 500-600 health. \n \nAn interesting feature of this game is the health system. The timer at the top of the screen also acts as the health bar and it decreases faster when you get hit. Enemies come in large groups, sometimes in formations, and shooting twenty enemies will refill your timer 200 points. Getting to the end of a level also adds a certain amount to the timer depending on the level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neural-gear"}
