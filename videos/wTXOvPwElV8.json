Some of these tooth doctors offered a computer with this game on it to take away most of the fears and anxieties of their younger patients. Seems like it could have worked, as the game is a decent platformer with quite smooth graphics and convenient gameplay. You are either Aro or Elmi, mascots of a toothpaste company. Your task is to eat away as many pieces of plaque as you can on each level and find the exit. After the first three levels, some questions come up asking about the right ways of brushing one's teeth (in German). If you make it to level 6, you can continue with Elmi in a different setting, eating away sugar cubes in an icy world. The game is not too easy either, as your ammo to defeat bacteria foes is limited and shoots in a parabolic way. Probably suitable for a young audience who was experienced with many other popular platform games at the time. Funny enough, the style and graphics remind me very much of another advertisement game, powered by Nestl\u00e9, advertising their Nesquik product with Quiky, their rabbit mascot http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plohmMVUUgM. So, first consume some sweets, but don't forget to brush your teeth afterwards!
