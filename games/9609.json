You control a unique car that allows you to boost, jump, rotate, and even fly through a chaotic and twisted city. The world has a mysterious history, and as you explore you'll be able to uncover pieces of its past.\n\nThe roads are treacherous and unpredictable with obstacles around every corner. Instead of doing laps on a loop, you'll be trying to survive to the end in the quickest time. Since your car has several abilities, it allows you to not only drive fast on the track but also upside down and on buildings and walls! You can also fly to discover new shortcuts and paths. You'll be able to take on the roads alone, or in multiplayer with your friends!\n\nThe game is a spiritual successor to the multi-award winning game Nitronic Rush, created by ourselves and 6 others while attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. It was widely praised for its innovative mechanics, visual style, audio design, and atmosphere.\nKey Features\nAbilities: The cars can perform many unique actions such as boosting, jumping, flying, and rotating to navigate along and around the track.\nAdventure: A single player experience to learn how to play the game as well as unveil a short story about the world's mysterious past.\nMultiplayer: LAN, Online, and Split-Screen play in several modes, such as Sprint as well as Reverse Tag, Stunt, and many others.\nLevel editor: Includes a powerful level editor that can be used to create levels from inside the game and share them with players around the world using Steam Workshop.\nOriginal soundtrack: New music from the composer behind award-winning games like Nitronic Rush, Solace, and The Fourth Wall.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/distance", "videos": [{"id": 22170, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0Z4G47P5vd8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z4G47P5vd8", "title": "Distance - Adventure Campaign Story Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Z4G47P5vd8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 22172, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HFv2rA-y4DA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFv2rA-y4DA", "title": "Distance - The Ghost Update", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HFv2rA-y4DA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 22173, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9-OwcGtGkFk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-OwcGtGkFk", "title": "Distance - The Creativity Update", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9-OwcGtGkFk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 22627, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p7dp5mwhcl8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7dp5mwhcl8", "title": "Distance - Launch Trailer (PC v1.0)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p7dp5mwhcl8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
