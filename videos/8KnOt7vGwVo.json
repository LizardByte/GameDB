If you place two pieces of the same color together they will mend together into one piece.\n\nThere are six game modes: Solo Normal Game, Solo Scoring Marathon, Solo vs. Computer, 2 Players @ 1 Keyboard, 2 Players. Use Network, Computer vs. Computer. If the standard tetris pieces feels too uninteresting to play with you can select to play with two other sets of pieces: \"Planar Pantominoes\" and \"One-To-Five-Ominoes\". To make the game even more interesting you can activate the \"Power Pieces\"-option. A Power Piece can be one of four different kinds: The bomb (destroys all adjacent tiles), The Down (pushes each tile directly beneath it down as far as it can go), The Drip (all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it change to be the color most commonly occurring on the board) and The Skull (destroys all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it).\n\nAs standard there is no sound in the game but the user can add his/her own sound. The graphic style of the game can also be changed. There are 12 built in styles and additional styles can be created by the user.\n\n\nDownload link:\n\nYou can download the game here:\n\nhttp://games.softpedia.com/progDownload/Alizarin-Tetris-Download-67203.html\n\nJust simply click on \"Softpedia Secure Download (US)\" on the right side. :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KnOt7vGwVo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KnOt7vGwVo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KnOt7vGwVo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KnOt7vGwVo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KnOt7vGwVo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Alizarin Tetris (aka. \"Atris\") for PC", "description": "Came also out for:\n\nLinux\n\n\nGame description:\n\nAlizarin Tetris is a freeware Tetris variant with several game modes and other features.\n\nThe game area is 10 x 20 tiles in size and as standard every piece that drops down can consist of up to four smaller pieces which are affected by gravity.
