{"id": "guOZaWPpB5k", "snippet": {"title": "The Legendary Starfy Playthrough Part 2", "description": "In this part, we go through Hotcha Springs.\r\n\r\nThese are the stages shown in this part:\r\n\r\n2-1: Between a Rock...: This stage introduces the concept of using boulders to get obstacles out of the way. It's quite a simple stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n2-2: The Wise Old Lobster: This stage introduces Old Man Lobber, a character who usually appears in the beginning of the Starfy games. His bath is incredibly cold and must be heated up, which can be done by the use of the Monstar ability. The side-quest here consists of you lighting up every wood bundle using the Monstar ability. Be quick, as the flames will die down after a while. Doing this unlocks 2-5: Secret 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n2-5: Secret 1: This stage consists of mainly rock-pushing. A Heart Gem can be found here.\r\n\r\n\r\n2-3: HEY-OH!: This level has you finding the Squirts (a comedy group) for Bawss to find out more info about the shard. The side-quest here consists of you trying to find the house that a strange noise is coming from. You'll find out the noise is coming from Squirt #5, who makes his first appearance in this game. You will also gain access to 2-6: Secret 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n2-6: Secret 2: This short stage mainly has you getting around with the geysers scattered around the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n2-4: Hot-Spring Snapper Battle: After the Hot-Spring Snapper takes the shard, you must go after it. The side-quest of this stage consists of you finding the Squirts' hot spring. You must head over to Bawss within the time limit while avoiding lava geysers. If you run out of time or get hit three times, you'll have to try again. Getting to Bawss will allow you to go to 2-7: Secret 3. The boss here, as you would expect, is the Hot-Spring Snapper. He's quite easy to defeat. In the first phase, you must use the geysers to get on top of the Snapper and spin to knock him over. Afterwards, you have to spin into the weak point on his belly. After a few hits, the floor will rise. The rest of the fight has you swimming while avoiding rocks. A few more spins to the Snapper will defeat him.\r\n\r\n\r\n2-7: Secret 3: This stage has you smacking around some more rocks to get rid of obstacles. The upgrade for the Monstar ability is found here, which can let you use the Super Spicy Belly move, which has a much bigger range than the original Spicy Belly.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/guOZaWPpB5k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/guOZaWPpB5k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/guOZaWPpB5k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/guOZaWPpB5k/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "The Legendary Starfy Playthrough Part 2", "description": "In this part, we go through Hotcha Springs.\r\n\r\nThese are the stages shown in this part:\r\n\r\n2-1: Between a Rock...: This stage introduces the concept of using boulders to get obstacles out of the way.
