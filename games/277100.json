A poor backwater with corrupt government and brainwashed population, rife with crime - and opportunity. Mutants and outcasts like us are not loved by anyone, so we choose infamy over their sick and unjust order. They may call us pirates and criminals but it's better to die free than live for others.\"", "summary": "X-Piratez is a total conversion mod designed for OpenXcom, a free open-source re-implementation of X-Com: Enemy Unknown (1994) and Terror From The Deep. There are major gameplay differences, as well as many additions to research, manufacture, base facilities, and so on.
