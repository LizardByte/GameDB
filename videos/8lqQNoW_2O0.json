Sixty years ago, these lands bore witness to the arrival of a being henceforth known as the Demon King. Where he appeared from; none could say. Nature itself twisted before his very existence, and it wasn\u2019t long before a horde of demons and monsters fell upon the nations of man.\nNo matter how many times these heroes struck down the Demon King, death proved to be naught but a temporary setback. He soon returned; He always did.\nDriven to desperation, it was the learned men of Arvium who would discover a solution. The Demon\u2019s soul would be pulled from His body, and sealed within that of a human.\nIn time, these custodians of the Demon King\u2019s soul would come to be known as \u201cVassals\u201d. Lady Faratras Hoikade is the fourth Vassal of the Demon King, having kept Him in check for 21 years. Is He sealed for good? As is so often the case, outward appearances can be deceptive.\n\u25a0 A tale full of moral choices that alter the story & characters\u2019 personality\n\u25a0 Follow three protagonists alternating their points of view\n\u25a0 Multiple romance options\n\u25a0 Multiple endings\n\nPath of the Midnight Sun is the first video game made by indie developers Studio Daimon, based in Milan, Italy.\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.pathofthemidnightsun.com\nOfficial Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/studiodaimon\nJoin the Discord server: https://discord.gg/M3E6pjC\n\n\u24b82022 Studio Daimon / Alfred Kamon", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8lqQNoW_2O0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8lqQNoW_2O0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8lqQNoW_2O0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8lqQNoW_2O0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8lqQNoW_2O0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Path of the Midnight Sun - Official Trailer | 2022", "description": "A charming Tactical RPG / Visual Novel fully animated in Live2D!
