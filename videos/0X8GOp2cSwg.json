It plays on my Windows 7 64bit system without issue which isn't always the case with these old games.\nThe game allows you to select 1080p resolution but as it wasn't designed for wide-screen monitors everything looks very flat and weird so I ran it in 1280x1024. I played using my Xbox 360 controller and the game detected it and all its buttons and analogue controllers (again, not always the case with older games). \nI used to play this game a lot years ago and there's definitely still fun to be had with it.\n\n\nhttp://uk.gamespot.com/colin-mcrae-rally-2-0/\nhttp://uk.gamespot.com/colin-mcrae-rally-2-0/reviews/colin-mcrae-rally-20-2692767/\n\nCaptured with Fraps 3.5.9 (15586)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0X8GOp2cSwg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0X8GOp2cSwg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0X8GOp2cSwg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0X8GOp2cSwg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0X8GOp2cSwg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (2001) (PC) (Gameplay and Replay)", "description": "Playing a bit of this old rally game from 2001 (badly, it's been a while).
