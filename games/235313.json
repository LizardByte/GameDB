Tetra Offline is a singleplayer block-stacker game made in Unity. Tetra Offline was made available as Tetra Online, which originally released on Steam as closed-source software, was taken down due to a DMCA notice on December 9, 2020.\n\nSteam's connectivity and APIs were integral to Tetra Online's multiplayer systems. As the code itself was deemed too difficult to modify for independent hosting, the decision was made to preserve Tetra Online's singleplayer component exclusively. This release also featured many aspects of Tetra Online that were yet to be implemented into the game, or were scrapped earlier in development.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tetra-offline"}
