Due to a plague of photosensitivity caused by cheap gas station cheese and retinal parasites, we've had to enforce a strict low-light policy for the sake of our staff. That won't be a problem, right? You shouldn't expect to see much action up here anyway...\n\nFear and Loathing is a limit-removing Doom 2 mapset from various members of Doomer Boards. Conductor Scrangus McBrickdad (aka @Jaxxoon R), the lead behind the tranquil Lillywhite Lilith, brings the exact opposite with a spooky combination of ambient sounds, darkness*, vicious monsters and perhaps most horrifying of all: Doom 3. There's also some extra eye candy for GZDoom users, which is perfect for the Halloween season.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fear-and-loathing"}
