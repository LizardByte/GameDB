Well, I hope you've been patient for this, and I hope you also have some more patience leftover because there's still a bit left in this mod to complete before we can actually publish an official release. I hope you all understand that time is needed here, because the team behind this creation is working hard to make sure that what we craft is the best it can be for the players. \n---\nI want to say a huge thank you to Kitrod, Berk, C45 and slender for their contributions to the mod. The work put in by them truly changed the tone of this entire thing for the better, and I can't thank any of them enough. Especially Kitrod, he has been making the strongest efforts by changing each individual room with his own style, making the mod stand out on its own much better. \n---\nWe hope this mod will be release-able in the near future, hopefully in the next month or two. But with that being said, thank you all for the support given to this creation, and I hope you enjoy the trailer.\n\nModDB page: https://www.moddb.com/mods/scp-terror-hunt-mod\nJoin our Discord server: https://discord.gg/xRhHjszE9m", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCdbedxnsio/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCdbedxnsio/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCdbedxnsio/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCdbedxnsio/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rCdbedxnsio/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SCP: Terror Hunt v0.4.0 Trailer", "description": "Wow, this update has really been taking a long time, huh?
