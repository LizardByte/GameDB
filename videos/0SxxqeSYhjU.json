{"id": "0SxxqeSYhjU", "snippet": {"title": "The Addams Family (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ocean's 1992 license-based platformer for the Super Nintendo, The Addams Family.\n\nThe Addams Family for the SNES was one of several games that appeared after the release of the popular 1991 movie. Though all of the games based on the movie follow the same basic premise (you run around the non-linear mansion search for family members and cash), the SNES version is probably my favorite among them.\n\nThe Addams Family features the typical run-and-jump action that was popularized by Super Mario Bros., and it does very well at mimicking those mechanics. The controls are smooth and Gomez is easy to maneuver around the screen (though his skidding could land you in trouble if you aren't careful!), and the relatively speedy gameplay keeps things moving right along. Stages are loaded with secret areas that hide money, 1-ups, and various power-up items. There is a lot of precision jumping involved which can be tricky until you learn the layouts, but it's never very frustrating since the game hands out 1-ups constantly, and you'll rarely see the Game Over screen. The enemy placement is deliberate and designed to punish you for blindly rushing through, but that becomes easier to handle with time and experience. Overall the game is quite easy, but finding all of the secrets is likely to take a while, and that is a lot of the fun.\n\nThe SNES game is virtually identical to the Genesis, Amiga, and Atari ST versions, but it is easily the best version between them. The gameplay is about the same, but the SNES runs away with the presentation prize. The graphics are excellent for such an early game, with nice, big sprites, a lot of varied backgrounds loaded with details and color as opposed to the flat/dithered graphics in the other versions, and a metric ton of parallax scrolling - it's almost too much in the chains level. I know, too much parallax scrolling? I didn't think it was possible either, but this game and Jim Power proved to me otherwise. I was always a huge fan of the hall lined with the family portraits myself. The SNES one also has an excellent soundtrack, but of course, music always was consistently one of Ocean's major strengths. The wavetable synth here sounds way better than the Genesis FM music, and it's extremely catchy. \n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0SxxqeSYhjU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0SxxqeSYhjU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0SxxqeSYhjU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0SxxqeSYhjU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "The Addams Family (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ocean's 1992 license-based platformer for the Super Nintendo, The Addams Family.\n\nThe Addams Family for the SNES was one of several games that appeared after the release of the popular 1991 movie.
