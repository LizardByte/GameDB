Other than aestethics, you will find also a wide range of weapons, each one with its unique functions. Assault Rifle has an attached grenade launcher (which acts like the Pro-Pipe from Reach), Rocket Launcher has an overcharged mode that fires faster rockets, Needler now is a burst-fire weapon, and so on. Vehicles have been improved as well, and same goes for the encounters and the actor_variants.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sois-singleplayer-adventure", "videos": [{"id": 37915, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "qEGSINKgI6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEGSINKgI6g", "title": "SOI's Singleplayer Adventure - Launch trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qEGSINKgI6g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
