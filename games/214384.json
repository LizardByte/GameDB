There is almost nothing left of the Old World. Overpopulation, environmental exploitation, and complete disregard for nature resulted in the depletion of drinkable water by 2040. It took less than 15 years after that for the complete annihilation of our civilization. But a few lucky souls survived the destruction inside enormous bunkers. Now they have to get back to the surface and rebuild civilization.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/homeseek", "videos": [{"id": 73622, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "6B1kr_5AcOM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B1kr_5AcOM", "title": "Homeseek Gameplay Trailer (Pre-Alpha)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6B1kr_5AcOM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
