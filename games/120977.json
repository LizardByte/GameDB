A submission created in six weeks for the 2019 Dream Diary Jam. \n \nPlay as Nina and explore her dreams, collecting various effects along the way. The ending will become available once Nina has collected all four effects. \n \nThis game is written entirely in NEC V810 assembly and is made to be compatible with actual Virtual Boy hardware. Hardware compatibility has been tested by a third party. \n \nThe game doesn't feature any sound, as there was not enough time to write an assembly sound driver during the Jam. There is also no saving in the game itself.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
