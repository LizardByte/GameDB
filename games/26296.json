The quest takes the knight into three different realms of danger, each with its own challenges, and an ever changing maze which they must navigate through. The quest is broken down into these challenges:\n\nForest - The Knight must confront three dragons, each one more difficult than the last. Along the way, an enchanted bat will give him the strength to overcome the danger.\n\nCastle - The Knight must overcome six wizards, his only aid being a mouse that will generally try to avoid capture.\n\nDungeon - A randomly appearing skull is the only defense against the nine demons that make up the sinister dungeons.\n\nAlong the way, the items that the Knight will find may be of some help (or hinder) his quest to make it through the different areas. Challenge the areas again and again for the highest score possible!", "summary": "A whimsical new medieval fantasy game developed Connie Goldman and David Warhol of Mattel Electronics and published by INTV Corporation for the Intellivision in 1986.\n\nYou're the knight in shining armor on your quest for survival. Your journey takes you through the enchanted forest where three dragons wait with heated breath. Then, through a castle maze with three wicked wizards. Finally to a dark and dreary dungeon where the three demons present your final challenge.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thunder-castle", "videos": [{"id": 49194, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tdIUBGabCpg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdIUBGabCpg", "title": "Thunder Castle for the Mattel Intellivision", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tdIUBGabCpg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
