It was once rich, but has been overshadowed by the Labyrinth Kingdoms and their Minotaur king.\n\nEvery year, brave adventurers venture forth to solve the mysteries of the labyrinths in order to return with treasure to save their dying city, but none ever return. This loss of healthy, skilled people only serves to accelerate the decline.\n\nCan you succeed where others have failed? Test your mettle against the mazes and discover the secrets and riches that lie within!\n\nNavigating the Labyrinth is a classic first-person party-based dungeon crawler RPG with grid-based movement and turn-based combat. Build and level up a party of up to six adventurers of different classes and use their spells and abilities to defeat progressively tougher monsters as they explore farther into the labyrinth.", "summary": "Navigating the Labyrinth is a classic first-person party-based dungeon crawler RPG with grid-based movement and turn-based combat.
