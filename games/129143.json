Play one of history's defining RPGs with completely overhauled graphics, sound, and expanded musical score.\n\nThe year is 2087, nearly a century after an all-out nuclear war turned vast swaths of the Earth into a radioactive hellscape. You are a Desert Ranger, a band of stalwart lawmen who are the only hope left in what was once the American southwest, and good people's last defense against hunger, sickness, ravaging raiders, and mutants.\n\nNow something more secretive and sinister is menacing humanity, and it's your job to investigate. Recruit help and follow leads - the choices you make will shape the world around you. Choose wisely, your life and the lives of those you're sworn to protect depend on it.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 33408, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "W6KF4xc-cd4"}]}
