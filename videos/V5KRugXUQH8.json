This is a story-driven game, under development for over four years by a small, independent team.\n\nWe started by creating a fantastical universe for this adventure. Shining Stryah crystals are turning dark and cold all across the world of Eathral. Outbreaks of chaos, vicious raiders, and corrupted wildlife turn the tranquil world upside down. The followers of a long-forgotten dark sect march from the shadows to sow mayhem in service to their insatiable god of disorder. They rampage unchecked, for the last great hero imbued with mystic blessings to protect the world was laid to rest twenty years ago.\n\nNext, we built the game around a blend of features sure to please almost any player. In addition to the major points listed separately, Heart of Eir offers puzzles to solve and plenty of loot to upgrade your party. Despite the massive size of this project, everything you can see here and play in our publicly-available demo was built with a limited budget and dedicated team members. We leveraged the latest technologies in game development to do more with less, and we believe in staying close to our players.
