The first six games in the series were developed by Core Design, whilst Crystal Dynamics developed the latest four; their fifth game is currently in production. Two movies\u2014Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life\u2014have been produced, starring American actress Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, the first of which is still the highest-grossing film adaptation of a video game ever released in US, and third worldwide.\n\nSince the release of the original Tomb Raider in 1996, notable for its female protagonist, the series developed into a lucrative franchise of related media, and Lara went on to become a major icon of the virtual gaming industry. In 2006, Lara Croft was inducted into the Walk of Game and the Guinness Book of World Records has recognised her as the \"Most Successful Human Virtual Game Heroine.\"\n\nOver the course of time, the Tomb Raider series' canon has undergone various changes or retcons. These changes correspond to the series entering a new medium, such as comic books or film, or being taken over by another game developer. For example, in the first Tomb Raider game manual, Lara Croft is said to have survived a plane crash in the Himalayas at the age of twenty one, and was later disowned by her parents, who are still living.[3] However, in the comics, Lara lost both her parents and her fianc\u00e9 in the crash. \nIn addition to the voice actresses who have been responsible for Lara Croft's spoken dialogue during the games, a number of women have taken on the role of Lara for applications outside of the games themselves. Six different women have served as the official Lara Croft model for publicity purposes, including model Nell McAndrew, actress Rhona Mitra, and, most recently, gymnast Alison Carroll, who held the job until 2010. American film star Angelina Jolie portrayed Lara Croft in two feature-length Tomb Raider films, which together grossed nearly US$500 million worldwide, making her role as Lara the most well known and widely seen of any other.\n\nSixteen years after the release of the original game, Lara is still one of the most famous and recognizable video game characters in the history of the medium. The debate over whether she is an icon of female empowerment or a vessel for male titillation has existed for as long as she has, but the huge effect she has had on both gaming and popular culture in general cannot be denied.[6]\n\n1996--2003: Tomb Raider, II, III, The Last Revelation, Chronicles, and The Angel of Darkness\nToby Gard, one of the creators of Tomb Raider\n\nThe original game, titled Tomb Raider, made its debut on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. It was one of the major titles responsible for the PlayStation's success in the mid-1990s, and helped shift 100 million PlayStation consoles.[10] The games present a world in 3D: a series of tombs, and other locations, through which the player must guide Lara. Tomb Raider, an early example of the 3D genre, uses third-person shooter mechanics. The player's camera follows her, usually over her shoulder or from behind. Until Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, the game's environments were largely orthogonal, as a result of the creators' decision to extend the 2D platform game genre to a 3D world. This is shown through Tomb Raider's game-play, which is reminiscent of older platform games like Prince of Persia and Flashback that had a heavy focus on timed jumping interspersed with combat. Each game has introduced new weapons and moves; by the fourth game, Lara could back flip off ropes and turn around in mid-air to grab a ledge behind her. other tags: harlem shake ad commercial samuel jackson battlefield reveil press conference leaked announcement uncharted 4 chris dorner last stand arnold schwarzenegger sylvester stallone chuck norris jean claude van damme bruce willis jason statham the rock dwayne johnson halo super bowl fast furious 6 vin diesel sin city a dame to kill for thor superhero batman james bond videogames walkthrough let's play ost bullet to the head parker terminator aliens ufc 158 gsp diaz george st-pierre nick angelina jolie bande annonce cinemassacre joueur grenier pappy", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkD8x9aItCs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkD8x9aItCs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkD8x9aItCs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkD8x9aItCs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VkD8x9aItCs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Tomb Raider 1 - Official PS1 trailer 1996 - (Restored 16:9)", "description": "Tomb Raider 2013 ign gamespot machinima review are out\n\nOfficial Jason Graves Website:\nhttp://www.jasongraves.com/\n\nTomb Raider is a video game franchise which also includes comic books, novels, theme park rides and movies, centring around the adventures of the fictional English archaeologist Lara Croft.
