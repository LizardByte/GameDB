A man, respected by the police, decides to care of the situation by himself. The man takes the boy to a coffeehouse, where the boy explains that he ran away from his orphanage to find his parents' whereabouts. The man introduces himself as a private detective named Shunsuke Utsugi, and convinces the boy to become his assistant.\n\nA few months later, Utsugi and the protagonist receive a phone call to check over a crime scene. The murder victim is a freshman schoolgirl named Yoko Kojima. The protagonist begins gathering information from Ushimitsu High School to solve the Yoko case and connect it with the Genjiro Kaneda case along with the help of Yoko's two high school friends; a girl named Ayumi Tachibana and a boy named Hitomi Kawaii. It soon emerges that Yoko was deep into an investigation of \"The Tale of the Girl Who Stands Behind,\" a rumor involving a ghost of a blood-soaked girl that stands behind a student, and the trio set out to discover the truth behind this rumor.", "summary": "As a young detective (whom you name yourself), you work as an assistant for the famous investigator Utsugi. Your first important assignment is to investigate a murder case. A girl named Yoko was found murdered near a central bridge. During the investigation, you discover a strange rumor about a mysterious ghost-like \"girl who stands at the back\", spread around the school Yoko studied at. Soon the young detective realizes that the case grows more and more complex and that he will need all his wit and talents to find the criminal!\n\nThis adventure game is dedicated entirely to investigation. You have a menu with various choices (Talk, Investigate, Think), as well as multiple topics to ask the suspects about. You should find clues by questioning people and gathering information, but also by examining areas - in certain places you should move a hand-like cursor over the screen and click on a precise spot to examine it.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 57462, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WKQR2qS5ORw"}, {"id": 57463, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "k4mAYhXkn2U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4mAYhXkn2U", "title": "\u3010FDS\u3011\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u63a2\u5075\u5036\u697d\u90e8 PARTII \u3046\u3057\u308d\u306b\u7acb\u3064\u5c11\u5973 \u5f8c\u7de8\u3010\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u307e\u3067\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k4mAYhXkn2U/sddefault.jpg"}]}
