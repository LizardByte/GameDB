The game involves the player solving puzzles by interacting with the environment through the use of a text parser and was an example of Falcom's technical know-how at the time. Every contemporary Japanese adventure game released for computers during this period would draw its graphics line-by-line and slowly fill in the colors, a long process that would need to be done anytime the scene changed to a new image. Demons Ring, on the other hand, could transition to different images in under half a second, a feature that was heavily advertised by Falcom and something that would eventually become a standard for the genre moving forward.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/demons-ring"}
