It has some crazy production values, including full voice acting, so I figured I'd showcase the game a bit. \n\nIt's worth noting that all of the characters have completely different first two stages. \n\nWith the Scarlet Sisters you can switch between Remilia and Flandre by pressing shot+focus, but only from stage 2 onwards. \nThey each have different shottypes and bombs as well. \n\nThe shottype I picked has a pretty shitty spread shot for Remilia and pretty much SanaeA from UFO for Flandre. Remilia's bomb works like SA MarisaC, you get a temporary shield that can take a hit, if it runs out without being hit, you get a bomb piece back. Flandre's bomb however gives you 3 free hits and doesn't run out. The only downside to this is that these hits have basically no invulnerability frames. It's pretty easy to get insta-gibbed 3 times in a bad situation. It's honestly a bit too good. \n\nGrazing fills up the meter in the bottom-left. When it's completely full you get awarded a bomb piece. After every 3 bomb pieces you get awarded a life piece instead. It takes increasingly more graze each time to fill the meter. \n\nYou need 4 life pieces to form an extra life and 4 bomb pieces to form an extra bomb. You get surprisingly few extra lives in this game, which is really uncommon for a Touhou game. I only got 5 extra lives total this run, and I did graze quite a bit. \n\nI do like the visual and audial feedback you get for grazing in this. It feels pretty good to see a big cloud of purple for grazing a bunch and it stimulates you to graze more. This is something the official Touhou games have always lacked I feel. \n\nIt's pretty cute that bosses actually drop a spell card for you to pick up if you capture a spell card.\n\nI realize the dialogue is kinda long and that not everyone appreciates fan voice acting, so I included some annotation skips for people that just want to see the run. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tRxjetOttE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tRxjetOttE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tRxjetOttE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0tRxjetOttE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou \u4e1c\u65b9\u5e7b\u68a6\u7b3a  ~ Phantasm Dream - Scarlet Sisters Lunatic 1cc (No-Miss)", "description": "Turn on captions for extra text commentary during the video. \n\nTouhou Phantasm Dream is a pretty obscure Chinese Touhou fangame.
