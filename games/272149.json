What unpredictable situations will happen? How is the story connected to the other entries? All of this and much more will be discovered in this new entry, the new generation of the Tuiterland saga!\n\nTuiterland 4 has been developed to be the ultimate Tuiterland experience, being the game with most story cutscenes, lots of side content in terms of stories and map exploration and the most refined combat system.
