Think health bar with health pickups, fast paced combat, shotguns, rocket launchers, exploding barrels and a mass of other retro mechanics in a mix of 2D and 3D FPS action!\n\nReleased for Windows (7, 8 and 10). With all Art, Programming and Design done by one man, me! Music done by a friend of mine, Scott Hunter.\n\nThe art for Bitsturbed has a number of influences, some legitimately retro (Megaman, Duke3D, Doom1+2), but also more modern games with retro themes ('The adventures of Square' being one awesome example).\n\nThe final game aims to be about an hour long, for an average playthrough.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bitsturbed"}
