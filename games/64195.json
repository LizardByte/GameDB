It was released for the NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, FM7 and X1.\n\nThe game's story is loosely based on the Southern Cross story arc from the original manga. The objective is to help Kenshiro and Bat infiltrate the city of Southern Cross and defeat Shin. As with most adventure games, the player must navigate Ken and Bat through a menu-based command system that will allow them to obtain vital items that will lead them to their ultimate goal. Additionally, Kenshiro must also confront Shin's various underlings throughout the course of the story. The fighting sequences uses a so-called \"vital point system\" (\u79d8\u5b54\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0) in which an enemy can only be defeated by striking specific vital points. The player must search for information or clues that will help them figure out the weak spots of each enemy.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hokuto-no-ken-violence-gekiga-adventure", "videos": [{"id": 78493, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LlmLbXc_R98", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlmLbXc_R98", "title": "Hokuto no Ken (\u5317\u6597\u306e\u62f3) for the NEC PC-88", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LlmLbXc_R98/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
