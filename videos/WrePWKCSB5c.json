Today, we are pushing all the features from last week\u2019s enormous update to the stable branch. Just in case you missed the news, this includes the total block redesign, new multiplayer netcode, a tutorial campaign and much more! We wanted to make this great update available to all players as you\u2019ve been asking for it all week! In combination with this today\u2019s bug and crash fixes, you should be able to enjoy a stable gameplay experience. This update also marks the transition of Space Engineers moving to Beta phase.\nThe most important thing to remember with this announcement is that there is still more content, improvements and many optimizations to come. As an example, we can confirm that one of the things being worked on currently is a new HUD which should significantly increase your immersion in the game. Beta simply means that we feel the game now has a solid foundation.\n\nFull list of new features and fixes: http://forums.keenswh.com/threads/7390358\nMarek's blog post about Space Engineers Beta: http://blog.marekrosa.org/2016/12/space-engineers-entering-beta_15.html\n\nhttp://www.SpaceEngineersGame.com/\n\nLike us on https://www.facebook.com/SpaceEngineers\nFollow us on http://twitter.com/SpaceEngineersG", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WrePWKCSB5c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WrePWKCSB5c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WrePWKCSB5c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WrePWKCSB5c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WrePWKCSB5c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Space Engineers Beta Trailer", "description": "Hello Engineers!
