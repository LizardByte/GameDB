{"id": "Duq8cv1QVP0", "snippet": {"title": "Total Carnage (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Malibu's 1993 Super NES port of Midway's Smash TV sequel, Total Carnage.\n\nIncludes the hidden Pleasure Dome ending. \n\nAs much as I like this game, I have to say that I don't want to see it again for awhile after doing this video. It's Smash TV without the game show theme, and is a pretty funny take on the whole Gulf War media frenzy of demonizing brown people. This one wasn't developed by Beam (the team that developed the Smash TV SNES port), and it doesn't look anywhere near as close to the arcade version as its predecessor did. The incredible music of the arcade game is here, but it sounds like someone put it through a meat grinder first. The awesome FM guitars of the arcade soundtrack are replaced here by some beepy noise that sounds like a 90s wavetable sound card's square lead patch, but the voices are mostly all here and still hilarious (I'll buy YOU for a dollar!) and make for some fun references to Smash TV (some of the voices are even recycled directly from it). \n\nThe game is incredibly fun, and quite difficult. Merely getting to the end before running out of credits is a feat, but it's much easier to do than it was in Super Smash TV. The real challenge is getting to the Pleasure Dome, mainly because in TC you have to find 120 keys across the stages - this means collecting every single key that's dropped or hidden behind scenery, and there aren't always enough keys to achieve handed out during a game to get this ending. This is the reason why I try to hang out at the edge to prevent the screen from scrolling so often - the longer you linger, the better chance you have of having a key randomly appear. \n\nAfter about a month of solid practice and brushing up with this game I sat down to record it with the true ending. I had to record the damn thing seven times to have a game where I actually had enough keys and didn't accidentally let Akhboob escape in the final sequence. Five of those times were solely due to not having enough keys drop during them game. So, like I said, I really like this, but it's going back on the shelf to hibernate for a good long time after the amount I've played it recently. \n\nAt the end of the video I included a neat little easter egg: if you get a game over with more than 1,000 points but less than 2,000, you'll get 5th place on the leaderboard. Type your name in as YAWDIM (Midway backwards), press the right key and you'll get some MS Paint picture of stick figures murdering each other, and each of the four face buttons will play a voice clip from the arcade version that isn't used in the SNES version. Pretty neat. Now, if only I could flip my in-game gun around like TJ Laser... :)\n____________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Duq8cv1QVP0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Duq8cv1QVP0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Duq8cv1QVP0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Total Carnage (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Malibu's 1993 Super NES port of Midway's Smash TV sequel, Total Carnage.\n\nIncludes the hidden Pleasure Dome ending. \n\nAs much as I like this game, I have to say that I don't want to see it again for awhile after doing this video.
