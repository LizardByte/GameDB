For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/s-dot-c-i-dot-special-criminal-investigation"}
