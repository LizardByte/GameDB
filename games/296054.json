Power Meter!! is a Japan-exclusive e-Reader card for use with Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3. It was released in Series 2 in Japan. It can be used only in World-e. The key art, similar to the blue switch card, was colored orange with a red outline of Raccoon Mario. The only difference between the two cards is that Mario is facing upright and pointing his left finger.\n\nOnce this card is scanned, the Power Meter is halved, making it much easier to run and fly throughout stages.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-advance-4-card-e-plus-sugu-ni-mantan-power-meter"}
