Welcome to a new experience in gameplay and battle your way through a series of devastating space feuds, for supremacy across the universe. Unleash your firepower and launch an arsenal of special attacks to destroy the enemy.\n\nExplore the galaxy and distant constellations, where resources, new life forms and fearsome adversaries abound. Destroy your opponents with lasers and missiles, along with a dozen special attacks and weapons you can earn through mining and search for life mini games.\n\nPlace spaceships in combat formation at the battlefront, keeping in mind that the vulnerable and missile attack ships, should be positioned behind the stronger crafts that are equipped with lasers and abundant health points, in order to engage the enemy and withstand attacks that would otherwise destroy inferior spaceships. When all the crafts of either opposing fleet have been destroyed, the battle is over.\n\nIf you win, but have damaged crafts, return to the nearest base and mobilise available ships for the next mission. As the game progresses, depending on your leadership status, you have the option of selecting up to four spaceships with different abilities in every space station and a total of six in battle formation.\nEach spaceship can be upgraded by collecting experience points during combat. The current status is denoted by rank signs. Ships with more experience can withstand greater damage and deliver more powerful hits.\n\nThe scan button helps detect resources, which can be found by scanning and mining different sectors of the galaxy. Collecting crystals is strategically essential, because special weapons cannot be acquired without them. Without these special weapons, you will be incapable of completing specific missions.\nThere are three types of crystals and their various combinations are required for special attacks. Use the crafting system in space stations to create the sort of crystal needed for the desired weapon.\n\nThe search for life will grant you life points. While claiming life points, you will get promotions with rewards and additional crystals.\nEngage in one-on one battles and lead your mother-ship against the enemy's. The battle of the mother-ship is a turn based card collision. The results of all mother-ship battles can be tracked in the space base Hall of fame panel, where your rank is displayed.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spaceforce-constellations"}
