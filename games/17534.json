While finding a way to change the flow of past events, you will encounter many obstacles and meet new allies. Will you be brave enough?\n\nThis game aims to revive nostalgic moments for good old RPG fanatics (such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3...). Our game has no game over screen; once the hero dies, his soul is sent to the underworld, to meet the Soul Giver. At this point, it is possible to re-embody a new body (therefore several choices of classes: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, Hunter ...). In addition, once a character masters a technique, it is learned permanently in the mind of the hero. It is therefore possible to transfer a warrior's ability to a magician. This leads toward interesting gameplay combinations.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
