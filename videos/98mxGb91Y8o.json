ERI has come a long way over the past few months, and bringing the PC game to mobile has been a real challenge.  Over 9000 assets have been converted to mobile along with an entirely new set of animations; all capped off by several major overhauls in code.\r\n\r\nBeing on the cutting edge of technology is incredibly exciting but also a little scary.  We're working in uncharted territory, which is why we've held off on giving a specific release date.  We'd rather focus on making everything work the way it should than setting a date and cutting corners to meet that date.  However, we are still set to release this summer.\r\n\r\nThis footage was taken with the iPad 2 and hasn't been altered.  Warm Gun will be available for several iOS devices, including the iPad, iPad 2, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod Touch 3 and iPod Touch 4. Warm Gun will also be released on Android devices after the iOS version launches.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more information about Warm Gun on our website: http://warmgungame.com\r\n\r\nYou can also follow us on Twitter @WarmGunGame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/98mxGb91Y8o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/98mxGb91Y8o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/98mxGb91Y8o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/98mxGb91Y8o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/98mxGb91Y8o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Warm Gun iOS Debut Trailer", "description": "\u2720 iTunes: Warm Gun - http://bit.ly/WarmGun ($4.99) Universal \u2720\r\n\u2720 Warm Gun CoB - http://bit.ly/WarmGunCOB (Free) Universal \u2720\r\n\r\nAfter almost six months of development, Emotional Robots Inc. is happy to debut the first gameplay footage of Warm Gun on iOS!
