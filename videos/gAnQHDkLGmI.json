It is based on the events of the 2008 film Jumper, released two days later.\n\n\nThe game begins in a flashback to the night Griffin's parents were murdered. He will remember the two - a woman and her male partner - for years to come. The gameplay begins in earnest with zach's encounter with David Rice at the Colosseum. Griffin's interrogation of a Paladin leads him to Nepal in search of Roland Cox, where he learns that the Paladins have long since lost the support of the monks who first trained them to sense Jump Scars. From there Griffin traces the Paladins to Tokyo, where they are stealing a machine that permits others to follow Jumpers through Jump Scars. He is nearly able to kill the lady and the man who killed his parents, but the Paladins escape with the machine. While nursing his wounds at his lair, David arrives, permitting the Paladins to use the machine to finally locate the lair. After an intense duel, he drives Roland back through the Jump Scar and pursues. At Millie's house, he encounters the most dangerous Paladin he has ever faced. Afterwards, he questions the high-ranking Paladin as to the identity of the woman who killed his parents. The Paladin laughs and says that David knows her; the only conclusion is that it is Mary Rice - David's mother.\n\n\n\nEnhanced graphics with emulator PCSX2 1.4.0.For recording I used a Nvidia Shadowplay (it can handle 1080p at 60FPS).\n-some games can have graphical issues, lags and other problems...\n\nPC specs:\nCPU - Intel Core i7 6700K @ 4.60 Ghz\nRAM - 16 GB DDR4\nGPU - GTX 970 GAMING 100ME 4GB\nOS  - Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\n\n::::: Rate, Comment & Subscribe :::::", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAnQHDkLGmI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAnQHDkLGmI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAnQHDkLGmI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAnQHDkLGmI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAnQHDkLGmI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jumper: Griffin's Story - PS2 Gameplay 1080p (PCSX2)", "description": "Jumper: Griffin's Story - PS2 Gameplay 1080p (PCSX2)\n\nVisit new JohnGodGamesHD channel here: https://goo.gl/W9f1n4\n\nJumper: Griffin's Story is a video game released for the PlayStation 2, Wii and Xbox 360 on February 12, 2008.
