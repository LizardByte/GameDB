As you unlock technologies, possibilities will grow, as will citizens' demands.\n\nOrrstead will feature a variety of viable city-building options, each with pros and cons. For example, a mining town will be highly productive, but offer a low quality of life. In contrast, a riverside fishing village may be less productive, but offer a higher quality of life.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orrstead", "videos": [{"id": 78747, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0wYVbBBEor4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wYVbBBEor4", "title": "Orrstead Alpha 0.2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0wYVbBBEor4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
