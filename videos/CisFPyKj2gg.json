For example, Sun totem has Star blast, Star shower and Sand Pit abilities, which can be linked to the Sun.\n\nEach totem has a Shield ability, which were stronger from the top to bottom, the Shield of Truth being the strongest. There are a total of 80 Talents, which can be gathered along the span of the Single-player game.
