Rumor has it that these could optimize the Morkite refining process tenfold. The problem is, they\u2019re located much deeper down in Hoxxes than we\u2019re used to, hidden away in dazzling Morkite Geodes.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to locate several Resonance Crystals in the cave system using the provided Telemetric Rangefinder. Use the Crystals to perform Deep Scans and pinpoint the location of the Morkite Geode. Once you\u2019ve got that, a Drillevator will be sent down to bring you to the Geode where you can collect the precious Morkite Seeds.\n\nManagement advises that you familiarize yourself with the mission details in the Miners Manual prior to your first descent. Good luck!", "summary": "Hello Miners, Welcome to SEASON 05 - DRILLING DEEPER!\nManagement\u2019s got their sights set on mineral riches deeper down toward Hoxxes\u2019 core, which means we\u2019re increasing your depth of operations. You\u2019re venturing down deeper than ever before, claiming unprecedented treasures for the company, and confronting all the lethal horrors that stand in your way.\nIn other words, it\u2019s another great day at work.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-season-5-drilling-deeper", "videos": [{"id": 116723, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aNCFfpIzZU8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNCFfpIzZU8", "title": "Deep Rock Galactic: Season 05 - Narrated Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aNCFfpIzZU8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
