Due to the CD-ROM format of PlayStation it has longer load times in comparison to the Super Nintendo version.\n\nIn Japan, it was available in both a standalone release and as part of Final Fantasy Collection, while in North America it was available only as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. In Europe it was sold only as a standalone release.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-vi--4", "videos": [{"id": 107987, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "s0-ZEJOGqY4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0-ZEJOGqY4", "title": "Final Fantasy VI - Intro Cinematic", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s0-ZEJOGqY4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 107988, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Q6MkTwkTye0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6MkTwkTye0", "title": "Final Fantasy Anthology: FF6 ...
