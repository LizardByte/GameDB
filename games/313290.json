But why stop at detailing your dream machine when you can also draft licenses and traffic tickets, label trophies and ribbons, and create flags and license plates?\n\nFrom the main access screen, you can visit the Print Shop to create a newsletter, greeting cards, business cards, letterhead, and postcards; the DMV to make licenses and license plates and issue tickets; Victory Lane for ribbons, trophies, banners, and flags; and the Customizing Garage where you customize your cars.\n\nThe customization features include choosing the colors for your car from eight available, placing decals and adding different styles of tires, muffler pipes, spoilers, and weapons. Licenses, ribbons, and trophies can be personalized including imported photos for licenses. Also, traffic tickets can be created using traditional violations or personalized to include \"special violations,\" such as \"Dad didn't take me to the movies...$20 fine.\" Everything you create can be saved and printed.\n\nHot Wheels Custom Car Designer CD-ROM sports a basic point-and-click interface and has no demanding PC requirements. Anyone familiar with MS Paint will be able to make use of the variety of creativity applications.
