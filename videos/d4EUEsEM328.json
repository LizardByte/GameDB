{"id": "d4EUEsEM328", "snippet": {"title": "SNES Longplay - Donkey Kong Country", "description": "101% longplay (this game has an extra %, it's a tradition with the DKC games). All bonus rooms and KONG letters are shown.\n\nThere is a bit of a weird glitch involving the KONG letters that happens a few times throughout this longplay. Basically what happens is this: I get a certain number of KONG letters, I collect three animal tokens, I play an animal mini-game and then get taken back to the main level. When I get the next KONG letter, the game acts like I didn't get the previous KONG letters that I got before the animal mini-game! This glitch isn't game-breaking or anything, but it may confuse some people. So if you see the game acting like I didn't collect certain KONG letters, rest assured that I actually did get them.\n\nThis was recorded on an emulator (snes9x) with a USB controller in one sitting; no save states or re-recording tools were used. I died a bunch of times during the recording, but the deaths have all been edited out, so none of them appear in the video.\n\nLastly, it's probably best that I explain what I did from 1:04:21 - 1:04:32. In the level Oil Drum Alley, in one of its bonus rooms you have to get three bananas, then a barrel will appear. You then have to use that barrel to break the right wall to enter a bonus room within a bonus room (!). To do it properly you need to grab the barrel as soon as you can, then hold right while jumping. This is kind of tricky to pull off if you don't know what you're doing, so I thought I'd bring mention to it in case it confuses anyone.\n\nCredit to Ocean Blais & PokeDigiFighter11013 for the time stamps:\n\nKongo Jungle\n\nJungle Hijinxs 0:54\nRopey Rampage 2:27\nReptile Rumble 4:26\nCoral Capers 5:59\nBarrel Cannon Canyon 8:17\nVery Gnawty 11:19\n\nMonkey Mines\n\nWinky's Walkway 11:47\nMine Cart Carnage 14:08\nBouncy Bonanza 15:44\nStop & Go Station 17:50\nMillstone Mayhem 19:53\nMaster Necky 23:46\n\nVine Valley\n\nVulture Culture 24:16\nTree Top Town 26:43\nForest Frenzy 30:47\nTemple Tempest 33:28\nOrangutan Gang 36:38\nClam City 40:28\nQueen B. 43:49\n\nGorilla Glacier\n\nSnow Barrel Blast 44:44\nSlipslide Ride 47:30\nIce Age Alley 52:14\nCroctopus Chase 54:27\nTorchlight Trouble 57:47\nRope Bridge Rumble 1:00:48\nReally Gnawty 1:03:02\n\nKremkrok Industries Inc.\n\nOil Drum Alley 1:03:37\nTrick Track Trek 1:07:04\nElevator Antics 1:11:12\nPoison Pond 1:14:38\nMine Cart Madness 1:19:32\nBlackout Basement 1:21:46\nBoss Dumb Drum 1:26:04\n\nChimp Caverns\n\nTanked Up Trouble 1:27:04\nManic Mincers 1:30:11\nMisty Mine 1:32:48\nLoopy Lights 1:37:30\nPlatform Perils 1:40:03\nMaster Necky Snr. 1:43:06\n\nFinal Boss 1:43:46", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d4EUEsEM328/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d4EUEsEM328/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d4EUEsEM328/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d4EUEsEM328/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d4EUEsEM328/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay - Donkey Kong Country", "description": "101% longplay (this game has an extra %, it's a tradition with the DKC games).
