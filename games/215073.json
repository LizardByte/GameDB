The general rules are followed. The character can be steered around the court and two buttons are used: one for a hard shot and another for a light one. When hitting the ball the direction of the shot can also be determined. When a shot seems out of reach it is possible to perform a type of dive, but this has a recovery time usually long enough to miss the next shot when it returns. The players cannot collide or hinder each other.\n\nThere are eight characters to choose from, each from a different country. The first player to score nine points wins the game. A single credit is not necessarily sufficient to complete an entire game. After too many faults an additional credit is required to continue playing. When a serve takes too long a clock appears. Games consist of a series of matches against an opponent who becomes more difficult with each match.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/squash-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 74158, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LpjzRvNWIGQ"}]}
