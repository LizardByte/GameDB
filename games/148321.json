Each fly talks about its life, about some things that happened to them, and about some almost philosophical thoughts they had. Be prepared to experience some very unusual content, some interesting thoughts that go way beyond the normal life of a fly, and some entertaining short stories with a twist.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/life-of-fly-2"}
