You need to set up defenses to slow the tide of violent animals, while you begin a search for a lasting solution. \n \nThis game is a unique fusion of tower defense strategy and visual novel, with branching dialogue and four different endings. As you play, the AI uses machine learning to discover what offense is the best against specific defenses. It takes into account the pathing, water hazards, and even the genetics of the animals which it controls indirectly by selecting the best specimens from its own evolving evaluation.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-abbattoir-intergrade"}
