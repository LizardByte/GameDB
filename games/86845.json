Whether they're cute hamsters or guinea pigs, sweet bunnies, playful cats or cuddly dogs: they all want to be cared for with love and adopted by the right owners. \n\n\n\nANIMAL CARE\n\nMany of your rescues didn't always have it easy in their lives, but luckily they at least found their way to you. After an initial examination to determine current health conditions and to establish any necessary treatment, life in the animal rescue can begin. Take care of your little friend with food and water and make sure that they always have fresh litter. When they have everything they need, pretty soon they'll feel fit as a fiddle again!\n\n\nTAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PETS\n\nOf course the animals are in the best possible hands with you, but they do eventually need a real home. As soon as the head of the animal rescue, a grumpy professor, puts you in charge of the animal adoption process, it's your job to find the most suitable new animal owner. \n\nThere is no better way to teach soon to be pet owning children the responsibilities that will come with their new charge.
