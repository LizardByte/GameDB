Racing welcomes you to the planet Polygon-4, where deadly vehicles of the distant future compete, swishing planet\u2019s dusty atmosphere at a tremendous pace. Years ago humans along with the Arlings used Polygon-4 for a number of military experiments, but later left the test complex. However, the intelligent machines, AIMs, continue to fulfill objectives they are programmed for: further evolution and self-perfection. AIMs of the Reckoners clan built a network of tracks to test multi-purpose combat machines in action.\n\nIf you are not afraid of awesome speed, fatal traps and plasma charges, tearing apart your racing glider\u2019s sheeting, A.I.M. Racing is a game of your choice. There is no need to save money to buy a new glider, no need to think, where you can acquire energy supply for a more powerful canon. The clan will give you everything \u2013 but you must win!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 7945, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "wXA6-hW5u3k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXA6-hW5u3k", "title": "A.I.M.
