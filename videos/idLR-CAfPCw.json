His background is unknown, but he was in possession of documents indicating that he was sent to Kanai Ward as a detective-in-training at an agency in the city. He participates in ongoing investigations. A lack of self-confidence results in a tendency to frequently complain.

She usually appears in her spirit form. Only visible to Yuma, Shinigami is constantly floating and bobbing along at his side.

In the Mystery Labyrinth she transforms into a humanoid form and has the power to intervene in matters.\n\n#raincode", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/idLR-CAfPCw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/idLR-CAfPCw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/idLR-CAfPCw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/idLR-CAfPCw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/idLR-CAfPCw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE Plus Announcement Trailer | PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Steam", "description": "Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE Plus is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.\nEnjoy a brand new dark fantasy detective action game from the minds behind the Danganronpa series!\n\n\"Plus\" features:\n- 4K compatibility & improved overall performance\n- New gallery mode to enjoy cinematics and BGM\n- 4 previously released DLC:\nCh.
