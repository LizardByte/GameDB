You play as the titular Teacup, a shy and introverted young frog who loves drinking tea and reading. The day before she is to host a tea party at her house, she realizes she is completely out of tea, and thus must venture into the woods around her to find the herbs she needs to restock her pantry.\nTo do so, the player will have to explore the world and talk to the different animals who live in the forest, helping them with their errands or completing small favors. During Teacup's expedition, the player will also encounter a variety of mini-games, ranging from simple puzzles to action based challenges.\nTeacup\u2019s journey is non-linear; once the initial area has been completed, the map opens up and the player is free to explore at their leisure, tackling the list of herbs they must find in any order they wish. Backtracking is encouraged; as you meet and talk to new animals, you will learn more about the world and open up new options and possibilities in already visited areas.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/83uCOkBsHqE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/83uCOkBsHqE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/83uCOkBsHqE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Teacup - The MIX Next Introduction Video", "description": "\"Teacup\" is a narrative driven adventure game with a focus on exploration and non-linear progression.
