The game deals with devils and angels and the game is a cross of a standard medieval/olden day RPG with a style kind of like Megami Tensei. The monsters are drawn in a way that strongly resembles the style of MT/SMT from the 16-bit era. You can even talk to monsters and convince them to give you gifts or run away, etc.  \r\n\r\nStorywise, I won't get long winded, but generally speaking TnU is a romantic love story between a young human male named Reyard Lauer (Reiaado) and an angel named Curana Laetice and the demonic forces of the underworld which ends up dealing with God and Satan...so yeah. Even the plot devices (at least regarding gods and devils) seems Megami Tensei-ish. You can gain levels ups like traditional RPGs, buy items, etc...but regarding leveling up, there is another way that you gain levels besides fighting.\r\n\r\nDuring a few preset \"checkpoints\" in the game, your entire party automatically gains level-ups. For example, after a boss, your party may gain eight level ups. Not just a total of eight either, EVERYONE gets eight levels. Also, while I haven't done it personally, according to a few japanese websites I've visited, there is a bug that occurs if you overtrain at various points in the game. If you encounter one of these \"checkpoints\"  and your level is a specific level or higher, your party doesn't just get level ups...the whole party goes to level 99! You can even do this at the first checkpoint if you are like level 9 or something. \r\n\r\nThe level up thing is actually explained in the manual too (though I don't think the level 99 bug is, as it wasn't intentional). Supposedly, it was to curb the difficultly at points in the game and allow for smoother game progression so one can focus on the story...wow. Anyway, this game has some cool enemy designs and an awesome soundtrack. Some folks from Wolf Team I believe also had to do with this game's soundtrack (which sounds like Tales of Phantasia in some spots).\r\n\r\nJust look at some links below for more information:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.super-famicom.jp/data/te/tensi.html (level 99)\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenshi_no_Uta (Wiki)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LKiN-nVtTW4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LKiN-nVtTW4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LKiN-nVtTW4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Tenshi no Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori Game Sample - SNES/SFC", "description": "Original Air Date: May 26th, 2009\r\n\r\nThis is the somewhat strange \"Tenshi no Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori\" (\u5929\u4f7f\u306e\u8a69 \u767d\u304d\u7ffc\u306e\u7948\u308a), for the Super Famicom.
