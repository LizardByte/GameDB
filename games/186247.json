A thing they had never seen - only known from the childrens\u2019 tales they were told in their youth. It was said in these myths that with ember one could perform the most miraculous feats. Very quickly rumours spread of this ember - kings, queens, warriors, and other powers sought this small amount of ember so that they might unravel its mysteries and claim its power for their own. A terrible war broke out leaving all peoples of the Old Kingdoms seeking for a safe place to live in peace. Most went south, east, or west, due to the looming threat of the Darklands to the north. A place where few have wandered and even fewer have returned - those who did return were not the same for they were no longer sane; their minds were left somewhere beneath the dark boughs of the Darklands. The players in Embers Adrift are some of the few who have made the treacherous journey across the Darklands, maintained their sanity, and found Newhaven waiting for them; though new dangers and adventures await them north of the wall, they have found a little peace in Newhaven.", "summary": "Join an MMORPG focused on group gameplay, challenge, and immersion - ignite your adventure in Embers Adrift.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "videos": [{"id": 62833, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JhNWubOkkhk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhNWubOkkhk", "title": "Embers Adrift: A New MMORPG - Official Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JhNWubOkkhk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62834, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "erVKOAH4TRY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erVKOAH4TRY", "title": "Embers Adrift - Gritty Gameplay with Elloa & Drindin EP1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/erVKOAH4TRY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
