The game utilizes the M.U.G.E.N engine, but unlike other MUGEN games all of the sprites are made entirely by scratch. This not only gives the game a uniform and \"professional\" artstyle, but it also allows for better control of balance.\n\nDevelopment for the game started in 2005, but was halted for several years before being quietly discontinued. In June of 2018, Ahuron released a prototype of the game from 2011 that featured the four marquee characters. At least two updates featuring more characters and stages are planned for release soon after, but beyond that, the game will receive no further updates or bug fixes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/card-sagas-wars", "videos": [{"id": 39345, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Vor1djq9b18"}, {"id": 39346, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3SfSKgNg2MU"}, {"id": 39347, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "UDjeO1wCJmo"}, {"id": 39348, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "e5ePGaDh1iw"}]}
