One day her mother asks them to clean their warehouse, where they find a silver mirror among the other antique stuff. Just before they go out, a thunder strikes outside and Aoi gets absorbed into the mirror. When she opens her eyes Aoi finds herself back in 1873, the Meiji era... and in front of her is a group of travelling performers, Aoiza.\n\nAoi immediately notices an older Sousuke in the group, but he introduces herself as Kaminari Kensuke and tells her she\u2019s got the wrong person. For some reason the group also keeps calling her \u201cFutaba Aoi\u201d, making her even more confused. She follows Aoiza back to their headquarter, a shop called Miyoshino in Ueno, where she finally learns that \u201cFutaba Aoi\u201d is actually a sacred stone they\u2019ve been protecting all this time. It\u2019s a family crest with a strong magical power, but nobody knows of its existence except for Aoiza\u2019s members. Today the stone suddenly disappeared from its box, and they finally found it on Aoi\u2019s wrist. Because of this, they now think she\u2019s the embodiment of \u201cFutaba Aoi\u201d itself.\nAs for Aoi herself, she was born holding that stone. Her grandma said it might bring good luck to her someday, so Aoi keeps it with her all the time. Who would have thought that it\u2019s going to play an important role in the past? The Aoiza members then asks her to stay with them, since she doesn\u2019t know anything about this world. Plus, it would be easier for them to protect the stone as well. Aoi gladly takes their offer, and it marks the start of her journey with them.", "summary": "Bunmei Kaika: Aoiza Ibunroku is an otome game, developed by HuneX and published by FuRyu, which was released in Japan in 2011.\n\nMito Aoi is a normal high school student living in a shrine with her childhood friend, Kaminari Sousuke.
