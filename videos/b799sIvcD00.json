Fill a cube factory with a variety of devices and program them to work together to produce the required cubes. Go back and tweak your solutions to make them increasingly efficient, and see how your solutions compare to your friends and other players across the world.\n\nDesign Factories\nFill a series of workstations with devices that can either alter a cube, such as spray painters, panel removers, and payload adders, or that can react to a cube's state, including weighers, and lasers that react to colour. Program each workstation to manipulate and alter cubes and use the reactive devices to branch the flow of logic.\n\nPursue Efficiency\nCompete against your friends and the rest of the world to produce the quickest, or simplest, or least wasteful solution to each puzzle.\n\nSave (or rule!) the Galaxy\nCubes have become the galaxy's most important commodity, a fact that some intend to exploit to their own advantage. Track down the conspiracy, infiltrate it, and bring it down. Or don't, and take your place amongst the new rulers.\n\n\n\n\nHexahedra soundtrack by James Elsey: https://www.jameselseymusic.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b799sIvcD00/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b799sIvcD00/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b799sIvcD00/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b799sIvcD00/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Hexahedra Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Add Hexahedra to your Steam wishlist: https://s.team/a/1248420\nitch.io store page: https://sidequestninja.itch.io/hexahedra\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/BfYyvgC\n\nHexahedra is an open-ended programming puzzle game.
