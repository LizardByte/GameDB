Grab your magic staff and find yourself in the shoes of a necromancer working as a bouncer in a nightclub. Every day he selflessly crawls the dungeon club only to do it over and over again in an endless loop of despair. You\u2019ll face hordes of enemies who have been unleashed during your absence from the workplace. It's time to show these pathetic dogs who's in charge!\n\nRemember the golden years when you ran home as fast as you could after school so you could play your favorite games on the computer or console until your parents got home from work? Thanks to NecroBouncer you are sure to have a lot of old-school slash and dash fun.\n\nThere will be a long path through winding corridors, clearing room after room of miserable \u2013 and not so \u2013 enemies, to eventually clash in an epic battle with hardcore bosses, each with his unique style and mechanics. Defeating them will not only open up a further path, but also provide access to new abilities and skills. You\u2019ll have the chance to collect gems containing the power of the bosses, to turn the brawl to your advantage later.\n\nDungeon Interior Designer Simulator\nDying for an adventure?
