Now, the online experience has become even more explosive with the release of the Combustible Map Pack, a collection of three new maps for Gears of War 2 available now on Xbox LIVE Marketplace for 800 MS Points.\n\nDebuted during the SPIKE TV Video Game Awards on Dec. 14, where Gears of War 2 took home the Best Shooter and Best Xbox 360 Game awards, Microsoft Game Studios and Epic Games unveiled exclusive footage from the Combustible Map Pack with Marisa Miller (Sports Illustrateds 2008 Swimsuit Issue cover model) and Gears of War 2s Augustus Cole Train Cole (played by Lester Speight) presenting the first look at the new maps.\n\nThe Combustible Map Pack unleashes three new multiplayer maps: Flood, Gold Rush and Fuel Station.\n\n    * Flood is a very tight map that's made extra snug when the environmental hazard of Imulsion begins creeping up around the edges. As the playing field closes in, the firefight will intensify as combat is forced to the center of the map. Teams skilled at flanking their opponents will have a powerful edge.\n    * Gold Rush takes place in an old Imulsion refinery that now serves as a hotly contested battleground. Players must survive heavy crossfire as they infiltrate the factory and navigate multiple tiers. Breakable glass allows for a clean shot at those who make a dash for the Longshot rifle while bolder players make their run for the heavy weapon. In the right hands, the Mortar can be devastating on this map, so keep those smoke grenades armed as the concussive effect comes in very handy.\n    * Fuel Station is situated in a desolate area marked by an abandoned fossil fuel station. The team that secures and controls the station is likely to be the side that wins the match. An especially strategic location on this map is the rooftop, as there are only two points of entry  the main elevator and a staircase on the back side of the building. Heavy weaponry is situated right in front, which presents a high risk to reward ratio in this level. Lugging the Mulcher around, deploying it and revving it up can keep an entire team at bay, and unleashing hell from the rooftops is always an excellent tactic. \n\nAll of the multiplayer maps in the Combustible Map Pack are playable in the highly popular, five player co-op Horde mode.\n\nGears of War 2 is the best-selling console game in the US (November NPD data) and has been named the 'best Xbox 360 game ever' by GamePro magazine. Gears of War 2 is available exclusively on Xbox 360 and is rated M for Mature by the ESRB.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/17tUVBNVDbY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/17tUVBNVDbY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/17tUVBNVDbY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[Rated M] Gears of War 2: Combustible Pack - Spike TV Trailer - Dec. 14, '08", "description": "From/De: Microsoft\n\nPlayers will be able to enjoy the all new exhilarating action in the first Gears of War 2 downloadable content mere hours following its exclusive premiere during the SPIKE TV Video Game Awards\n\nMore than 1.5 million people were drawn to Gears of War 2 on Xbox LIVE during its first weekend, logging over 15 million gameplay hours and driving a new record for concurrent users.
