A beta build of the cartridge version of Brett Hull NHL Hockey was released by B&C Computervisions on January 9, 2004 for US$50. Brett Hull NHL Hockey is a ice hockey game that is played from a vertical perspective in a two-dimensional environment with sprites. Most of the rules from the sport are present in the title, though they can be disabled from the menu and in-game options. Some of the gameplay options found within the game include an exhibition match, regular season and playoff competitions, among other modes of play. The announcer, Al Michaels, makes commentary during gameplay and announces Brett Hull by name but other players are only called by their respective jersey number due to the lack of the NHL license, while his commentaries can also be turned off on the options menu. Season progress is only kept via password and there is also a two-player option for every mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brett-hull-nhl-hockey"}
