Ryu Yamada holds the special power to copy a witch's power and he's been using this to solve the many issues that pop-up at the school. One day, Ryu and his friends are hanging out at the Occult Club as usual. But when Miyabi brings up a rumor involving time travel, Ryu brushes it off as being unrelated to witches and their powers. On the way home from school, just outside the gates, Ryu feels someone tap on his shoulder. He turns around, but there's nobody there. Thinking it must have been his imagination, he continues on his way home only to find his house is gone! It turns out, he's travelled in time!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-witch-in-time-yamada-kun-to-nananin-no-majo"}
