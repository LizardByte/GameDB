Enemy encounters, items, areas and treasures are all carefully designed to bring you a series of engaging, well thought-out puzzles that are a joy to solve. There is no grinding and each area is a completely unique experience. Movement is turn-based, and you may play as quickly or slowly as you want. Play this game to relax and contemplate, or take advantage of its large depth and optional elements of challenge and replayability.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/drod-rpg-tendrys-tale", "videos": [{"id": 79297, "video_id": "6S2WzECQazU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S2WzECQazU", "title": "DROD RPG: Tendry's Tale trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6S2WzECQazU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
