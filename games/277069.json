It is a very strange world in\nthere... Mario, inside, asks you to help get him out of there using the controller connected to the box. It is up to\nyou to lead Mario out of the Unworld and back to the real world in time to stop Bowser! Expect some humorous comments\nand a some-what storyline within this.\n\nTo get to Bowser in the regular, just getting one normal exit after another path, will take you 33 exits. However, if you are a player\nwho likes looking for secret exits, finding new Overworld areas and paths, then you will have a whole 93 exits to find.\nI only used Lunar Magic and the instant Death blocks in this hack, so I would call it a vanilla hack (I guess?) This hack\nhas, in my opinion and that of others', a very nice difficulty curve, where it is pretty easy in the beginning and slowly gets much much harder.\nMany levels have hidden bonuses and secret surprises... So, what are you waiting for? Download this and have fun!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-unworld"}
