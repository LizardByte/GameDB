This establishes the humorous tone of subsequent narrative, which has little to do with history and a lot to do with pretty high school girls. The game has no real story, being instead composed of five unrelated vignettes, short episodes that feature a sexy high school girl, a male protagonist (named \"God\" by default), and various comical and erotic situations under different circumstances: meeting in a school, haunted house, crowded train station, etc.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kounai-shasei-vol-dot-1-yonimo-h-na-monogatari"}
