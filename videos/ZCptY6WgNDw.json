But it soon becomes clear that the game is a mask for something much bigger. Twist after twist as the layers go deeper and deeper until finally... well, we honestly have no idea what's going on in this thing.\n\nAs seen at:\nFantasia International Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, The Actors Awards, The Los Angeles Comedy Festival, Telluride Horror Show, Ridgway Independent Film Festival, The Fantasy Film Festival, Art Blocks International Film Festival, Hollywood Shortsfest, the Los Angeles Film Awards, and Buffer Festival.\n\nWe're Chris W. Smith and Jack De Sena (aka Chris & Jack). We've been friends for years and love making high-quality, high-concept sketch comedy. Chris was a Blue Man in Blue Man Group. Jack voiced Sokka in Avatar the Last Airbender. In 2016 we united to create this channel, confusingly titled \u201cChris & Jack\u201d, which has served as a shared platform to write, produce, direct, edit, and star in our own stuff. We're releasing comedic sketches of all shapes and sizes the first and third Friday of every month. Sci-Fi, Heists, animation, movie tropes, absurdist bits, and plenty of fun new experiments. But above all else, friendship.\n\nIf you'd like to help us make future shorts and sketches, please support our Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/chrisandjack \n\nCheck out all our stuff: https://chrisandjack.komi.io/\n-Merchandise: https://www.pixelempire.com/collections/chris-and-jack\n-Our podcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjHQDpOQYcsbahkI2yAmxjw\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisandjacksketch\n     (Chris) https://www.instagram.com/chrissmithwho\n     (Jack) https://www.instagram.com/jackdesena\n-Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisandjackarechrisandjack\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisAndJack/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/sBVGdmg\n\nCAST:\n\nAgent 17 - Jack De Sena\nGamer & Evil Bee - Chris W.
