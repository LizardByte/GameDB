Take this manual and start your adventures!\"\nNo one could have imagined that mine adventure legends was about to begin.\n\n\"Let\u2019s build our house today! There's wood and stone everywhere. Come on!\"\nNo one ever did chopping, mining or carpentry, but it was as if we have been given the magic by the land, and everyone learned to master all sorts of skills. Wood and stone were transported to the worktable, crafted into boards and bricks, and a two-story building slowly formed with the sweat from everyone.\nAs night fell, a mysterious mist filled the air. As Xiaxia said, a group of small demons with green flames appeared in the mist, but the fire in front of their homes made them dare not go further. But survival is only the first step, more adventures are waiting for us! Hope we can build a big clan some day!\n\nAfter the home was built, everyone can't wait to explore the world. In order to bring the wild horses back to clan, let\u2019s prepare horse feed first. There was a faint smell of carrot and wheat balls baked with a soft fire, and several horses came to us, rubbed our hands and ate happily. Lightly on the back of the horse, let the sun shine on the shoulders, we planned to go to explore the wilderness tomorrow! Can\u2019t wait to ride a dragon in the future!\n\nMount and weapon are ready, and nothing can stop us from exploring.\nIt is said that in the islands, forests, deserts and snow-capped mountains, the treasure left by the creator gods is now guarded by monsters, dragons and Evils.\nFor about half a day north, a ruin was visible, and a troop of skeletons wandered through the wreckage, with a golden chest in the middle. The clash began, the seemingly vulnerable skeletons were so powerful unexpectedly. Finally we beat them, after opening the treasure chest, a gem appeared with its soft light, as if healing our wounds.\n\nI have climbed the most remote ruins, sailed to the most romantic heart island, even cut off the teeth of the dragon, but I still need more friends, do things we enjoy together, do you want to come together?", "summary": "Utopia: Origin is a survival MMORPG where you get to delve deep into a huge fantasy world and do basically whatever you want: fight against monsters, talk to other players, build all kinds of buildings, explore inhospitable areas, and much more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/utopia-origin", "videos": [{"id": 59738, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0NGoedbDhyY"}]}
