Preschoolers help Pooh throw a birthday party and attend Christopher Robin's friendship celebration, while learning lessons about sharing and friendship. Preschoolers gain an understanding of letter and number recognition, phonics, sequencing, and more through a magical Winnie the Pooh story-based journey in the 100 Acre Wood. \n\nAs preschoolers help Pooh throw a birthday party and attend Christopher Robin's friendship celebration, they obtain lessons on the importance of friendship and helping others. Winnie the Pooh is his usual befuddled self and just can't remember what it is that he's forgotten. After a period of some very tough thinking, he recalls that it's Eeyore's birthday, and he better get ready for the party. \n\nBeautiful graphics and delightful narration set the stage for this adventure in which children play six games to help Pooh prepare for Eeyore's party. The activities are nicely integrated into the storyline. Rabbit, for instance, can't come to the party unless all of his vegetable jars are labeled. Kids help him by matching number labels to the number of objects in each jar. To free Piglet up to make the birthday cake, children color pictures by matching the colors of a model. To help Tigger get the party music ready, children use their listening skills as they match the sounds of musical pipes. \n\nChildren practice their alphabet skills with Kanga and Roo and are also exposed to exercises in counting, sequencing and categorization. After they complete each activity, a gift is presented at Eeyore's birthday table. The program culminates in his party, of course! In addition to the engaging activities, children will appreciate that they can print out workbook pages, stickers, bookmarks, concentration cards and ID cards, all featuring Winnie the Pooh artwork. The breadth and depth of the CD is a real strength, with three adjustable levels of difficulty for each game- making it perfect for toddlers and preschoolers alike. \n\n-- Uploader's Notes --\nWinnie the Pooh Preschool is a 1999 Disney educational computer game featuring Winnie the Pooh and his friends.
