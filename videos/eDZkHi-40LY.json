The branching paths are missing and the music is all pulled directly from Mighty Final Fight (https://youtu.be/as22LRnVDK4 ), but still, this is a shockingly close recreation of Final Fight 3.\n\nThough there are fewer characters on the screen at once and sprite flicker runs rampant (enough so that it makes the 2P modes hard to play), the sprites all closely resemble their 16-bit counterparts, and there are just enough animation frames to make everything flow well enough that the gameplay doesn't feel *too* far removed from the SNES game.  \n\nYou can run by double-tapping the d-pad and the special moves are still here, as are the basic punch-punch-whack combos, jump kicks, and even a few of the grapples/throws made the cut. Not everything was kept - Haggar's spinning piledriver, for example, is MIA - but some cuts, of course, were to be expected.\n\nIt's clear that the game is pushing the NES far, far beyond it's comfort zone, but the game does a fantastic job of balancing its ambition with overall playability. Sprite flicker aside, this plays better than you'd ever expect from the NES. I daresay it stays truer to the spirit of Final Fight than Capcom's own Mighty Final Fight ever did.\n\nThe NES was never designed to do anything like this, and I was blown away by just how much was achieved with Final Fight 3. If you ever doubted just what could be done on such limited hardware, give this one a try. \n_____________\r\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \r\n\r\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eDZkHi-40LY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eDZkHi-40LY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eDZkHi-40LY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eDZkHi-40LY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Final Fight 3 (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of JY Team's 1998 unlicensed beat 'em up for the NES, Final Fight 3.\n\nPlayed through as Haggar on the normal difficulty level. \n\nFinal Fight 3 was the final NES/Famicom game developed by Hummer Team (the guys responsible for games like Kart Fighter and Somari), and as the name indicates, it's a \"demake\" of the 1995 Capcom Super Famicom game of the same name (https://youtu.be/7rHaWPh5EZI ).\n\nThe game features many of the stages from the original, all four main characters are still playable, the between-stage cutscenes are still here, and it even retains the two-player simultaneous and \"2P Auto\" options of the original game.
