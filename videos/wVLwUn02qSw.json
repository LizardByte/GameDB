Interstellar space battles, creatures big as planets, looting & upgrading and much more awaits.\n\nThis free update adds two new ships - the Pandora and the Iris - with unique characteristics, a Relaxed Mode, and an Autosave feature.\n\nTWO NEW SHIPS:\n\ud83e\udea8The Pandora: Aggressive but nimble, the Pandora is powered by Meteorite Thrusters, giving it the unique ability to ram other ships to deal heavy damage. The Pandora is equipped with a Surge Laser, Parasite Blaster, and Swarm Missile, enabling it to deal double damage in close combat, recharge its shield after a successful hit, or attack multiple targets simultaneously.\n\n\ud83d\udca5The Iris: Built for strategy, the Iris can use special Blink Thrusters to teleport between waypoints, dropping explosives that detonate when an enemy comes within proximity. The Iris is equipped with a Sniper Blaster, Link Laser, and Odin Missile, letting players pick enemies off from afar, quickly manage crowd control, or deal massive damage in one hit.\n\nRELAXED MODE: \nIn this mode, ship damage is reduced, ammunition is increased, the currency threshold is raised, and shops will offer more items. All options can be individually adjusted with multiple levels, allowing players to tune the game\u2019s difficulty.\n\nAUTOSAVE\nGhost Signal: A Stellaris Game now autosaves at the start of each sector. Players can pick up where they left off with the Continue Game option, or start a new journey by choosing the Abandon Game option. Autosave is automatically enabled for all players.\n\nFollow @GhostSignalVR here:\n\ud83e\ude90 Twitter - https://twitter.com/GhostSignalVR \n\ud83e\ude90 Facebook - https://facebook.com/GhostSignalVR \n\ud83e\ude90 Instagram - https://instagram.com/GhostSignalVR \n\nRead more on https://www.fasttravelgames.com/games/ghost-signal", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVLwUn02qSw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVLwUn02qSw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVLwUn02qSw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVLwUn02qSw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVLwUn02qSw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ghost Signal: A Stellaris Game | Fleet Expansion Trailer | Meta Quest 2 + 3 + Pro", "description": "Get one of the best rated action rougelites on the Meta Quest Store today: https://metaque.st/3IiBAhg\n\nGhost Signal: A Stellaris Game is an action-packed roguelite in space, where you control a spaceship on a quest to find a mysterious signal that seems to defy death.
