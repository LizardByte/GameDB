Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/revelation"}
