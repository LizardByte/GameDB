Screens, enemy and item placement, palettes, text, and more are all changed. The primary goal was to make the game more playable - the discerning player will note the careful placement of platforms and enemies to make jumps easier. However, beating the game will not be a cinch. Items are much more difficult to get, corridors are contorted into winding mazes, and many of the energy tanks have been completely eliminated.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metroid-x"}
