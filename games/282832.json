One day, she encountered a couple of zombies during a walk, tracking their source back to a cave. Kalia proceeded to explore the caves, eventually finding an entrance into a complex of ancient ruins, but getting trapped within in the process.\n\nWith no way back, Kalia must venture further into the ruins in search of another exit. But fortune turns to her favor when she discovers an ancient Fire Staff. Kalia immediately attunes to the staff's energy, becoming able to wield its fire powers. But the staff's energy has been weakened from several millenia of disuse. In order to escape the underground, Kalia must embark on a journey through the remains of a lost civilization, fight increasingly more capable foes, and unlock the staff's true potential.\n\nUse your abilities to burn your foes! Create and spread fires to amplify your powers, but be careful not to let it out of control. Solve puzzles and navigate the ruins in search of your way out!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kalia-and-the-fire-staff"}
