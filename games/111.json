Shortly after waking, Daniel finds a note written by himself that explains how he purposely made himself forget his past, because he couldn't handle losing his innocence, so he wanted to forget it all. The note urges Daniel to descend into the castle's Inner Sanctum and murder a man named Alexander , the baron of the castle. The note gives a final warning that a \"living nightmare\" is chasing him, and Daniel must escape it for as long as he can because there is no way to fight back.", "summary": "Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a survival horror video game by Frictional Games.
