What this amounts to is viewing one of three softcore pornographic colour still images through a small (viewfinder) window, panning across the image with mouse movements and zooming in or out with the buttons. The player can press R to record so that later on, the game can reproduce the particular combination of camera moves (or: their \"adult film\") for the enjoyment of the viewer.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adult-film-cameraman"}
