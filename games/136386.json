The Black Mesa Research Facility has been shut down. The nation never got to know anything about the experiments there. The less you know, the less you worry. The government founded a new organisation to handle \"alien related topics\". They hired the best scientists, technicians and military forces worldwide, its name is Poke646.\n\nSome days ago the Poke646 scientists spotted alarming signals from the Xen homeworld. It looks as if the aliens plan to invade Nation City by opening a massive amount of portals. But the Poke646 Tech Labs are already prepared: some months ago the technicians developed a huge generator which is able to close hundreds of portals at once with a bundled energy beam. Four generators are about to be installed at the edges of Nation City. With all four activated they will form a giant beam and hopefully destroy the alien portal technology forever.", "summary": "The release of the \"Poke646: Anniversary Edition\" on Dec 21st 2016 marks the 15th anniversary of the original \"Poke646\" release and the 10th anniversary of the \"Poke646: Vendetta\" sequel release.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/poke646-anniversary-edition", "videos": [{"id": 38910, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xun8plJVXjc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xun8plJVXjc", "title": "Postcard From Nation City - The Level Design Of Poke646", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xun8plJVXjc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
