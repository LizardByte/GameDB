Sadly the game was cancelled, as we can read on the old Horny Dog website: \u201cThe Sega announcement that they were ceasing production of Dreamcast hardware wasn\u2019t much of a help, as well as the fact one or two members of our team didn\u2019t have the game\u2019s best interest at heart. [\u2026] We had spent 15 months developing the title, and although many of us felt we achieved so much, it wasn\u2019t enough to save the title.\u201d \n \nThe developer's website described Hellgate as follows: \"Imagine a crossover between Quake and WipeOut. Got that image? Hellgate meshes these two genres, with high speed at your fingertips, as well as some meaty weaponry! There will be four gigantic realms to conquer, as well as ten formidable weapons to defeat the many demons and monsters lurking within Hell.\" \n \n\"We will also be supporting Dreamcast\u2019s online capabilities with online Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Sumo and Time Trial modes, and also feature offline 4 player Deathmatch and link-up Deathmatch modes. The exciting thing is, Hellgate could well be the first Dreamcast game to support 12 \u2013 yes \u2013 12 people.\" \n \nIn March 2009, a playable beta was leaked online.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hellgate", "videos": [{"id": 47745, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "T4FBmvzJyiI"}]}
