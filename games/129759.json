He'd saved every credit he could to pay the deposit on the freighter.\n\nPerhaps in hindsight, purchasing the Belanzano wasn't the greatest plan but it was a start - he was now free to explore.\n\nAfter all he was a space captain and he belonged in space!\n\nThe freight agent on Morland had been highly skeptical, and downright wary of giving him a freight contract. But after much wrangling he managed to convince her to let the Belanzano's new captain transport a shipment of Thruster Manifolds to Kirby Station in the Grantham system.\n\nCharlie might not make a huge profit on this initial run, but at least he'd be free and once again in charge of his own destiny!\n\nOr so he thought...\n\nEverything had been running smoothly. Well, apart from the onboard A.I. ZED, which seemed to have been modified with a sarcasm personality chip. Not to mention a series of minor glitches in just about every secondary system onboard the ship. So far Charlie had been unable to disconnect the A.I. or even reboot it.\n\nAs for the other issues, they would have to wait.\n\nNothing he couldn't fix over time...\n\nCharlie woke groggily to the sound of Sirens and banging on the exterior hull plating. There was a loud explosion from somewhere aft, and all the exterior ships sensors and most of the interior ones had gone offline.\n\nIt was going to be one of those days!", "summary": "Captain Hannon: The Belanzano is a large scale sci-fi open world sandbox game.
