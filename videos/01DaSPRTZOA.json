In this game, you can become an eminent cosplayer, gamer, streamer or singer, stand out and become the legendary \"Con\" organizer, save the economy of your motherland \"Republic of Metropolises\"!\nCombining tabletop strategy cards with traditional SLG gameplay, the players are able to manage their \"Con\" company, invite booths & guests and compete with peers. On the other hand, they also need to deal with several real-time tasks (hire NPC, punish copyright infringement booths) & emergencies (fire hazard, thieves) during the Con as a responsible organizer.\nAnd of course, the game is MODable.
