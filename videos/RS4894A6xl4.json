{"id": "RS4894A6xl4", "snippet": {"title": "Rescue Mission Game Sample - Sega Master System [Light Phaser]", "description": "After I noticed a pretty suspicious lack of Light Phaser videos, I decided to put some up before retiring from the SMS (temporarily). Rescue Mission is one of the best Light Phaser games available for the system, featuring nice and colorful locales, a few interesting additions to the overall package besides just blasting everything that moves, three different difficulty settings to provide a moderate challenge, and neat tunes and ditties to round off the experience. Playing as three courageous but somewhat incompotent soldiers (Beginner Mike, Lazy Steve, and Honest John) who are the last hope in this game's war, your job is to do what the previous rescue team failed to do; ride deep into enemy territory on a handcar to treat the wounded while blasting every enemy that moves so you don't end up dead and return en masse to help the frontline. There are lots of enemies who attack in a variety of ways and you can shoot them as well as their projectiles, or run them over in your handcar. There are also traps on the rails that you must shoot. Helping wounded soldiers rewards you with items that help you live longer, but be careful; you can accidentally shoot your wounded friends! Aim for a \"No Damage\" rating and go for the highest score!\r\n\r\nThis is a sample recorded off of Sega hardware (Power Base Converter on a CDX system). Enjoy.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RS4894A6xl4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RS4894A6xl4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RS4894A6xl4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Rescue Mission Game Sample - Sega Master System [Light Phaser]", "description": "After I noticed a pretty suspicious lack of Light Phaser videos, I decided to put some up before retiring from the SMS (temporarily).
