The trail leads to an abandoned path in the mountains; Mika decides to venture there, while the other two are going back to school at night, hoping to find more clues.", "summary": "The gameplay in this sequel is identical to that of the previous entry: the player navigates the digitized images of the girls over 2D backgrounds in a side-scrolling/third-person perspective manner, searching for clues, triggering scenes, and choosing responses and/or actions when prompted by the narrative.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twilight-syndrome-kyuumei-hen"}
