You, an ex-sergeant, have signed a contract with a large mining corporation in the Belt. Mine ore, build out your outpost, travel to nearby asteroids and collaborate with other belters.\n\nOperate a mining outpost on an asteroid. Mine valuable ore from large and small rocks on the surface. Sell the ore to earn credits (the currency in the Belt in the future). Build out your mining outpost with a landing pad, drone pad, storage, solar panels, refineries, and more.\n\nThere are lots of large and small rocks on the surface that can easily be mined for ore.\n\nYou can sell the ore that you mine using the management user interface in the outpost. Just click the \"sell ore\" button, and you will sell ore at the current market price and earn credits. You can use the credits to buy upgrades, equipment, buildings, repairs, food, water, etc.\n\nWhen you have earned enough credits from selling ore, you will be able to buy a spaceship. You can now mine ore more efficiently and travel to other asteroids.\n\nAs you venture out into the Belt, you will meet others. You can earn credits by doing tasks for others.\n\nThere are several space stations scattered throughout the Belt. Most of them are owned by United Space Corporation and Utopia Arura Corporation.\n\nDrones are very useful for hauling ore and small equipment.\n\nExtractors are specialized drilling and extraction rigs that can be used to extract different types of ore beneath the surface of the asteroid.\n\nEnjoy several hours of gameplay in solitude in the Asteroid Belt, mining for ore, operating your outpost, flying your spaceship, floating in micro-gravity, etc. This may be a good game for you if you like space games and are tired of action-packed shooting games.\n\nScattered in an orbit around the sun, just beyond the orbit of Mars, are bits and pieces of rock left over from the dawn of the solar system. The asteroid belt has countless small asteroids, and between 700,000 and 1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1 km or more. The game is set somewhere in the Belt where there are several large asteroids in the proximity of each other. We have made many large high-quality asteroids of several kilometers (and several miles) in diameter. You can land on the surface of any of these asteroids and mine them. We have put quite a bit of effort into making the asteroids realistic.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/belt-colony", "videos": [{"id": 74049, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "QncgYpizO04", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QncgYpizO04", "title": "Belt Colony Coming Soon Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QncgYpizO04/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
