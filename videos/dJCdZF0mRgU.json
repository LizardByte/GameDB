I had this game on the Neo Geo CD for years and played it constantly, and with the RAM cart, the Saturn version is just as good - better, if you take into account how much the loading time was slashed by. \n\nThe game is overall a pretty standard mid-90s arcade 2D fighter. It flows well (though I would've preferred they slowed it down just a bit - it's good that they sped it up from the original, but I think it was just a bit too much), it looks pretty good, the ridiculous voices are still ridiculous, and seriously, the game that ends with a hidden last boss like this one deserves at least a raised eye brow or two. \n\nAnd for the record, I believe that Mizoguchi's death scream has to be one of the best video game sounds ever.
