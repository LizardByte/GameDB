Initially in each experiment you will see just the first trial room. Complete it to reveal more,\n\nControl Echo the Mouse with a joystick and learn his abilities as you go. Hint, it is best to start with Experiment 1.\n\nTo beat a trial room collect a piece of cheese before the time runs out. You only have 5 seconds to do this between each cheese and more of the room is revealed. Sometimes there will be more than one cheese and your choice can drastically affect the room.\n\nYou have infinite clones but must be successful to proceed. If a trial room in one experiment is proving to be too challenging, jump over to one of the other experiments instead.\n\nComplete the trials in all three experiments to win Echo's freedom.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cheesy-trials", "videos": [{"id": 104166, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LNYdMzaULTg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNYdMzaULTg", "title": "COMMODORE VIC 20 =+ CHEESY TRIALS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LNYdMzaULTg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
