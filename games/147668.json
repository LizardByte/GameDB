Drive the train back to the station safely to prevent the seals from falling into the sea. Let's get going! \u2022 How to play You are the \"seal\" of a train driver on the ocean. The train is easily affected by waves, so it is important to keep the car balanced. When you tilt the Joy-Con back and forth and left and right, the train will tilt in tandem. To prevent the seals on the ceiling of the train from falling into the sea balance your vehicles and drive safely. Orcas from rival railroads patrol the seas and attack your train with terrifying attacks. It is your mission to protect your passengers from the orcas and get them safely to the station. Bring as many passengers as possible to the station during your working hours to meet your quota! With the share of the Joy-Con, you can play cooperatively with two players on one Nintendo Switch.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/seal-electric-railway"}
