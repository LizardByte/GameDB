Heubi und M. K\u00f6hler for the Atari ST platform. War Heli is a vertical shoot 'em up in a war setting. The player pilots a helicopter through an area where he has to destroy all enemy tanks. He has to be careful not to hit any ambulances. If he does so, his score gets set to zero. War Heli is a challenging game with high standards in graphics and technique for its time. War Heli came with a then unique feature: you could save the game to the disk and continue later. Further artists of the Argonica team were: T. Steimle, R. Gafner and H.P.
