{"id": "widRDVmJIuU", "snippet": {"title": "Crazy Golf PS2 Gameplay (Phoenix Games)", "description": "Here i test out the Phoenix Games Ps2 game titled Crazy Golf. A very colourfull minature golf game that can get frustratingly addictive. \nThis is the typical game youd expect from Phoenix. Stiff controls, poor camera angles, and a never ending sound loop. But somehow they manage to pull off a half decent game with some very wacky level designs. Dont get me wrong, your not going to find a game youl return to time and time again, but when you do pick up the pad youl lose a couple of hours out of sheer determination to complete the level your stuck on. \nIts the standard stuff youd expect from a minature golf game but some of the levels here seem so impossible to complete that you just have to try and do it. But youl probably pull your hair out along the way. \nIts a nice game to own as part of the Phoenix set, and its one of the more playable games they released, but its sadly not a major player. If you like crazy golf games its worth having a laugh at.\n\nPlease leave a comment down below if youd like to see more, and please dont forget to subscribe if you havent already. \n\nThanks for watching, check out all my other videos here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SHLIMPOLE", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/widRDVmJIuU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/widRDVmJIuU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/widRDVmJIuU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/widRDVmJIuU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/widRDVmJIuU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Crazy Golf PS2 Gameplay (Phoenix Games)", "description": "Here i test out the Phoenix Games Ps2 game titled Crazy Golf.
