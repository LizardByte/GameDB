Those can be stunned by Spider-Man's iconic web substance, but touching them or other hazards in the game world will decrease his health. Another important part of the gameplay is puzzles, mostly with the goal to deactivate some of Mysterio's gimmicks to clear the path. Spider-Man can climb walls and shoot grappling hooks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-amazing-spider-man--1"}
