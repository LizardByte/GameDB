Players control a remotely operated droid tasked with shutting down the planet's security system and disposing of radioactive material. The game spans eight levels, each with its own challenges as players navigate through the planet's complex, avoiding hostile defense droids and racing against time to dispose of unstable radioactive materials. Resource management is crucial, as players must conserve fuel while using thrusters to navigate, and locate fuel supplies within the complex. To progress, players must find level passes while efficiently clearing hazardous materials, creating a tense blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and time management.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/equinox"}
