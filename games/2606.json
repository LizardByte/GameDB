It is the third title in the BloodRayne series. Unlike the previous 3D hack 'n slash games before it, this game is a 2D side scroller with HD graphic sprites and very bloody attacks. It's unknown whether or not the game takes place in the same continuity as the rest of the series as its story seems self-contained. The game has a high level of difficulty, comparable to that of games such as Ninja Gaiden and some of the achievements require hours of work to achieve.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloodrayne-betrayal", "videos": [{"id": 79633, "video_id": "Fy0trIL8pGg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0trIL8pGg", "title": "BloodRayne: Betrayal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fy0trIL8pGg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
