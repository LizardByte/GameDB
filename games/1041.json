The game retain many gameplay elements from Link's Awakening such as the graphics, audio and top-view perspective. It also features eight dungeons and a large overworld to explore like in the previous games. Oracle of Ages is said to be more puzzle-oriented than its counterpart being more action-oriented. After completing one of the two games, both can be linked to form a single linear plot with an alternate ending. Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons were often credited as being two of the top games for the Game Boy Color.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-ages", "videos": [{"id": 15525, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_nwR7WWo_yA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nwR7WWo_yA", "title": "Nintendo eShop - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_nwR7WWo_yA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 15526, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_73CVfAvZ0A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_73CVfAvZ0A", "title": "Oracle Of Ages and Seasons trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_73CVfAvZ0A/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
