The plot takes us to a space station near Jupiter, where a brave cosmonaut has to repair many broken devices. To move around, the hero uses special sucker launchers (grappling hooks-like-devices), thanks to which he can get to places inaccessible to ordinary people. Yupitergrad is a dynamic platformer with a lot of puzzles, traps and wacky humour, sunk in futuristic dieselpunk sauce. In Time Attack mode you can test your skills by competing with players from around the world to see who will achieve the best results on 20 specially built levels.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWsdjNiVVMs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWsdjNiVVMs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWsdjNiVVMs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWsdjNiVVMs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWsdjNiVVMs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Yupitergrad: Sneaki Peaki \ud83e\ude90", "description": "\u2581 \u2582 \u2584 \u2585 \u2586 \u2587 \u2588\ud83d\udca0\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude46 \ud835\ude50\ud835\ude4e \ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude4f\ud83d\udca0\u2588 \u2587 \u2586 \u2585 \u2584 \u2582 \u2581\n\ud83d\udcac\u3010\ud835\ude73\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude72\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude73\u3011https://discord.gg/ZUQfuxgjru\n\ud83d\udcf0\u3010\ud835\ude75\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude72\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude71\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude7a\u3011https://www.facebook.com/Gamedust\n\ud83e\udd86\u3010\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude86\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude81\u3011https://twitter.com/GamedustTT\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\u3010\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude74\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude7c\u3011https://store.steampowered.com/dev/GameDust\n\ud83d\udcf7\u3010\ud835\ude78\ud835\ude7d\ud835\ude82\ud835\ude83\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude76\ud835\ude81\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude7c\u3011https://www.instagram.com/gamedust_studio/\n-----------------\nGET THE GAME FOR FREE\n\u3010SideQuest\u3011 https://sidequestvr.com/app/3533/yupitergrad-sneaki-peaki\n\u3010Itch.io\u3011 https://gamedust-studio.itch.io/yupitergrad-sneaki-peaki\n\u3010Steam\u3011 https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579120\nShow your potential, candidate!\n\nBecome a real acrobat in a cosmonaut costume!
