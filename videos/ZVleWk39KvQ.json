Update 0.2 will introduce new mechanics as well as expand the open world experience of the sailing the Great Western Ocean.\n\nKhorne! \nIntroducing the first of our new fleets. Khorne sails into Warhammer\u2019s Great Western Ocean, and the world will never be the same again. There are three new ships to face off against; \nThe Ironshark has a huge mechanical shark head mounted on its bow, \nThe Bloodship is a deadly war machine with giant pincers snapping open and shut,\nThe Deathgalley sails into battle alongside the other ships and is a deadly support vessel for Khorne. \n\nBeastmen\nSailing in these vessels along with the more depraved sailors are the fearsome Beastmen, ready to face the unwary in battle.\n\nPort Attacks.\nEvery port now has tower defences, containing gun batteries, some ports such as Erengrad and Marienburg have formidable defences that only the foolish or brave would dare attack. Due to a ship\u2019s cannon spread, most of your cannon balls will likely miss the narrow target of the towers. So if you wish to become a destroyer of ports then perhaps a more specialised ship like a Hellhammer would be suitable, or any ship that fires one massive projectile.\n\nIf you successfully defeat a port you\u2019ll need to dock with it, then you\u2019ll have a choice to:\n Loot (Grabbing what you can from the ports stores)\n Raze (Destroying the port and gaining infamy and losing favour with that race)\n Cannibalize (Breaking up the port to repair your ship)\n\nWe are pushing 32 new ports into this update much, much more than we originally planned, including one extra Kislevite Port, seven Orc Ports, ten Pirate/Smugglers Ports and thirteen Bretonnian Ports. \n\nOrc Ports.\nOrc ports are floating wrecks and debris strapped together occupying the deep sea. They spawn defence fleets and raiding parties. You will be able to Loot, Raze and Cannibalize Orc Ports.\n\nPirate / Smuggler Ports.\nIf you\u2019re tired of working with the Empire and Kislev you can now turn your back on them and start the path to becoming a Pirate! Of course this will take time, you\u2019ll need to attack enemies of the Pirates, and eventually you win favour with them and be able to dock in pirate ports, trade and get new missions. You will also be able to to Loot, Raze and Cannibalize Pirate Ports if you decide the Pirate life is not for you.\n\nBretonnian Ports.\nThe open world of Man O\u2019 War: Corsair is now significantly bigger, not only is Bretonnia open for business but all 3 Bretonnia ships are purchasable and new quests are available in their ports.\n\nThe Dragon\u2019s Maw.\nIf you\u2019re venturing to L\u2019Anguille, before you see it\u2019s legendary lighthouse you may skirt the edges of the Dragon\u2019s Maw. The Maw is a massive expanse of rock formations, littered with the occasional shipwreck. It\u2019s the perfect place to lure an adversary if they outgun you. A skilled sailor can weave in and out of the rocks using them as cover.\n\nThe Black Leviathan.\nThe biggest fish in the Old World is now in the Great Western Ocean. It is so large that it can swallow most ships whole. The best tactic when faced with the Black Leviathan is to keep it at range and drive it away with cannon fire.\n\nFull list of changes;\n- Extended world bounds to include Bretonnia\n- Added port defences for all ports\n- Added ability to Loot, Raze and Cannibalise ports\n- Added Orc ports\n- Added Pirate ports\n- Added new Kislevite Port\n- Added Black Leviathan encounters\n- Added Khorne encounters\n- Added quests around Bretonnia\n- Added more music\n- Added ability to rebind keys (NB: tutorial UI not yet updated to reflect changed keys - coming soon)\n- Changed how ships and characters are streamed to prevent hitching\n- Game Time can be increased to x4 while out of combat.\n- Game Time no longer pauses on the map screen.\n- Right clicking on the map (or pressing control) will set a waypoint at the mouse position for the First Mate to steer to whenever the captain is not at the wheel.\n- Clicking on ships and ports on the map shows additional info\n- Camera is now stabilised whilst using spyglass or zoom scope\n- Mouse speed whilst zoomed is now the same on both axes", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVleWk39KvQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVleWk39KvQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVleWk39KvQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVleWk39KvQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVleWk39KvQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Man O' War: Corsair 0.2 Update trailer", "description": "Steam Store: http://store.steampowered.com/app/344240\nGoG Store: https://www.gog.com/game/man_o_war_corsair\nMacGameStore: http://www.macgamestore.com/product/5606/Man-O-War-Corsair/\nWinGameStore: http://www.wingamestore.com/product/5606/Man-O-War-Corsair/\n\nIntroducing the new update for Man O\u2019 War: Corsair.
