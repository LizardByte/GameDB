Players take the role of Ronin who makes a promise with his friend Reah that in three years, he would become a refiner and she would become a guard knight. Three years later, Ronin discovers Reah unconscious on the outskirts of his hometown and takes her home where she tells him that the Guardian of the Temple of Fire has gone out of control. Ronin goes into the Temple of Fire, finds its guard dead and defeats the guardian. Ronin returns to his village only to find that it's been attacked and Leah is missing. Ronin ventures out to find her and find out what the attackers were looking for.\n\nThe game offers three characters to play as, with Leah and Aramor unlocked after players complete the game as Ronin. Players are given two guardians out of three to choose from in the beginning of the game. These guardians allow players to use magic spells and more guardians will be available as players go through the game. Players may also buy better weapons and armor and once they equip them, the protagonist's appearance will change to show him holding the chosen sword and wearing the armor he's been equipped with. Players may combine items to create a single, more useful item, add attributes to their weapons by using orbs, as well as refine them. Refinement is risky as there's a possibility to break the protagonist's weapon and the game will save after each refining attempt.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tJxAtIGOgTY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tJxAtIGOgTY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tJxAtIGOgTY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tJxAtIGOgTY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tJxAtIGOgTY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Heroes Lore: Wind of Soltia - Walkthrough | Part 1 - Ronin (Java Game)", "description": "Released: Dec 14, 2005\n\nHeroes Lore: Wind of Soltia is an Action RPG for mobile phones.
