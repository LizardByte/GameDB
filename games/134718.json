These resource-stripping activities threaten the local flora and fauna, especially the Mountain Wampus, who get hunted for their treasure.\n\nAs a young wampus, players set out to rid Irata of the settler invaders and restore harmony to the land. While a fun lark, Wampus explores themes of environmentalism, conservationism, stewardship of the land, and the destructive nature of colonialism.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wampus", "videos": [{"id": 112364, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lLIrCjy59X0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLIrCjy59X0", "title": "Wampus DX (NES Homebrew)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lLIrCjy59X0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
