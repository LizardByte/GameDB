His friend, Tobias had repaired his house for Nick. He then told the player a story where he lost his childhood and family, when the Five Nights at Freddy's series ended.\n\nA person named Michael broke into Scott Cawthon's house, claiming that he didn't remember anything anymore. Nick, who was a child at that time, convinced his father to let him in. With no other choice, Scott decided to bring him inside while he collected his thoughts. Nick's mother, Val brought Nick to his bedroom and later stayed in the living room with his husband. They wanted to stay up all night to make sure their children is safe.\n\nWhile Val stayed in the living room, Scott left her and went to check on his children. However, while Scott is gone, Michael's voice appeared and told her to survive until 6 AM and grab her children to get out of the house immediately. Val noticed Michael knew Scott's name and found out something was wrong, but it was too late. On the other side, Scott seemed to hear Nick's screaming and quickly entered his bedroom, but the room is all pitch black. He turned back and started having hallucination. He turned away, and noticed Ignited Freddy who started chasing him. Scott tried to escape and lastly found a note in his office.\n\nAfter Scott survived until 6 AM, he went to the basement where his children seemed to be hiding in. The computer inside the basement started having weird images. While he tried to ask who is the one attacking his family, a voice came from his back and beat him into unconsciousness. The camera turned into Michael's perspective when he woke up in a toilet in a basement. This happened before he was found by Scott. He followed what the monitors in the basement told him to do, and lastly escaped the basement.\n\nThe player's perspective changed back to Scott. He was tied on a chair with a monitor in front of him. Through a speaker, Michael revealed that he is Mike Schmidt, the night guard in the first Five Nights at Freddy's. He mentioned that him and the animatronics escaped from Scott's creation, and they will need Scott's body to maintain their shape in this real world.\n\nThe house started burning, and Scott failed to escape and was killed by his creation. With Scott's body, the creation escaped the house and found Val and their children. Although he tried to hide his real identity, they noticed something was wrong with Scott.", "summary": "This is a FNaF Fan Game, FNaF is owned by Scott Cawthon.\n\nRain and thunder shake the earth, drowning it in water and loud noises.
