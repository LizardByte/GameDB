The only rule is you cant cross the line, so there's no going back. The mazes vary from level to level and also have different objectives, from the classic start to end maze to collecting items stolen from a picnic. Levels get harder the more your progress with time limits and larger more complex mazes to explore. On top of that Anthony's friends join him and you have to guide multiple ants around the maze, each with their own objectives. Later levels include boosters that let you tackle the maze in fun new ways. From blowing up new tunnel entrances with a Cookie Crumble to teleporting to other parts of the maze with a Donut Vortex and more. If you love a challenge and doing some good then Maze Rescue is the game for you.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maze-rescue"}
