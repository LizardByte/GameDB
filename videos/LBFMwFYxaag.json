It was Konami at it's best bringing over one of its most Japan-centric IPs, and everyone that played it loved it. I just wish that they hadn't waited until the N64 to translate the next game - we never got English releases of some awesome follow-ups. But still, we got this one, and it's awesome. I mean, as an little out-of-the-way mini-game it features the full first level of Gradius recreated in 16-bit. Cool stuff. And it was co-op, which was an unbelievable edition for such a game in 1991. My sister and I played this to death. We couldn't ever get over the seriously bizarre (to us) Japanese humor. I mean, a tanooki statue warns you of danger ahead at the start of every action stage. Now, have you ever really scrutinized that sprite?  Under his belly? No, those aren't the folds of a ceremonial robe. Those are his balls. Really.       ...but Konami had to censor topless lady statues in Castlevania III? Hahahaha. \n\nI've had a playthrough up of this game on my channel almost since the beginning. Now that it's over three years old though, I thought to revisit it. Not just to update the video to a 60fps format, but also to be more thorough and show more stuff. It's just too good of a game to not have a video do its best to really do the game justice. \n\nAs of January 2020, there is now an English fan-translation patch for the sequel, Ganbare Goemon 2!
