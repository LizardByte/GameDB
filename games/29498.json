Only one rule, don't fall in the pool. \nAside from the standard mechanics there are a number of movement abilities such as wall climbing, sliding, wall jumping, crawling, and many more.  \nPlenty of work was done to prevent players from walking/ looking inside objects as to maximize immersion and provide a solid framework for speedrunning possibilities. Many other exploits with room scale gameplay have also been ironed out, and will continue to be focused in future updates.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
