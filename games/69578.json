You \nhave been ordered to use any means necessary to put Dr. Riptide and \nhis secret lab out of commission...for good. \nA JASON submersible will be issued to aid your search. The JASON's \nsmall, manageable size will make it an invaluable asset. \n \nMission Background: \n \nRiptide was banished from the scientific community after he \nannounced plans to construct devices of heinous mass \ndestruction to the population of the world's oceans. \nIntelligence has reported that Riptide has finally developed his \nTuna-Matic, a device that turns living matter into a marketable \ndelicacy. Riptide is fast becoming a rich villain by selling his \n\"Tuna\" on the black market as a trendy food for the filthy rich and \npowerful. Riptide has hidden himself deep within underwater \ncatacombs off the coast of Australia and has surrounded himself \nwith deadly protection. You will come face to face with many of \nDr. Riptide's creations and traps, so be prepared. If you reach \nhis lab, Riptide will be waiting for you, and he will have no regrets \nshipping you out in a tuna can!", "summary": "A side-scrolling DOS game set in the Great Barrier Reef.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 46246, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kRpMaHdz4iM"}]}
