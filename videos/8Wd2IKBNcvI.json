But no; I'm not dead and I'm back with another video for you.\n\nSo you're wondering why I would pick this over some other, more well-known game. First I'm going to tell you a little story about this game. It was released in November 2000, the PS1 hanging to its life by a string, since the next big thing, the PS2, had been released not too long ago. It was underrated by critics, and generally overlooked by most of the gaming crowd. Maybe due the next generation of consoles dawning... I mean, nobody wanted to play on old systems anymore, didn't they?\n\nWell, surprisingly it turns out this game is an absolute gem. Hell, it's probably the best Disney movie game ever made! It's a fun, light-hearted platformer with great gameplay, good story (it mostly follows the film but it does change a few minor things), and unforgettable voice acting and music. It's a classic example of critics not giving a game its due credit. It's gained a very small cult following by those who have played it thoroughly, even though it's pretty much still unknown. But if any day you feel like playing a good, old 3D adventure/platforming game, I'd reccomend this.\n\nThere will be a seperate video for each set of levels in the game. This first part covers the first level and its four chapters, the Village. Kuzco is intent on building Kuzcotopia, but he's gotta get out of here and get turned back into a human first. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Well, me and our hero run into some trouble on our way out...\n\nP.S.: I also take requests, so send me messages with your suggestions for games that you want me to play, and I will consider them.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Wd2IKBNcvI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Wd2IKBNcvI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Wd2IKBNcvI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Wd2IKBNcvI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Wd2IKBNcvI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[PS1] [HD] Let's Play The Emperor's New Groove, Part 1: The Village (100%)", "description": "I bet you weren't expecting me to do a playthrough of anything, and much less of this game, weren't you?
