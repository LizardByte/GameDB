{"id": "Wi6daQsSaeg", "snippet": {"title": "Virtual League Baseball (Virtual Boy) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Kemco's 1995 baseball game for the Nintendo Virtual Boy, Virtual League Baseball. \n\nThis video shows two different games: the first is a standard Player 1 Vs. CPU game. I play as the US team, and the CPU is playing as UK. The second game, beginning at 20:56, is an All-Star game, with me playing as the European All-Star team, and the CPU as the All-Asian All-Star team.\n\nVirtual League Baseball was the only baseball game to be released for the Virtual Boy (even though it had two bowling games...), and it came from a surprising source - it's a Kemco title, both developed and published by the company that was known in the US for MacVenture NES ports and the Top Gear and Kid Klown games. I certainly never could pegged them for VR baseball, but hey, why not?\n\nVirtual League Baseball is a simple, old-fashioned baseball game - it's very similar in scope to most of the NES's baseball games, and that's what I've always liked the most about it. There aren't any complicated meters, complex control mappings, nor endless pages of statistics. It harkens back to games like Bases Loaded, Bad News Baseball, or Dusty Diamond, and it feels good. \n\nFielding, batting, and pitching are all easy to handle, though they may be a bit too much. The game's mechanics do have a few faults: the AI just isn't any good, and the forgiving batting system means you'll send a fair few balls over the fence. It's all fun and fast paced, but it never approaches anything near what you'd call challenging. \n\nI really like the graphics and sound - the music is excellent, making good use of the VB's sound channels with fun renditions of classic baseball tunes and national anthems. It's odd that there aren't any voices, though... especially by 1995 baseball game standards. The graphics do a decent job of differentiating the different screen elements using nothing but shades of red, and the prerendered CG images and sprites look cool. The character animation isn't great, and the batting perspective is pretty funny in how some of the fielders end up as stick people, but the sense of depth that the parallax provides does still create a fairly impressive image on a real Virtual Boy.\n\nI doubt that people are clamoring for copies of a 23 year old sports game on the Virtual Boy, but if you have the system, the game is easily worth the pocket change it goes for online. It's not flashy or refined, but it's definitely fun for a quick game now and then. \n\n__\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wi6daQsSaeg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wi6daQsSaeg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wi6daQsSaeg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wi6daQsSaeg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Virtual League Baseball (Virtual Boy) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Kemco's 1995 baseball game for the Nintendo Virtual Boy, Virtual League Baseball. \n\nThis video shows two different games: the first is a standard Player 1 Vs.
