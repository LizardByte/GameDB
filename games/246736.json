Throughout the game, each player's character learns skills that will determine how successful (or not) they will be at their trade. The first two attributes (race and class) are chosen by the player when creating his character. The skill attribute mainly depends on the experience during the game and is deeply influenced by the way of playing and the preferences of each player.\n\nThe action takes place in a fictional virtual world where you take the role of a character who interacts with other characters, whether they are controlled by other players or by non-player characters. All the interactions take place in a fantastic environment like in a traditional role-playing game. You can chat with other characters on the screen, and through interactions, trade, trade, make friends, or other activities. We are waiting for you at Desterium!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/desterium--3", "videos": [{"id": 88671, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KI9B2VL0KzU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI9B2VL0KzU", "title": "Evento Mega Teleports - Desterium Game Ao  - Agites", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KI9B2VL0KzU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
