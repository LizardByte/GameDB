This wad consists of four small island maps with lots of action. The chaingun, rocket launcher, and plasma gun have all received an upgrade for the adventure. MAP01 is a thrill-seeking adventure to a tropical island, with lots of unsightly guests to contend with. MAP02 is a bit more chill, but still has enough heat so your chaingun does not freeze over. MAP03 is a romp through one of the hottest vacation spots imaginable. MAP04 is a look into how this adventure was booked in the first place.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloodbaths-terrible-vacation"}
