With this in mind, I met Emma, a young girl who claimed to be a military robot. She asked to come with me and offered to give me everything she had.\n\nEmma was a strange, with little common sense, always expressionless, and even said that sex was a way to relieve stress. She even initiated physical contact with me and said she was used to it...\n\nWhat had she been through and what was she hiding?\n\nAfter I spent some time with Emma, she gradually took on a different look. The sadness in Emma's eyes was slowly revealed, and I began to enjoy her company, forgetting for a while that I was still in the middle of the doomsday.\n\nSuffering was approaching, should we face it or escape? The physical and psychological choices that we had to make were difficult.\n\nCould we really find hope in this desperate doomsday?", "summary": "The world was destroyed, and the doomsday was here. I collapsed in the wasteland, short of food and water. Just as thought I was going to die, a young girl rescued me. Her name was Emma and she told me who she was--a military robot girl.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
