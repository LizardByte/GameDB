Heroes can make their own decisions, but the substantial rewards they see on the task board will guide them where needed. Or it might not, if they are drunk or set on buying themselves a new weapon!\n\nEach hero in the game has their own value system, determining their preferences and influencing their behavior and decisions. Thieves are ready to tickle a dragon for gold, while paladins eradicate evil with enthusiasm, and free of charge. A wise ruler can use this to their advantage.\nIn the tavern, over a mug of ale, heroes gather in parties to take on the serious challenges that the land of Lessaria presents. Together, they become stronger, complementing each other's skills and compensating for weaknesses.\n\nA king must take care of his people, manage and oversee construction! Guilds of heroes, equipment and potion shops, resource gatherer homes, walls, and towers are all vital for your kingdom. Heroes will often come for supplies, enriching the treasury to some extent. Taxes are the foundation of any commonwealth. Without them, the kingdom will starve - tax collectors will ensure this doesn\u2019t happen by routinely visiting every building in the city.\nAnother source of income for the kingdom is from caravans. Protect your own and plunder others to become even richer and more influential. After all, it is your land, and you have the right to combat smuggling within its borders.\n\nWhat could be better than the smell of a fire storm in the mornings? Only the scent of singed goblins who have decided to attack you! Use the arsenal of spells available to court wizards to destroy your enemies, aid allied heroes, and summon magical creatures into battle.\nYou can learn new spells in the library or from the guilds of heroes. If you want to use them a distance away from the castle, build beacons.", "summary": "Lessaria is a unique strategy game that combines city building with indirect hero control.
