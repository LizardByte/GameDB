So it comes down to dexterity, but you will have to think regularly. It's all about batteries and the mechanisms they power. When those batteries are empty, everything comes to a standstill, and you can't get any further. So you have to make sure you keep things running...\n\nBattery Check was given away for free by Stibat when returning 15 empty batteries between May 9 and June 20, 1998. The goal was to give away 50,000 units, but due to its popularity, it ended up being 220,000.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battery-check"}
