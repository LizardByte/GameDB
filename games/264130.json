Now that the Jam has officially ended, it gets posted to PokeCommunity!\nBasically, you own a daycare, where trainers can drop off and pick up their Pok\u00e9mon. Use the money you get to buy food for the checked in Pok\u00e9mon or even upgrade the daycare itself. Sometimes you find eggs, which Trainers can adopt, but you never do find out where they come from.\nNot really much of a plot to be honest. Trainers are random though, that's cool.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-daycare"}
