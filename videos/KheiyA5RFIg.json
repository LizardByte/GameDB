You play the role of the last survivor, confronted by a gigantic AI boss who evaluates your musical performance to ensure your survival. \n\nThe boss will punish your mistakes by \"summoning\" his henchmen to eliminate you. \n\nIn this game, the drums are your weapon and your shield. Every note you play with precision strengthens your defenses, while wrong notes will summon more monsters in every wave of the game. \n\nKeep up the rhythm, string together chords with precision and resist the constant attacks of the AI, all the while hoping to reach a level of performance sufficient to survive. At the end of each round, you can buy turrets to defend yourself against the monsters !\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Musics :\n\nWellmess feat. Divty - I'm a Hurricane\nWellmess  ft.
