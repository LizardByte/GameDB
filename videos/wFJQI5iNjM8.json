In the Box2D physics engine built into unity, no physics objects can bend or deform, which is absolutely no fun.

In the game, you control a little blobby guy who is generally unimpressed with your jumping skills. An arrow constantly moving back and forth indicates the direction you can jump. But be careful! One wrong tap and it's back to the beginning.\n\nI think I kinda failed at the whole \"rage game\" goal, which is to make something frustratingly hard that you still can't put down. This game, which is not even that hard by the way, is also not fun. \n\n--- You May Also Like ---\nCheck out some of my other \"I Made\"  videos like this:\nI Made Minecraft in 24 Hours: https://youtu.be/Nj8gt_92c-M\nI Made a Game with Intentional Bugs: https://youtu.be/M_iiXaaF5T4\nI Made a Game with Infinite Levels: https://youtu.be/u6MW8rdotkM\n\nAlso check out @Danidev (although you already have) who I believe I owe some description links to:\nDani - Programming a Boss Battle For my Game: https://youtu.be/nhhSDrA6stw\nDani - He said I Couldn't Make a 3D Game...
