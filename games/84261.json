In real karaoke style, songs appear on your screen and you have to sing the right words at the right time. Onscreen indicators inform you what pitch you need to maintain at any given time. Hit the right notes for the right amount of time, and you'll get high scores.\n\nAs the focus of the game is the TV show atmosphere, special attention has been paid to select a variety of video clips of judge comments and special performances of the show. This way, players need to struggle to achieve a good result and are awarded with special contents from the show. The game also contains Party modes in which players compete by playing a selection of humorous mini-games.\n\nBoth versions of the game are bundled with a USB microphone.\n\nThe tracklist of the game features songs like Superstar (Melanie C.), Shiver (Natalie Imbruglia), Is there something I should know? (Duran Duran), Is this the way to Amarillo? (Tony Christie), and many others.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-x-factor-sing"}
