The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they're sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.\n\nRead the family's thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. Remain unseen to avoid causing personal trauma. It's up to you to decide how Dan's career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.\n\nDan's relationships - to his work, his wife, and his son - react and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play.\n\nThe decisions you make will define the Kaplans' lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpWNF7L1hks/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpWNF7L1hks/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpWNF7L1hks/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpWNF7L1hks/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpWNF7L1hks/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Novelist: Official Trailer", "description": "For more information, please visit TheNovelistGame.com.\n\n----\n\nThe Novelist asks one central question: can you achieve your dreams without pushing away the people you love?
