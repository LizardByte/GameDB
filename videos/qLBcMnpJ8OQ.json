A hand-drawn rat-filled side-scrolling looter-shooter moba-lite 2D gore-fest inspired by that brutal 90s gaming feel of yore.\n\nSet in a world where rats are the only form of life. Lead your troops to battle and retake the land of Ratopia from TechnoRat: A singular consciousness comprising cyborg rats that want nothing more than to consume all flesh and turn it to metal.\n\nInspired by games such as Kingdom: New Lands and Future Cop LAPD's Precinct Assault mode (now generally considered to be the first ever MOBA) delivered in a package that evokes the brutal, gory 90s gaming sprites of old, it's a non-stop bloody action game with lovingly hand-drawn art and animation.\n\nLoads of weapons, enemies and loot to be had. You must manage and fight alongside your army to push back the tide of the enemy and get your Ratineer into their base. Sounds simple but it won't be easy.\n\nDeveloped by wootusart Industries\nRelease Date: Q2 2025\n\n#steam #steamgames #steamgame #theforeseenarcade #steamnextfest #steamnextfestfebruary2025 #warrats", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLBcMnpJ8OQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLBcMnpJ8OQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLBcMnpJ8OQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLBcMnpJ8OQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLBcMnpJ8OQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "WAR RATS: The Rat em Up - Steam Next Fest: February 2025 Demo", "description": "Sidescrolling shooter meets tower defense with a sprinkle of RPG elements.
