Play is for one or two players simultaneously (including a battle-mode), and options are available for mouse and joystick controls. A comprehensive level editor is also included. The players\u2019 bat here is made out to look like a bone, and the ball is a spherical stone. Level backdrops are randomised pixel-painted scenes featuring different types of Dinosaurs. The bricks to knock out sometimes contain pickups to collect, such as a laser gun, an automatic CPU controlled bat navigation mode, extra life, slow-ball etc. A pickup is immediately activated upon collection, but subsequent ones collected are not if one is active, and clicking the right mouse button will cancel out the current effect for the last pickup collected. A bonus coconut game can be enabled from the main menu, which in turn lets you play this sub-game at predefined intervals during the course of standard play, where you control a caveman holding a pan, and the object is to catch coconuts that fall from trees with it, by moving from left to right on the single screen. Your bonus is tallied for how many coconuts you managed to catch in the allotted time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crack", "videos": [{"id": 130054, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Qz0WxhyM1-I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz0WxhyM1-I", "title": "Crack (Amiga) (Gameplay)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qz0WxhyM1-I/sddefault.jpg"}]}
