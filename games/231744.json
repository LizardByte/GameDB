This version has three opponents: a Wiggler, a Big Boo, and Waluigi. Luigi has to beat all his opponents. After that, he has to repeat the fighting order along with winning a coin, a trophy, or a Championship Belt. Luigi and his opponents start with five hit points each, and they reset to five each time one of them gets pushed back. As the player advances in the game, the enemies get more difficult to defeat.\n\nGetting one KO earns a coin, getting five earns a Yoshi Coin, getting ten earns a trophy, and getting 50 earns a Championship Belt. It is Game Over if Luigi gets KO'd.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
