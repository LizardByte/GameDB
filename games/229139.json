A MUD is a multi-player computer game that combines elements of role-playing games, hack and slash style computer games and social chat rooms. MUDs are text-driven, where players read descriptions of rooms, objects, events, other characters, and computer-controlled creatures or non-player characters (NPCs) in a virtual world.\n\nAabahran has been in existence since June of 2000, ranking it in line with many of the long-standing MUDs still in existence. Its world is rich, dynamic and exciting. It is also a roleplaying-enforced, playerkilling MUD. What this means is that in Aabahran, you are required to play a character to its full extent. Additionally, you may kill other players (after a certain rank and within our highly balanced playerkilling ranges). In fact, because Aabahran has a balanced rare & unique item system, you may need to kill other players in order to get that special sword or shield you\u2019ve been looking for! The world is massive, with over 10,000 unique rooms for you to explore. Because of the variety of races and classes, the game remains fresh and exciting, and endlessly replayable.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aabahran-the-forsaken-lands"}
