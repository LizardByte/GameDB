Join three explorers Bern, Matchi and Totch who\u2019s journey has led them to an icy mountain where they believe the Lantri to be hidden.", "summary": "Path of Giants is a serene adventure puzzle game where the player controls three explorers Bern, Matchi and Totch who must help each other to conquer a set of ancient trials in search of a lost treasure. Each level focuses on the main feature of having three characters, and is hinged around the fact that the player will need to use all three of the characters in order to solve the puzzles and progress. The player will be using the boosting mechanic between the characters to help boost each other up and down platforms all while interacting with a variety of environmental moving pieces.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/path-of-giants--1", "videos": [{"id": 43566, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VgKLQHwDpW4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgKLQHwDpW4", "title": "Path of Giants - Official Steam Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VgKLQHwDpW4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 65651, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "DFNvuozRi-s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFNvuozRi-s", "title": "Path of Giants - Gameplay Preview 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFNvuozRi-s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 65652, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kYhdsmJJD1s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhdsmJJD1s", "title": "Path of Giants - Mobile Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kYhdsmJJD1s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
