The game stars Natalie, a young girl who locked herself in her room. According to the developer, Dreamscaper uses American culture to contrast against the large amount of eastern/Japanese fangames out at the time. Dreamscaper plays like most fangames, focused on collecting effects and exploring Natalie's dream world."}
