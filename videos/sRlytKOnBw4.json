{"id": "sRlytKOnBw4", "snippet": {"title": "Kakutou Ryouri Densetsu Bistro Recipe: Wonder Battle Hen Game Sample - WonderSwan", "description": "Original Air Date: October 15th, 2009\n\nI got a request for a video for this game a little while ago, and it's ironically one of but a handful of WS/WSC/SC games that I still own, so I figured I'd get around to it. The footage for this was recorded with an emulator. For all intents and purposes, it is identical to the original, except the sound in this game is actually BETTER than on my SwanCrystal... no static, so the music sounds better. The title of this game (which is a mouthful btw) roughly translates into \"Martial Arts Cooking Legend Bistro-Recipe\", and it's an obscure but popular anime and manga series that was released in the U.S. for a short time under the title of \"Fighting Foodons\".\n\nI honestly don't know much about either since I completely missed the anime and manga (I've only seen small bits of the anime and only knew one person who read the manga), but the game basically involves Zen (called Chase in the U.S.) talking with his sister Karin (Kayla in the U.S.) and Father Tsukiji (Chef Jack in the U.S.) and getting ready to compete in a contest that will allow him to board what is presumably the S.S. Food Fight (as it's known in the U.S.) to get a chance to become a master chef. As I've said before, I don't know that much about the game or how faithful it is to the anime or manga, though Don Cook (Georgeous Gorge) and others are apparently in the game.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is relatively easy to navigate through as only a basic understanding of Japanese is necessary... even the character's names have been simplified to Katakana instead of Kanji. The standard menu has basic functions like Mochimono and Takaramono (One's Property and Treasured Items) to Shokuzai and Zukon (Foodstuffs and A Foodon Encyclopedia/ Monster bestairy). Battle functions range from the four primary actions (Ouen/Support, Kousan/Give Up, Waza/Technique, and \"Topping/\u30c8\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0 (which lists your items and foodstuff). It's pretty simple.\n\nYou can also adjust the abilities of your fighters and most importantly, you can \"cook\", which your success depends on how good you are at Dance Dance Revolution and games of that nature. You have to hit arrows and special symbols to improve your monster, but too many mistakes can result in a failure. When preparing new Foodons, the system becomes vertical and your controls will change accordingly to accomodate this feature.\n\nTwo Bistro Recipe games were also made for Game Boy Color. I can't discern if they're better at this point in time, but they're in color, something this game should have been too. The \"Wonder Battle Hen\" portion is also \"Wonder Battle Compilation\".\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sRlytKOnBw4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sRlytKOnBw4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sRlytKOnBw4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Kakutou Ryouri Densetsu Bistro Recipe: Wonder Battle Hen Game Sample - WonderSwan", "description": "Original Air Date: October 15th, 2009\n\nI got a request for a video for this game a little while ago, and it's ironically one of but a handful of WS/WSC/SC games that I still own, so I figured I'd get around to it.
