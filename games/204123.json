There does not appear to be any kind of storyline or plot. The player is free to explore the game's world as a goat, destroying things in the environment, running, jumping, and licking. \"Goat Simulator is like an old school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff,\" explained the game's creators.\nThe game boasts the fact that various glitches and bugs have been intentionally left in the game, as to add to the light-hearted entertainment value. Another gameplay feature is the ability to \"lick\" objects with the goat's absurdly long tongue, which will then stick to the goat's tongue and can be carried and swung around to provide an alternative method of wreaking havoc on the game environment.\nWith over 2.5 million sales (on IOS, Android & 6PC combined) this Indie Game is the most successfull game of Coffee Stain Studios", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 69239, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kUiUygL92UY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUiUygL92UY", "title": "Goat Simulator Official Mobile Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUiUygL92UY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
