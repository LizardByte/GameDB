Two or more monsters compete for the domination of the town and have a limited time to use their magic powers to convince a majority of peasants to rally to their cause.\n\nEach monster has its own special powers (e.g. Dracula can fly), strengths and weaknesses. You can use a series of traps to stop your enemy's advance (e.g. place a mirror somewhere to stop Quasimodo, since he can't stand his own reflection), or build new dwellings for your supporters. On certain maps, there's a \"neutral\" monster that you can hypnotize too and use as a secondary character to gain support amongst the citizens twice as fast.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/universal-studios-monsters-monsterville"}
