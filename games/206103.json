After the wealthy move to Mars and turn it into a paradise for those who can afford to live there, the Earth is torn apart in an enormous accident. The survivors live miserably on a collection of orbiting slums known colloquially as The Taint. To add meaning to their vapid lives, the elites of Mars raid the ruins of Earth for Merch, pop-culture relics such as old VHS tapes or vinyl records. Players control a titular Hyena, a space-pirate from the Taint that raids enormous Plunderships on their way from Earth to Mars in an attempt to steal the Merch held within.", "summary": "Hyenas is a hero-based, multiplayer extraction shooter. Choose a Hyena to play as - each with a unique weapon, ability, and personality - to form a crew of three and steal valuable Merch. The action takes place on vast, themed 'Plunderships' returning to Mars from Earth, loaded with salvaged Merch for your crew to steal.\n\nCompeting with four other raiding crews, your goal is to find and crack secured vaults, then steal enough Merch to make your escape. Standing in your way are not only rival players but also the \u201cMURFs\u201d \u2013 security forces who will fight to the death to protect the precious cargo.\n\nOnce a team has stolen enough Merch, they activate the Plundership\u2019s VIP Extraction, which is revealed on the map. You must find it and make your getaway or stop others from making theirs. The crew that escapes first is the winner, so make sure it\u2019s you!\n\nFast and frenetic combat is enhanced by the unique weaponry and ability of each Hyena. Additionally, each Plundership features zero gravity areas, some of which can be toggled on and off. Gunfights take on an entirely new dimension, literally, when gravity is no longer a concern. Enemy players can come at you from any direction, so you\u2019ll need to keep your head on a swivel \u2013 or make sure to ambush them first.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hyenas", "videos": [{"id": 70579, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0694XcFmI7M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0694XcFmI7M", "title": "HYENAS Official Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0694XcFmI7M/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 95994, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0DVApk5s7qo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DVApk5s7qo", "title": "Gameplay Trailer - HYENAS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0DVApk5s7qo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
