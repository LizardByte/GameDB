However, no evidence of this successor was found, and the world believed evil had been vanquished.\n\nFor years, peace and prosperity flourished, aided by the mysterious time doors that allowed for new discoveries. But evil slowly returned, first seen in a lone, benevolent orc that had escaped magical control. Soon, darkness spread unchecked, revealing Minax, Mondain\u2019s apprentice.\n\nMinax, far more powerful than her master, did not merely spread evil\u2014she corrupted the good, turning people against each other. Her ultimate success was the devastation of 2111, when once-great civilizations destroyed themselves in hatred. The few survivors used the time doors to escape, hoping to undo the catastrophe.\n\nTwo theories emerged: either Minax was the sole source of evil, or removing its root cause could erase its effects entirely. Lord British and his allies now entrust you with a perilous mission\u2014travel through time to stop Minax. Success will restore history, though future generations may never know the hero\u2019s sacrifice.\n\nThe choice is clear: embark on this journey, with the force of good as your guide.", "summary": "After obtaining aid from the lords of the realm in Ultima I, your character travels back in time, locates the mad wizard Mondain, slays him, and ends his reign of terror. In Ultima II: Revenge of the Enchantress, Mondain's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Minax, who studied the mad wizard's teachings and writings, returns to wreak vengeance on the person who slew her teacher and lover -- you. And, instead of waiting for you to return to her native land of Sosaria, she wreaks havoc on your own Earth.\n\nThroughout Ultima II: Revenge of the Enchantress, your quest is quite different in scope from its predecessor. Earth is turned into a half-modern, half-fantasy world by the forces of magic and, as a result, things are much stranger than one might expect. As explained in the introduction, your tasks in the game are to \"Battle strange creatures across the face of the Earth, search for clues in careless words spoken at the local pub, traverse deep, dark, deadly dungeons and tall, terrifying towers...and conquer Time itself to battle Minax the Enchantress.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultima-ii-the-revenge-of-the-enchantress"}
