There\u2019s also a healthy dose of vehicles they can drive around, plus a crafting system. One interesting feature is that players are rewarded with building materials after each match that they can use to construct refuges, which are places to hang out with friends in-between matches.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farlight-84", "videos": [{"id": 127300, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Hf9Rh_D7sQ4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf9Rh_D7sQ4", "title": "Farlight 84 | \"Hi, Buddy!\" Expansion Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hf9Rh_D7sQ4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 127301, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Dm4IHf2m1pI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm4IHf2m1pI", "title": "What's New in Farlight 84?
