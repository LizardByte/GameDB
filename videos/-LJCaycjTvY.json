The fog of war and 'enemy-on-screen count' surpasses even that of DW5: Empires [360] and even DW6 [360] in my opinion. \n\nThe limited radial visibility, the strength of even the most basic enemy troops, and the fact that they even march 'in formation' towards you, makes the fourth in the series vastly more eerie, intimidating, and 'fulfilling to dominate' than its predecessors; and even DW5 in my opinion. \n\nDW4 takes itself seriously without the need to rely entirely on anime tropes and cliches like the newer installments do.  It pridefully pulls off its best attempt to be gritty and realistic within its allowed Eastern-art scope while also maintaining an addicting combat system that makes the player feel like the hero when they are seemingly the sole source of inspiration for the troops - all to increase morale - a mechanic that multiplies your comrade's abilities and likelihood to survive; lest you end up being the last man alive against a horde of relentless attackers. \n\nThrough the onslaught of button-mashing and timing combos, the setting is best supplemented with the appropriate music. Every mission has a special song, and for every faction, and therefore every mood that should be conveyed.  The music is composed as instrumental heavy metal combined with classical Chinese instruments, and always ingeniously counterparts the historical situation. A massive campaign for vengeance is matched with a marching track reflecting sorrow and anger, while another track instills fear and anxiety upon retreating, other tracks will reflect various skirmishes of the war with a varying chance of loss or defeat.  More than anything, the music in these Warriors games all add to the well-constructed atmosphere and immersion that these games try so hard to toss you in - it would all be nothing without its soundtrack. \n\nThe game is unfortunately sometimes counter-intuitive with its tone: For one, It is sometimes rife with comically mispronounced major character names. (Lord Cow Cow!) Localization teams do not always reflect the passion of the original script, and we see this in several famous games; worst of all DW9. In another break of tone, the renowned warriors use magic orbs to enhance their attacks, while also denouncing the possibility of 'sorcery' as mere trickery. \n\nIt is no wonder the original Samurai Warriors was a great beginning to its spin-off series - it had an even more accentuated dark and gloomy aesthetic to pair with the creepy 'fogginess' and over-the-top, anime-style combat. The game used fog of war,  the genre's \"weakness\" - a frame-saving mechanic, as an addition to the setting. It added the same Gothic and surreal ambience as a Devil May Cry game did - hectic, but still mysterious.\n\nThe soundtrack to a Samurai Warriors game would make a crazy dance floor, but the Dynasty Warriors game would make the most violent moshpit. \n\nIt's too bad DW4 'Hyper' (strictly for PC) didn't get the 'Xtreme Legends' expansion. Maybe because they knew a console port could be pirated less? Maybe a contract with Sony, which is why X-Box didn't have one? Who knows. This game definitely needs a remaster! It is debatably Koei's best piece of work when combined with its expansion. \n\nSeeing how good this looks makes me yearn to play a properly translated 'Warriors Orochi Z'. \n\nGoing over this video on YouTube did not give my gameplay justice.  I recorded using the MS Game Bar using 60 FPS and 192kbps audio (the best that it allows).  Previous footage of games using OBS has seen better quality somehow, though I would not be in the right field of knowledge to explain exactly why.  My gameplay looked amazing and my sound was groovy, but the footage looks awful in comparison - which totally defeats the purpose of me showcasing how great the game looks.  If any of you have suggestions, I'll gladly take them.  Even now, though, surely you can see the differences between the PS2 and the PC ports. \n\ntl;dr: Definitely give the game a try yourself. Especially if you love early DW. \n\nJoin our Warriors Discord at: https://discord.gg/82pQkGY\nFollow me on: https://twitter.com/Biggest__Boss\n\nGoogle killed my download link, but DM me on discord and I'll help you out. \nManly McBeefington#9990", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-LJCaycjTvY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-LJCaycjTvY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-LJCaycjTvY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-LJCaycjTvY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-LJCaycjTvY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Max Graphics Test - Dynasty Warriors 4: Hyper [PC Only]", "description": "Gameplay: 5:44\n\nShort Answer: \nThe PC port of DW4 is actually pretty fucking smooth compared to the PS2 one.\n\nLong Answer: The Case for DW4\nThe quality is the best as can be for that era (for Koei, that is).
