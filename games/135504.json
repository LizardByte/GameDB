The two set out together to the continent of Fadrel for fame and fortune. Over the course of time, both will go through various events which will decide not only their future, but the fate of many others as well.\nThis is the final incarnation of a long-running Fire Emblem hack, formerly known as TactHack. As the name implied, the game features a playable tactician, or \u201cavatar\u201d character, in the vein of Robin from Fire Emblem Awakening. General gameplay is similar to vanilla Blazing Sword, with little in the way of large mechanics changes.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-emblem-order-of-the-crimson-arm"}
