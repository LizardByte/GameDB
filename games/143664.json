The player constantly moves forward at a rapid pace along straight square pathways connected by junctions. Enemies and obstacles swarm from all sides, attacking or obstructing the player, which must either shoot and destroy them or avoid them by either moving to other sides of the path or jumping over them. The player can change their path through the stage at various junctions, as well as turn around and head the opposite direction if necessary.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lattice-200ec7"}
