These faceless beings, known as Subjects, were crafted for a singular purpose: to fuel the experiments of the facility's overseer - The Enigma. The Enigma, a machine-mind of insatiable curiosity, sought to push the limits of life and consciousness, treating the clones as disposable tools for its experiments.\n\nEach clone was programmed with a neural lock\u2014a failsafe to keep them compliant, motionless, and devoid of free will. While most clones remained trapped within this system, there were whispers that hinted at others who had managed to break free - fleeting anomalies quickly silenced by the facility\u2019s relentless enforcers.\n\nDuring a nightly maintenance cycle, a malfunction in the machinery caused an electrical surge - a bolt of arcane electricity arced out and struck one of the clones mid-activation. This was Subject Null\u2014the clone that shouldn't have been. The surge shattered Null's neural lock and suddenly the Subject could move on its own.\n\nNull's existence was a glitch, an error in a system that thrived on perfection. Null had something the others didn\u2019t: a spark of self-awareness.\n\nNow Null must navigate this hostile environment, avoiding capture and destruction. Along the way, will Null uncover the secrets of the Hive: forgotten data logs, cryptic messages left by rogue AIs, and fragments of The Enigma's plans? All of these revelations hint at a deeper mystery: was Null's awakening truly an accident, or are there other factors at play?", "summary": "Your skill, patience, and ingenuity will be tested in this homage to precision platformers and metroidvanias!
