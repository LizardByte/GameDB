The character will die if you touch them.  \n  \nHere is the link to the game : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heethpjain.heeth.flappygravity  \n  \nHope so you like my game!  \nPlease leave an honest rating!  \nI won't ask anyone for fake ratings!  \n  \nAnd suggestions are highly appreciated!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
