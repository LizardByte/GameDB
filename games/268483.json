Although this is quite an elusive game concerning unreleased titles for the 32X, it has a lot to offer.\n\nDevelopment of this game was assigned to Scavenger, who owned some studios (like Zyrinx and Lemon) featuring many former Amiga demoscene developers, known for their high-tech profile and their enthusiasm into pushing systems to their limits.\n\nThis X-Men adventure with beat 'em up-esque gameplay is a 3D game with stunning visuals for its time, probably redefining a new age of titles for the Mega Drive add-on.\n\nThe prototype is quite early, something of a tech-demo which allows selecting and playing a couple levels from a concept title screen. The levels feature several playable areas -some of them having no enemies at all- and a single playable character, Bishop.\n\nWith this proto we have a great playable sketch of a game that could have probably surpassed our expectations, having been finished and released, that is. This is a great showcase for both the 32X and the Scavenger studios.\n\nX-Men: Mind Games was never released.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-mind-games"}
