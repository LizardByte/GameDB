The game is currently in an early development stage. This website is used to blog about the latest progress and to keep you informed. \n \nGame Facts \n- Stranded III will have a multiplayer mode \n- It will have a story mode and random islands like Stranded II \n- I\u2019m aiming for a style and gameplay which is slightly more realistic than Stranded II but this doesn\u2019t exclude funny elements \n \nEngine, Technique, Requirements \n- Stranded III will use Unity 3D (v. 2017 or higher) as game engine \n- You will be able to mod nearly everything (even more modding opportunities and freedom than you had in Stranded II) \n- The scripting language is Lua combined with my own basic definition language \n- The requirements are uncertain. Unity 3D itself runs with most video cards though. You\u2019ll be able to change settings to make it work with non-high-end PCs. \n \nRelease, Platforms, Price \n- There is NO FIXED RELEASE DATE! Please don\u2019t ask for it. I don\u2019t know it and can\u2019t estimate it! \n- Stranded III will be released for PC (Windows) first, but MacOS and Linux versions are possible (a Linux dedicated server is planned) \n- Mobile and console versions are NOT planned \nI will probably try Steam Direct for the release \n- The game will either be completely free or available for a low and affordable price", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stranded-3"}
