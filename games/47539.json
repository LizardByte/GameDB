The player's car can shot bullets in several directions as well as grenades. It's fast and challenging, definitely recommended, specially for fans of Road Fighter or F1 Spirit. It has some funny engrish text like \"Daras\" instead of Dallas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/car-fighter"}
