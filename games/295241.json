With an uncooperative defendant, a staggering amount of evidence supporting the police's case, and a prosecutor that clearly has it in for him, how will Phoenix turn things around? Is there even any room for doubt?\n\nWhere does the truth lie?\n\nIn the hearts of the key players, all with their own secrets and motives?\n\nBetween the trees of the dense forest, the scene of a horrific murder?\n\nOr perhaps, in the mythical city of gold that seems to be the connecting factor between the strange circumstances of the case -- El Dorado?", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-turnabout-to-el-dorado"}
