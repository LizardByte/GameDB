In this atmospheric vehicle adventure, players embark on a unique journey through a barren, yet hauntingly beautiful world. \n\nIn a unique hybrid of ship and train, you travel across an ocean-turned-desert following the tracks of a once flourishing civilization. Through an array of roadblocks and through hazardous weather, you need to keep your vessel going. Where will this journey take you? Are you the last of your kind?\n\nFAR: Lone Sails is all about the experience of being on your way. It wants you to travel into the unknown and be curious. Your enormous vessel is not only a means of transport, but your shelter and your only companion in the world. Without your machine, all hope of finding answers would be lost. The only way to go is forward \u2013 there may still be something out there that is worth taking the risks of travelling through unknown grounds.\n\nFAR: Lone Sails on Nintendo Switch is a perfect travel companion that helps you make yourself at home even when you are far away. While your miniscule character manoeuvres through the vast world, taking care of your vehicle may demand your full attention: manage your fuel supplies, your vehicle\u2019s condition, and find your way through obstacles of all sorts. But don\u2019t forget to enjoy the relaxing moments, too, sailing effortlessly while star-gazing from the roof of your mobile home for a while.\n\nFAR: Lone Sails will be out on Nintendo Switch on August 18, 2019, at 18:00 CEST / 9:00 AM PDT. \n\nwww.far-game.com\n#FARLoneSails\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 Nintendo", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fo1aFQr1vH8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fo1aFQr1vH8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fo1aFQr1vH8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fo1aFQr1vH8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fo1aFQr1vH8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "FAR: Lone Sails - Nintendo Switch Teaser Trailer", "description": "Take your (t)rusty vehicle on the road: FAR: Lone Sails releases on Nintendo Switch\u2122 August 18, 2019\nhttps://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/far-lone-sails-switch/\n \nSummer is the season to travel: What better time to bring the acclaimed indie game FAR: Lone Sails to Nintendo Switch\u2122.
