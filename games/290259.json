The game takes place between the events of the first game and Cordy 2.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Doodle Jump's gameplay, but also has some distinct elements. Every 1000 meters, you collect a Fuel Cell. Once you reach 5000 meters and have gotten all 5 Fuel Cells, the ship is refueled and Volt goes home. You can also collect Tap Tokens, which can be used to get prizes, such as gears or power-ups. The player can also purchase skins that all require a certain amount of gears to be purchased.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cordy-sky"}
