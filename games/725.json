GalCiv II focuses on the single player experience that consists of a Campaign mode and a \"Sandbox\" mode, and omits multi-player. The game is notable for its artificial intelligence, which is challenging without being given resources and abilities not available to the player, as is common in the majority of strategy games.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "videos": [{"id": 4301, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GCwNnnUIQ60", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwNnnUIQ60", "title": "Galactic Civilizations II Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GCwNnnUIQ60/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
