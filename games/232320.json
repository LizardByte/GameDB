Everything you see is live-action video, with real actors in atmospheric locations. You decide where to go, where to investigate, who to speak to and what to ask. As the story unfolds you'll meet new people, witness new events and discover new places.\nYou investigate with Inspector Jenks, who has been assigned to the case of a student found murdered in an idyllic English country village.\nYou meet several characters during the game, most of whom you can visit as often as you like. You can ask these characters about any item of evidence or information that you've collected along the way.\nThe aim (and name) of the game is to spot contradictions in what they've said. By consulting your notes and pairing together two contradictory replies, Jenks will interrogate the character and they will be forced to reveal new information, allowing you to progress further through the game.\nReveal all the contradictions to complete the game! Playing with headphones a must for a complete experience.\nContradiction is also available in HD and with added features on Steam for PC and Mac.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/contradiction--1"}
