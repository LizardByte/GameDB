Initially released in 1995 (the same year that HUMAN Entertainment released Clock Tower: the First Fear on the Super Famicom in Japan) Silverload is not usually regarded as an \"early\" horror game, although it is exactly that.  It's Playstation debut occurred a year before Clock Tower: the First Fear's.  Like Clock Tower, Silverload is a point-and-click horror adventure with a strong emphasis on puzzle-solving and deliberation.  Set in the late 1800s Wild West, you are the Gunslinger and decide to help a pair of settlers find their kidnapped boy.  To do so, you have to go into Silverload, a tormented town controlled by an cursed priest and his cult.  Silverload predates Silent Hill by nearly four years, but there are many similarities between the two.  It's a game worth playing if you want to see the pioneers of the genre.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A2ugfAS2Z5Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A2ugfAS2Z5Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A2ugfAS2Z5Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Intro to Silverload (PS1)", "description": "This is the intro movie to Silverload (Vic Tokai Inc., Millenium Interactive Ltd.) for the Playstation, a highly underrated survival horror game.
