A HYBRID OF ALTERNATIVE HORROR AND CREEPYPASTA... \nWelcome to the Halloween Edition v1.03! \nTake a deep breath, dim the lights, put on your headphones... \n \nNon-linear first-person gameplay lets you explore Grimhaven Orphanage and discover the characters who once lived there \u2013 voiced by Dan Bull, Chuck Huber and Raychul Moore, plus a multitude of other great voices from around the world - some of which we discovered through our global YouTube auditions! \n \nWe call this \u2018alt horror\u2019 because it has no graphic violence, blood or guns. As the player, you have no defense... however, you must show empathy and courage to save the twelve missing orphans. This is a game for people who like to explore, listen, think and solve - and play cat and mouse in a dark and scary maze. Listen to the nineteen personal creepypasta-style stories to piece together the mysterious events of that fateful night in 1898, when twelve orphans simply... disappeared! Now with shorter (30-60 sec) in-game stories to enhance the tension and new plot twists when you least expect them! And don\u2019t panic story lovers! The full stories are still there \u2013 on the menu page and somewhere within the game\u2026 if you know where to look!! \n \nFind the twelve orphan\u2019s mementos and place them on the correct headstones to set the lost souls free. Did we mention the headstones are in a hedge maze? Custom-created by a \u2018Ripley\u2019s Believe-It-Or-Not\u2019 Maze Master? No problem! But first you\u2019ll have to find the key... Are you up to the challenge? Did we mention the Huntsman\u2026 in the maze\u2026 stalking you? Did we mention he may also be lurking in Grimhaven Orphanage? \n \nSo \u2013 how fast can you turn and run? Well you won\u2019t know \u2018till you check it out! So go do it! Have fun!! Scare yourself as much as you want (maybe you should keep the hallway light on\u2026!) \n \nThis is a Free Upgrade for all our Steam key holders and supporters of our Black Friday Edition \u2013 THANK YOU!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/huntsman-the-orphanage-halloween-edition"}
