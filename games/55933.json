(You were expecting maybe Quake?) The goal is to find the lost accordion and return it to Al's house. To do so you must find the key to Al's house, and possibly the keys to any or all of Al's band members' houses, all while avoiding the radioactive hamster, slime creature, and Pac-Man. Explore two towns, the sewers, the cemetary, Al's band members' houses, Dr. Demento's huge warehouse of records, and a forest.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/weird-als-great-adventure"}
