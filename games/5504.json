Developed by Chris Sawyer, and coded in X86 Assembly language, it was among the first in the relatively new 'tycoon' genre of games - simulations of business empires that the player founded, grew and took full control of.\n\nTransport Tycoon saw the player running their transport empire from 1930 to 2030, with rail, road, sea and air transport available to help the player's expansion of their business. New technologies are introduced to the player at historically accurate times, and players could see first-hand how advancements changed the way their businesses were run.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}]}
