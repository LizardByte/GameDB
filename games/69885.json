The house is haunted by three friendly ghosts that only Pluto and the player can see; Shaky, Quaky and Clyde, who assist the group by making keys available as Mickey and pals solve six puzzles.\n\nSilverware dances, a stuffed bear yawns and stretches, spiders scurry about as the player clicks on items in the six rooms; often two characters will converge in a room and hold a short conversation while the player is idle. Gameplay uses the mouse; to move from room to room the player clicks where the cursor becomes an arrow - at the edge of the screen, on the staircase and the secret passageway.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
