But watch out for pits and dark saltwater - saltwater is no good for frogs!\n\nUse the froggy tongue to grab hard to reach collectibles, or activate tongue flingers that will send froggy flying onwards and upwards! Collecting all 5 beetles before finishing each stage will let froggy go to a special bonus stage. There, froggy will find a big delicious dragonfly waiting at the end!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/little-frog-game"}
