Allie the pilot and Tally the technician were quietly promoted and reassigned to the Ganuka system, deep within Dangan space. Due to their expertise they were tasked to oversee the Empire's own dreadnought project.\n\nThese unmanned war machines are controlled by a super computer called the ALL-CONSTRUCT. The hope is that the dreadnoughts under its control will turn the tide and finally put an end to the prolonged conflict between the Dangan Empire and Houdan Confederation.\n\nA few months pass. Allie and Tally are out on the edge of the Ganuka system when they receive a message from the dreadnought base:\n\nALL-CONSTRUCT. SENTIENT. HOUDAN-INFLUENCE.\n\nAll communication is lost after that. Fearing the worst, the two decide immediately to return to base.", "summary": "Dangan GB2 is a short simplistic boss-rush, bullet-hell, shoot 'em up released for the Game Boy Color to celebrate the console's 25th anniversary.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dangan-gb2"}
