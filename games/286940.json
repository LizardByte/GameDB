We at iam8bit immensely appreciate what our friends at Annapurna have done to elevate gaming, so we partnered with them to produce this one-of-a-kind anthology.\n\nIntroducing the Annapurna Interactive Deluxe Limited Edition Collection \u2014 a first-of-its-kind release, featuring a whopping 12 games, neatly packed onto a single Switch cart. Just pop it in and watch each title, including 4 previously unreleased physical games, flood your dashboard.\n\nThis collection is more than just the games, though. In addition to the ultra premium packaging, we\u2019ve also included a foreword from Annapurna Interactive founder, Nathan Gary, as well as an art booklet featuring exclusive statements from each game\u2019s creative visionaries.\n\nAnd because the legacy of Annapurna Interactive is so directly intertwined with the history of the Nintendo Switch, we knew this collection needed something extra special to bring it all together. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve included an Exclusive & Luxurious Annapurna Interactive Console & Cartridge Case. Prepare to feel safe, secure, and fashionable as you take your console on-the-go. You won\u2019t find these anywhere else!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/annapurna-interactive-deluxe-limited-edition-collection"}
