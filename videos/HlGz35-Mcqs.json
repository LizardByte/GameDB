Have you ever wanted to navigate the corridors of power? Have you ever wanted to take on corporate sellouts? Have you ever wanted to evade questions about your irregular tax returns? Well, here\u2019s your chance.\n\nWe\u2019re building POLITICAL ARENA: a video game that puts you in the center of American democracy.  This is a first-of-its-kind political sandbox where no two playthroughs are alike, complete with high stakes campaign strategizing, backroom legislative dealing, special interests, and the ever-watchful press. Developed by acclaimed political journalist and humorist Eliot Nelson and a team of veteran game designers, developers and artists, Political Arena will be available -- with your help! -- on PCs and Macs in 2022 with more platforms to follow.  \n\nAmerican democracy is in peril: special interests and anti-democratic forces are growing ever more sophisticated -- leveraging the courts, fake grassroots organizations, arcane legislative maneuvers, academia, the media and more to achieve their goals.\n\nThe better you know how things work when the TV cameras are off, the better you\u2019ll be able to bring about positive change. Plus, with POLITICAL ARENA, you\u2019ll never have to personally endure the worst parts of elected office, like all the amorality of wearing a suit to a state fair.\n\n\nVisit our WEBSITE: http://www.politicalarena.com/\nFollow us on TWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/politicalarena\nFollow us on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/PoliticArena", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HlGz35-Mcqs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HlGz35-Mcqs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HlGz35-Mcqs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HlGz35-Mcqs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HlGz35-Mcqs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Political Arena | A Video Game About American Power | Kickstarter | Eliot Nelson Can't Wear Hats", "description": "In this completely uninterrupted presentation, game creator Eliot Nelson discusses Political Arena's features and isn't interrupted.
