Now, along with Luigi, the Toad Brigade, Toadette, and 3 new purplians named Magenta, Perse, and Lavender, they set out on a scientific expedition into deep space. Unfortunately, things go wrong, and their ship ends up stranded in a distant system.\n\nHowever, they are not alone. They encounter a race of aliens called the Yellonials, who were forced to wander the universe after their home planet was conquered by King Purplius years earlier. Now they want one thing: revenge against the Purplians.\n\nThey also meet a group called THE PURPLE KNIGHTS. These King Purplius loyalists fled into space after their plan to take over Planet Purplius failed miserably. As bumbling as they seem, they claim to have some sort of secret weapon up their sleeves!\n\nCan our heroes overcome these enemies and get back home?
