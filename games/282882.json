The game takes place some time after the first game. Alex Chaikin has finished his service in the army and came back home with the girl he met there. They got married and had 2 kids. But Alex, being a lazy guy, didn't look for work and lived off the money he got carrying out a special mission in the army. Soon afterwards, the young couple ran out of money and Kate, his wife, sent him off to find a job.\n\nIt didn't take too long to find a job as Alex received a phone call from his friend asking him to join the ranks of the Police. Thus, getting his first job to investigate a burglary, players will begin the adventure game.\n\nBeing a point and click adventure game, players will need to find, pick up and use various objects in different situations. Alex also has access to a police database, where he can find out extra info about the important characters in the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dmb-2--1"}
