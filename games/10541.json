But something is different\u2026 a feeling of anxiety comes over you and something strange happens, causing you to black out. Waking up on a deserted beach without any knowledge of who you are or where you are, you bring yourself to your feet. Looking around you, everything you used to know has seemingly been wiped from your memory. Why did this happen? Did someone do this on purpose? If so, was it meant for you or someone else? \n\nIt's up to you to piece your memories together to find out all these answers by solving the puzzles in each memory from your past that are housed in there own rooms. However, this won\u2019t be an easy task as not only are these puzzles very difficult, but you are also pursued by the Soul Cloud\u2019s anti-virus who believes that you are the cause of all these 'problems' in the network. Every puzzle solved unlocks a memory which reveals more about your life when you were alive: a walk on a beach, visiting loved ones now lost from your life and confronting demons who have manipulated your career and very existence. \n\nOnce you have pieced together all your memories the games narrative and game play will lead you to a dramatic climax which brings the answers you are looking for but also questions the very nature of life and your creations coming back to haunt you.", "summary": "Imagine a world where death is no longer final, where precious memories are saved to enjoy forever, where your soul is immortal, welcome to the Soul Cloud.
