Not to be confused with the other cancelled adaptation in 2000, nor the released movie tie-in in 2005.\n\nA game based on the original animated series was announced on April 9, 1996 for the PlayStation. The game, which was loosely based on \"The Demiurge\" episode, was being developed by Cryo Interactive and published by Viacom New Media. The game first made an appearance at E3 that same year, with \u00c6on Flux creator Peter Chung on hand to promote it, and commercial advertising was even included in the 1996 VHS release of the animated series.\n\nViacom was dissolved when Spelling Entertainment realized it had two video game divisions. Spelling folded Viacom into Virgin in 1997, which then canceled all working and planned Viacom titles \u2013 Aeon Flux being one of them.\nMeanwhile, Cryo reworked the game into a title called PAX Corps, which was released in Europe to poor reviews. No US publisher has signed on to bring the game here.\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact the GT Interactive has acquired the rights to the Aeon Flux license, though no game has been announced to date.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aeon-flux", "videos": [{"id": 107180, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "smo60MPUo8k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smo60MPUo8k", "title": "E3 1996 Aeon Flux game trailer presentation (canceled PS1 game)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/smo60MPUo8k/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 107181, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SwfeyjnO-QU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwfeyjnO-QU", "title": "\u00c6on Flux - 1996 Prototype (Pax Corpus) [PS1]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SwfeyjnO-QU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
