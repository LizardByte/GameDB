It's too bad I missed the line skip on map 7, though; it doesn't help a ton, but it made the rest of the map more dangerous than it should have been, and I got close to death as a result and confused the route a bit by forgetting to press a switch. I added a bonus demo showing my strafe40 setup for the line skip executed properly; dunno if I or anyone else will ever improve this, but at least for IL speed and maxes, this should be useful.\n\nCaptured using PrBoom+ 2.5.1.5", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HHKNKKJfZqs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HHKNKKJfZqs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HHKNKKJfZqs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "H2H XMas Single Segment UV-Max in 1:46:17", "description": "H2H XMas: https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/xmas/h2h-xmas (idgames), https://www.dsdarchive.com/wads/h2h-xmas (DSDA).\n\nAdvanced HUD was used when recording this run for kill and secret counters.\n\nThis was my first real attempt (total # is 2 since the first time I launched the run I quit right at the start of map 1).
