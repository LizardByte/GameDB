{"id": "6DB5Mb5S2zs", "snippet": {"title": "Donkey Kong Land III Playthrough Part 2", "description": "This part finishes Cape Codswallop and begins Primate Plains. These are the levels shown in this part:\r\n\r\nKoco Channel: This is the first riverbank level in the game. The main enemies here are Kocos. It's not that difficult. This level contains Squitter the Spider. I am not a fan of his controls in this game.\r\n\r\nA little before the Squitter Barrel, there's a huge hill. Use Squitter's web platforms while on the hill and go to the left to find a Bonus Barrel. Or, the easier way: Just fly over there as Dixie Kong.\r\n\r\nFind the Token!!: You must go through a huge part of the riverbank to find a Bonus Coin at the ending. It's easier just to fly over the water as Dixie Kong. A Re-Koil will try to stop you from progressing.\r\n\r\nRight after turning back into the Kongs, go into the water, then swim left. You'll find a few Kocos along with a Bonus Barrel.\r\n\r\nCollect the Stars!: You need to simply collect every star in the area to win a Bonus Coin. Some are on land while some are in water.\r\n\r\nDK Coin: The Coin is found right at the beginning of the level, and of course, a Koin is guarding it. Right near the \"K\", you'll see a Knik-Knak. Bounce on it, then bounce on the Knik-Knak over it. You will find a secret area with a Steel Keg along with a Koin. Throw the Steel Keg so it goes over the Koin. It'll ritochet and hit him.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiftshaft Lottery: Another mill level. This level has tons of Re-Koils and Buzzes. You mainly use wooden platforms (assuming that they're supposed to be lift shafts) to progress through this level.\r\n\r\nWhile riding one of the lift shafts, you should see a Buzz to the right. Jump over it to find a new area. Avoid the Re-Koil and enter the Bonus Barrel.\r\n\r\nCollect the Stars!: You must get every star on ropes while avoiding Buzzes. Once you get all of them, you will win a Bonus Coin.\r\n\r\nAfter the group of Bristles, jump on the lift shaft and wait for it to go upwards. Now, jump to the left. You will land in a hidden barrel that will shoot you to another barrel that will shoot you into a Bonus Barrel.\r\n\r\nFind the Token!!: You must avoid Re-Koils and Buzzes while going through this area. You will find the Bonus Coin in the top left area.\r\n\r\nDK Coin: When on a lift shaft, you will see a passage on the left. Ignore it. When you reach the peak of the lift shaft that you're on, there will be another one that is descending. Land on that one and wait for it to rise. You'll find an entirely new passage with a Steel Keg and a Koin. Hit the Koin from behind with the Steel Keg.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbos Bastion: This is the first boss battle in the game. You use Enguarde for this battle. Barbos attacks by firing smaller Lurchins at you. You need to wait for the single Lurchin that she fires at you to open up. Once it does, you need to stab it as Enguarde. It'll be knocked into Barbos, which will cause damage. You also need to avoid her barrage of Lurchins that you cannot counter. After a few hits, Barbos will be defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoral Quarrel: Another underwater level. Bounty Basses, Bazzas, and Lurchins are found here.\r\n\r\nWhile descending in the level, you should find two holes that Bazzas come out of. Decend more instead of going to the right. You will find a Bonus Barrel.\r\n\r\nFind the Token!!: You must reach the end of the area while avoiding Lurchins. If you do, you will find a Bonus Coin.\r\n\r\nLater in the stage, instead of taking the path with the bananas making a left arrow, go to the bottom path for the letter \"G\" and a Bonus Barrel.\r\n\r\nCollect the Stars!: You must collect all of the stars while avoiding various enemies. Once you do, you'll win a Bonus Coin.\r\n\r\nDK Coin: Right after the checkpoint, go to the left instead of the right to find the DK Coin.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DB5Mb5S2zs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DB5Mb5S2zs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6DB5Mb5S2zs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Donkey Kong Land III Playthrough Part 2", "description": "This part finishes Cape Codswallop and begins Primate Plains.
