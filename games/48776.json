Pachio-kun simply has to lean in to examine the machines closer to ascertain how to make the machine pay out. The overall goal is to keep playing each machine, winning either through a determined strategy or simple perseverance, until all the machines have been emptied of their contents. Doing so will win the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mezase-pachi-pro-pachio-kun", "collections": [{"id": 7542, "name": "Pachio-kun"}]}
