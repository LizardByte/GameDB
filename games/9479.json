Every day, big crowds flock to the ski-regions and want to rush down the ski runs as fast as possible. But as soon as any inconveniences or delays arise, the tourists complain and money stops rolling in. Keep in mind, keeping such a slope in good repair is not as easy as you might think. Perpetual snow fall, aggressive snowboarders or strong winds mean that the pistes slowly but surely become impassable. Therefore you and the piste caterpillar have to keep on moving - in such a profession the fear of steep slopes is out of place. Slide the snow correctly, compress it and spare no effort to ensure that the slopes keep in good repair, the skiers will thank you.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snowcat-simulator"}
