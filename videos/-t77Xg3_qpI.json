Firing the lasers use energy. Taking damage from enemies or collisions can cost the player energy. The game ends when the player runs out of energy.\n\nThe HUD takes the form of a spaceship's cockpit, features the energy meter and a message indicator at the top. In the center of the HUD is the reticle, which is static as the starry background moves (along with the SAC-II's motion simulation system) with the player's directional inputs to give the impression of steering a spaceship through outer space. On the sides of the HUD are two indicator screens. The one on the left gives a visualization of the target and the amount of points earned from destroying it. The right-hand screen identifies whatever target that comes into the reticle. \n\nThis is the game scoring:    \n\nPractice Drone - 100-200 pts.\n    \nBomb Drone - 200-400 pts.\n    \nSpace Mine - 2,000 pts.\n    \nEnemy Carrier - 5,000 pts.\n\nIt never got to see widespread release in arcades, due to the cancellation of the SAC-II. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-t77Xg3_qpI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-t77Xg3_qpI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-t77Xg3_qpI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-t77Xg3_qpI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-t77Xg3_qpI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Shrike Avenger Arcade (prototype)", "description": "Shrike Avenger is a first-person space combat simulation game, which plays similarly to other titles such as Star Raiders and Starmaster, where the player battles against a force of space pirates.\n\nThe player is armed with lasers (red beams) for shooting enemies, and a tractor beam (blue beams) for collecting fuel tanks to replenish their energy.
