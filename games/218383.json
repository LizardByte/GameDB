The central tree there supplied life to the world. One day, the tree began to wither. The people of the world began fighting, but one girl came up to the tree and began crying in front of it. Her tears were filled with love and they began to rejuvenate the withered tree. With her love, the tree flourished and all was right with the world. She became known as \u2018Alicis\u2019 and was locked into a cage. One day, Alicis fell in love with a man. The tree began to wither because Alicis had given all her love to the man instead of the tree. The two decided to escape the cage and go to a different world. Once they entered that world, a bright light shone and the girl died. The man despaired and hated all light from that moment on. His hatred covered the world and brought darkness to a world that never knew anything other than light.\n\nThe heroine, Sumeragi Runa, once again sees the tree in her dream. It\u2019s her quiet place where she can just relax, but all the sudden the tree begins to wither. She attempts to save it, but before she actually does anything she wakes up. On the way to school, she hears a voice and is suddenly transported to a different world by M and L, the guardians of that world (Luche). Before she hounds them for answers, a guy with red hair appears and whisks her away at the guardians request.\n\nWhile walking, he introduces himself as Harvey and asks that she not tack on a \u2018-san\u2019 at the end of his name. He\u2019s happy that she seems like a good kid though she\u2019s kind of tainted with noir. He brings her to a castle called Sefira and introduces her to the rest of the Roacrysto.", "summary": "A PC otome game by Icing Candy.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kago-no-naka-no-alicis", "videos": [{"id": 75118, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6CCyebdUwnc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CCyebdUwnc", "title": "[Otome Game] Kago no Naka no Alicis  Demo  Part 1 (CC English Subs)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6CCyebdUwnc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
