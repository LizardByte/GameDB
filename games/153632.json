The game's gameplay is mostly derived from the classic arcade game Buster Bros., also known as Pang, but with some key differences. Where Buster Bros. may be described as an action game, TranscendPang takes the basic \"Pang\" format and turns it into a frantic shoot 'em up experience. The soundtrack features several artists from the Japanese doujin and rhythm game scenes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
