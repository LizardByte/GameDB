He was even more surprised when he dropped to his knees and burst out laughing.\n\nIndeed, this worried him when he had recovered, so as soon as the funeral was over he toddled on down to this local psychiatric hospital for a checkup. He was found to possess a borderline psychopathic personality, and it was recommended that he stay at the institute for further evaluation.\n\nOne night, Chris is awoken by a terrible scream. At first he thinks another serious inmate is being given a cold shower, but then he notices a rather eerie silence hanging over the place. He could hear unearthly moans and grisly noises in the distance. A security guard burst in, a knife buried in his spine, and collapsed upon the floor, dead. Even with slight psychosis Chris can tell something is very, very wrong. He dresses swiftly in his civilian clothes and trenchcoat, and arms himself with the deceased guard's gun.\n\nAs he prepares to face whatever is waiting for him outside the door, a thin and baffling smile crosses his face.", "summary": "Age of Evil is a horror comedy themed total conversion for Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition.
