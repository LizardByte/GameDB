They possessed immense power and wisdom and could grant wishes when pleased.\n\nHowever, over time, the dragons became increasingly reclusive and reserved, leaving humans and other races to fend for themselves. Without the guidance of the dragons, the world became a dark and perilous place, filled with monsters and dark magic.\n\nAs humans struggled for survival, a group of adventurers banded together to seek out the dragons and request their aid. They journeyed across treacherous mountains and through dark forests, facing various dangers along the way.\n\nEventually, after many months of travel, they reached the dragons' lair, a vast and sprawling system of caves deep beneath the earth. There, they found the dragons, ancient and powerful beings, slumbering amidst their treasures.\n\nThe adventurers awakened the dragons and implored them for assistance in combating the dark forces threatening to destroy the world. Initially, the dragons were hesitant to get involved, but as the adventurers pleaded with them, they recognized the merit of their cause.\n\nTogether, the dragons and adventurers fought against the darkness, driving back the monsters and restoring peace to the land. Although the dragons returned to their slumber, they knew they could count on the people of CyTale to call upon them in times of need.", "summary": "Cytale is an immersive fantasy multiplayer online game that revolves around a rich lore featuring dragons, adventurers, and the battle against dark forces.
