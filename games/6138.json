The player controls a shuttle and must navigate it through a course defined by colored stars, similar to ski slaloms. The player must also avoid obstacles, and will be awarded with extra points depending on on his/her speed across the course. \n \nAt a mere 8kB, the game is one of the smallest SG-1000 games, and was only sold in Japan.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-slalom"}
