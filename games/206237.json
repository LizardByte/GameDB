She herself implemented the new system for sending and receiving samples. And Agent Fox, the biologist investigating the unusual behaviour of the hives that have begun to spread through level zero.\n\nOthers have accepted this mission before you and have not returned. That was the fate that befell the first squad that raided the area. Their whereabouts are unknown, they lost connection with the headquarters and it is unknown whether they are dead or alive. Since that incident, only autonomous robots have had access to the area. Now it's your turn.\n\nA dystopian first-person horror adventure inspired by Backrooms that mixes liminal spaces and science fiction.", "summary": "A first-person dystopian-horror sci fi-liminal adventure inspired by Backrooms.
