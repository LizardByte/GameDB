It brings a new and innovative experience to your touch devices. It is not about winning. It is about who you play with and how you chose to play. Its a simple toy that helps you explore your relationships in new ways. You have to work your way against the other player and ensure that you end up on the top.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/circulets"}
