{"id": "VUn42XDHl6A", "snippet": {"title": "Slender Rising - Gameplay Walkthrough - Part 1 (iOS)", "description": "Slender Rising is designed as a single-player game. In the game, the player moves around an enclosed and labyrinthine location (from which there are several to choose from) and search for signs/pages scattered throughout the map. While doing so, they must avoid the enemy, a hostile supernatural being known as the Slender Man.\n\nThe signs are randomly scattered across the map. Ghostly whisper sound effects help the player find them, as well as a red arrow if the compass option is selected. The Slender Man stalks the player around the map, and can teleport closer to the player, but they must avoid looking at the enemy. When the player sees the Slender Man, they must quickly look away or they will be killed (and lose the round). Two gameplay options are available: an infinite mode where the player must find as many signs as possible before they are killed by the enemy; or a limited mode where they must collect seven signs, whilst Slender Man becomes increasingly more aggressive as they progress. Difficulty can also be selected.\n\nFour different maps/locations are available to play in: the Cursed Ruins, an old cemetery; the Desolate Town, a deserted ghost town; the Haunted Forest; and the Lost Ward, an abandoned asylum. The user can also select from multiple options of aesthetic ambience, including a daytime mode and nighttime modes (with several variations).\n\nDownload on App Store \u25b6\ufe0f https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slender-rising/id571640421\n\nPrice \u25b6\ufe0f $1.99\n\nCheck out my Main Channel \u25b6\ufe0f https://youtube.com/GoblinGamer2019\n\nSubscribe, Like and Share!\n\nThanks for Watching Slender Rising - Gameplay Walkthrough - Part 1 (iOS)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VUn42XDHl6A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VUn42XDHl6A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VUn42XDHl6A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VUn42XDHl6A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VUn42XDHl6A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Slender Rising - Gameplay Walkthrough - Part 1 (iOS)", "description": "Slender Rising is designed as a single-player game.
