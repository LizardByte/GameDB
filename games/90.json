Here you'll find spine-tingling action coupled with awesome graphics. As you race down an alpine road in your choice of eight high performance cars, you'll be amazed by the detail and realism. The sophisticated physics model recreates the feel of the cars themselves; you'll notice the difference in handling, breaking and just plain power. Plan your strategy for each track, there are six to choose from during regular play, and each demands a different style of driving.\n\nThere's also a bonus track if you win the Tournament. There are four game modes to try, with an option to compete against another driver over a modem. With different cars, different tracks, and different styles of racing fueling your need for speed, you'll find your addiction growing to a fewer pitch. No need to worry, when you crash and burn in the game, there's always another day.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-need-for-speed", "videos": [{"id": 118155, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dFwuwUlJ5Jo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFwuwUlJ5Jo", "title": "PSX Longplay [377] Road and Track Presents: The Need for Speed", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dFwuwUlJ5Jo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
