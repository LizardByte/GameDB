To save the Kingdom, you\u2019ll need to enter the King\u2019s mind palace and hack and slash your way through his twisted nightmare full of goblins, banshees, and bosses.\n\nOn your quest, you'll be able to unlock 20 playable heroes from the Mighty Quest universe, including the mighty Lord Logan and the infamous plague doctor Coma, as well as loot that will help level up your combat. The King's mind palace takes the shape of a massive maze with 15 different zones that have been overrun by a purple-ish goo called the void. You'll need to eradicate the void as you make your way through the maze, but beware - each zone contains unique enemies and deadly bosses.\n\nIn the Hub, you'll be able to prepare for your next run, selecting which hero to play as and equipping them with a build. The hero you choose will also dictate where you start in the maze. In addition, you'll unlock new perks and upgrades that will empower you in your fight against the void.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mighty-quest-rogue-palace", "videos": [{"id": 89116, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zeg2W2mzilc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeg2W2mzilc", "title": "Mighty Quest Rogue Palace | Official Game Trailer | Netflix", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zeg2W2mzilc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
