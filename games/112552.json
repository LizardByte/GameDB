Both of them take the night train that goes from Toyo's Ueno to Sapporo but what started as a normal train travel soon will start to be a little more complicated since they will be involved into murders, assassins and other dangerous situations.\n\nThe player can choose at the beginning of the game which story he wants to play and the situations and reactions of each character are different, so there is 2 adventures in the same game. The game is played in a first person perspective and is like an interactive movie and depending of the player choices his character will or not survive the travel. There are different endings and different death scenes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/19-03-ueno-hatsu-yakou-ressha"}
