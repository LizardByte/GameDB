{"id": "D-3UdDRG7io", "snippet": {"title": "[Longplay] NES - Castlevania \"100%\" (HD, 60FPS)", "description": "Played by xRavenXP (me)\n\nThis is the longplay of the game Castlevania, known in Japan as Akumajou Dracula and released in 1986. Castlevania is a series of action games and platform launched in the 80's and that has become one of the most famous and successful series of Konami, having the first release on the NES and shortly afterwards on MSX. This version features Simon Belmont, who, while not the first in the Belmont family's lineage chronologically, was the first protagonist of this great saga. The year is 1691, and Simon is a descendant of a lineage of vampire hunters from a family called Belmont, a family destined to fight Count Dracula and his hordes of Darknesses inhabiting Castlevania by taking the Vampire Killer whip, one of the Trademarks of the series.\n\nThe player controls Simon Belmont and his Vampire Killer whip, which can be improved strength and range by getting special items throughout the game. In addition, various \"sub-weapons\" that can be obtained and which provide different means of attack to the cost of hearts obtained. To obtain items it is necessary to break down chandeliers, some walls and other certain items situated throughout the castle.\n\nThe graphics of the game are very dark and even simple, but very detailed, and have become extremely ideal for a game of this type, the songs are remarkable and the gameplay is good but great care is needed when jumping because the character does not change the direction of its jump in the air until it reaches the ground and this is something that raises criticism of more current game players, add to the fact that the character does not jump while climbing or descending stairs. And even though that same gameplay has lasted for several games in the Castlevania franchise, it's considered one of the most remarkable aspects of the game.\n\nThis video I recorded with 100% collecting all the secrets (shiny items, crounching areas, secret walls with Pot Roast and Misc Items). This video was recorded in two playthroughs: one at the normal level and another at the hard level (where besides normal secrets there are also secrets unique to this level of difficulty and even an item that is impossible to get at the moment: 27:08). Unlike the Japanese version, this American version does not have an Easy mode, which further increases the difficulty. Castlevania is a classic more than recommended!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-3UdDRG7io/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-3UdDRG7io/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-3UdDRG7io/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-3UdDRG7io/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D-3UdDRG7io/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Longplay] NES - Castlevania \"100%\" (HD, 60FPS)", "description": "Played by xRavenXP (me)\n\nThis is the longplay of the game Castlevania, known in Japan as Akumajou Dracula and released in 1986.
