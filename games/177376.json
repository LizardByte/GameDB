(It couldn't come at a better time. Thanks to the Lord for all of the recent business, but still, it's quite a lot.)\n\nTo start, I need help with an intake this week. His name is Carlos. Carlos was suspended earlier this week, and his school requested a therapist's letter before approving re-entry. His parents specifically sought out our reparative therapy services, which I have full confidence in your ability to provide.\n\nI can't be there to help, but remember: \"I assure you, even if you had faith as small as a mustard seed you could say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible.\"\n\nIn faith,\nJohn Paul", "summary": "Newly hired by Reparative Faith Counseling, you take your first unsupervised client. How the sessions go is up to you.
