Crimson Court is a parallel campaign experienced alongside the main Darkest Dungeon content that will provide you with new challenges and variation at every difficulty level. The narrative grounding sheds some light on the Ancestor\u2019s early days, and will be presented in the same style of cut-scenes you\u2019ve seen elsewhere in the game. \n \nThe DLC is designed to be played alongside an existing campaign, or as a brand new one--your choice! The events and features will unlock over the course of play.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/darkest-dungeon-the-crimson-court", "videos": [{"id": 22808, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iCJ6UNvEG94", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCJ6UNvEG94", "title": "Darkest Dungeon - The Crimson Court - Launch Trailer [OFFICIAL]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iCJ6UNvEG94/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
