The game screen shows the machine being played in the centre while to the right is the player's stack of coins, the player clicks on a coin to transfer it to the machine so that they can play. An unusual feature of this game is the way cash is paid out, if/when a player wins and collects their cash the coin stack on the right is updated immediately while the coins collected do a little dance across the bottom of the screen before eventually disappearing.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jackpot-jubilee"}
