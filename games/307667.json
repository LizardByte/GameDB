Mario Forever Remake contains a bunch of never-before-seen additional worlds, like my long-living Letter Worlds Series, or Crist\u2019s Minus Worlds. The game is based on the original Mario Forever versions that are between 2.16 and 4.4, with some little features from 5.0 and 5.9.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-forever-remake--1"}
