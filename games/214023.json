Find your own path through the world of Little Pond.\nDuring your adventure you will meet the charming inhabitants of the forest. Some are talkative, some are grumpy, but all of them will lend you an ear on your adventure.\nMost of the animals you meet will be glad to help Teacup\u2026 in exchange for a small favor or some help.
