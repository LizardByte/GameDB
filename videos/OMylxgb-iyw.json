It's just such an interesting gadget that I felt like showing a part of Nintendo's history. This Playthrough is going to show most of this Camera's features and mini-games. Sorry, but I am not going to be unlocking every picture in the album. Some of the requirements are ridiculous. Also, Groose shall be taking my place in the mini-games. It's the closest you're going to get to an official \"The Legend of Groose\". I'm going to give a brief explanation of each mini-game.\r\n\r\nSpace Fever II: This is where you can choose from the other mini-games. With each shot, you will alternate between one and two bullets. One hit (or pressing B) results in a game over. There are three rounds to the main game, each one ending in a creepy, giant head. The third round's boss will be the Game Face you inserted (in terms of mine, I used Groose). I seemed to rush too much in this, trying to get 2,000 points early. The bosses are pathetically easy and can be killed by just repeatedly pressing A, not moving at all. Just hope that you don't get unlucky. If you get over 2,000 points (which is what I was aiming for), you will be able to play the mini-game known as \"Run! Run! Run!\".\r\n\r\nBall: Based on the Game & Watch title with the same name, you need to juggle the three balls and prevent any of them from hitting the ground. It's a pretty simple game.\r\n\r\nDJ: As the name implies, you are a DJ in this mini-game. You can make songs and recordings here. It's a fun little thing to do if you're bored.\r\n\r\nRun! Run! Run!: This is definitely the hardest mini-game to \"win\" if you don't have fast fingers. I am horrible at button mashing when it comes to the Game Boy or Super Nintendo controller's buttons. You tap A to run, Up to jump, and tap B to flap your arms. It's extremely difficult trying to beat the mole, but beating it in under 22 seconds (which gives you the real credits) is quite simple.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion for the viewers:\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the weirdest game or product Nintendo made?", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OMylxgb-iyw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OMylxgb-iyw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OMylxgb-iyw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Camera Playthrough", "description": "\"Who are you running from?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy am I doing this?
