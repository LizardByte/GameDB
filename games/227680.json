There will be quite a strong theme of nostalgia - we will meet many familiar characters, go through similar mini-games and visit places we know. The game uses the formula of Reksio's Adventures (adventure game interspersed with mini-games) adapted to pixel art; the best comparison I can find in the gaming industry is Oneshot."}
