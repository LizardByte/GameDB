In this virtual bowling game, you can steer the ball all the way to the pins!\n\nSound too easy? Not really -- you must dodge trolley cars in San Francisco 2099, leap buses on the streets of Tokyo, navigate across a pitching ship on the High Seas, and avoid whatever other obstacles are thrown your way.\n\nPlayers seeking more predictable play can always fine tune their skills in a Classic bowling alley or bowl through a peaceful Yosemite forest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hyperbowl-arcade-edition"}
