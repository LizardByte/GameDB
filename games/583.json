Small statistics are shown for every country - their last biggest win, appearances at the World Cup, etc.\n\nThe stadium and all players are really detailed. The player's texture's resolution is so high, you can easily recognize most of them. The stadium is big and impressive, and full of colored crowd.\n\nAs in FIFA Soccer 2002, animation were taken from real players, with motion sensors. Thus, some new animation were added - new sliding, falling, and more.\n\nAnd the newest feature of 2002 FIFA World Cup, is the air ball control model. You can take balls from the air, and have much more control with them - creating great goals from the air.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/2002-fifa-world-cup", "videos": [{"id": 39403, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NrzpJk_s6R8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrzpJk_s6R8", "title": "2002 FIFA World Cup - Official Trailer - GameCube", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NrzpJk_s6R8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
