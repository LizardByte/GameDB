Race down a hill with contraptions built from scrap! Play with up to 4 players in local multiplayer, or race against pre-fabricated \"bot\" opponents. Frantically build a wheel from scrap to roll down a hill: The contraption to roll the farthest wins! Start constructing your wheel by placing a scrap part anywhere on your blueprint! After that, just make sure any new parts you want to add are touching your contraption. To qualify for the race, make sure your construction covers all of the points on your blueprint."}
