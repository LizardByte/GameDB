As they head towards the precipice, two adventurers\u2014young stalwart Zalek and plucky veteran Kinissh\u2014get caught in the chaos. They soon realize the war's scope extends far beyond the mortal coil, with rumors of a primordial dragon's return looming upon the realm. Elsewhere, Zalek's mentor Rommel asks his other disciple, Ron, to join the duo, while Princess Eve of the religious capital Romo learns about her true powers. It's up to them and others to thwart Anchis' new king and stop the dark one's revival.\n\nWar-Torn Versnag is a heavily story-driven JRPG divided into chapters. You play Zalek and other party members as they wander between towns, dungeons, and other locations to do battle and advance the plot. Combat normally plays out automatically, but players can tweak characters' behaviors or manually control them as well. The game uses mouse-based controls, a rarity for X68000 exclusives; it released after much delay, late into the system's lifecycle.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/war-torn-versnag", "videos": [{"id": 105732, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "smdQcZYpIxI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smdQcZYpIxI", "title": "War-torn Versnag (X68000) \u2014 Game Showcase (\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc\u30b0\u6226\u4e71)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/smdQcZYpIxI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
