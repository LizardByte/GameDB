Fully destructible arenas like the Poison Apple Inn and Dragon's Gate have walls toppling and debris flying while a multitude of weapons, potions, and magical items spell endless melee action for up to four players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shrek-super-slam"}
