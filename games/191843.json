In other words, players have to figure out who is going to die. It does this by \"saluting\", that is, by changing the body. When the actor who plays the soul greets another character, he takes control of that character and begins to see the world through his eyes. In this way, he can carry out dialogues with different combinations with different people. Thus, new information is obtained through the story and the game is shaped. \"Finding the character to die\", which is the prerequisite for our freedom, is achieved with the information we have gained in the story. Of course, the story does not progress with dialogue alone. We can get information about the items and characters in different houses.", "summary": "Soulflow is a 2.5D fantasy detective game that offers a unique experience with its graphic style.
