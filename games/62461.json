Players get to compete as characters from the series (except for Jamito and Gloria), along with tracks loosely based on locations from the animated series.\n\nThe game offers three game modes: Cups, Exhibition, and Challenges. In \"Cups\", the player can unlock characters, while at the end of \"Challenges\" scenarios and tracks are unlocked. The player can collect power-ups along the race which can be used to benefit himself and gain an advantage in the race. Tracks include series features and scenarios such as Azteca Stadium, the city of Acapulco, the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro and also Stadium TFC in Toulouse. Each track can be raced in the opposite direction, and include alternative paths, traps and obstacles. The game features local multiplayer, allowing up to four players to compete against each other simultaneously. The game features 45 trophies or achievements that can be unlocked to progress through the game.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/el-chavo-kart", "collections": [{"id": 3614, "name": "El Chavo"}]}
