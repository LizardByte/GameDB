Conversations are multiple choice and have no bearing on the game - if you choose the wrong answer you just have to try again until you find the right one. The handling is similar to Cruise for a Corpse: Right-click on a object and choose the appropriate command. \n \nBetween scenarios you have to read short texts about European problems and what the SPD thinks to be the right solutions to them. In these texts are hidden letters which result in a password to participate in a lottery.", "summary": "Abenteuer Europa is a promotional game by the German party SPD to reach new voters for the election of the European Parliament in 1994.
