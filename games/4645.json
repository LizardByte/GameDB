The game was available for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game had a much slower pace than its predecessors which surprised and angered many PES fans but was welcomed by others who thought 4 was too fast. However it was the first to introduce the online mode on all consoles. The game was infamous for the referee halting play for very tedious fouls.", "videos": [{"id": 13476, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GocuMsShQrY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GocuMsShQrY", "title": "Pro Evolution Soccer 5 - Games Convention Trailer - PS2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GocuMsShQrY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
