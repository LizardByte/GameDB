There is no prince or an evil stepmother - you're all alone and you need to survive in a new strange world.\n\nMeet a young girl threw into the world she doesn't belong to - without name and memories. Disclose the dark secret surrounding the island inhabited only by kids and find your way back home. It's not an ordinary tale and you're not an ordinary Snow White with her Seven Dwarfs. It's a game that alternates between reality and illusion, showing the real world problems in a new, twisted way.\n\nPlay Seven Boys and discover more than 7 storylines by meeting orphans living on an Island. Every story is complementary and will give you the wider view and help you understand the game as a whole. As the story goes, the illusion and reality are overlapping gradually. Each ending will give you more information about the world and the characters that live in it, and will help you understand their motives."}
