This game is notable for being one of two scannable extras supplied on the Shining Imakuni? promotional card, the other being a biography on Imakuni? and various fun facts about him. The card is scannable via the Japanese e-Reader+ peripheral for the GameBoy Advance. It was given out with member registrations to the Pok\u00e9mon Fan Club starting January of 2002 alongside a commemorative sleeve.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/imakuni-no-ball"}
