The player can actively dodge, block, or deflect attacks. Spell and ability pre-selection is critical to defeat encounters, as is forging alliances with other players.

Through exploration, the player can uncover mysteries and unique adventures as well as acquire rare and exotic spells and abilities from dungeons and challenging encounters.", "summary": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen is a group-focused MMORPG based on challenging gameplay and open world high fantasy. It takes place in a world populated by deities and heroes, called Terminus. Mortal and planar shards which have collided create the dramatic and epic environment of Terminus. With some of those shards came deities and demigods that, over time, raised empires which forged the turbulent political landscape. Centuries later, new planar collisions have occurred that will pull the players into the world and its politics. The player is a legendary hero, stripped of his or her powerful relics and left to explore the dramatically diverse and epic regions of Terminus with hopes of reclaiming their relics and those of lost heroes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 26384, "name": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen | SDCC 17 Teaser Trailer", "video_id": "ngE1f1tVFgc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngE1f1tVFgc", "title": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen - SDCC 17 Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ngE1f1tVFgc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 26385, "name": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen | Pre-Alpha 2 Gameplay", "video_id": "QWgKSQJtHrA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWgKSQJtHrA", "title": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen Pre-Alpha 2 Gameplay w/ CohhCarnage", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QWgKSQJtHrA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 26386, "name": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen | Wild's End Teaser", "video_id": "sY-O0_cf0aQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY-O0_cf0aQ", "title": "Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen - Wild's End Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sY-O0_cf0aQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
