This game came out for the Genesis and Super Nintendo in 1996. Anyone who was around to remember when those consoles were big, probably remembers how good the old Disney games were. Aladdin, Lion King, Junglebook, the various Mickey Mouse games. They were all great. I think this game slipped under the radar of some gamer's out there. At the time, the original Playstation and Sega Saturn were out, so everyone's attention was going to those new consoles. Plus I could see plenty of guys not wanting to give it a shot, for obvious reasons. It's actually a well made environmental puzzle/platforming game though, and really surprised me. Give it a shot if you love the old Disney games, or just like Disney in general. Pocahontas is a pretty good gem that you never hear about.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FL9HnjqnkwM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FL9HnjqnkwM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FL9HnjqnkwM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Pocahontas level 1 playthrough.
