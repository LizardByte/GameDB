The game has four episodes where the player had to wander around the island, collecting various objects, speaking with the other castaways and solving various puzzles. As is the case with Mickey Mousecapade, the computer's control of Gilligan is often a source of frustration. Frequently getting stuck in things, the player has to cut him free each time, or rescue him if he falls down one of many holes. Luckily, the game has a password feature for each level. This game has been considered one of the worst games ever made because of the A.I., mostly because the Gilligan character is always falling down holes. However, it could easily be argued that the \"bad behavior\" of the A.I. Gilligan was representative of the way the character was always fouling the castaways rescue attempts on the show on which the game is based.\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est 2007 includes gameplay captures from all commercial releases from the US market with a few extras (like famicom releases) just for fun. As of Dec 2024, I've resumed efforts to update some of the older (some 360p) videos with higher-def captures. Text updates will be posted to BlueSky (which doesn't require an account to view).
