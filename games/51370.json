Milne's Winnie the Pooh series of short stories.\nEach character had lost an item of value to them and wanted the item returned. The player moves through the Hundred Acre Wood and collects the missing items then returns them to their rightful owners. Only one item can be carried at a time, so picking up one item means leaving behind of whatever item is currently being carried. Some screens have interactive sub elements. For example: you could \"climb\" Pooh's tree and see the limb where he kept his honey pots safely out of the reach of flood waters (a reference to a scene in the Disney animated movie \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\"and Chapter 9 of A.A. Milne's book Winnie-the-Pooh.). The game has no animation in the mode of a traditional Quest game such as King's Quest. Rather, the Hundred Acre Wood existed as a grid of connected static screens. Players move between the screen using the arrow keys and can only move North, South, East or West. The missing items are randomly assigned at the start of each new game to screens within this grid, although the various characters can always be found on the same screens. When an item is \"dropped\" on a screen in order to \"pick up\" another item, the dropped item stays on that screen until the user returns to retrieve it later.\nReuniting a character with their item results in a celebration screen.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/winnie-the-pooh-in-the-hundred-acre-wood"}
