We really wanted to get this together before Nintendo's conference tomorrow...err...later today, mostly in case they actually reveal a new Kirby game(which I somewhat hope yet mostly doubt they will). We don't want to steal their thunder if they were to, of course (not that that's really even possible), as wanting a new multiplayer 2.5D Kirby game in the vein of KSS but with new features and more characters and such is the main reason we started this project in the first place.
