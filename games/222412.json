The new Encyclopedia feature offers helpful information that helps you keep track of items, equipment, enemies, and the Tactical Souls System. With the new Soul Gadget option, you can get on-screen pop-ups that display whether or not a soul has been obtained every time you defeat a monster.\n\nSoma Cruz, a young high school exchange student in Japan, is somehow involved in the eternal cycle of reincarnation of the Dark Lord himself.
