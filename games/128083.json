Each Fly is colour coded and in turn, must be caught with the right colour of tongue. One out of three colours is picked every 30 seconds which triggers a tongue colour change, for every 10 Fly's picked, the difficulty spikes along with a few surprises. However, if you happen to catch a fly with the wrong colour, you will trigger a game over and a potential froggy explosion. Simplistic controls are all that are required, arrow keys to move and the space-bar to temporarily freeze and stick out your tongue.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frog-x-log"}
