The game follows the same general path as the movie, and includes media straight from the film. Present in the game are Greek, Persian, Indian and Egyptian forces, with a campaign for each. The hybrid 2D/3D engine (2D units, 3D terrain - also used in Cossacks 2: Napoleonic Wars) allows for a very large number of troops on the field. This is used to good effect, as battles can easily contain hundreds of units. Finally, multiplayer and skirmish levels are available, and the soundtrack (of the game and the movie) is by the composer Vangelis.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alexander"}
