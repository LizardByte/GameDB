The game focuses on a dark vampire cult and features a villain who becomes cursed by betraying his cult on the night of the ritual and turns into a dark creature. The player who made a deal with the devil to get rid of the curse, must hunt down cult members and curse them into his side. Meanwhile, the cultists must complete the ritual and gain vampire powers on this challenging night. But beware! When humans turn into vampires, the roles will change and the creature hunt will begin. You never know who will win in this game where teams and roles will change, where the hunter can be the prey and the prey can be the hunter. Hide in the dark, use your special powers, and survive. Most importantly, don't trust anyone. If your friend is cursed, he will turn into a creature and come after you.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cursed-deal", "videos": [{"id": 101645, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "TYbYMBG5_k8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYbYMBG5_k8", "title": "Cursed Deal - Introduction Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TYbYMBG5_k8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
