You must escape.\n\nOnce, it hung in the sky like a jeweled moon\u2014a continent-sized station filled with biomechanically enhanced citizens, all working toward some greater purpose lost to time. Bodies were replaceable, resurrection assumed.\n\nNow your city\u2014one of the last\u2014has fallen, swallowed by the encroaching darkness of the station's slow death. Beyond its walls you find yourself in the Arc's decaying superstructure, where both power and light are precious resources.\n\nBut the darkness isn't empty. It only feels that way at first.\n\nThe Arc is packed with powerful and unsettling wonders, if only you can live long enough to extract them. Master forgotten technologies and unearth secrets as you traverse yawning chasms, self replicating labyrinths, and techno-catacombs in search of a way out.\n\nYou are not the only survivor in the desolation. Form fragile alliances and build them into deeper relationships. Of course, anyone still living is likely both dangerous and treacherous, and that includes you. The choices you make will shape your journey and decide the fates of those you meet.", "summary": "GRAFT splices together tense survival horror with a dark RPG experience in a thrilling new adventure from the developers of BATTLETECH and the Shadowrun Trilogy.
