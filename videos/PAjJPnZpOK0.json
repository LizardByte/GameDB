However the game isn't glitch free as there are many times where you will have to quit out and enter a password to save yourself from being stuck or if you play long enough all the cars will dissappear from the wrold. There is also significant slow down in GTA 2 when a lot is happening which actually makes the driving easier but I owuld dtill say it is a negative. Now at the end of my longplay I pretty much just run over people to go from 4.2 million oints to 5 million because I couldn't get the final Russian mission to work right and no matter what respect levels I had for any of the gangs I couldn't find any new missions. I had fun with this one and despite all of its glitches and problems I still enjoyed playing it.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PAjJPnZpOK0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PAjJPnZpOK0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PAjJPnZpOK0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PAjJPnZpOK0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PAjJPnZpOK0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Grand Theft Auto 2  - GBC Longplay/Walkthrough #32 [720p]", "description": "Gameboy Color: Grand Theft Auto 2\n\nRating: 2.5/5\n\nI had a lot more fun with this one over the first as the districts are quite lively and there were far less glitches than the first GTA for the GBC.
