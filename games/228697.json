Over the course of each two-year timeline, the game explores all the key eras of the Star Wars Expanded Universe.\n\nTake and hold planets as an Imperial Stormtrooper, command the Rebel navy and liberate the galaxy, pursue targets as a bounty hunter, or shape things on a larger scale as a member of the Galactic Senate. Maybe you\u2019ll even be one of the few born with force sensitivity, destined to be trained by Jedi or Sith.\n\nThe game offers an extensive crafting system for engineers to supply weapons, armor, and ships to the galaxy. Develop new, cutting-edge armaments to give your side an edge, or open a shop in a bustling commercial district and become wealthy as part of a powerful engineering conglomerate.\n\nLOTJ offers full PVP in both ground and space combat, governed by a set of rules to minimize griefing and ensure that all kills have sufficient in-character cause.\n\nWhat role will you play? The legend awaits!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
