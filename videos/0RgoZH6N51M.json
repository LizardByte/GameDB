And while I think it's difficult to fully capture the strange complexities of the US voting system - this game feels arguably pretty accurate to how it works.  Money creates influence, influence does its thing, voters vote, and the electoral college does what it does.\n\nI played a few times, but for the video I played as Kamala Harris and my own independent candidate.  I think the game properly captures how insanely difficult it is to make a difference as an independent voter, but my excitement for winning California was amazing.  And, Kamala Harris won her election campaign against Trump.  I'm glad she has far better folks on her campaign than me, because I did a terrible job of making that a reality.\n\nFor my fellow Americans, please check your voter registration.\n\nhttps://www.vote.org/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0RgoZH6N51M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0RgoZH6N51M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0RgoZH6N51M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Election Tycoon:  Trump vs Harris | Kamala Harris wins the US Election 2024", "description": "#steam, #indiegame, #kamalaharris \nDisclaimer: I received a free key for the game from the developer\nFurther Disclaimer: Any political thoughts expressed in the video are my own, and not a reflection of the developer.\n\nWishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170840/Election_Tycoon_Trump_vs_Harris/\n\nIt's election season in the US, so of course we've got some Election themed games rolling in.
