{"id": 208624, "name": "Astro Command Scramble Retro!", "summary": "This is an accurate conversion from that retro vintage classic from the early 1980's brought forward to the 21st Century. Scramble by Grandstand and Astro Command by Epoch, Radio Shack and many other companies in the 80's are all the same game but in a different shell with a different name."}
