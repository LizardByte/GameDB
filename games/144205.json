Our last two games in the Nurse Love Addiction series focused on professional life with nurses and nursing students at a hospital. This game continues that focus, putting the spotlight on the people in a game development office, creating a story much like the life our team experiences daily.\n\nThe game is set at Yuriica Software, a small game development company tucked away in Koenji, a neighborhood not far from the center of the capital city Tokyo. To this day it remains wrapped in the kindness of its working-class residents. Our protagonist Ai is a simple girl from the country who makes the leap alone to see her younger sister Kokoro, currently a game company employee. The sisters had lived apart a long time due to their parents\u2019 separation.\n\nUnused to working as a game developer, Ai finds herself leading a pressured but exciting, game-like daily life surrounded by strange characters even weirder than you\u2019d find in an actual game. Her one worry is the frigid, off-putting attitude that her sister Kokoro gives her. Ai, who moved to Tokyo alone for the sake of her sister, is losing the foundation of her life. And just what is the significance of Nie Witch, the doujin game that Yuriica Software is remaking and Ai suddenly finds herself working on?\n\nYumeutsutsu Re:After\nYumeutsutsu Re:After includes the following character after stories:\n\n- Kokoro After Story: \u201cYumeutsutsu Re:Unification\u201d\n- Saki After Story: \u201cDeadline Rather than Paradise\u201d\n- Nana After Story: \u201cGhosts of the Past\u201d\n- Marie After Story: \u201cMarried Life\u201d\n- Honoka Episode: \u201cLove Story, With Her and the Dog\u201d", "summary": "Yumeutsutsu Re:Master Bundle Pack is a physical bundle including both the Yumeutsutsu Re:Master base game and Yumeutsutsu Re:After.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yumeutsutsu-re-master-bundle-pack", "videos": [{"id": 46204, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Yjmbwkpo6IE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjmbwkpo6IE", "title": "Yumeutsutsu Re:Master Bundle Pack - Nintendo Switch, PS4 - Trailer [Asia Multi-Language Retail]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yjmbwkpo6IE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
