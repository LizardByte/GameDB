It is a collection of three stories. \n \nTaken from GOG: \n \nThe first story, \"The Smuggler's Guild\", starts with the retirement of your trader father through ill health. There's no money in being an honest trader these days. Smuggling contraband is a risky business, but the rewards are great - especially for those lucky or connected enough to join the exclusive Smugglers Guild. \n \nThe second story, \"Thirst For Vengeance\", recalls the pirate raiders that killed your parents and kidnapped your sister when you were a child. As a graduate of the space academy with a ship of your own, the time has finally come to seek your revenge. \n \nIn the final story, \"Solomon\u00b4s Treasure\", your father dedicated his life to finding the hidden treasure of Solomon McTavish, legendary pirate, and died without success. Perhaps you can do better - but you are not the only one seeking this vast fortune.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smugglers-guild"}
