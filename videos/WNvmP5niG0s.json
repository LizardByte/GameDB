This is part 8, in which Henry visits a pet store, and continues through the Building World, fighting apemen, sniffer dogs and other morbid hellspawns before finally making his way to Room 207 of his apartment -- Richard's room. The Silent Hill 4 original soundtrack was composed by Akira Yamaoka. I'll be aiming for the best ending, the Escape ending, which is the hardest to get. This is a no commentary playthrough, but will still feature commentary in text format for valuable information and some trivia. Undoubtedly one of the scariest games of all time, and the scariest for me personally. I hope you'll enjoy! \n\nMy PC: \ni5-6600K 4 x 4.5 GHz OC,\nGTX 1080 Ti FTW3,\n16GB DDR4 RAM,\nEVGA 650W PSU.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNvmP5niG0s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNvmP5niG0s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNvmP5niG0s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNvmP5niG0s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WNvmP5niG0s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Silent Hill 4: The Room Walkthrough Part 8 [4K, text commentary, PCSX2]", "description": "I'm finally making a Silent Hill 4 walkthrough, Hard mode, 4K, played on the PCSX2 emulator for the best visuals, since the PC and Xbox ports look and sound worse.
