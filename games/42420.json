As D Movies gain traction, a trend emerges of disaffected young people taking permanent refuge in the virtual world while abandoning their physical bodies to atrophy. To retrieve these so-called \u201cSinkers\u201d, Japan's National Public Safety Commission establishes Public Security Division Four, nicknamed \u201cDiamond Dog\u201d, in 1984. The agents who enter the virtual world and perform these rescues are known as Debuggers.\n\nIn 1992, a seventeen-year-old girl named Y\u016bki Sayaka sinks into \u201cStory of the Ruined Capital\u201d, a D Movie directed by David Visconti. Three days pass before she is discovered, and combined with her weak constitution, she is expected to die within twenty-four hours. Two Debuggers, Shijima Ry\u014d and Tobari Maria, are dispatched to rescue her before that happens.", "summary": "Sayaka Kaori has fallen into a coma.
