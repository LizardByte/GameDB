Numerous handholds are available with which to pull himself up, helpfully labeled with keyboard letters, and if a handhold proves out of reach the player can activate a muscle-tensing big push, really striving to get close enough to the handhold to grab it. The player's body is governed by ragdoll physics, meaning that sometimes some rocking or swinging motions are needed in order to get close enough to make use of a handhold. Additional challenge is provided by shore birds who have made their nests in the handholds, obscuring the relevant letter with their feathery little bodies, plus of course the gradually-rising tide.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/girp", "videos": [{"id": 44461, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "q1STTnctFms", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1STTnctFms", "title": "GIRP playthrough: beaten in 3min 22.2s", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1STTnctFms/sddefault.jpg"}]}
