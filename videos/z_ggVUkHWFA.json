All we hold familiar and comfortable has been turned into a network of hellish, rusty, pulsating labyrinthian series of factories that serve as the nerves and organs for some greater being that only seeks to consume and grow.  Its victims have been twisted into terrifying machines, and much like worker ants, only gather victims and materials for its creator and exist to serve its goals. Your job is simple: cut it all down and stop the spread of the Growth. Mercy is weakness. Hesitation is death.\n\n\nINCISION is designed to be merciless in its difficulty, but the player will never feel weak in the face of danger. Your arsenal is varied, powerful, loud, and will turn enemies into sticky red puddles. Movement is fast and responsive. Story never stops the gameplay. INCISION puts gameplay, fun and challenge before anything else.\n\n\nINCISION is coming to Steam early access in 2021.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_ggVUkHWFA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_ggVUkHWFA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_ggVUkHWFA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_ggVUkHWFA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_ggVUkHWFA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "INCISION - Realms Deep 2021 Trailer", "description": "GET THE DEMO HERE: https://smoothbraindev.itch.io/incision\n\n\n\nINCISION is a brutal, fast, dark blast from the days of Doom, Quake and Duke Nukem 3D.\n\n\nThe world has transformed into a living nightmare where chaotic mass of flesh and machine live in unholy symbiosis.
