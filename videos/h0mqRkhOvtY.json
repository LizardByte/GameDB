I had played the first three already (that would be parts I, IV, and VI for those of you that don't remember how pre-FF7 numbering worked!), and I loved them all. The stories, the music, the melodrama... Square had made a fan out of me.\n\nThis is actually the game that convinced me that I needed a Playstation, and what convinced my parents to get me one for my birthday not long after the game was released. It's also the reason that I passed on the N64 - Mario 64 was cool and all, but I wanted Final Fantasy, and if Square was jumping ship to Sony, I would happily follow. Sorry, Nintendo. Even in hindsight, if I had the choice to make again, I'd make the same one everytime. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII was a hugely important release, not just for Sony, Square, and RPG fans, but for video games. It represented a major paradigm shift in how gaming approached storytelling with the new tech. Granted, the plot was a bit of a muddled mess (and it wasn't a terribly compelling one, if I were to offer my completely honest opinion), but the use of prerendered backgrounds, FMV, and 3D characters gave this one much more weight and impact than the older titles had. It presented a somewhat more \"adult\" storyline with a massive world that felt much more convincing and alive than we'd seen before. It was a massive kick just to endlessly run around the map discovering hidden items and getting beaten to death again and again, just to see what you might stumble on next.\n\nIt is also the game generally credited with popularizing the RPG genre in the west. Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, Chrono Trigger, Phantasy Star - they were all fantastic games, but they were very niche products that sold poorly next to platformers and fighting games. FF7 had finally dragged the concept of turn-based battles to the masses, and it became one of the best-selling games of its generation... and one of the most popular games of all time, despite now being 23 years old. \n\nThe revamped battle system, the materia customizations, the fairly free-form nature of the middle of the game - they're all things that had evolved out of older Final Fantasy titles, but the seventh pulled them all together in just the right way for the technology available at the time to bring the series mainstream.\n\nI played it many times over and never got tired of it, and I still found it fun to go through again for this recording. I can't say as I'm enamored with it as I was when it was new - I still think that FF4 and FF6 are better games - but this one still holds as a classic that shouldn't be missed.\n\n(Also, be sure to check out the NES demake of FF7: https://youtu.be/iBq9jBHnyt0 )\n\n*Note: there is a filter running over the video. I'm not usually a huge fan recording with filters, but this video looked pretty gross without them. The reason is that FF7 regularly switches resolutions. In game it runs at 320x240, but it switches to 365x240 for the menu and post-battle screens. Since both images had to fit the same 960x720 frame, I couldn't use integer scaling without leaving huge black bars on the image, and using any other scaling factor caused the font text look chunky and uneven. Finding neither of these things acceptable, I used the filter to even those differences out and to make it appear a bit more natural. It's a compromise, sure, but in my mind, this was the one that made the smallest sacrifice to the image quality. This way the game's image still fills the screen the way it should, it maintains the correct aspect ratio at all times, and the text looks consistent and even.\n_____________\r\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \r\n\r\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0mqRkhOvtY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0mqRkhOvtY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0mqRkhOvtY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0mqRkhOvtY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Final Fantasy VII (PS1) Playthrough [1 of 3] - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Square's 1997 JRPG for the Sony Playstation, Final Fantasy VII.\n\nThis is the first part of the three-part playthrough, showing from the beginning through the first visit to Cosmo Canyon.\n\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/ub0qHDFZayE\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/dNzygpMl3Ss\n\nFor reference, the Midgar portion of the game ends at 5:20:03.\n\nFinal Fantasy VII wasn't my first game in the series, but it was one that I remember pretty eagerly anticipating.
