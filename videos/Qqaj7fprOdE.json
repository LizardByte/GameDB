{"id": "Qqaj7fprOdE", "snippet": {"title": "ODS Carnival Games - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) - Longplay", "description": "ODS Carnival Games is an educational game released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997. The game tasks you with performing arithmetic, and every time you correctly finish an equation, a stuffed bear hits a high striker, increasing the count by one. When the count reaches five, a series of pulleys knocks the robot, Blit into a dunk tank. The game then resets.\n\nThis longplay clears every difficulty in the game. There is no penalty for incorrect answers, and seemingly no upper limit on the number of digits that can be submitted in your answer, although only numbers are allowed.\n\nI wanted to upload this because Ohio Distinctive Software was a big part of my childhood and I couldn't find any footage of it on Youtube. Fortunately this game along with many other Ohio Distinctive games has been preserved digitally and can be found archived online. \n\nOhio Distinctive still operates but seems to be out of software publishing. Their facebook page suggests that they shut down during covid and reopened selling items such as mugs.\n\nIf you played this game please comment and let me know the when and where. My mother worked for the marketing firm that Ohio Distinctive used, so we ended up with discs of many of their games. I'm guessing that if anyone else played these games it would have been in a school setting but I'm not sure.\n\nThis session was recorded on December 9th, 2022 using DOSBox running Windows 3.1.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qqaj7fprOdE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qqaj7fprOdE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qqaj7fprOdE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qqaj7fprOdE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qqaj7fprOdE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ODS Carnival Games - Ohio Distinctive Software (1997) - Longplay", "description": "ODS Carnival Games is an educational game released by Ohio Distinctive Software in 1997.
