Don't take it all on yourself. Playing with your friends is a great way to solve this problem. The more people you have, the better. Go out with as many friends as you can!\n\nIt's easy, isn't it? It's all you need and your ball will fly straight to wherever you want it to go. Or rather, it's hard not to fly too far.\n\nIf your ball accidentally hits a friend, don't worry. They will laugh and forgive you. Of course, you too, please be prepared to take physical risks.\n\nRemember, we are all a team. You may have one club, but you have as many chances as the number of your friends to get a shot. Sometimes, you just need to find the right spot, push the directional key and leave the club to your friends.\n\nHave a nice golf!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shall-we-golf"}
