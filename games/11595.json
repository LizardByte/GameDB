The game is a hybrid of an action role-playing and a tactical role-playing. Movement is done on a square grid with turns being determined by figuring out which character has the highest AP. On the player's turn, he or she can move his character into position and choose to attack an enemy.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/namco-x-capcom", "videos": [{"id": 4918, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "hIgRgZyGbb0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIgRgZyGbb0", "title": "[PS2]\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30ab\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hIgRgZyGbb0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 37317, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "TlKPpRiEaoo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlKPpRiEaoo", "title": "Namco X Capcom - Chapter 5 Devil's Gene Part 10/50", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TlKPpRiEaoo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
