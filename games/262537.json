We're led by our passion for creation and desire to always raise the bar of quality.\n\nOur goal with Half-Life 2 RTX is to deliver a new way to experience Valve's classic, using cutting-edge rendering tech to bring the game to life in a way never before possible. At the same time, we'll be remastering all of the game's assets, to be made available to the community for free. With Half-Life 2 RTX and the release of its assets, we hope to ignite new passion within the community to explore the potential of RTX in remastering classic mods, or making new mods with RTX in mind!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/half-life-2-rtx", "videos": [{"id": 96131, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "aM_gzfAMdNs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM_gzfAMdNs", "title": "Half-Life 2 RTX, An RTX Remix Project - Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aM_gzfAMdNs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
