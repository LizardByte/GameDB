Players control King Graham, now ruler of Daventry, as he searches for a bride in the land of Kolyma. The game follows Graham's quest to rescue a maiden named Valanice, who is imprisoned in a quartz tower by an evil witch. Players guide Graham through various locations, solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles using inventory items and interaction with characters. The game world draws inspiration from fairy tales and folklore, featuring encounters with classic characters and creatures. King's Quest II expands on the gameplay established in the first game, offering a larger world to explore and more complex puzzles. As the second installment in the series, it continues the story of Graham and introduces elements that would become important to the broader King's Quest narrative, including the character of Valanice, Graham's future queen.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-s-quest-ii-romancing-the-throne", "collections": [{"id": 135, "name": "King's Quest"}]}
