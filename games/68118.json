Played from a third-person perspective, the player needs to walk around, construct buildings, provide roads, and then screen the emails of possible inhabitants. Citizens need to be kept happy by interacting with them - give them gifts, listen to their gossip and complaints. If their needs are attended to (through schools, hospitals or entertainment), they will ditch the town. Build commercial, utility, entertainment industries to appease your citizens and make this a city people want to live in.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metropolismania-2"}
