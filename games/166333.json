Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells. The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a 'Niffler'. It is a simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys. Depending on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you. Perform well enough, and it will become really happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire--1", "videos": [{"id": 54272, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SI9mLuYE45U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI9mLuYE45U", "title": "harry potter and the goblet of fire gba playthrough part 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SI9mLuYE45U/sddefault.jpg"}]}
