You play as a peaceful zombie who is on an adventure, as you play the game the story enfolds. Try to find out who you are and what's going on and maybe what the future holds. It is based in an post apocalyptic land out in the desert where you parked up your RV and set up base for a while.\n\nIn this short but sweet little point and click adventure game, you will come across characters who need your help, or at least will help you in your quest. You will also get to read up on what and why things have happened to get you to this point.\n\nDid you know, in the future they produce brains in cans?\n\nThis game has been updated for the steam release, including some new graphics, scenes, clickable items, and some quality of life updates.\n\nWe do hope you will support us and enjoy the adventure so we are able to continue on with the sequel(s)!", "summary": "A bite sized post apocalyptic point and click adventure game, where you play as a passive zombie.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-adventures-of-zomboy", "videos": [{"id": 133924, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "SJJua6LI3gI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJJua6LI3gI", "title": "The Adventures of Zomboy Trailer 2024", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SJJua6LI3gI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
