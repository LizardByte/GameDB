As such, the game veers away from anachronisms and modern fantastical elements like magic and mythological creatures. Instead, it is more centered on historical realism mixed with superstitions that existed in that period of Russian history.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/requital", "videos": [{"id": 90359, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dsDoUF7ekOg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsDoUF7ekOg", "title": "\"Requital\"/\"\u0412\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\" HD Playthrough Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dsDoUF7ekOg/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8803, "name": "Wolfhound"}]}
