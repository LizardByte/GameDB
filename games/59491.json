The player has to take care of the incoming and outgoing traffic on an airport, including take-off and landing clearance. He also has to make sure that the aircrafts don't crash together and approach the airport from the correct direction. The whole game takes place on a map where all airports and aircrafts are marked; on the right side of the screen is a list of all planes and their destination. When clicking on the entries a menu pops up where the player can give commands like changing the height. When something's about to go wrong the player receives a warning so he can react.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/air-command-3-dot-0"}
