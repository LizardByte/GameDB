WolfQuest is a wildlife simulation game about wolf ecology. Playing as a two-year-old gray wolf in Yellowstone National Park, you'll learn how to live on your own, finding food, meeting other wolves, and searching for a mate. Ultimately, your goal is to find a home and raise your own family.\n\nYour quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain and eventually takes you across the Lamar Valley to Slough Creek. There, you and your mate will establish a territory and raise a litter of pups: training them, feeding them, defending them against predators, and finally taking them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Ultimately, your success will depend on your ability to ensure the survival of your pack.\n\nPlay the game alone or with friends in on-line multiplayer missions, which now feature the complete pup-raising mission arc. Private multiplayer games feature text and voice chat. Both private and public games have phrase chat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
