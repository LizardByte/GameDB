As in that game, there is a top-down view of an arena containing two equally equipped tanks who engage in a fight to the death. Each tank can fire a bullet at a time, and move to avoid the opponent's fire. Contact with a bullet will destroy your tank, earning your opponent a point, and the first player to five points wins the contest.\n\nThe current game has a couple of important differences from the original. The most important is that bullets do not just travel in a straight line after you fire them. They move in the direction in which you last directed your tank. This allows you to fire around corners, and even to shoot yourself (gifting your opponent a free point). Secondly, there are a number of different arenas which can be chosen, with different wall layouts. Some of these layouts also include a turn-style which allows you to pass but stops any pursuing bullets. Finally there are two speed settings (for fast and slow bullets).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-bullet"}
