You\u2019ve played games with your cat. Now, let your kitty really get in on the action with Sitten Kitten, the first, best, and only NES game designed to be played by your cat.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent months perfecting our Feline Detection System to accurately track where your cat is located at all times. When your kitty plants its tail on one of the Power Pad buttons, they rack up the points and earn a steady stream of verbal accolades and cat-courgament. Proud owners helping their feline friend stretch for that high score can guide them to mega-point bonus buttons.\n\nTo throw some extra catnip on this feline feast, we\u2019re partnering up with rescue shelters and adoption clinics to find homes for cats everywhere. A portion of every purchase goes to helping these neglected and abused kitties land on their feet in a new home, and we\u2019ll be featuring every feline adoptee on our site in a paw-some cat mosaic.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sitten-kitten"}
