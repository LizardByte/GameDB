The turn-based gameplay is similar to games like Tank, Scorched Earth, and more recently Worms, except it now takes place in space and gravity is not only pulling the space ship's missiles down, but towards any nearby planet. There is a large variety of weapons to take out enemy ships. The shareware version is fully playable, but only the registered version allows custom weapons. The game supports both single-player and multiplayer games.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warheads-se"}
