The key difference between Dungeonbowl and Blood Bowl as is rather obvious from the name, is that Dungeonbowl is played in a dungeon!\n\nThe game also introduces some subtle modifications to the standard Blood Bowl rules. A match is still played between two teams, but each side is composed of three races. For example, the roster of a Rainbow Wizards team contains Wood Elves, Halflings and Humans.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeonbowl", "collections": [{"id": 869, "name": "Blood Bowl"}]}
