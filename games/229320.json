So that's pretty much what Dernshous is, but I feel like it's still too much of a conventional game that it doesn't work how I'd like. I think I would've preferred it narrowed down more with a stronger focus rather than being half a normal space game.\n\nDernshous was almost meant to be a much simpler version of Slumos, my other space flying game, but it got out of hand as well. I included an old version of the game because I kind of like the looser under-done feel of it, I often feel like I lose something as I try and refine my games, so the older version could remind me of what I was going for / ideas I had earlier, as I was getting a bit lost with what to focus on.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-pirate-dernshous"}
