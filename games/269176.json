Evolution is an updated console-only port of Take the A-Train IV, the fourth main entry in Artdink's long-running railroad management simulation series. It is largely a straight port of the original PC title, but the interface and graphics have been redesigned for the console format. The most significant new feature of this version is the ability to ride the trains and view the player's city in a full 3D polygon view, which would become a staple of later entries. The game was later released internationally with a number of additions as A.IV Evolution Global.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aiv-a-ressha-de-ikou-4-evolution"}
