It's not a big business, but their reputation is steadily going up. One day, their past teacher Ingrid requests them to write books for the new library that is being built. The library will be finished in 5 years, so they are requested to write at least one book every year during that time.\n\nDuring the years, Marie and Elie are introduced to Anis Ryftchen, a young alchemist studying to become a teacher. While Anis initially seems cheerful, it's soon revealed that she is overworking herself. Anis is struggling to keep up with both her work at the academy and her vision to write books for her school back in the Southern Country. Marie and Elie offers to help her, but this is ultimately up to the player to choose.", "summary": "Atelier Marie, Elie & Anis: Message on the Gentle Breeze is a Strategy game, published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 2003.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
