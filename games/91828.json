Designed around familiar game mechanics, a character explores a world, avoiding monsters and collecting items, while urging the player to reflect on the actions. The game is entirely controlled by the keyboard and is set in a maze that represents the mind. Based on the actions, it can be explored in a normal or a psychedelic state changing the main character's features.\n\nIn general, the gameplay is designed around the \"chasing the dragon\" and the \"cold turkey\" states that can be induced by addiction. The way the player tries to shake off or enhance the habit influences the outcome and the way the game is played and controlled.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/akrasia"}
