Those who support the forces of light are known as the Night Watch, while those that fight on the side of darkness are the Day Watch. These two sides have been locked in an epic battle with the common hope of one ultimately claiming a decisive victory and a right to rule the world.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/night-watch", "videos": [{"id": 140511, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YXyUV7wsDN4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXyUV7wsDN4", "title": "Night Watch Trailer - E3 2006 (PC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YXyUV7wsDN4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
