Unlike the other versions there is no canyon racing or drift racing.\n\nThe goal of the game is to build up a gang of the best racers and take over all the city's territories. The driving is all city-based similar to the open world of Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The tuner culture/car customization features started in Need for Speed Underground are also present.\n\nThere is a light story, presented as comic book style illustrations, that unfolds as the player take over territories and complete chapters.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-carbon-own-the-city", "videos": [{"id": 5018, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "0wKM1-v3StE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wKM1-v3StE", "title": "Need for Speed CARBON Own the City Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0wKM1-v3StE/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 5019, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7bcCOEKz9iU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bcCOEKz9iU", "title": "Need for Speed CARBON Own the City Krimson Crew", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7bcCOEKz9iU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
