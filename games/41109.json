Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 27611, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "3QGWk8zfTA4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QGWk8zfTA4", "title": "Midnight Magic (Atari 2600) - Player 1 Going For 1 Run 1984", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3QGWk8zfTA4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
