You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer.\n\nYou'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields.\n\nBut you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart.\n\nGood luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!", "summary": "Life Force is an action-packed shooter where there are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields.
