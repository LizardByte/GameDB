All of the levels from those two games are available in this collection, and all of the minigames are already unlocked and included. Formerly only available to GameCube players, the Super Monkey Ball series has made it to the PS2 and Xbox after a wait of almost 3 and a half years.\n\nThe game itself plays very much like the old arcade game Marble Madness. You control a monkey in a ball, and you have to navigate it through many perilous labyrinths to the finish. In the previous two games you had limited lives/tries, but here you have infinite lives, which makes it all the easier.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-monkey-ball-deluxe", "videos": [{"id": 1480, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "QVaX6aZfX34", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVaX6aZfX34", "title": "Super Monkey Ball Deluxe Xbox Trailer - Direct Feed Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QVaX6aZfX34/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 541, "name": "Super Monkey Ball"}]}
