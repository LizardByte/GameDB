After failing to attract a sufficiently large audience Sega shut down the game in June 2002, offering refunds to anybody with subscription time left.\n\nIt was set to be ported to the Sega Dreamcast, originally for Autumn 2000 but was delayed and then cancelled in March 2001.\n\nA community effort to relaunch the game was started soon after the servers were taken down. Conundrum Studios was formed in late 2002, and the game was relaunched under the name Project Visitor in 2003.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/10six-online", "videos": [{"id": 47608, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "IldoIUsJcf8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IldoIUsJcf8", "title": "10SIX (Project Visitor) Promotion movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IldoIUsJcf8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47609, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "SuWCRIrGwdY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuWCRIrGwdY", "title": "10SIX (\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9) - Sega Dreamcast (UNRELEASED)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SuWCRIrGwdY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
