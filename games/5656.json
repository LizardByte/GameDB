To reach and destroy your assigned target, you must maneuver through a field filled with enemy mines. Although these are hidden, the mine detection equipment in your tank warns you of their presence by producing a buzzing sound. This is your signal to change course on route to your target. If you should stumble into a mine, your tank will be \"destroyed\" and returned to its original starting position. If you get through the minefield and successfully engage the target, the built-in computer will automatically set up another challenge with a new starting position, target location, and minefield.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 81807, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "WoeKQHgAEeo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoeKQHgAEeo", "title": "Intellivision - Armor Battle \u00a9 1979 Mattel - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WoeKQHgAEeo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
