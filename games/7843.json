U.S. Forces engaged in police action and reconnaissance operations to protect RDO interests from Czervenian incursion and local Red Coin terrorist factions. U.S. Army forces moved on a secret Czervenian fortified hideout, designated \"Ranch\", discovered on the Ostregal mainland, stopping Czervenia from coordinating surface-to-air attacks against Coalition aircraft and allowing incoming humanitarian relief to reach thousands of displaced refugees. A Long Range Reconnaissance team conducted a recon mission to determine Czervenian force strength at a possible staging area on the Ostregal island of Palisav and collected vital photographic evidence about a probable and dire threat, details of which are currently classified. With the arrival of U.S. and Coalition Forces, the Czervenian Army was driven off the Ostregal mainland. They made a hasty retreat over the CZ Transocean Highway, across the Silent Harbor Bridge and over the border on Palisav Island. The bridge became a strategic lightning rod for ongoing clashes with Czervenian troops and their allies, so called Red Coin terrorists.", "summary": "America\u2019s Army: Proving Grounds is the official game of the U.S. Army and part of the highly acclaimed America\u2019s Army game series.
