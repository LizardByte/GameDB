You have an army of men and weapons at your disposal. Your mission: capture your opponent's flag and protect your own. Your troops range in rank from scout to marshal--but your opponent doesn't know the ranks of your players. Each is disguised as an innocent drummer boy marching across the battlefield while cautiously sidestepping hidden bombs. When engaged in battle, characters morph into toy soldiers, and their ranks determine who emerges victorious. This is the game for developing your strategic skills.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stratego--2"}
