The game features 3000 new questions and allows the player to select the subject of the questions, something that was not possible on the real tv show.\n\nEach question worth a prize, and as the game progress, the questions start to become more difficult. If answered correctly, the player doesn't win the amount of money immediately, but is introduced to a new question. The score is registered only the player decides to stop, receive the prize of the last question, win the question worth of 1.000.000 reais (Brazilian currency), or give the wrong answer to a question, when he receives a smaller prize (or nothing if it was the question worth of 1.000.000 reais).\n\nAt any time, the player is allowed to consult university students and virtual players, (just once, each, once in a game) who will give theirs opinions about what's the correct answer. The player may also try to peek a card, which may exclude none, one, two or all three wrong answers. Again this is possible only once each game.\n\nThere's also the possibility to exclude a question, picking another one, worth of the same prize. This action is allowed three times in each game.\n\nFeaturing the image and voice of Silvio Santos, charismatic host of the tv show, the series were a huge success, this game, the third of the series, has been released just some months after the first game of the series.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/show-do-milhao-volume-3", "collections": [{"id": 4886, "name": "Show do Milh\u00e3o"}]}
