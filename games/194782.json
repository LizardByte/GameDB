In order to survive on the Wastelands, you must struggle for dominance by battling the warring clans that rule the wastes and join forces against a sinister Artificial Intelligence that threatens to make our extinction complete. There is no mercy here - only Total Domination!\n\nTo prosper, you must build your fighting forces and secure resources from the Wasteland. Upgrade your Sector with defensive structures and buildings, and secure it by building strategic alliances with the factions around you.\n\nEven when times are harsh, you will have to research more and more Technologies to construct new Buildings, and thus, purchase more powerful Units.\n\nThere are three main types of Resources - Uranium, Titanium, and Credits. Upgrade your Resource buildings and construct the Breeder Reactor and Ore Refinery to improve Resource production. Upgrade your Warehouses to store more Resources.\n\nDiplomacy is important in getting required Resources, but you can also take Resources from other Sectors by raiding and occupying them. Your friends can also send Resources to help you. Whichever strategy you choose is entirely up to you, Commander!", "summary": "Total Domination developed by Plarium throws players into a world shambling all around you.
