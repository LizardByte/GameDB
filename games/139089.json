Wake up and save it.\n\nSkopje is a comic book styled First Person Shooter with roguelite elements and a strong brutalistic identity. You will roam the yugoslavian architecture of a city decimated by a mysterious event, scavenge materials that will help you upgrade your character and fight hordes of mutated abominations along the way. By your side is DOM - the jerry-rigged bus which will serve as your mobile base of operations. Drive it around town, use it as a shelter from enemies, and upgrade your character with the loot you find. However, the city streets of an alternate history capital hide more than just monsters to fight. Look around and you will find clues and information that you will have to piece together to uncover the truth behind what happened to your city, and how to save it. Your actions will not only determine your fate, but the fate of the city as well.\n\nGood luck, Pioneer.
