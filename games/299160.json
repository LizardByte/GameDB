One hundred years ago, vampires revealed themselves to humanity and conquered every nation on earth. Now, to keep them from wiping out the rest of us, every able-bodied person must donate a pint of blood once weekly to keep their hunger at bay. It's worked pretty well, so far.

Most people can forget what they're doing.\n\nBut what if you can't give blood at all?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hemophobia"}
