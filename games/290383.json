Hero Squadron, training hobby!\nIt is a training hobby game to become the commander of the Hero Squadron, which is the face of Sunday, and nurture a new squadron. There are 5 members of the squadron, each of which has its own personality depending on their personality, age and gender. In addition to normal physical skills, the grown-up Orrangers will master \"special moves\" that make use of their specialty areas such as Ike-face attacks that shoot moms' hearts. The growth of the nurtured Oranger can be confirmed in the battle with the enemies in the Sunday morning program and sales (children's festival). The main fans are children, junior high school students, and housewives. There are various ways to enjoy it, such as cultivating a squadron by which fan base you want to be loved, and aiming for the first place by competing with other heroes in the national popularity ranking. Let's grow your favorite squadron!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ore-no-sentai-oranger"}
