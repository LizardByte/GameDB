{"id": "_NGY7Techpc", "snippet": {"title": "Deadeus Release Trailer", "description": "Deadeus is an authentic horror Gameboy game  developed using Chris Maltby\u2019s GB Studio engine, Featuring music by Stuart Busby.\n\nThe game centers around a small boy who has a prophetic nightmare telling him everyone will die in 3 days and that he has to investigate his village to see how he can save them, if at all.\n\nThe game has 11 endings and no direct path leaving it up to the player to decide which is the best course of action.\n\nThe game comes as a ROM file, to play it you will need to download an emulator to your device. For PC users I recommend BGB Emulator and have included a config file in the folder for the best set up for the game. If you can run a GB/ GBC emulator on it you can run Deadeus on it, during development it has been played on a PC, Mac, PSVita, GB, GBC, Android and even a Nintendo Switch\n\nThe game is also playable on an original Gameboy using a flashcart or other emulation cartridge. \n\nDOWNLOAD HERE:\n\nhttps://izma.itch.io/deadeus", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_NGY7Techpc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_NGY7Techpc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_NGY7Techpc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_NGY7Techpc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_NGY7Techpc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Deadeus Release Trailer", "description": "Deadeus is an authentic horror Gameboy game  developed using Chris Maltby\u2019s GB Studio engine, Featuring music by Stuart Busby.\n\nThe game centers around a small boy who has a prophetic nightmare telling him everyone will die in 3 days and that he has to investigate his village to see how he can save them, if at all.\n\nThe game has 11 endings and no direct path leaving it up to the player to decide which is the best course of action.\n\nThe game comes as a ROM file, to play it you will need to download an emulator to your device.
