Extraction Point is the first standalone expansion pack for the video game F.E.A.R. A prominent gameplay element new to this game is reflex time, an ability which slows down the game world while still allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds. This effect is used to simulate the player character's superhuman reflexes, and is represented by stylized visual effects, such as bullets in flight that cause air distortion or interact with the game's particle system. Other new features include the ability to bash open doors by using the melee function, as well as blast them open with explosives, and the ability to smash crates, some of which contain supplies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/f-e-a-r-extraction-point", "videos": [{"id": 556, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TcNDWij0fTg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcNDWij0fTg", "title": "F.E.A.R.
