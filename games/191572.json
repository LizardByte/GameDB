On the surface, you lead a perfectly normal life as an investigative journalist in one of the biggest newspapers. Of course, if one could call \"normal life\" writing about murder, rape, and child abuse. You know this world very well. You also know how often the perpetrators are not held responsible or are given sentences inadequate to the crime. Well, it's time to take matters into your own hands and put things in order.\n\nIt is only up to you what judgment you will pass on your target. Does a thief who steals from lonely old women deserve a prison? Or is it enough to break his hands with a crowbar as a warning? Will the rapist die or do you prefer the eye for eye method? You are the gardener of this city and the fate of the weeds is in your hands!\n\nRemember that society also has an idea of justice. If you loosen the reins of your emotions and the will to kill too much, you will face negative reception, and the police will throw all their strength on the streets to get the mad avenger. Choose penalties commensurate with the blame to remain the hero in the eyes of the villagers, or fire up completely and become what you fight - the choice is yours.", "summary": "Serial Hunter, an action-adventure thriller, invites you into the twisted mind of the self-proclaimed avenger. Play as John Doe, an investigative journalist who uses information gathered at work to rid the public of the most degenerate individuals. And the cleansing methods are very diverse... As an investigative journalist, you have access to many tools that allow you to track down the incarnate evil. Use police frequency monitoring, whistleblower services and connection to municipal surveillance to establish the identity and whereabouts of your target. Only then will you plan a perfect execution.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/serial-hunter", "videos": [{"id": 64406, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "t4l_1yf8GMg"}]}
