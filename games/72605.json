The player battles as the Ultra Warriors in stories identical to TV show episodes and movies. \n \nThe game features a ranking system, in which depending on how well the player completed the stage, they will be awarded a rank, with D being the worst rank and S being the best rank. Each stage has its own health and time remaining requirement, that when completed boosts the rank. Two other special tasks must be completed to achieve an S Rank. Lots of stages include more than 2 special tasks, meaning there are multiple ways to get an S rank for each stage. Some of these tasks can achieve an S rank immediately, regardless of any other special tasks or the health and time requirements.", "summary": "Ultraman Fighting Evolution 3 (\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30de\u30f3 Fighting\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0 Evolution\u30a8\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 3\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc Urutoraman Faitingu Ebory\u016bshon Sur\u012b) also called \"Ultraman FE3\" is a Fighting game developed and published by Banpresto. it is the 3rd in the Ultraman Fighting Evolution series.
