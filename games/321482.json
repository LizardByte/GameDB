It is a remake of his earlier game Phantasm Romance, containing an overhauled game system, three game modes, and an extra stage.\n\nThe game spans six regular areas as well as three \"unseen\" areas which the player must unlock via special means. In addition to this, the game also contains a Terminus area which serves as a counterpart to the Extra stage in the main Touhou series.\n\nThe game's system revolves around a combination of factors, including a multiplier that is increased by items, bonuses caused by grazing, and a hyper system that duplicates point items and allows the player to cancel bullets into items. There is also a \"simple\" mode that works like Phantasm Romance, with the multiplier, graze and hyper system removed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gensou-rouman-kikou-phantasmagoria-trues", "videos": [{"id": 131949, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wnkZz1z-A2E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnkZz1z-A2E", "title": "Phantasmagoria Trues (Danmakufu) - Standard Unseen Stages Route 1cc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wnkZz1z-A2E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
