There are no boundaries, you can walk all the way around the globe if you want to. This does get somewhat confusing at times though. In order to move to the next globe, you have to find all the pieces of a stone disk.\n\nHowever, your enemies will also pick up the disk pieces and you have to defeat them to get them back. When you die, you are reincarnated at your \"oracle\", a stone structure which you have to defend. If your oracle is destroyed, you can no longer be resurrected. This is also true for your enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
