Start your company in the 70s. Invent until 2034, create the best hardware and operating system, upgrade your infrastructure and handle your marketing! Promote games, rule the global market and become an immortal!\n\nWhy do I show this on October 5th? Well, this is the death anniversary of the biggest computer tycoon, period! He was a great inspiration both for the game and personally to me. His work has always been an object of great adoration for me. This is the 6th anniversary of his unfortunate passing.\n\nWhat's the story?\n\nLet me share with you more about me and Computer Tycoon!\nAt the age of 9, I built my very first computer. It was an XT PC with a 286 CPU. (oh this was very very outdated those days). After playing the first strategy and simulator classics I knew that I wanted to be nothing, but a game creator. As time passed I had to go into the business sector where I had more than 10 years and went through all the levels of the regular ladder.\n\nDuring that time I created music and hobby games, and at the start of 2016, I decided to change my life and devote it to games completely. So I took one of my dream game ideas and started the development. I truly do believe what Steve said... The only way to create awesome things if you love them! This was one of the biggest motivations in my life to do what I try to do now.\n\nComputer Tycoon isn't a huge project. In fact, it's small - but still, it means a huge amount of workload that I do alone. I cannot afford much help - only with graphics because this is an area that is one of my weaknesses.\n\nPlease follow me on twitter and/or youtube! And spread the word about the game. I really need your help if I'd like to live for my passion: creating games.\n\nAnd remember how interesting is our life today - how many things can you read about, listen to, or see today in front of your screen because of people such as HE was.\n\nR.I.P. we will remember.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyKgaCoBHx0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyKgaCoBHx0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyKgaCoBHx0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyKgaCoBHx0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JyKgaCoBHx0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Computer Tycoon Official EA Trailer - In Memory of Steve Jobs", "description": "http://www.computertycoon.com\n\nComputer Tycoon is an indie business strategy game about Computer Evolution.
