Played with VisualBoyAdvance. No tools, cheats, autofire, re-recording or save states were used.\n\nNot a very good game based on the film Robocop 2. Why do I upload a game like this? Well, there are not many videos of this game on Youtube and it's not an easy game. I like to upload rare and/or difficult games.\n\nThe game was developed by Painting by Numbers and published by Ocean in 1991. Sprites are quite good, and the music is also nice (composed by Jonathan Dunn), but gameplay is simply crap. \n\nThe first game for the Game Boy was simply outstanding and the music was one of the best compositions ever made for a videogame. This sequel is pretty bad compared to the first game. The game was also released for Nes and C64. There are more RoboCop 2 games for other systems, but they are different games.\n\nAnd well, the game is not easy for children, although not especially difficult. There are some things that kill you instantly, but besides that, the game is pretty straightforward. You have to arrest a minimum number of nuke smugglers in every stage in order to complete them. If you fail, you have to repeat the level all over again, so you must remember where these guys are.\n\nGive it a try if you want.
