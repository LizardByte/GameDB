It is the last Madou Monogatari entry to feature the original cast of characters created by Compile. The game was only available to download for six months before being delisted sometime in June 2006, and as of November 30, 2021, the game can no longer be launched due to G-mode's service through i-mode being discontinued.\n\nUnlike Madou Monogatari (Saturn), Madou Monogatari returns to the classic first-person dungeon crawling style. A new spell, Stone, is introduced that attacks enemies with falling stones, and after clearing the game you'll be presented with a report card that changes depending on the amount of steps Arle takes, the amount of damage done to enemies, and the number of times that curry is eaten.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/madou-monogatari--1"}
