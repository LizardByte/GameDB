To rescue them, the lieutenant infiltrates Hellman's compound and shoots each of them with bullets coated with extract from Datura plants, which can turn freshly-created zombies back into humans.", "summary": "Corpse Killer is a full-motion video shoot-'em up. You play as an elite special forces soldier, who parachutes onto a remote tropical island. It seems the evil genius Dr. Hellman has found a way to raise the dead, and created an island of zombies. It's up to you to shoot your way through the undead hordes and stop Dr. Hellman.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective. Various zombies pop up in front of a video background, and you shoot them down by moving a cursor on screen or by using a light gun.
