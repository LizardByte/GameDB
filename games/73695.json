The game allows players to go through the story of either Himura Kenshin, Sagara Sanosuke, Saito Hajime, or Shinomori Aoshi, who is playable once the player unlocks him, although with a smaller movelist. The plot is based entirely on the Ky\u014dto Arc of the manga and anime. An American version was planned to be released by Bandai Namco games and developed by Dimps in 2007; however, it was cancelled due to scheduling conflicts and low profit prospects.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rurouni-kenshin-meiji-kenkaku-romantan-enjou-kyoto-rinne"}
