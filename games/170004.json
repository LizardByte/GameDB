The main difference between this version and the original is the lack of multiplayer, as the option has been entirely removed, with Balloon Trip now taking the place of Game B. The other difference which is shared by virtually all NES to Game Boy Advance ports was the \"squished\" resolution, as the system's screen was lower resolution than the NES' output.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/balloon-fight-e"}
