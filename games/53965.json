Nicknamed the Toymaker by the local media, the only clue to his identity is a grim calling card -- strange toys left with his victim's bodies. Just as any hope of catching the killer begins to dwindle, the lead investigator receives a package containing a disturbing video, sent by the Toymaker himself. To track down the psychopath, our heroine must scour over video frames of the crime scenes, search for clues left by the killer, and unravel the twisted plot connecting the Toymaker with each of his victims. Will she discover the killer's identity in time to stop him from taking another life, or has accepting the killer's challenge only put her in his sights?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deadly-puzzles-toymaker"}
