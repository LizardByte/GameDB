After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are suddenly attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team's members. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members of the team (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) are forced to seek refuge in a nearby abandoned mansion. It soon becomes very clear that it isn't just any mansion, but a hellish place where the undead walk the corridors and other horrors are lurking in the darkness, waiting to eat some heads.", "summary": "Resident Evil is a survival horror classic in which a group of special forces agents, known as S.T.A.R.S, struggle against hordes of zombies and various other mutants in a mysterious mansion as they try to uncover the truth behind the terrifying infection. The gameplay environment consists of polygonal 3D characters placed over pre-rendered 2D backgrounds. As such, the game relies on pre-determined camera angles for a view of the action instead of a real-time camera like most games. The game is credited for coining the phrase \"survival horror\" and popularizing the genre.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil", "videos": [{"id": 72992, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "UWo0Hhx07Pc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWo0Hhx07Pc", "title": "Resident Evil 1 Original Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UWo0Hhx07Pc/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 72993, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "sTzV88Ug7jY"}, {"id": 131392, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7m80hA5bRk0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m80hA5bRk0", "title": "Resident Evil Playstation Trailer (1996)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7m80hA5bRk0/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 131393, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8OaXfg8tMK0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OaXfg8tMK0", "title": "Resident Evil 1 (Playstation 1) Original Trailer/Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8OaXfg8tMK0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 56, "name": "Narrator"}]}
