Pirates! Gold lets you play the role of a beginning buccaneer in the 17th century Spanish Main, in search of fame and fortune. Each town in this untamed raw region has different surprises and dangers.\n\nHow you acquire stature is up to you; you can make your living through honest trade and the search for hidden treasure, or you can be a little more daring and attack and plunder ships. As you can choose a specific skill to stand out in, the game can vary each time. Sword fighting is played out in side-view action sequences.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 14970, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "3BRS331lGc0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BRS331lGc0", "title": "Pirates!
