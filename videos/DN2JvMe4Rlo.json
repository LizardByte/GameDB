On some of the levels, you encounter mostly smart bombs. More than a dozen can be in the air at a time. You will be forced to spend most of your time in evasion, unable to aim your bombs.

With the skies packed with missiles, you will find it hard to thread a safe path, even though they aren't homing in on you.\n\nThe reward of reaching the higher levels are the banks of asteroids slicing through the air in deadly clusters. Even though you collect a point for each hit on them, they very effectively block your attack against the targets down below.\n\nAt the 17th (out of 32) level of the game, the speed of the game increases twofold, making it twice as dangerous flying, and throwing off the timing you gained in the first 16 levels.
