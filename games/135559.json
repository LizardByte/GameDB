The original BadlionPvP 1.0 was created by Archybot for his HCF/OCN Team called Badlion. The server was used by around a thousand players with a peak of around 10-20 players at any one point in time. In June 2013 Archybot recruited MasterGberry to come and help program BadlionPvP 2.0. MasterGberry up until this point had been just hosting the BadlionPvP 1.0 server and had no knowledge of the Minecraft game or the APIs available. \n \nAround July 2013 the BadlionPvP 2.0 was released. Throughout the next 6 months BadlionPvP 2.0 tried to branch out into a full blown network, later renamed to Badlion Network. Badlion Network branched into Minekart, Factions, Creative, and a Hardcore SMP server during this time. In the end none of these game modes or servers lasted very long. Somewhere around the 2nd quarter of 2014 Badlion Network expanded it's game modes to UHC. The UHC game mode took a while to catch on, but now many of you know of the game mode and enjoy it on a regular basis. \n \nBadlion Network continues to work to create new Minecraft game modes for the network of services we offer here. If you have a suggestion please feel free to register an account and make a post on the forums. Badlion Network is always looking at how to better our services.", "summary": "Badlion Client is all in one modpack for Minecraft which has almost 50 built in mods, FPS improvements, a client anticheat, and more awesome features built into it.
