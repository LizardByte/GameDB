It's also tragically obscure. \n\nThe pixel art is insanely good, almost to a level of something like Metal Slug and the level design and scoring system is like something straight out of a Cave game. \nI don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this game is pretty arcade-level quality like Crimzon Clover.\n\nMechanics-wise the game is like a mix of Ketsui and Progear. \nYou have the lock-on and pointblank mechanic from Ketsui and the bullet cancelling mechanic from Progear for destroying enemies on top of bullets, among other things. \n\nThe game overall has three different modes: Hard, Very Hard and Extreme.\nHard is a 2-loop game with a TLB, Very Hard is just the 2nd loop of Hard but without suicide bullets and Extreme is its own thing like Mushihisama Ultra, also with a TLB.\n\nThe way scoring works in Hard and Very Hard is by first killing enemies with shot for stars and bullet cancelling bullets into stars. These get added to your star count and increase your star value. The closer you are to an enemy when you kill it the stars you get increase the counter ranging from 1 to 3. \nBy killing enemies with the lock-on you will cash in on the star multiplier and the star value will drop as a result, kinda like in Ketsui.\nThere is however another multiplier added on top of everything for the amount of bullets you cancel when you kill the enemy. \n\nIn short you want to use shot for stars and lock for valuable enemies when there are lots of bullets on top of it. \nThere is a high-level technique for extra stars where you kill an enemy right after you press the lock button but it's pretty tricky. You get the same result for killing an enemy with lock at pointblank range.\n\nI'm actually not completely sure which enemies in this game are the more valuable ones so I'm mostly doing educated guesses. \nIt's kinda hard to figure out the optimal strategies for a very deep Cave-like scoring system like this one on your own. \n\nI accidentally killed the first phase of the stage 1 boss way too fast. You can get a much bigger cancel later and you can also kill the top turret for another cancel. \n\nHomepage: \nhttp://naut-mark.com/\n\nBuy the game here:\nhttp://www.dlsite.com/eng/work/=/product_id/RE157191.html", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ENrO_KR7ycI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ENrO_KR7ycI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ENrO_KR7ycI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ENrO_KR7ycI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ENrO_KR7ycI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9 ~ Battle Traverse - Very Hard ALL Clear - 95 Million", "description": "Battle Traverse is a doujin game that came out earlier this year that is really good.
