Even then, the player will have to go a long way to get out.", "summary": "Dust is a Post-Apocalyptic survival simulator with an emphasis on lore and story. Dust completely overhauls nearly every aspect of the game to better represent an apocalyptic survival-horror atmosphere. Combat, weather, perks, loot, enemies, you name it. Some areas have even been visually overhauled. All vanilla NPCs have either been killed or changed beyond all recognition. You will not be able to complete quests or join factions. There is but one quest in Dust.
