The name is an anagram for \u201cfigure it out\u201d, and this concept is a key aspect of the game.\nThe game starts out as a simple block moving game, but as players progress they are introduced to new mechanics that will require new ways of thinking about the puzzles.\nFio challenges players to figure out these mechanics for themselves rather than giving them instructions.
