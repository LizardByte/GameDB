The water damaged almost the entire AI program of his.\n\nSo, they scrapped him. DAVBOT was sent to work in the prison. But during the errors of his AI, DAVBOT felt something other than pain. He felt the dreams of being free. The dreams stayed with him this whole time, and he chose that it was time to make them come true.\n\nHe started running. The security tried to stop him, but he ran and ran. Dr. Mopsky was in the prison at the time of the first escape. DAVBOT was stopped. Now he felt sadness; he didn't want to work anymore. Because of that, he was being hurt a lot by the guards. But DAVBOT remembered the dreams.\n\nAnd the dreams remembered him.
