{"id": "uCDroHotVlk", "snippet": {"title": "Flux", "description": "Flux is a game made by Masterwork Software in 1999, back then my parents brought me a CD with lots of demos including Gubble, which i loved too. I remember i could spend hours playing flux because it was really fun, and it looked pretty awesome, i still think it does, and man, the music. The funniest thing is that FluxLE (The demo version) only had 3 tracks, but they were all pretty cool. I uploaded this video because i'm sure i'm not the only one who played this gem of a pc game, and i wanna make sure no one forgets about it. You can download the demo version at www.planetflux.com\n\nNote: I didn't use FRAPS because this game is too old, that should explain the FPS drops and stuff.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nUPDATE: Here's a download url for the Full version and it should work on Win7.\n\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/q9uia3qnlhqc4l4/AAADHODbPp4cNRHjYjbhP8Ada/Flux.exe?dl=0\ufeff\n\nCredits to Mateus Couto", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uCDroHotVlk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uCDroHotVlk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uCDroHotVlk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Flux", "description": "Flux is a game made by Masterwork Software in 1999, back then my parents brought me a CD with lots of demos including Gubble, which i loved too.
