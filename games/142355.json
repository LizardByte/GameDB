It started off on the Unreal Engine, but now it's being developed on Source 2.\nIt's not going to be Garry's Mod 2. My hope is that it will eclipse what is possible in Garry's Mod rather than simply be a modern version of it.\nThe current status is \"heavy development\". The aim is to give some people access in the first half of 2021, and give everyone else access in the second half of 2021.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/s-and-box"}
