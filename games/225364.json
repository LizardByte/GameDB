In it, the game basically follows the rule of the original gameplay - you play as Madotsuki to search for the effects in her dream world, except now she will have guns as her weapons, and some of the NPCs in the dream world are now dangerous enemies. Madotsuki can now receive health damage in the dream world and be forced to wake up if she's defeated. Players earn money and 3 kinds of medals: Gold, Silver and Copper, by killing the enemies in a single map or triggering the events.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yume-nikki-hazard"}
