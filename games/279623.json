Players progress through a series of trials set in procedurally generated levels, where they must choose a relic, shield, and rage ability for each trial run. After completing a challenge within a trial, players can opt for upgrading their weapon, relic, or stats, but these enhancements only apply to that specific trial run. Each run and the completion of specific gameplay challenges unlock permanent rewards. If a player dies, they restart the trial from the beginning. The downloadable content (DLC) also introduces new enemies, including new and familiar ones from the Greek era games like cyclopes and minotaurs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla", "videos": [{"id": 103076, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "C44_HrseDSs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C44_HrseDSs", "title": "God of War Ragnar\u00f6k: Valhalla - Reveal Trailer | PS5 & PS4 Games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C44_HrseDSs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
