This was our first jam try and despite many imperfections and compromises we had to make due to time limits we liked the result very much. So we thought it could be fun to spend a little bit more time to build a more presentable prototype. And finally we are happy to present it to you.\nIn our minds we have big plans for this game: revised gameplay, improved graphics, comprehensive story filled with drama and stupid whale puns, and many more. \nBut for that we need your support and feedback. And probably a good publisher. \nHope, you will enjoy our game!
