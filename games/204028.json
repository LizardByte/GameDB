Fight your way through puzzles and obstacles to uncover the story that surrounds this broken, run down society, where only children are still free. But for how long?\n\nA pure hand-drawn pixel art adventure that will keep you on your toes from the very beginning, with a few jump scares and a thrilling atmosphere but still suitable for all ages as it does not feature any gore or violence.\n\nFull Void is a spiritual successor to classic cinematic puzzle platformers such as Prince of Persia, Another World (Out of This World) and Flashback, with a modern twist, innovative visual and gameplay mechanics. Along with traditional puzzles, you can use your hacking skills to interact with elements of the game and make your way through this hostile world full of creatures continuously on the verge to get you. In a 2D world, aspects of 3D have been integrated both in the gameplay and visuals.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/full-void", "videos": [{"id": 95096, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "cE8Cdqpn3nI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE8Cdqpn3nI", "title": "Full Void Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cE8Cdqpn3nI/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 95098, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "JWG0Jg3Aiw4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWG0Jg3Aiw4", "title": "Full Void Official Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JWG0Jg3Aiw4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 95099, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "W2Crvc5XR6A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Crvc5XR6A", "title": "Full Void Official trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W2Crvc5XR6A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 96845, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "X3Yi6QDstoI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Yi6QDstoI", "title": "Full Void - Official Console Release Window and Accolade Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3Yi6QDstoI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
