How unfortunate.\"\nWith that, the clock on the Mushroom Kingdom's hero's game comes to an end. A young star kid spares a few more moments off of his own life to bring Mario back from the dead. There is someone out there that wants to pull the strings of the fates of all things -- the same person who brought about the end of Mario's life. In a race against the clock, will Mario be able to protect the fates of all things?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-ticks-of-time"}
