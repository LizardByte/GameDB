The game has a hub world that lets you explore and find levels freely, but the stages themselves are linear, like a traditional Mario game. Think Peach's Castle from 64 with about 20ish linear stages instead of open world stages. Yoshi Coins act as the main collectable. The more you collect, the more levels and areas of the hub world you will be able to access.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-starlight", "videos": [{"id": 100401, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8uvuQc4FTKk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uvuQc4FTKk", "title": "Super Mario Starlight | Release Trailer (SMW ROM Hack)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8uvuQc4FTKk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
