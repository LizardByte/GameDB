By pressing any direction in the joystick, the player launches a boulder toward the opponent. The longer the stick is held, the farther the boulder goes.\r\n\r\nBesides hitting the castles, boulders can also hit the enemy catapult or the soldier operating it. In any of these cases, the catapult and soldier will go offscreen to receive the necessary repairs or first aid.\r\n\r\nMiscalculated shots can also hit the player's own castle, giving points to the opponent. The winner is the one with more points at the end of ten battles.\r\n\r\nPlayers score three points for each hit on a castle, seven points for hitting an enemy soldier and ten points for hitting an enemy catapult. At the end of each battle, the points scored by the winner are multiplied by the number of the battle (one to ten). The loser gets no points.\r\n\r\nThere are three variations to this game, according to the catapult tension. The higher the number of the variation, the faster the catapult shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I think:\r\n\r\nThis is a REALLY fun game ... too bad it lacks singleplayer. :*(", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZxl9OC24Ic/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZxl9OC24Ic/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZxl9OC24Ic/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZxl9OC24Ic/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZxl9OC24Ic/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Smithereens! for the Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 / Philips Videopac", "description": "Alternate titles:\r\n\r\n\"Tiro de catapulta\" -- Spanish Title\r\n\"Tiro con la catapulta\" -- Italian Title\r\n\"Stone Sling\" -- UK Title\r\n\"Stenslyngekamp\" -- Danish Title\r\n\"Stenslunga\" -- Swedish Title\r\n\"Katapult\" -- Dutch Title\r\n\"Catapulte\" -- French Title\r\n\"Burgenschlacht\" -- German Title\r\n\"Batalha Medieval!\" -- Brazilian Title\r\n\r\n\r\nCame also out for:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nGame description:\r\n\r\nThis game takes place in a time when knights were bold and castle crumbling was one of the most popular sports.\r\n\r\nIn this Artillery clone, two players must try to destroy each other's castle with their catapults.
