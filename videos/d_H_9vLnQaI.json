(Wii) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Nintendo's 2009 boxing game for the Nintendo Wii, Doc Louis's Punch-Out!!\n\nThe video shows playing through and winning each of the three available modes.\n\nDoc Louis's Punch-Out!! is a really cool novelty game. It was a free game offered exclusively to Club Nintendo platinum members through the WiiWare service until 2015, where it was sold for a short time before the plug was pulled on Club Nintendo.\n\nIt features Mac and his trainer Doc Louis training at the gym. There are no other fighters available, but it uses the same engine and assets from the full retail Punch-Out!! Wii game, which is a pretty good assurance of quality. The three modes boost the difficulty level as you work your way up - just wait and see what Doc does if you deprive him of his chocolate bar! It might scar you, so be warned. \n\nIt's a really cool teaser/demo that goes well above what you'd expect for a demo since Doc Louis isn't in the full game as a fighter, and it's Punch Out. Does it need anything else to be great?\n____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_H_9vLnQaI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_H_9vLnQaI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_H_9vLnQaI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_H_9vLnQaI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_H_9vLnQaI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Doc Louis's Punch-Out!!
