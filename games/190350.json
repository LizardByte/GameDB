They grew up together, went to school together, and ardently believed that they would always be best friends.\n\nThat was before Haruka\u2019s breakdown, however.\n\nWorn down by her demanding job as a nurse, Haruka abandons her old life, and her old best friend, and moves back in with her parents. Believing herself to be a failure, and too ashamed to see Shiina again, Haruka retreats into herself and her depression, and despairs.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until almost five years later that Haruka and Shiina reunite. At Shiina\u2019s behest, the pair of them make an impromptu trip to a favourite haunt of theirs from their youth: an outdated theme park on the outskirts of Nara called Dreamy Planet.\n\nDreamy Planet was once a popular park, but it has since fallen into disrepair. The park was closed down several years ago, owing to dwindling attendance numbers, and it has been left in a miserable state: the spinning teacups, the roller coasters, and the carousel all left to rust.\n\nTogether again, Haruka and Shiina pick their way through Dreamy Planet\u2019s carcass, and as they do, they recall fond memories from their past. Dreamy Planet might be beyond salvaging, but perhaps their relationship can still be saved \u2013 if only Haruka can find the courage to finally tell Shiina how she really feels.", "summary": "A gloomy yuri VN set in an abandoned theme park, focused on a ruinous relationship between a pair of estranged childhood friends.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dreamy-planet", "videos": [{"id": 100068, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8gwBPFBnStM"}]}
