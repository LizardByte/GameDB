Be careful as you jump on platforms as going to close to the edge can cause you to lose balance and fall. On the screen, your health is shown by a heart. If you get hit by an enemy, fall down a pit, or fall from too high, it will decrease by one. If it reaches zero, you lose one of three lives. Some special attacks can be used, if possessed, like apple bombs. Eventually a sign \"Find The Exit\" will appear and you can exit to the next level. If you make it to the end, you must fight Maliss in dragon form. You can change the difficulty level or choose a continuous play option as well."}
