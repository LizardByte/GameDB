Atomfall is inspired by the real-life events of the 1957 Windscale disaster and the story picks up five years later in a fictionalised quarantine zone that encompasses rolling countryside, valleys, caves and even a picturesque English village. \n\nBut this picture-perfect postcard setting is a hostile landscape that hides a dark mystery. To get to the bottom of what happened at Windscale, you will need to navigate military encampments, delve through abandoned bunkers below ground, and risk your life in Pagan ruins. Your trusty metal detector will also help you uncover a few secrets buried beneath the surface! \n\nCentral to the dark mystery are the host of eccentric characters and cryptic organisations that inhabit the quarantine zone. These individuals have been cut off from the outside world for years and left to their own devices, so are anything but normal. Your interactions with them are important and will shape your journey. But be careful, they aren\u2019t all friendly and you will need to get to grips with an array of ranged and melee weapons if you are to survive!\n----\nPrepare for the launch of Atomfall with the Limited Edition \"Survival Pack\" which includes bonus in-game content and exclusive collectible items!\nPlease note the Atomfall pack does not include the Atomfall game.\n\nPre-order the Survival Pack NOW - Unavailable\n\n\nFollow us on: \nTwitter/X: https://x.com/AtomfallGame\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AtomfallGame/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/atomfallgame/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@rebelliondevelopments\n\nJoin the conversation: \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/rebellion_official\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/rebellion \nFind out more about Rebellion at https://rebellion.com/ \nFind out more about Atomfall at https://atomfall.com\n\n#Atomfall #Rebellion GameDev #XboxGamePass #Xbox #PlayStation #PC #Gaming #VideoGames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcGbyD8OnW8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcGbyD8OnW8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcGbyD8OnW8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcGbyD8OnW8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcGbyD8OnW8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Atomfall - Gamescom Trailer  | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 & PS4", "description": "Add Atomfall to your WISHLIST NOW - http://reb.to/AtomfallGCYT\n\nDelve deeper into the foreboding world of Atomfall and the mystery of Windscale with a look at its new trailer, hot off the heels of Gamescom.\n\nOpening in the style of a classic 1950s news reel, this latest trailer offers a closer look at Atomfall\u2019s setting in the North of England.
