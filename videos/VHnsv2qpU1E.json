{"id": "VHnsv2qpU1E", "snippet": {"title": "[Steam] Gunbird - 2-ALL Clear 1,378,100 (Marion)", "description": "Gunbird came out in the arcades in 1994 and was one of the first games developed by Psikyo. \nThe most recent port of the game was made by Zerodiv and CITY CONNECTION and was ported to Switch and Steam.\n\nVery weird port. Lots of subtle and not-so-subtle differences and some jank that wasn't there in the original arcade version. \nPort is also easier. The bullets in the 2nd loop are visibly slower.\n\nThe good things it has:\n- Leaderboards\n- Tate\n- A background and some very basic widgets.\n- Voice acting for the cutscenes.\n- An arranged soundtrack (no option to use the arcade soundtrack though).\n- You can turn off bilinear filtering and there is a basic scanline filter.\n- An autofire shot button (no autofire for bomb though).\n\nThe bad things:\n- Not arcade accurate. The 2nd loop especially is easier than it should be. \n- Some things that work in the arcade version simply do not here. \n- No practice mode of -any kind-.\n- No replays of any kind.\n- I don't know what they did with the intro cinematic, but it looks horrendous. There is a horrible filter on it and it runs at like 10 fps.\n- The stage clear jingle bleeds into the next stage if you skip the cutscenes. The entire voiced dialogue also bleeds into the next stage sometimes.\n- It has more input lag than Shmupmame but not enough to really be an issue. \n\nDifferences I've noticed:\n- Like said before, the bullets in the 2nd loop are visibly slower, which makes the game a lot easier to clear. \n- In the original arcade version, the 2nd loop had a cool nighttime palette swap, which is completely absent here for some bizarre reason and feels really wrong.\n- The stage 7 stage music gets replaced by the standard boss music at the midboss for some reason. \n- The stage 7 boss coffin safespot doesn't work for some reason.\n- The stage 6 big pillars have an attack where they aim bullets around you. But for some reason in this port the aiming breaks after the 3rd wave and you get hit in the safespot anyway. Really annoying. \n- For the part right after you can normally just stream in the arcade version of 1-6 but that doesn't seem to work here...\n- For the 1-6 dragon boss in arcade, the bullet speed and Marion's movement speed are perfect in the sense where you can dodge the attack by just holding a direction. This doesn't seem to work here. Implying that the bullet speed might also be slower in the 1st loop. \n- In 2-4 you usually use the \"Insert Coin\" part of the HUD to position yourself for a safespot but that part is absent here. Makes it kinda annoying. \n- The first phase of the mine boss is supposed to go lower on the screen. \n- The first water turrets in 1-4 and 2-4 fire bullets before they're even on screen in this. \n\nLucky run without the 2nd loop train stage. it's insane how much easier this game is to clear without it. \n\nI did a fully annotated 2-ALL of the original arcade version about a year ago, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1S15AETFl8\nFeel free to compare for yourself. \n\nBuy the game on Steam here:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1261970/GUNBIRD/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VHnsv2qpU1E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VHnsv2qpU1E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VHnsv2qpU1E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VHnsv2qpU1E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VHnsv2qpU1E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Steam] Gunbird - 2-ALL Clear 1,378,100 (Marion)", "description": "Gunbird came out in the arcades in 1994 and was one of the first games developed by Psikyo. \nThe most recent port of the game was made by Zerodiv and CITY CONNECTION and was ported to Switch and Steam.\n\nVery weird port.
