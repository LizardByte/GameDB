This video is for the main level puzzles. Only view the ones you're truly stuck on. No cheating!\n\nThis game originally released in 2017, and I only got around to making the walkthrough in 2020! This is partly due to the fact that I was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2018, had surgery to debulk it, and have spent the last two years learning to walk, talk and program again.\n\nApologies, the game sounds don't seem to have been captured. I only noticed when I came to edit the videos, and don't really want to go back and record it all again!\n\nInchoate (0:00)\nTrepidation (0:50)\nInproficient (1:33)\nTolerance (2:16)\nConfidence (4:05)\nAttenuation (4:36)\nObservance (5:07)\nIntrospection (7:22)\nAbsence (8:34)\nBelief (9:01)\nAttention (9:35)\nSuppression (9:58)\nHeartbeat (10:24)\nDevastation (13:21)\nContempt (14:40)\nDisdain (15:41)\nAbsinthe (16:55)\nDisillusion (18:09)\nDesolation (18:30)\nIndignation (19:17)\nPrecipitancy (21:12)\nSacrament (22:05)\nFortress (22:49)\nDefiance (23:46)\nSeparation (24:37)\nPatience (25:13)\nIncarceration (25:50)\nVoid (26:16)\nSyncopation (28:37)\nWe Are All Unique (30:49)\nWe All Need Peace (35:22)\nWe Are Free To Roam (37:52)\nDelirium (39:45)\nDisbelief (40:31)\nDissonance (41:01)\nSubdivision (43:49)\nHeartbroke (44:55)\nWe Are All The Same (46:08)\nNexus (47:17)\nTear It Down (52:53)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XWE4MtTEC4Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XWE4MtTEC4Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XWE4MtTEC4Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XWE4MtTEC4Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Bending the Light Walkthrough - 1 - Main Levels", "description": "Walkthrough for the VR game Bending the Light, by the creator of the game Chris Underwood.
