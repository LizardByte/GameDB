One of the best games I bought back then and it still stands up and plays well today. Great music and overall well presented. A bit easier than other conversions but it can still throw some tricky situations at you requiring some trick jumping to glitch the collision detection. Unfortunately while most of the arcade game mechanics are intact, the ending is not leaving only the bad ending when completed in one player.

I then show a second run using the Super Mode cheat which puts some of the tougher enemies right at the start of the game throwing projectile's. I had to reset the game to input the cheat mode which also reset the scores. In the second run I do make use of umbrella warps as well as showing all secret doors by not losing any lives.
