Or if you don't feel like performing story errands, just treat it like a digital museum instead.\n\nThis game features 17 unique areas to explore, with lots of weird things to see and people to meet everywhere you go.\n\nUnlike the typical Yume Nikki fangame, there aren't any \"effects\" to find here, instead all of the focus is placed on touring a fully open realm where every path leads to somewhere else.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/conexus--1"}
