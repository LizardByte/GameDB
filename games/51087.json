Battles are played across multiple rounds, with points scored for each round based on the quality of the hand. Each player uses a Wii Remote controller to point and click on a standard deck of cards laid across the screen. The first click flips the card over, at which point it can be grabbed by anyone else. You've got to have fast fingers and eyes if you're to grab the cards you need before someone else snatches them from you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-poker"}
