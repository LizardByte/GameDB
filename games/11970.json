She has a soul of steel and a heart that beats to an electronic rhythm- real cool, not a breath of life in her whole being. And if you stare too long, you'll see nothing but your own reflection in those chrome bodies.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blue-angel-69"}
