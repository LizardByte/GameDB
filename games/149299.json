In \"Nature Matters\" you take on a role of a little plant spirit. Without protection, surrounded by a city that grows up from everywhere, one day she realizes that she is completely alone and won't be able to survive. The only solution is to find her caretaker - a little boy who has been caught up in a whirlwind of human weakness and convince him to take care of her again. During your journey, you will see different lands devastated by the destructive human influence. Solving the puzzles, with the sounds of relaxing music, you will have the opportunity to restore vegetation and colors in them. The unique graphic design will allow you to immerse yourself in a world that will remain in your memory for a long time. The \"Nature Matters\" project is a small contribution that the studio \"Digital Melody\" wants to make towards arousing social awareness of the threats that result from human neglect of the natural environment. As the creators say, if at least one person becomes more attentive to nature by experiencing this game, it will be a great joy for us. Game features: - logic puzzles - atmospheric music - elegant graphics - stirring story", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nature-matters", "videos": [{"id": 52581, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZwohwppbgXE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwohwppbgXE", "title": "Nature Matters | Trailer (Nintendo Switch)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZwohwppbgXE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
