Avoid hitting Coily and Q*Bertha. Jump on the platforms to be carried to the top of the pyramid and maybe make an enemy jump to its doom.\n\nBelieving that the original game was too easy, Davis initiated development of Faster Harder More Challenging Q*bert (also known as FHMC Q*bert) in 1983, which increased the difficulty, introduced Q*bertha and added a bonus round. However, the project was canceled and the game never entered production. Despite this, Davis later released FHMC Q*bert's ROM image onto the web.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/faster-harder-more-challenging-q-star-bert"}
