And it's tougher still when nobody gives you the respect you deserve. Harvey and Frank have been pounding the proverbial pavement for years, doing big-time work for small-time pay, only to get credit snatched away by the (sometimes literal) Vultures at the Scarlet City Police Department.\n\nBut all of that changed when the case of a lifetime fell right into their laps... along with a couple of trigger-happy, gun-toting thugs. But a little bullet-themed office redecoration courtesy of those two-bit toughs wasn't about to scare Harvey Barker and Frank Mustard off the biggest case (and biggest paycheque) they've ever had...\n\nSo grab a good snack, your beverage of choice, and head on down to the Clydesdale Hotel... because it's time to crack this case wide open!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-barker-and-mustard-files", "videos": [{"id": 77778, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "PrIbM29sanU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrIbM29sanU", "title": "The Barker & Mustard Files - Trailer 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PrIbM29sanU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
