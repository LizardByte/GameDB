Several scientists from a previous expedition went missing on Midgaard, a planet inhabited by beings remarkably reminiscent of the people of our Early Middle Ages. The planet is surrounded by a radiation field that distorts and damages all forms of advanced technology.\n\nThe part of the world where the game's action takes place shows strong resemblance to Earth's Scandinavia.\u200b The planet hides many secrets and its mysterious forces change everything within its reach: creatures, objects, and even people. It significantly influences the world that Vuko travels and interacts with, as well as shapes key gameplay features such as combat and character interactions. Learning the planet's mysteries is bound to unravel what happened to the scientists you seek.\n\nDuring his journey, Vuko is accompanied by Cyphral - a biological AI connected to the hero's nervous system, whose task is to support him in his dangerous mission and greatly increase his strength, reflexes, and endurance. Cyphral's presence will help the player when facing the unknown. Vuko will have to traverse otherworldly lands inhabited by tribes and beasts and uncover what is really happening on this strange, alien world.", "summary": "\"The Night Wanderer\" is a hybrid of RPG and soulslike genres, characterized by unique solutions and an innovative approach to tried-and-true mechanics.
