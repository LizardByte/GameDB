Refusing to share their technique with the rest of the world, Igem eventually developed a weather control machine named ONI, which they intend to use for the purpose of global domination. A squadron of ace helicopter pilots, called Zero Gunner, is assembled to destroy ONI - but Igem fights back with everything they've got...\n\nZero Gunner 2 is a top-down shooter. All backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D, though the gameplay mostly follows the conventions of 2D shooters. Since your craft is a helicopter, a \"target and spin\" feature has been added, whereby you can both rotate your craft to attack an enemy more efficiently, or alternatively lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. These actions are not automatically executed, and are controlled by the player; in order to succeed, mastering this feature is imperative.\n\nThe usual power-ups and boss enemy battles are included in the game, along with a selection of helicopters to choose from.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zero-gunner-2", "videos": [{"id": 87917, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dMCDbMZW8lU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMCDbMZW8lU", "title": "Zero Gunner 2 (2001) SUPERPLAY by KTR / 1CC NO MISS BOTH LOOPS (60 FPS) SEGA Dreamcast / iPlaySEGA", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dMCDbMZW8lU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
