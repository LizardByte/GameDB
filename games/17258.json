The game was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. The player's objective is simple: solve basic arithmetic problems. Game variations determine whether the player solves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems, and whether he/she could select the top number (the console randomly selects the lower number). The player uses the joystick to enter a guess, with sound effects signaling whether it is right or wrong.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/basic-math", "videos": [{"id": 15445, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "va5C4PSgvrQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va5C4PSgvrQ", "title": "Classic Game Room - BASIC MATH review for Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/va5C4PSgvrQ/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3564, "name": "123 Animal Math"}]}
