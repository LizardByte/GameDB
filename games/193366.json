Like the Game Boy Advance version, this iteration is a two-dimensional sidescrolling platformer; however, it is very different from traditional Rayman games in that its gameplay is an almost direct copy of that of the early Sonic the Hedgehog titles. Rayman traverses levels at extreme speeds, often rolling into a ball to do so. Familiar gameplay elements such as cages, Purple Lums and Teensies reappear, but beyond that, the game bears little in common with the others of the series.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-raving-rabbids--4"}
