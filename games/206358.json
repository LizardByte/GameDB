Earth has been abandoned after hundreds of years of destructive climate change and catastrophic neglect of the environment by corporations and industry. Political and social unrest has left the old cities decimated and hostile to life. Civilization has collapsed and destroyed itself, yet a cyborg police force still wields control over the wastelands.\n\nOnly privileged first-class citizens were permitted onto the new world. The unworthy who were left behind \u2013 criminals, rebels, political dissidents, and the poor \u2013 scavenge in the forgotten cities of Earth, which have become overgrown with jungle, flooded by swamps, swallowed by sand and frozen by ice.\n\nPollution and technological debris litter the environment, and survivors have set up shelter in destroyed skyscrapers, laboratories, abandoned metros and crumbling freeways.\n\nThe world is inhabited by criminals, pirates, bounty hunters, drug lords, slavers, cannibals, victims of genetic experiments and malfunctioning robots, all competing for resources and territory. The cops enforce a totalitarian authority even after society is in ruin, forcing humans to live in the wastelands.", "summary": "Decimated is a 3rd person multiplayer online survival RPG.
