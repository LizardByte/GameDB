Needless to say his inventions, including this one, are not safe in the hands of Score-chan. Can you help her and Gig undo the great chaos created by her inevitable mishandling of Piczle Paint 3000? Also there is Dbug the cat who is naturally more concerned with cat matters.", "summary": "Piczle Colors isn't your typical grid-based color logic-puzzle! Like other puzzles of this type, hints next to each row and above each column tell you how many blocks of each color go in each row or column. By following these hints you can paint each part of the grid and reveal an image. However, these hints do NOT tell you the order they come in! \n \nSmaller puzzles ease you into this new way of thinking. You can work your way through 6 levels with 50 puzzles each, ranging in size from 5x5 to 15x10. Each puzzle lets you start with a randomly cleared row and column if you need a helping hand, but clearing puzzles without using hints earns you coins, which you can use to unlock Piczle Colors' many cool extra features!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 24469, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "enxa7xoZ1Bs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enxa7xoZ1Bs", "title": "Piczle Colors for Nintendo Switch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/enxa7xoZ1Bs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
