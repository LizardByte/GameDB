Larry, liking the idea, and having nothing better to do, agrees to help the voice collect the five sacred keys to free the Starborn Quintuplets so he can collect all 79 Power Comets and enact Comet-Side. Along the way, Larry goes through all kinds of crazy and unique situations he wouldn't go through on any normal day across five different roms. The other Koopalings also all have a part in the story starring as the main characters in their own side story roms that connect to the main story of LarryDS. How will this story unfold?
