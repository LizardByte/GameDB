The mysterious villain then forces Peach and Bowser to get married, creating a rift of dark energy that threatens to tear the universe apart. Only Mario can save the day, but he can't do it alone.", "summary": "Super Paper Mario is a platformer role-playing game released for the Wii. Unlike other Paper Mario games, Super Paper Mario is a platformer and does not use a turn-based battle system, but rather incorporates RPG elements with platforming. The game fuses elements of 2D and 3D gameplay together, shifting back and forth between dimensions. In addition to the regular Paper Mario aesthetics, the game also uses many novel character, enemy, and background designs, including a fully pixelated world and the use of sprites from the classic Super Mario Bros. for certain techniques.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 1286, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZiZ3uxff5LY"}, {"id": 35953, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gJZiClBAKo0"}]}
