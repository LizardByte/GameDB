However, with incredible power at your disposal and a team of evil-minded impish critters, the Minions, on hand to do your bidding, how will you resist the temptation to be wonderfully despotic?\n\nDelve deeper into the Overlord's twisted world as Overlord: Raising Hell opens up a series of hellish new levels, each a twisted, corrupted version of the five major kingdoms: Mellow Hills, Evernight, Heaven's Peak, the Golden Halls, and the Ruborian Desert. Access to each abyss is via a portal, which opens once a kingdom has been successfully conquered and the previous ruler banished to a personal hell within. However it's not just the fallen heroes that have been dragged into the abyss: the Overlord's newly loyal peasants have also been taken down into hell too.
