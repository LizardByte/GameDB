To make your wage you will be tasked with digging up graves on the premises and looting them of their valuables. While doing your job, the reverend let's you know about an old graveyard that is just beyond the walls behind your church and that there are rumors of valuables there. You agree to go investigate the old graveyard and upon arriving you see that it has already been looted long ago. Inside the mausoleum you notice the tomb open but all that is inside is the skeletal torso of blackened bones. Not thinking much of it, you leave.\n\nAfter investigating the old graveyard, things do not seem right. You start hearing strange sounds and voices that you can not explain. Paranormal activity begins picking up each day that you are doing your job and you need to do something about it. You can purchase items with your wage to help wade off the spirits, but it is not enough. While continuing to do your job, you start noticing extra bones inside the caskets. Blackened bones. The same looking bones you found in the mausoleum. \n\nMaybe finding all the blackened bones and putting them back to the mausoleum will stop the activity?
