So he sets off on his journey but finds many challenges ahead. The emissaries of the Lord of Shadows lurk every step of the way, looking for a way to lead him astray or make him give up.\n\nArmed with the Word of God and the shield of faith, embark on this incredible adventure towards the City of Eternal Freedom. Face the arguments of religionists, mystics, unbelievers, and pluralists, who will do anything to deceive you and try to convince you to abandon the journey. Also be prepared for strong opposition from demons, monsters, thieves, and the Devil himself.\n\n\"Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.\"\n(Mark 13:13)\n\nOn foot, on horseback, or by boat, across seas, forests, deserts, and plains.
