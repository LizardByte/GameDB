This is a virtual reality experience where you become the iconic hedgehog, traversing original Zones, defeating enemies, collecting rings and, of course, using the terrain to your advantage to achieve high speeds.\n\nThis project's goal is to push the boundaries of what sorts of experiences are capable in virtual reality, showcasing the potential of the medium as it pertains to high-speed action games.\n\nIn my research, I have discovered that it is not necessarily motion itself that gives players motion sickness, but a lack of expectation of how that motion is going to behave. For example: a roller coaster VR experience is completely out of the player's control. They have no say in what they do and when things happen to them. Similarly, if a VR motion system moves a player in a way that they don't expect, that can also disorient them. \nAs such, so long as the player feels in control of themselves at all times, motion sickness should cease to be a hindrance to the player.\n\nThis experience will be compatible with all SteamVR-compatible headsets:\n~HTC Vive\n~Vive Cosmos\n~Valve Index\n~Oculus Rift\n~Oculus Rift S\n~Oculus Quest (Through Oculus Link only)\n~Windows Mixed Reality\n~Pico Neo 2 (Through Streaming Assistant only)\n\nPAS (Probably Asked Questions):\n-Will you port this to non-VR?\nNo. This was built from the ground, up with Virtual Reality in mind. Porting back down to a traditional perspective would result in an unsatisfactory experience.\n\n-Will you port this to standalone Oculus Quest through SideQuest?\nNo. This was built using the SteamVR framework in order to reach the widest audience possible. Porting to Quest would require a complete overhaul.\n\n-What's that black thing at the bottom right?\nThat's your (Sonic's) nose! (You can turn it off in the options. Don't worry.)\n\n-Will you port Green Hill Paradise to VR?\nNo, for the same reasons stated above.\n\n-Will this be made open-source like The Bumper Engine?\nUnfortunately, no. I don't anticipate much demand for that.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/64no-PBVL3A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/64no-PBVL3A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/64no-PBVL3A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/64no-PBVL3A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/64no-PBVL3A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Virtua Sonic Teaser Trailer - SAGE 2020", "description": "UPDATE:\nVirtua Sonic is now LIVE!!\nhttps://www.sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/virtua-sonic.685/\n\nComing to SAGE 2020 is Virtua Sonic!
