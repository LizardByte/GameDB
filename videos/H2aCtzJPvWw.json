I actually enjoyed this version, it feels better balanced on the speed, its not so rough when the other cars crash into you, and the switching of the various tracks automatically while you're playing is a nice tough of randomness.  I was able to get to the extended play mark without too much fumbling around this time, which is a major improvement.  Good stuff, and solid sprint series of games from Atari.
