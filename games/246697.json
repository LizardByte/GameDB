Our nameless protagonist has dedicated himself to a collection of retro Japanese computer games, with a particular fondness for early visual novels. Although decaying in a slovenly existence to the untrained eye, his retreat into digital life is enriched by the scripted interactions with various charming 2D girls. His one purpose in life is to chronicle his thoughts and reflections on each of the digital worlds he immerses himself in. However, one day while pulling out the box of another visual novel to review, a girl leaps straight out of the cover art and begins interacting with him face to face. And perhaps most shocking of all to him, in a completely unscripted manner.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/digital-seclusion"}
