I thought it seemed fitting, given the name and it's a trans key so that's like a lot of keys! Huh, did I say something similar before? Anyways, you should know most of these keymodes shown here if you've seen my previous videos! \n\nThis is the Chapter 3 version of the chart seen on my previous video! This one doesn't have any parts where it mixes keymodes (two-colour borders) like in Chapter 2 though, but instead, it shows even bigger keymodes! Imagine if even with these bigger keymodes, the charter still intends to try to put a part where it mixes keymodes though! That's gonna be really difficult, I think! Despite that, though, this chart is still difficult without that gimmick! I always mess up big time on the 12k part for some reason! \n\nOh right, all the charts for the recent festival have been uploaded, so it seems! You may want to have another look at it! However, apparently, that doesn't necessarily mean it is the end of the event? It looks like there will be something else on the 8th and 9th January this year? Something called a speed twister, from what I get with my translator? I guess we'll have to see by then!\nHere's the link to the festival again! There's a lot of new keymodes here as well!\nhttps://vorhandensein.sakura.ne.jp/event/nfes21_returns/index.html\n\nAnyways, I hope you decide to try out danoni for yourself! ....or else\n\n#danoni\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~\n\nSong: \u6e05\u6c34 \u5dba - Journey\nMaker: goe\nChart Link: http://www.omission0.com/danoni/200-journey/?scoreId=2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xj8OY3UevdQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xj8OY3UevdQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xj8OY3UevdQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xj8OY3UevdQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xj8OY3UevdQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Trans Key Danoni] Beginning of a New Year (\u6e05\u6c34 \u5dba - Journey (Chapter 3))", "description": "Starting the year off with this chart!
