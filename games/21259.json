Set on hilly terrain, similar to artillery games likeScorched Earth, the gameplay is real time instead of turn-based. It supports two to seven players, represented by differently-colored tanks, with a range of weapons. The terrain on which this occurs, an ever-decreasing yellow landscape, is completely obliterated by the players during gameplay or otherwise gradually whittles down to a flat plain.\n\nThe original Death Tank was a bonus game in the Sega Saturn version of PowerSlave (1996). A sequel/update, Death Tank Zwei, was hidden in the Saturn version of Duke Nukem 3D (1997).", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/death-tank"}
