Now the Red Hood, aptly named for the tactical visor and jacket hood he wears, Jason cleans the streets of criminal scum with extreme prejudice. Unlike the rest of the Bat Family, Jason kills his enemies and doesn't spare them. For over a month's time, he continued his crusade. Among the nameless thugs he killed, Red Hood added the super criminal Killer Moth to the body count. Red Hood enters through a glass roof to stop an arms deal between Black Mask's and Penguin's gangs. After neutralizing everybody, he interrogates the only man he didn't kill. With a gun to his face, the thug tells Red Hood about a weapon shipment stored at a dock near near Gotham City. With the thug's usefulness expended, Red Hood kills him and heads off.\n\nAt the Docks, Red Hood again takes out everybody, this time in silently, due to the amount of guns carried by henchmen. With only one man left, Red Hood takes him for interrogation to find out where Black Mask is hiding out. Having been beaten and interrogated by Batman and his allies for years, the thug adamantly tells Red Hood that he won't kill him. Annoyed, Red Hood puts a gun under the thug's chin, asking if he looked like Batman. Now afraid for his life, the thug reveals Black Mask's location in the hopes of being spared. However, just like the last snitch, he too is sentenced to death with a bullet to the head.\n\nRed Hood arrives at Sionis' hideout, and takes out several guards. This draws out Black Mask, who enters his office with several henchmen. Black Mask attempts shooting the Red Hood numerous times, but fails due to the vigilante's reflexes. Beating Roman and his thugs, Red Hood slowly wears down the crime lord and kills all the henchmen.\nAfter the battle, Red Hood drags the now begging Sionis to a large window in his office. As Black Mask promises \"I'll go anywhere you want!\" Red Hood tells him \"How about you go to Hell?\" and kicks the defeated crime lord through the window, and tells him to \"Say hi to Joker for me.\" He then leaves the building.", "summary": "Batman: Arkham Knight \u2013 Red Hood Story Pack is a DLC where players control Red Hood, the anti-hero persona of Jason Todd.
