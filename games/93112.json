The events of the game take place in a small feudal kingdom. The kingdom is exhausted by the long train of persistent wars with the neighbors; the resources and power of the royal authority are considerably weakened. Royal vassals - feudal lords - exploit their status for their own mercenary ends. They establish their own laws on their lands and try to seize the lands of neighbors, till it can be done with a perfect impunity. The kingdom stands on the verge of a civil war, cities abandon to submit the lords, to whose domains they belong, and declare self-government. Gangs of marauders, big and small, scour the woods. There comes a turning-point in history. One of the tree heroes - Knight, Ranger or Archmage - has to gather an army, defend the King's throne and fight with the betrayers of his fatherland and with the Devil's incarnates.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/discord-times"}
