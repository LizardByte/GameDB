I don't know, really. Probably just for the \"d'aww\" factor that this game has. It's a very short Playthrough (8 parts long) that shows every level at least once, along with the game's \"ending\".\r\n\r\nNote #2: Sorry, but this is not going to be 100%'d, simply because you sometimes have to be bad at the levels to get other prizes. I'm just going to show off as much as I can of the levels, and beat many of them (Some will not get the best outcome, but some will). I will show various secrets in the game, though. The only two major items I'm not getting are the Flying Acorn (because you can get things down with the Megaphone), and the Lucky Hook.\r\n\r\nNote #3: Like all of my Playthroughs, this one has no commentary. I know that's odd for a game that requires a microphone. Like I explained in my channel description, I don't do commentary simply because so many people do it already. I just show gameplay for people to see various aspects of the games: helping out people who are stuck, or letting them simply see gameplay. I'm not really saying many things to Pikachu anyways, only things that will move on with the level. Just pretend that the main character is Red, and the \"no commentary\" thing won't be a problem.\r\n\r\nIn this part, we meet Pikachu and go on various adventures with it. Pikachu also decides to live with us.\r\n\r\nThese are the levels shown in this part:\r\n\r\nA Pok\u00e9mon Picnic, Part 1: This is a nice level to get used to Pikachu's capabilities. Unfortunately, for the first few levels, the camera will always focus on Pikachu. Anyways, Bulbasaur needs help finding ingredients for its stew: An Onion, a Carrot, and a Wild Herb. The Wild Herb is quite difficult to find. It's best to find all three of the recipes Bulbasaur needs, along with one extra of the needed ingredients. Pikachu will ask you if it's okay to send an ingredient to Magnemite. Some ingredients work, but some will not. As you can see, I got Weird Onion Stew out of my ingredients, probably because the Corn wasn't needed.\r\n\r\nA Field Trip, Part 1: There's not really much that you can do here right now, but later in the game, you can buy a Watering Jug from Abra, allowing you to water the Oddish scattered around the place. This is one of the levels I'm not going to fully beat (I do fully beat Part 2 of this, though), as it takes quite a while to fully evolve the Oddish by watering them. Also in this area, you can just chill with Pikachu. Let it pick up items and see how it reacts to them. Some items, such as a Strawberry, can be more interacted with, as Pikachu will eat it if you tell Pikachu to \"taste it\". This will make Pikachu happier as well.\r\n\r\nCaring for Caterpie, Part 1: Butterfree will leave you and Pikachu in charge of the baby Caterpie while it's gone. I knew this after doing this Playthrough, but if you feed the Caterpie enough Rosebuds, they will evolve into Metapod, then finally Butterfree. To get the best result out of this stage, you need to take good care of the Caterpie. If you see one flashing and changing color, it is either sick or hungry. Telling Pikachu to shock Rosebuds off a tree, Pikachu will feed them to the hungry Caterpie. If the day ends and the Caterpie are in good shape, you will be rewarded with a Ruby. Butterfree's reward depends on how well you take care of them.\r\n\r\nGone Fishing! Ochre: Well, as the name implies, you go fishing at the Ochre Fishing Hole for this one. Using the Fishing Hook, Pikachu will sometimes get a bite while fishing. You need to tell Pikachu to \"reel it in\", \"hang on\", or \"pull\" for it to get the biting Pok\u00e9mon to the surface. Sometimes this doesn't work and Pikachu will simply ignore you. You are also able to get a Lucky Rod from Abra later on, allowing you to fish for bigger Pok\u00e9mon, along with some rare ones (like Dratini).\r\n\r\nA Pok\u00e9mon Picnic, Part 2: Bulbasaur needs you and Pikachu's help again, and this time, it's making soup. It requires a Sweet Potato, Turnip, and Mushroom. Getting another Sweet Potato, you can make Sweet Potato Soup, which is apparently really good. Now that you can move around on your own, without the camera focusing on Pikachu, this should be a lot easier. It works the same was as Part 1; collect ingredients and give them to Magnemite.\r\n\r\nA Field Trip, Part 2: When you first enter here, you will get a Watering Can (the Watering Pail is much better, though), and you can now water some Oddish around the place to make them evolve into Gloom, and then into Vileplume when you revisit. Sometimes, Pikachu will find an Oddish, just for it to actually be a Strange Radish. To truly \"beat\" this level, you need to fully evolve every Oddish, which takes a really long time, which is why I only beat this one. You can also buy things from Abra's Shop.\r\n\r\nAlso, Quiz Time is pretty fun, but it messes up sometimes (the only real mistake on my part is accidentally saying \"Pidgey\" instead of \"Spearow\").", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7KCQT__Xkp4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7KCQT__Xkp4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7KCQT__Xkp4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Hey You, Pikachu!
