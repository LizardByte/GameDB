This is not an emulator and was not played on the Wii or Wii U Virtual Console.  This footage was recorded directly from my Super Nintendo using a real Street Fighter II Turbo cartridge.  I'm using my favorite character, Ken, and playing on max difficulty (8 stars).\n\nSo who wants some new Street Fighter II footage in 60 fps?  Once again, I didn't lose a single round while playing on the highest difficulty and turbo setting.  \n\nThis playthrough is similar to my last one, except I didn't use the cheap strategy on Bison this time.  However, I still had to use cheap tactics on Zangief and Guile because they're rotten bastards.  Guile will stop everything with his Flash Kick, and Zangief will grab you from a ridiculous range with his Spinning Piledriver.  So they deserve to be exploited.\n\nLike before, I'm playing with a four-star turbo setting.  I've had some people request the hidden 10-star turbo mode, but I've tried it, and it's just flat-out absurd.  I can't even react in time at that speed.\n\nI've been a Street Fighter II fan since The World Warrior first hit arcades in 1991.  I remember the first time I played it at a 7-Eleven near my elementary school.  I instantly got hooked and couldn't stop thinking about the game even during class.  Of course, at the time, I didn't know how to do any of the special moves, but that didn't stop me from playing the crap out of the game.  In fact, when I was only 7 or 8 years old, I entered a Street Fighter tournament hosted by that same 7-Eleven.  They hooked up a bunch of Street Fighter II cabinets outside the store and had everyone play against each other in elimination matches.  Naturally, I got my ass kicked in the first match, but I still had fun!\n\nOnce I learned the special moves I started getting more proficient, and for Christmas of 1992, my brother and I received a brand new Super Nintendo as well as a copy of Street Fighter II: The World Warrior.  We played that game to death.  I remember all the neighbor kids coming over to our house to play it and we would hold our own little improvised round robin matches.  By that time I started clobbering everyone with Ken.  Damn was it fun.  I even remember that some specific friends of ours (two brothers) picked up a Super Nintendo just to get to this game.  That's how popular Street Fighter was back then.\n\nA few years ago I replaced that World Warrior cartridge with a complete copy of Turbo because it's just so much better.  One of my friends used to own Turbo, so I got to play it at his house as a kid.  Plus I used to rent Turbo and Super Street Fighter II even though I owned the World Warrior.  That's how fun the games were.\n\nEnjoy the higher quality footage.\n\nRecorded with the Hauppauge HD PVR and the official SNES S-video cable at 60 frames per second.  I used a Toshiba model D-R550 DVD Recorder to upconvert the SNES's native 240p signal to 480i so that the Hauppauge could capture the console's audio/video signal.\n\nI'm using a standard SNES controller.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/otPC3_bL-4Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/otPC3_bL-4Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/otPC3_bL-4Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/otPC3_bL-4Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/otPC3_bL-4Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Street Fighter II Turbo (Actual SNES Capture) - Ken Playthrough on Max Difficulty", "description": "This is a capture of me playing through Street Fighter II Turbo on the SNES.
