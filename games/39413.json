It uses sprite scaling to simulate a 3D playfield, meaning it predates Virtua Fighter as a 3D fighter by about a year (though the 3D in Virtua Fighter isn't simulated, but rather true rendered 3D graphics). You can play as either warriors or monsters, but otherwise this is a typical fighting game with a dedicated jump button (as Up moves back). Although the title screen reads \"1992\", the arcade game was first sold in early 1993.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-edge", "videos": [{"id": 117997, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zBXZ9f-dCMM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBXZ9f-dCMM", "title": "Arcade Longplay [491] Dark Edge", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zBXZ9f-dCMM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
