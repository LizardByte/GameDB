(the game is coming out May 10th, 2017, but you can wish-list the game now \\^__^/): http://store.steampowered.com/app/559210/\nOfficial Rakuen Soundtrack: https://laurashigihara.bandcamp.com/album/rakuen-official-soundtrack\nWebsite: https://projectrakuen.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LauraShigihara\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/supershigi\n\nHello everyone! As many of you know, I've been creating a game called Rakuen for the past few years. We've finally settled on a launch date: May 10th, 2017 (only two weeks away)!! The game will be available on Steam for PC, Mac, and Linux... and you can wishlist the game now! I've been trying my best to answer questions over at Rakuen's Steam Community Hub (check it out if you get the chance, there's also some pretty nifty artwork up there^^) Until then, I'm just gonna be hiding in a cave, most likely super stressed out in an effort to get everything ready before the game's launch XD\n\nA lot of folks have been asking if there's a way they can help out (thank-you so much)... Basically, any help with spreading news of the game would be greatly appreciated (a simple tweet or facebook message, posting on reddit, telling your favorite news site about us, wishlisting the game, making a video, etc.). And if people want to do Let's Plays, it's okay with me so long as you link back to Rakuen's Steam page and my youtube channel :)   \n\nRakuen is an adventure game about a Boy who lives in the hospital. One day he asks his Mom if she'll escort him to the fantasy world from his favorite storybook, in order to ask the great Forest Guardian, Morizora to grant him one wish. Together, the Boy and his Mom search out special doors that lead between the hospital and fantasy world, and they set off on a great journey. In order to receive a wish, the Boy must complete a set of challenges that revolve around helping his neighbors in the hospital by interacting with their alter-egos in the fantasy world. \n\nThe art in the thumbnail was created by the very talented Emmy Toyonaga (the lead artist on this project). And a big thank-you to Slamacow for working with me to edit this trailer, I couldn't have gotten this video finished without his help and support :) Everyone has been working so hard to get this game ready to be shipped (Ancu/Ali on the Mac and Linux port, Zeriab on the mouse and Steamworks integration, Astra on leading up QA and coordinating with Kreyg to test all the up-to-date builds)... thanks so much to all of you! Just two more weeks ;_; Laura is so tired.
