The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.\n\nThe game takes place all over Lizard Breath, and there are several different types of action / interaction. The adventure part of the game is very linear, guiding the player in a fairly set sequence of action sections. These include first-person bug shooting, scrolling overhead shooting, and a chase sequence.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/it-came-from-the-desert", "videos": [{"id": 759, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Mh3nWh-3-ys", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh3nWh-3-ys", "title": "It Came from the Desert - Amiga gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mh3nWh-3-ys/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
