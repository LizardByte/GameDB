Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Masters of the World simulator for education and training. Over one thousand playable actions.At the country\u2019s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more.\n\nFor each of these areas, numerous laws can be proposed and must be voted on by the Parliament in order to pass. For example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc.\n\nThe player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more.\n\nEvery action has its consequences. Lobbies, social groups, and leading national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence finds it necessary to do so (interviews with the press, resignations, protests, strikes, roadblocks, wars...).\n\nTo prevent tension, the player can meet with any figure, or address the media (over 8 hours of dialog in the game).\n\nThanks to its intelligence services, the player also has an entire arsenal of spies and \u201cspecial\u201d ops. For example, he or she can - at his or her own risk - reveal scandals about another political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage a foreign infrastructure, have an opponent assassinated, etc.\n\nAs the head of the military, the player can move all of his or her units around the map from their actual bases during military conflicts.\n\nInternational organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council\u2019s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization.Lastly, in order to stay in power, he or she must actively campaign to make sure he or she is elected.", "videos": [{"id": 4724, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2Z_qvgTUCV4"}, {"id": 4725, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "PtbNJBpXFMo"}]}
