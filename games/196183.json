Thanks to the voice output, even toddlers are able to explore the hidden object pictures on their own. They do not need to be able to read to have a sense of achievement. Concentration and attentiveness are taught in a playful way. Incidentally, a study conducted by the Singapore Technological University proved the fact that hidden object games increase the understanding of spatial perception in memory. In addition, visual search skills were noticeably improved.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
