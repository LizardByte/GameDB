Anyway, I've played for about 2 mins then without saving so didn't bother loading. So on the next stage player two will come, but np... p2 dies fast (duh).\r\n\r\nThis is not like recording and using savestates like I'm used to with the Amiga emulator (WinUAE), so whenever I load or save a game, there's a tiny \"hiccup\" as some frames get lost everytime.\r\n\r\nAfter beating the game you can play a special stage... which is very hard so I killed myself instead to show the highscore part. If you wanna see this stage + the cool boss, check this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=wvvFMVzeGDw&feature=related\r\n\r\nYeah, it looks easy for him because he plays this game in another emulator that supports re-recording, so no sound hiccups and no problem making it perfect. As I don't record many arcade games anyway I do it the old fashioned way of loading and saving savestates and editing the video files together manually.\r\n\r\nIn my emulator the game is called \"Gokuyjou Parodius\", but on most other places people have named it \"Gokujou Parodius\". I don't speak Japanese, but to me \"Gokujou\" looks more Japanese so I went with that one :) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bLDK-b-ll8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bLDK-b-ll8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bLDK-b-ll8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bLDK-b-ll8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bLDK-b-ll8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Longplay [172] Gokujou Parodius", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\r\n\r\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\r\n\r\nBoss 1: 03:16\r\nBoss 2: 06:15\r\nBoss 3: 08:56\r\nBoss 4: 11:14 (?)\r\nBoss 5: 11:48\r\nBoss 6: 14:49\r\nBoss 7: 17:18\r\nBoss 8: 19:54\r\nBoss 9: 23:14\r\nBoss 10: 24:30\r\n\r\nAt 20:10 I accidently hit the 0 on my number pad which on my laptop is right next to my right arrow key (yeah, I play all my games on my laptop, no gamepad/joystick), when I say right next to, I mean right next to, it's a very compact keyboard and have like 2 mm between the keys.
