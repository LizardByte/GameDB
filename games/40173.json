Interestingly, the original flyers for the game referred to it as Hero in the \u201cTemple\u201d of Doom and featured the image of an Indiana-Jones-like character, complete with fedora (one wonders if they changed the name and character in an effort to avoid litigation).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hero-in-the-castle-of-doom"}
