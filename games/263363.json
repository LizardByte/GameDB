It features new graphics such as textures and weapon sprites, some new sounds and most notably the aforementioned custom mostly .ogg soundtrack. The plot follows a \"Clan [B0S] fighter\" as he wakes up from a nightmare into an apocalypse already in-progress. It is then gradually revealed that \"the worthy\" have already ascended to heaven, while everyone else have turned into bloodthirsty demons who are left to infight. He journeys into a now-desolate world, searching for answers as to what had happen, and why only he retained his humanity.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sacrament--1"}
