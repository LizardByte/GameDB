Unfortunately, Chase begins to realize that their memories \nof Echo may have been a bit rose-tinted. Being back in the town digs \nup old and painful memories; secrets that lead to rifts in the group \nthat have been boiling under the surface for years. On top of that, \nChase begins to realize that Echo itself may have its own secrets. \nOdd and unexplained memories that he always blamed on an overactive \nchildhood imagination may not have been imagined at all. \n \nFinally, an event is triggered that turns these fears into something much more \ntangible and dangerous. Chase is now forced into a situation in which \nhe must help his friends either face, or escape their demons. Either \nway, Echo is not keen on letting them go...", "summary": "When Chase decides to write a college report on a case of mass hysteria that occurred in his old home town of Echo, he uses the opportunity to get his group of childhood friends back together for the week. However, a tragedy from their past weighs heavily on their minds, and the desolate desert town finds itself on the brink of disaster once more in this atmospheric slow-burn visual novel.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 47406, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "2mWnE5VZLec", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mWnE5VZLec", "title": "Echo - The Full Visual Novel Available Now", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mWnE5VZLec/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
