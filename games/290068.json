Taking place in a world were gravity has shaped everything from animals to houses, and from weather to communication devices, the player is faced with different obstacles on her way through the game. To progress, the player has the ability to change the gravitational state of nearly every loose object in the environment using a stick. This stick can turn objects weightless, freeze them mid-air or have them fall back on the ground. Hoping to bring a brand new experience with the game play we have no intentions of leaving the visuals unaltered. The Source Engine is deeply modified to provide a vision of something new, a world that feels alive and different from what you have seen before.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ether--1"}
