Shrek is on a journey to meet his in-laws, so Shrek 2 follows his adventure to Far Away Land and the chaos that ensues once Fiona's parents learn that their precious daughter is an ogre -- and is married to the crudest of them all. Shrek 2 features a mixture of puzzle solving and enemy bashing. Players are able to control one of four characters at any given time -- swapping between them at will. Each character has a set of basic attack moves and a special ability. Donkey has a \"Burro Blast\" that can knock down large objects, Shrek can pick up and throw heavy objects, and Fiona -- in a nod to her fight scene in the first movie -- can slow down time, Matrix-style.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shrek-2", "videos": [{"id": 4532, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vu0lZDrkVDo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu0lZDrkVDo", "title": "Shrek 2 trailer Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vu0lZDrkVDo/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3073, "name": "Shrek"}]}
