You play as one of the Ascended Adventurers that have come to save Blackwall from the forces of evil who have overrun a nearby cathedral. You will adventure through the Everwood Forest: a procedural forest composed of various events and monsters. Gather whatever strength and power you may find, for the cathedral has lost all its light.\n\nIF you survive that, your new-found power will allow you the opportunity to raid the infamous Light's Wake Cathedral on your quest to descend into the depths and slay any who stand in your path. Will you be able to drive out the forces of darkness and cleanse this once holy site?\n\nIF Nevermore finally takes you, he may yet favour your reverence and grant you a permanent glimmer of your former power, advancing your Ascended and making them more powerful for each run.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nevermore--1"}
