York generates considerable friction with his dismissive attitude toward the locals, bizarre demeanor, and tendency to interrupt conversations to deliver asides to an unseen person referred to as \"Zach\". He is assisted by the town's sheriff George Woodman, who is scarred by a past of childhood abuse; the deputy sheriff Emily Wyatt, who becomes a love interest for York; and Thomas MacLaine, George's meek assistant. Additionally, York finds himself regularly ambushed and attacked by the Raincoat Killer, who, according to the folklore of the town, kills only when it rains.", "summary": "The open world mystery adventure \"Deadly Premonition\" is coming to Nintendo Switch.\nA mysterious serial murder occurs in Greenvale, a small town in North America surrounded by a beautiful nature.
