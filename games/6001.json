He lives on the isle Tol Andar and there are many, many other heroes there. The problem is that there are not enough princesses to rescue or dragons to slay for all the heroes, so Rodrigo is currently unemployed. Another problem involves pirates who want to raid the city Smashville and create flying ships with magical gloomstones. Confronted with this situation, Rodrigo is very disillusioned. Just in time, the dwarf Ramil hires Rodrigo to find his wife Jasmin, who was captured by the pirates and is held in the city of Endavin.", "summary": "Rent-a-Hero is a graphic adventure game developed by the Austrian studio Neo Software (later Rockstar Vienna) and published by Magic Bytes in 1998, and by SouthPeak Games in 2000.\n\nRent-a-Hero is a traditional point-and-click adventure. The characters are modeled in 3D but the background graphics are pre-rendered. There are over 30 locations and over 30 characters to interact with.
