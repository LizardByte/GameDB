There are some notable differences in this build when compared to the Xbox build of the game that was found a few years ago. The biggest difference probably being the working audio. There are also some extra graphical effects that appear to be disabled or broken in the Xbox port. Can't say exactly when BioMedia Project will release this to the public, but it should be soon.\n\nDiscord server link: https://discord.gg/DyWpTjC", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dvmzz92F3oo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dvmzz92F3oo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dvmzz92F3oo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dvmzz92F3oo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Bionicle 2: City of Legends PS2 build (1/15/2004) (PS2)", "description": "This is the PS2 build of Bionicle 2: City of Legends that I received from a former Argonaut developer.
