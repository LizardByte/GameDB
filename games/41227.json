To protect their goal, the player's paddle can fire missiles which can be aimed straight or angled up or downward. Missiles that hit whizballs can help propel them to start going in an opposite direction. If one of the missiles or whizballs hits the player's or the opponent's paddle, it will temporarily disappear leaving the respective goal undefended. The game is won when either one of the players gets to a previously selected score. \n \nThe game contains 72 game variations of this basic premise. Variations include having from 1 to 4 whizballs, and 6 different game types: \nBasic: each whizball is worth only 1 point; \nBasic Plus: players can guide the missile shots into the whizballs; \nBonus: whizballs can be numbered 1 through 4 and are worth that many points each; \nBonus Plus: adds guided missiles to the Bonus game type; \nSuper Bonus: whizballs increase in value from 1 to 9 points the longer they stay in play; \nSuper Bonus Plus: adds guided missile shots to the Super Bonus game type.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/videocart-20-video-whizball", "videos": [{"id": 16088, "name": "VR", "video_id": "yWKvqXiqjRU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWKvqXiqjRU", "title": "The Channel F Files VideoCart 20 Video Whizball Gameplay!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yWKvqXiqjRU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
