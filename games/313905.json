It was created to have a world for kids with safe chat features.\n\nNicktropolis was a social MMO where you could create an avatar and customize it, chat with other players, create your own room, and play games.\n\nThe game would allow you to walk around various Nickelodeon themed environments, where you would play mini-games of whatever intellectual property you would be in at the time. By doing so, you would obtain Nickpoints; the in-game currency. With it, you could buy items for your avatar in Nickname Lane where there would also be shops themed around the various shows.\n\nIn 2010, it was completely re-branded to The Club, which used a few different assets, but the idea was the same. In 2013, The Club was closed with a few assets remaining. And in 2016, all remaining assets carried over were closed when Nickelodeon removed the option to join as a user on the website.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nicktropolis", "videos": [{"id": 122913, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lPAJZbS3am4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPAJZbS3am4", "title": "Nicktropolis Demo Reel | Journey Through Nickelodeon's Virtual Reality World", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPAJZbS3am4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
