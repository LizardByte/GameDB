You can choose to play pool (first player to 25 points wins), billiards (first player to 50 points wins), trickshot (attempt to earn points by sinking all of the balls on the table in a single shot), or trickshot practice game variations. During the game you use the joystick to control a cursor which aims the cue ball. By holding down the button you control the amount of power in a shot (the longer you hold down the button, the more power the cue ball is hit with). You may also apply some English by moving the joystick while hitting the cue ball. At the end of the game a trophy will appear on screen to indicate who the winner is!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trick-shot"}
