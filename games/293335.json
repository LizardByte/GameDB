Stranded with just the clothes on your back (and up to three of your hopefully closest friends), you'll have to work the land to make it through the night. Build a homestead, search the haunted town for supplies or try to survive on what you can find in the wild, pursued by creatures straight from North American folklore!", "summary": "You're a nameless traveler, stranded in a ghost town in the Cursed West.
