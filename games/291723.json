Among these, Sage Kashyapa was distinct, for he fathered many beings, starting with the Devas and Asuras, and later the other races\u2014Yakshas, Gandharvas, Rishis, Vanaras, Nagas, Rakshasas, and Manavas.\n\nDevas as guardians of divine order, and the Asuras as embodiments of raw power lived in harmony and balance. The discovery of Amruth, the Nectar of Immortality, shattered this balance. Both races sought-after the elixir, believing it would grant them eternal rule over all the Lokas. What began as a sibling rivalry soon grew into an all-consuming war, as the Devas and Asuras dragged the other races into their struggle for supremacy across the ages.\n\nThe endless wars eventually disturbed the cosmic order, prompting the seven sages to seek the help of the tri-gods\u2014Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The tri-gods then crafted Ilavath, a realm outside ordinary time where heroes from all races could engage in battle without wreaking havoc on the cosmic universe. Here, the hero\u2019s fought for something greater than victory; they fought for moksha, the freedom of their souls from endless desires for battles.\n\nThus, Ilavath\u2019s battle arenas became the home, where true victory was not about conquering others but about overcoming one's own thirst for power and eternal life.", "summary": "ILAVATH, is a Team Based Strategy game that draws inspiration ancient legends of India.
