As soon as the leather dwarves feel unobserved, they cut loose in the most shameless manner.\nThe player's objective is to keep them from performing their pervert actions with the - mouse controlled - whip in order to obtain a lot of points. One must not get diverted by the dwarves' animated poses or their insolent comments. This could mean a loss of points or worse. There are different settings like the garden, the greenhouse or the darkroom.\n\nAs a bonus, there are two extra mini games included:\n\n\"Dance the leather dwarf\" - Make the dwarf dance to cool beats. The better your sense of rhythm, the higher the score.\n\n\"Sing Sing! - The dwarves prove their singing talent and you have to repeat the lyrics.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lederzwerge-deluxe-xxl-version"}
