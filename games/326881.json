It was not long ago I swiped a magical relic from my\n\nold friends the Keepers, but this time is now over, and life resumed its course. I am, again,\n\nlow on funds, and not in the best shape: keeping my network of associates was hard enough,\n\nbut I suspect one of those backstabbing bastards had the nerve to rat me out to the Hammers,\n\nand a swarm of fanatics came to bash the door of my hideout. Luckily for me I managed to get\n\nout, but in the commotion I forgot to take some of my equipment with me; most notably my\n\nclimbing gear. I can't risk going back to South Quarter, not with all the activity down there.\n\nI guess I'll have to borrow some ropes on my way because I'll need them if I want to get the\n\npiece I'm being commissioned for. Not to mention my usual supplier won a trip to Cragscleft\n\nrecently.\n\nI got tonight's job mostly by accident: as I was pawning off some items a greasy old\n\nbeggar approached me, introducing himself as Cutty. Beneath all the grime on his clothes\n\nand his crude way of talking you could tell he was someone very clever and particularly\n\nmethodical, and I was impressed to say the least. No one would ever suspect that tramp,\n\nperfectly blending in The City's finest populace of being one of the most famous fences\n\nin town. I introduced myself and he was mildly amused... I could see he wasn't convinced\n\nI was the one who sacked Beric's manor and pulled off so many daring jobs, so he offered\n\nme a job as a test: my goal tonight is very simple; I am to steal a precious opal called\n\nMoon Tear from Lord Monsegur, the new Warden of Stonemarket. Cutty did not exactly tell\n\nme why he wanted this opal in particular, but he is ready to pay me quite a sum if I\n\nreturn the opal to him, and will consider offering me prime jobs, the kind only real\n\nprofessionals get and with the promise of reliable funds. On other occasions I would\n\nhave declined the offer; I prefer to stay away from these Wardens as much as I can, but\n\nthe prospect of working with a person of his reputation is not something you can refuse,\n\nand Stonemarket is a rather wealthy district with all these thieving merchants and fat\n\nnobles around... It's just too good to resist!\n\nI will enter through Iron Gate when lights will dim. It's a cold and rainy night so I doubt\n\nI'll find many people out in the streets. From there I will need to proceed to Monsegur's\n\nmanor that's located north of the Hammerite clocktower. I know Stonemarket has been the\n\ntheatre of various thefts lately so I imagine the district will be on watch during the night,\n\nwith guards ready to arrest unlawful interlopers, and Monsegur's manor will most likely be\n\nwell protected. My first goal will be to find some ropes. One of my associates is ready to\n\ngive me a potential tip... but as always, it comes at a price. Or I could always pay the\n\nmerchants a little visit to see if they have some wares for a taffer like me.\n\nTime to go.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/endless-rain--1"}
