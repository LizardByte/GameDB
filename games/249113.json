No matter what the weather is like, the sun always shines on the square in the game. In the relaxed atmosphere of a square that could be like this in the south of France, you can throw the jack and the balls. In single player mode you learn how to do it, in multi-player mode you can compete against other players. These can be friends or random players all over the world. Special is certainly the sound of the game: the birds twitter, the bullets bang and immediately you are in another world.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boule-petanque", "videos": [{"id": 89219, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "K9uk6k5jPyg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9uk6k5jPyg", "title": "Boule Petanque - the VR sports game for Meta Quest", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K9uk6k5jPyg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
