There are no enemies, but the levels are full of obstacles like spikes or buzz-saws which you need to overcome by careful jumping. Each level is timed. To make things harder as you ascend the deity introduces new rules, like \"you can't touch golden blocks\" or \"you can't go left\".\n\nBrowser version features some additions to the original Windows game:\n\n- A new secret area;\n- Extended ending for finding all secrets;\n- Additional music, sounds, and graphics;\n- Various gameplay / graphical fixes;\n- Level creator that lets the players make and import custom levels.", "videos": [{"id": 67717, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "nlGhUMv7f5U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlGhUMv7f5U", "title": "Tower of Heaven Walkthrough - 0 deaths - Secrets", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlGhUMv7f5U/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
