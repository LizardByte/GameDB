(Intelligent Qube) Final, also known as Kurushi Final in Europe. This sample is played on the Japanese version of the game (So basically, this is I.Q. Final here).\r\n\r\nYou probably already know by seeing my channel that I'm a Puzzle Game fan, and this game is one of my personal favourites among them. I first discovered Kurushi through the Demo Disc provided with my Playstation 1 back then in 1997, and inside that Disc it was one of the demo games I played the most along with Overboard!, Rage Racer, Hercules and Lifeforce Tenka. Good times, good times. :D\r\n\r\nIn this Puzzle Game, you're playing as a guy (or a woman, or an animal, depending on the character you choose, there's several of them and are unlockable bonuses) trapped above a block of cubes. Cubes are coming to him, and you have to erase them before they crush him, and eventually make him lose rows (A bar below the playing screen shows how much normal and green cubes you can afford not to make them disappear : fill that bar by letting go too much of them, and you'll lose a row). Lose too much rows and thus playing space, and you'll fall to your Game Over.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of cubes : normal, green and black. Black ones are \"forbidden cubes\" : you'll lose a row per black cube you make disappear, so make sure not breaking them. Thus, the cubes you'll have to make disappear are the normal and the green ones. The green ones are \"advantage cubes\" : they'll make disappear all cubes around the place you made them disappear, so use them wisely.\r\n\r\nThe game sample I'm showing is of Stage 3, as of all Stages I played in this run (until Stage 5), this one had the best showing potential, with display of standard playing, exceptional playing, as well as failures. :p\r\n\r\nEnjoy ! :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WpSOLLQomBg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WpSOLLQomBg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WpSOLLQomBg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "I.Q.
