Like America's Army, it is considered to be video game propaganda; however, it differs from America's Army in that it is not available free.\n\nThe player takes the role of Ahmed, a Palestinian opposed to Israeli occupation (Zionists). Through the course of the game, Ahmed progresses from throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers to destroying Israeli military positions. The game has been criticized for being too hard and is designed so that it is easy to be killed. If the player shoots a civilian, the game ends automatically. In the end, it is not possible to achieve victory. The game contains recreations of the Dome of The Rock mosque, the West Bank, and Al Ramlah Prison an Israel Prison Service facility.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/under-ash"}
