It was the first new game to be released on cartridge for the Master System since 1998! \n \nYou play as Digger Chan working for M.O.O. Milk Co, and it's your job to go around the globe fixing the milk pipelines buried deep beneath the ground. Everyone loves having fresh cool milk available on tap, and the customers get displeased when there are problems with the pipelines, cutting off their supply of milk. \n \nGetting down to the pipelines is not an easy job, digging is exhausting with only sporadic bottles of milk available to collect and quench your thirst. As if that wasn't enough to worry about, rival milk companies have hidden deadly explosives in your path to disrupt your work! \n \nThis game has two versions: the first presented as an entry in the SMSPower! Competition in 2006 and the second expanded version, released as in cartridge format in 2011.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/digger-chan--1"}
