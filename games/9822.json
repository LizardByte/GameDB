Stout. It was first released digitally through Stout Games own website. Four months later (March 1, 2011) it was released on Steam. Just like some other indie games (e.g. Dear Esther or The Graveyard) its status as a video game has been disputed, as it requires minimal interaction and the few small choices you make are of no consequence to the story. It does, however, give the player the opportunity to eat, drink and smoke whenever the player wants to, as long as the time isn't up.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dinner-date", "videos": [{"id": 111947, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "VF_Mv3OzLpQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF_Mv3OzLpQ", "title": "Dinner Date - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VF_Mv3OzLpQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
