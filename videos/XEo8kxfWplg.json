Usually when I record an N64 video with FRAPS, the framerate drops and I lose a few frames, which is normal for me. But in this case, rather than dropping frames and keeping the game at the same speed, it slowed down the entire emulator down by nearly 20 FPS without any loss. That makes it look like I slowed it down or something, which isn't normal. Anyways if you use Project64 and know how to solve this issue, please send me a message so I can avoid this problem if it ever comes up again.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XEo8kxfWplg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XEo8kxfWplg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XEo8kxfWplg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Iggy's Reckin Balls (N64) Gameplay", "description": "Gameplay video of Iggy's Reckin Balls on Nintendo 64.\r\n\r\nI had some technical difficulties recording this video.
