The counselors start with an arcing rock attack. The goal is to find and defeat Jason Voorhees three times. Along the paths, players will find cabins, a lake, caves and wooded areas with all but the cabins having enemies such as zombies, crows, and wolves attacking the player. Players may upgrade their weapon upon finding a new one. A timed alarm appears at certain intervals, requiring players to find Jason before he kills one or more children or another counselor. Using the map, players must navigate their way to Jason's location or switch to the counselor being attacked and defeat him. If they do not make it there in time, Jason will kill the counselors or some of the children.\n\n#nes #nintendo #playthrough #gaming #retro #walkthrough #longplay #gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYHXcEsZMAE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYHXcEsZMAE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYHXcEsZMAE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYHXcEsZMAE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XYHXcEsZMAE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Friday the 13th (1989) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "description": "Playthrough of Friday the 13th, developed by Japanese game developer Atlus.\n\nFor a great breakdown on how to beat this game check out the video below. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcq9YGG6vVA\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Subscribe for more videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCCmsDPICSz4MfC07fhoNAw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dangermeat\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/danger_meat\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/danger_meat\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dangermeat\n\nAbout the game:\nFriday the 13th is a survival horror video game published by LJN and developed by Japanese video game developer Atlus for the Nintendo Entertainment System video game console.
