The other marines are wiped out, so Ripley must then travel through the infested colony and prison facility, and finally the crashed alien ship itself, to destroy the aliens and escape.", "summary": "Alien Trilogy takes many elements from Alien film series, such as face huggers, chest bursters, dog aliens, adult aliens, and Queen aliens.
