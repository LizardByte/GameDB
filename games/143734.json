Did you wish you could experience the magic and the mystery of an entirely golf-controlled hedgehog all over again, but this time in Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and perhaps enjoy more characters? Well, feast your eyes on SNOLF 3 & KNOLF: The Sonic Golf Experience, Part II!\n\nThis romhack, like its predecessor \"SNOLF: The Sonic Golf Experience\", replaces Sonic's ability to move with a golf-game mechanic, similar to the kind of thing found in games like Kirby's Dream Course. Sonic remains rolled up into a ball under most conditions, and can only be launched when he has come to a stop. The Rings counter instead counts how many shots you have taken, allowing players to compete to get the lowest score!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snolf-3-and-knolf"}
