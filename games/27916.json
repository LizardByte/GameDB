One day, the Hero's friend informs him of the Dark Lord's goals, and he urges him to seek a Knight named Bogard. As the Hero escapes imprisonment, he learns that the Dark Lord is seeking a key to the Mana Sanctuary in order to control the Mana Tree, an energy source that sustains life. The Hero is befriended by the Heroine (named by the player, officially called Fuji) who is also seeking Bogard. The two find Bogard, who recommends they seek out a man named Cibba. During their journey to meet him, the Heroine is kidnapped. With the aid of a mysterious man, she is later rescued by the Hero. When they meet Cibba, he plays a message left by the Heroine's mother, who reveals she is a descendant of the guardians of the Mana Tree and her pendant is the key to it. The mysterious man, upon discovering that the heroine holds the pendant, reveals himself to be Julius, the Dark Lord's advisor and kidnaps her. The Hero then attempts to rescue the Heroine, but he fails and is knocked off of Julius's airship. However, the Heroine gives the Hero the pendant just before he falls.\n\nSecret of Mana\nThe game begins as three boys from the small Potos village disobey their Elder's instructions and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure is said to be kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.\n\nTrials of Mana\nThe story begins in a different place for each playable character. With the exception of Charlotte, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character\u2014now including Charlotte\u2014on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Sanctuary of Mana, exhausted by her journey. Out of desperation, the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying, and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the Benevodons will reawaken and destroy the world. He goes on to explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. They can then restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not have the strength to do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined", "summary": "A collection of the first 3 Seiken Densetsu games, known as the Mana series internationally, with a quick save feature added and all 3 soundtracks.\nThe games included are Seiken Densetsu (Final Fantasy Adventure), Seiken Densetsu 2 (Secret of Mana), and Seiken Densetsu 3 (Trials of Mana).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/collection-of-mana", "videos": [{"id": 28135, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OE9tcYSRFqI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9tcYSRFqI", "title": "Collection of Mana  - Nintendo Switch Trailer - Nintendo E3 2019", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OE9tcYSRFqI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12734, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "60tMD5TDQog", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60tMD5TDQog", "title": "\u300e\u8056\u5263\u4f1d\u8aac\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/60tMD5TDQog/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1920, "name": "Mana"}]}
