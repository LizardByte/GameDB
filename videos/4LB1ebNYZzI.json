This is part 1 of my Dune Dynasty Tour & Skirmish game.\n\nCONTENTS:\nPart 1\n- 0:00 Tour of cool features\n- 13:44 Skirmish Game\nPart 2\nhttps://youtu.be/3WWqrVnDVO4?list=PLZqnaGtTZxFYhzg4kOt6bN4qD02wbuGI9\n- Skirmish game continued\n\nABOUT:\nDune Dynasty is a reverse engineered reconstruction of Dune 2 for windows using the OpenDune source files allowing skirmish, high resolutions, modern C&C style unit controls (eg box dragging & unit groups) and building options (even with build queues). But what makes Dynasty different to all the others out there is the fact it gives the most accurate Dune 2 feel due to be a proper reconstruction of the original engine and best of all also allows you to load in fan made addon campaigns like Super Dune 2 Classic and Dune 2 eXtended which famously added campaigns for the Fremen, Mercenaries and Imperial Sardukar. Normally those fan addons can only be played through the original Dos based Dune 2 with its limited graphics & ancient controls, so to now be able to play them in high resolution with modern controls is awesome!\n\nFor now I'd probably still recommend Legacy over this for skirmish maps as it has more maps and is easier to configure (I hate having to mess with ini files) however Dynasty does give a more accurate Dune 2 feel and should be your number 1 option for playing the fan campaigns until Legacy adds support for them (Legacy recently added Super Dune 2 & enhanced it! So fingers crossed they do the same with eXtended) and makes it's AIs feel more like the original. Also be warned that Dynasty requires the EU European edition of Dune 2 1.07. It will work with the 1.07 US copy that most of us have however you won't get unit voices (eg \"reporting\" \"acknowledged\" etc).\n\nNOTES:\n- I haven't played Dune 2 in over 10yrs so I suck a bit sorry lol.\n- Since recording this video I've learned that Dynasty is more of an accurate reverse engineered reconstruction of Dune 2 for modern systems which probably explains why I did much better in my game of this then I did with the Legacy Remake as that one just didn't behave or feel like the original Dune 2 did while Dynasty actually does!\n\nLINKS:\nDune 2 Dynasty homepage:\nhttp://dunedynasty.sourceforge.net/\n\nTo see more D2Dynasty and Dune related info, downloads, pictures & video visit my Dune Games Webpage here:\nhttp://blakessanctum.x10.mx/Games/DuneGames/\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nWelcome To Blake's Sanctum! :)\nIntro: https://youtu.be/EsSfHqBz2IU\n\nIf you wish to donate or support my work:\nYoutube Subscription: https://youtube.com/c/BlakesSanctum?sub_confirmation=1\nPaypal Donation: https://paypal.me/blakessanctum\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/blakessanctum\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LB1ebNYZzI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LB1ebNYZzI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LB1ebNYZzI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LB1ebNYZzI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LB1ebNYZzI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dune 2 HD Remake (Dynasty Project) Tour & Skirmish - Part 1/2", "description": "INTRO:\nDune Dynasty is a reverse engineered reconstruction of Dune 2 for windows using the OpenDune source files allowing skirmish, high resolutions, modern C&C style unit controls (eg box dragging & unit groups) and building options (even with build queues).
