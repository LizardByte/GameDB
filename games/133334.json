Three of those Tides, Kuundra, Aphase and Venphyra soon populated those worlds with gateways to different worlds, bringing in adventurous travelers, who built cities and began scavenging this planet for artifacts.\n\nSoon after the creation of those portal gateways, the gods witnessed evil creatures of many kinds entering the gateways and invading Nalraaf. It was discovered that the magical core of the planet would not only benefit the Tides, but also lure energy hungry creatures through the gateways.\n\nAs the Tides have no physical form, there was nothing they could do to stop this invasion, but each to choose on a physical contender and lend him their power. Together they formed the Tournament of the Tidewoken. The winners earn the title of Tidewoken and become a vessel for the gods.", "summary": "Tidewoken is a multiplayer turn-based combat strategy game with focus on competitive PvP.\n\nCreate your own challengers with over 45 skills per character class and win the Tournament of the Tidewoken with knowledge, wits and creativity. Each character can equip up to 10 Skills, of which one can be a Legendary Skill.\n\nFight alone, controlling multiple characters, or focus on one sole character in team vs. team battles.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tidewoken", "videos": [{"id": 36017, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BZE5PYpdOEQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZE5PYpdOEQ", "title": "Tidewoken Alpha Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BZE5PYpdOEQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
