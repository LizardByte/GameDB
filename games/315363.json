The game was mostly a clone of the regular Talking Tom app, which had the player talk to Tom and he would repeat back what the player had said. In addition to that, it also featured 2 mini-games, which were milk and study.\n\nThe game notably contained the malware \"Gooligan\" within it, which installed rootkits and stole authentication tokens from Android devices to gain access to Google accounts, among many things. In 2013, the game was removed from the Google Play Store after the developers were sued by Outfit7 for copyright infringement.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/talking-tom-3-in-olympics"}
