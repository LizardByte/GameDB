It is also the first to have an official licence from the National Hockey League It was release by Intellivision in 1980 and is a 2 player only game, meaning that it is not possible to challenge the CPU.\n\nIf the game start by itself, it will choose the fastest game speed, else, the player can choose between three game speed.  The Home Team is on the left and the Visitor Team is on the right. They are also identified by their colour: tan for the former and blue for the later.\n\nIn the rink, there are 4 players for each team. One of them is the goalie, who cannot be controlled at all. Like most hockey game of its time and the one that follow it, you control one player at a time, and you try to do pass or score at the opposing team\u2019s goal.\n\nInitially, the player skates slowly, but as you hold the direction you want him to go, he will go faster and faster until the maximum speed.\n\nWhen on offence, the player can only control the player currently having the puck. However, in defence mode, you can switch to any player, but the game will try to choose the one that is closest to the opposing player having the puck.\n\nOn defense, it is possible to intercept a pass by going in front of the puck before the opponent\u2019s teammate catch it. It is also possible to steal the puck if you manage to swing your stick as you touch the puck controlled by your opponent.\n\nPassing is done using the numbered button on the Intellivision controller. Depending on which button, it will send the puck to that direction, not directly toward a teammate like modern hockey games. It is also possible to perform a Slap Shot, a stronger hit that is intended near the goal.\n\nIt is possible to trip a player if he has the puck. If it is not the case, such as tripping a player that does not have the puck, the referee might whistle and send that player to the penalty box for 2 minutes. During that time, it is impossible to perform other penalties until there is room for the penalty box.\n\nNHL Hockey playthrough\n\nThe goal is to play a full game of hockey with the USA version of NHL Hockey.\n\nSince it is a 2 player only game, the runs are performed with 2 persons. The game is played with minimal TAS tools to show as much action as possible.\n\nTAS tools were used in this playthrough.\n\n#nhlhockey #mattel #intellivision #retro #vintage #retrogameup #retrogaming #retrogameup #sportsgame #sportsgames #longplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wAgBIr-dI8s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wAgBIr-dI8s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wAgBIr-dI8s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wAgBIr-dI8s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wAgBIr-dI8s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "NHL Hockey (Intellivision) - Playthrough [HD] | RetroGameUp", "description": "TAS tools were used in this playthrough.\nSubscribe here! https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameUp\n\nMore retro stuff here at RetroGameUp's website!  \nhttps://retrogameup.com/\nFollow RetroGameUp on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/RetroGameUp1\n\n\u2615\ufe0f Buy a coffee for support!  \nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/retrogameup\nNHL Hockey was developed by APh Technological Consulting and published by Mattel Electronics in 1980.\n\nredacted_cat is the second player in this playthrough, visit his twitch here! https://www.twitch.tv/redacted_cat/\n\nTIMESTAMPS\nPeriod 1  : 0:00\nPeriod 2 : 14:45\nPeriod 3 : 29:32\n\nGame Description\n\nNHL Hockey is the first true hockey game to appear on a game system.
