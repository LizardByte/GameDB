Not entirely sure why the game is called \"Azu-Cola\" though...that said, the artwork is very good (the characters look super recognizable/spot-on) and the characters have cute and funny animations, depending on what's taking place (so when you do chains, when characters when or lose, etc.). The game is colorful and presentation-wise, it's about what I've come to expect from columns-styled games (particularly indie variants), but everything is quite serviceable. The music is rather......odd? I don't even know how to describe it, but if you're able to hear it, you probably know what I mean! It doesn't make me think of anything. I am not really reminded much of Azumanga, nor Columns, when I listen to the music. The best way to put it is that I get a \"vague essence\" of the game trying to sound Azumanga-esque, personally. Still, nothing is especially offensive to the point where you can't enjoy the game.\n\nIf you are familiar with Columns, you'll probably be entertained with Azu-Cola, since the core gameplay is very functional, in the same way that Columns was/is. You get gems of different shapes and colors and you can match 3 (or more) of the same color/gem horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You attack your opponent (raise their stack to be closer to the top of the screen) when you do chains/combos (sessions where you match 3 or more numerous times in a row as your stack  and when someone's stack gets too high, noted in Azu-Cola by two \"rectangles\" at the top of the screen (the \"doom\" spot is the blank space between those rectangles), they lose. As you eliminate gems and make matches and the like, you also fill up a gauge underneath your gem display (that display shows you which gems you get next, to help you plan ahead) and when it is full, you get a power-up that will eliminate all of one type of gem on the screen, depending on what gem that power-up touches and stops on.\n\nIt's a pretty solid game, overall.\n\n--------------------\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rP0cgsYybTM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rP0cgsYybTM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rP0cgsYybTM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Azu-Cola [\u3042\u305a\u3053\u3089] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Check out collectibles for popular and obscure series that you know and love at Entertainment Earth!
