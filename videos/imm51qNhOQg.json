The streets are prowled by fearsome dogs. You can fire fluff balls to defend yourself, and collect food to replenish your energy. As a cat you have, of course, nine lives.\n\nThe gameplay is from the Steam re-release from Pixel Games UK, which also includes the Amstrad CPC version. Keep in mind that the Amstrad CPC version has no audio whatsoever.\n\nSteam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464540/Paws_CPCSpectrum/\n\n#steam #steamgame #steamgames #retrogames #retrogaming #pixelgamesuk #sinclair #sinclairzxspectrum  #zxspectrum  #paws #cat #cats #catgames #catgame #articcomputing", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/imm51qNhOQg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/imm51qNhOQg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/imm51qNhOQg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/imm51qNhOQg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/imm51qNhOQg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Paws - ZX Spectrum Gameplay (Steam Re-release)", "description": "Originally released in 1985 for home microcomputers, this unique game from Artic Computing saw players take on the role of a cat whose twelve kittens have wandered off into a labarinthine town.\n\nExplore the city searching for your twelve kittens, but watch out!
