In order to save campaign progress, players must have a memory card with at least one block free.\n\nBattles consist of two phases: deployment and real-time fighting. Deployment allows you to position your regiments within an area designated by white flags. This involves turning them to face certain enemies, issuing orders to attack, move (including setting waypoints and patrol loops) or simply hold ground.\n\nCombat involves charging the enemy, using magical spells (if available) or firing long-range weapons, such as arrows or catapults. Of course, line of sight and terrain will influence how successful your attacks are, and the emotion level (fear, hatred or frenzy) as well as the experience of your troops will also play a significant role. Each battlefield can also hold various magic items that may help in future battles.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warhammer-shadow-of-the-horned-rat--1", "videos": [{"id": 1964, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "o5nBfIJfOdg"}, {"id": 5028, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "5m8HttsILUE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m8HttsILUE", "title": "Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat - PC Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5m8HttsILUE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
