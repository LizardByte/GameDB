A good way to keep up with this mod is to stay up to date on our discord server which you can find here: https://discord.gg/QuUfgU9NDt\n\nWhen will the next trailer be?\nWe normally don't ever plan when our trailers will come out until last minute. Instead we just get a lot done and then see what we want to put in the trailer.\n\nDoes this mod feature the frog suit\nMost likely yes. As of now behind the scenes it is a little buggy but we hope to fix all of its issues in the end so it can finally see the light of day.\n\nHow many worlds and levels does impending doom have?\nSo far we plan to have 8 worlds with no bonus worlds. That can always change. Also there is no confirmed level count yet\n\nCan I download a wbfs/iso of this hack?\nNo, we are legally not allowed to give out an iso or a wbfs file of this mod when it releases. That is considered piracy. If you wish to play this game on dolphin emulator you need to find your own iso builder.\n\nCan I play this on Wii U?\nYou can play this mod on both the Wii and the Virtual Wii on the Wii U\n\nIf you have any more questions, make sure to ask a mod or a dev in the qna chat on our discord server!\n\n\nCheck out our main channels: \nJaker: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqE7ybRxN8VdCAhU-oNyAHA\nDrex: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLqftWZ1ndIMkPKQwsxKwJw\nSynel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCle8WuJ1NrVg1N8niuP8-rw\n\n\n#ImpendingDoom #Nsmbw #MarioBros", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ex1ohAvYUkw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ex1ohAvYUkw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ex1ohAvYUkw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ex1ohAvYUkw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ex1ohAvYUkw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "New Super Mario bros Impending Doom 2024 Trailer!", "description": "Disclaimer: We are not associated with Nintendo or the newer team.
