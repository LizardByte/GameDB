Whoever finds the way first wins. Luckily, they can use magic to move the walls of the maze. On the way through constantly changing paths, however, each player must first reach secret locations. The mystery cards reveal whether the next target is a ghost, a bunch of keys, an owl or something else. The first to discover all the secrets and return to their starting point is the winner. The random arrangement of the maze cards makes each game different.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ravensburger-labyrinth"}
