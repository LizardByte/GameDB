Each of these worlds offers incredible vistas and countless gameplay opportunities as players discover valuable resources, experience deadly combat encounters, raid bases, scout crash sites, and cooperate with other players on the planet surface and flying high above. Planetary landings are an entirely new way to play Elite: Dangerous, and is just the first part of the Horizons season of updates.\n\nThis expansion is now part of the base game; it became unavailable for purchase on October 27, 2020.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elite-dangerous-horizons", "videos": [{"id": 6492, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "Ih8S2Fx_JBg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih8S2Fx_JBg", "title": "Elite Dangerous: Horizons - Launch Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ih8S2Fx_JBg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
