There are several licensed real world teams with fifteen different riders and several motorcycles to choose from. Some are not available from the beginning and have to be unlocked by completing courses. There are totally seven of them, advertised as based on real circuits around the world.\n\nIncluded game modes are Grand Prix, time trials, single races and, exclusively for N-Gage wireless multiplayer for up to four players using Bluetooth connection. Unlike earlier MotoGP for GBA, this one runs in full 3D, including both environment and bikes. The lap records could've been uploaded to the N-Gage Arena service and shared online.\n\nAnother unique feature to this particular version is a simple track editor, where you can construct new racing stages from scratch, using top-down view and various turns. Those custom tracks could be later accessed in the single race mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/motogp--2"}
