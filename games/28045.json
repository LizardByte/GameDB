The story will take you from a banana plantation to dark toxic caverns, to the sprawling city of Pochutla, to the flooded coastline, to deadly demon-infested jungles, and more. There are 14 unique skills to upgrade with skill points, ranging from agility to firearms, hacking, hardware, voodoo, and more. Unlock up to 80 special abilities that allow you to do things such as throw your weapon, upgrade your guns, and even control the weather. Dangers include rival tribes fighting for fertile land, mutated ghouls that emerge from their caverns at night, vicious demons that hunger for your flesh, a flooded and irradiated coastline that eats away at civilization, disease, insanity, hunger, and more. You will die often, and you will like it.\n\n#indiegame, #fps, #rpg, #survivial, #horror, #mexico", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brigand-oaxaca", "videos": [{"id": 12903, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "om0XHjjWstM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om0XHjjWstM", "title": "Brigand Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/om0XHjjWstM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
