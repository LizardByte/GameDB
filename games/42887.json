He learns that in two years, the village will be turned into an amusement park by a company called Funland, and encounters three Harvest Sprites named Nic, Nak, and Flak and the Harvest Goddess, who ask him to stay on the farm and help them. The player then decides to take over his grandfather's farm and work hard to turn the village around. The player also meets Alice, Funland's CEO, and her henchmen, Charles and Renton, who reveal that they have the town's deed. He then makes it his goal to stop Funland's plans and increase the town's popularity to avert its destruction, all while having to deal with Alice's robotic creations. By choosing different paths, you can find up to 16 ways to save the village.\n\nIf the player is successful in saving the village before the end of the second year, Alice will give back the deed and will either leave or stay depending on the player's actions. The player will then be faced with a second challenge: earning the required amount of money before the end of the third year to convince his father (who doesn't think he can handle the farm by himself) to allow him to stay in the village.", "summary": "Protect Leaf Valley from the heartless Funland corporation!
