The game begins at the fall of the Han Dynasty, shortly after the death of Emperor Ling when the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao begun an uprising against the Empire. A number of elements in the game build on aspects of Chinese Mythology and there is a mix between fact and fiction as the game is built on the story of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nMany of the locations, characters, and events in Dynasty Warriors 4 are reported to have happened in Chinese history although many have been exaggerated to make the game more appealing to the player. There are also some features that are historically inaccurate such as Zhou Tai\u2019s weapon, a Japanese tachi, as there is no historical record of this kind of weapon being used in that era. The game features environments resembling that of ancient China and various items from the era. Common items throughout the game include Fairy Wine and Dim Sum\u2019s.", "summary": "Dynasty Warriors 4 is a hack and slash video game and the fourth installment in the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper was developed by Omega Force and is based on a series of books called Romance of the Three Kingdoms, written by Luo Guanzhong. As the series has progressed, it has strayed further from the actual plot of Romance of the Three Kingdoms but instead has given the user more input on how the storyline progresses.\n\nDynasty Warriors 4 was ported to the PC under the name Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 62759, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "scH5vQcEsdw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scH5vQcEsdw", "title": "Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper PC Games Trailer - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scH5vQcEsdw/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62760, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-LJCaycjTvY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LJCaycjTvY", "title": "Max Graphics Test - Dynasty Warriors 4: Hyper [PC Only]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-LJCaycjTvY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
