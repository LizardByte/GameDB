You are equipped with a car possessing the ability to fly over short distances and fitted with firepower.\n\nYou can play alone or in a genuine two-player mode. The packaging announces that the course is tough and one which you can only survive if you are brave and resourceful - and how true this is.\n\nYour car is seen from above and moves along a roadway which scrolls from top to bottom of the screen. As you barrel down the blacktop the opposition moves in for the kill mounted on bikes or piloting anything from little yellow taxi cabs to Sherman tanks.\n\nInitially you have about a dozen bullets and it appears that these are only effective at short range. Quite unsportingly. some of your opponents seem to be immune to your attack and keep on coming regardless of what you throw at them.\n\nYour fuel level steadily goes down, all the more so when you take off to avoid enemy vehides. Not only that, but with bullets in limited supply you need to rearm and refuel at regular intervals. Indicators showing fuel level, bullets remaining, jumps left and damage are at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAt several places you must make a choice of directions, one of which will usually result in a dead end. Experience teaches you to make the correct decision ,and often you can jump over to the right track if you're quick.\n\nOne annoying feature is that everything slows down drastically when a lot is happening. That apart, and considering the price. Boy Racer isn't at all bad, with good graphics and nice explosions.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boy-racer", "videos": [{"id": 103259, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "780bN-K3YkA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=780bN-K3YkA", "title": "[Amstrad CPC] Boy Racer - Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/780bN-K3YkA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
