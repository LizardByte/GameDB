Developer Bugbear has overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem.\n\nForget shiny supercars - in Wreckfest 2, the rides are old, rusty, dented, and patched together. As Early Access progresses, you'll be able to build the banger of your dreams and transform your battered ride into a wrecking machine! New cars and other vehicles will be added as the game evolves.\n\nFrom day one, Wreckfest 2 will be shaped by your feedback. We're eager to create the greatest demolition derby-style game of all time.
