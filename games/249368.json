The further they roll the bigger they get and the higher the bonuses.\nAvoid the obstacles, because Santa isn't wearing a helmet!\nIf he gets hit he'll drop all his presents first.\nIf he doesn't have any presents, it's Game Over!\nHigh Scores are saved for the most presents collected and bonus points scored during a single level.\nEvery level is unique with increasing difficulty, meaning that no two games will be the same.\nEasy to pick up, but difficult to master when the levels become more challenging.\nCan you save the holidays?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flabby-santa"}
