You do this by attaching yourself to your diving station and moving down the infested waters, grabbing an item of treasure and moving it back up to the station. \n \nVarious fish are around, including crabs, piranhas and squids, all of which move in their own ways, and can be shot with your gun. Worst of all are the sharks which can cut through your cord - make sure they do not swim above you close to the line. The cord can go through other fish safely and unimpeded, but contact with the fishes themselves costs you a life. You have 32 screens to plunder.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
