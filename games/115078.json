No two heroes are the same. Each hero has their own unique abilities and design, meaning there\u2019s a hero to match everyone\u2019s style of play. Heroes complete objectives to collect gold like killing minions, towers or enemy heroes. As a hero collects more gold they can buy items from the shop that influence their heroes in interesting ways - allowing them to teleport to new locations, go invisible, freeze time and more. Items also allow a hero to get more powerful by giving their hero better attributes such as power, attack speed, health and various other stats.\n\nUnlike most MOBAs, Predecessor puts you into the heart of the action. The Third-Person perspective fully immerses you into the game as enemies appear from shadow walls, over ledges or from behind you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/predecessor", "videos": [{"id": 46580, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "gS1bMRVLil0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS1bMRVLil0", "title": "Official Predecessor\u2122: Closed Alpha Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gS1bMRVLil0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46581, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "FlBtJh3exWQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlBtJh3exWQ", "title": "Predecessor Feng Mao Gameplay - DOMINATION!
