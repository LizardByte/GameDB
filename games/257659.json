This might be a bit controversial take, but in my opinion this improves the vibe.\n\u2013 Interactive items have a color. Yes. A color.\n\u2013 Cat now runs like a ballerina, not a raptor. Thank god.\n\u2013 Platforming is a bit easier thanks to hitbox tweaking but also by redrawing platforms in few places, for reference check the main gate.\n\u2013 I added a new pathway for you in case you have a fear of being eaten alive by a cosmic horror monster and really don\u2019t want to do this part. So now you can go around it.\n\u2013 No changes were done to the music, since it\u2019s already perfection.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daymare-cat-10-year-anniversary", "videos": [{"id": 94299, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "ma-MPGXHozA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma-MPGXHozA", "title": "Daymare Cat \u2022 10-year Anniversary \u2022 Game Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ma-MPGXHozA/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6019, "name": "daymare"}]}
