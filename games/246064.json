Thirsty for the sweet nectar of revenge.\n\nYou will make them suffer, and from carapace to thorax, they will know pain.\n\nAs the Killbug, use your insectoid instincts to dash, double-jump and wall-run your way around this brutal battleground. Combine these fluid movement mechanics to reach enemies in all areas of the map.\n\nSlash and shoot your way through droves of ravenous beasts. From beetles to spiders to a giant larvae monster, there are endless swarms for you to butcher as the Killbug.\n\nBecome the master of death as you rise again and again, raining destruction on your foes and aiming for your next high score.
