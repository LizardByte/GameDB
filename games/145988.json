Well, this is Fat Rat Pinball, where you'll see animals being punched by the flippers, flying up, hitting bumpers, slingshot, targets and opening keys that will lead to the end of the levels.", "summary": "Substitute the ball in a pinball game for a Fat Rat to see what happens... Well, this is Fat Rat Pinball, a nice casual game free to play! The challenges of a classic pinball are mixed up with the rat body physics creating a unique, unexpected and fun pinball arcade game.\n\nWith this new game you'll see animals flying over the pinball machine, being hit by the flippers, bouncing as a ball in the bumpers and increasing your score on each collision. But don't panic - no animals are hurt in this game. Everything happens in a nice way.\n\nAs a casual game, you can try to beat up one of the pinball tables in about ten minutes. Some pinball machines have stages, as a kind of runner, and you go up until the end point. So, it's part of the game challenge to win the tables, but you'll need to be skilled to do it.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: one touch in the right or left screen side and you'll activate the respective flipper. For launching the ball, you should touch the screen and slide down to choose the spring force. It's possible to play with one finger - one hand game - but we recommend using both hands for more speed on activating the paddles.\n\nFat Rat Pinball uses a reward system, and you can earn rubies while playing. Completing a pinball table a couple of times will make you earn rubies enough to release new content inside the game. There are rewarded Ads after the matches and you can choose if you want to watch them or not - you are not forced to see any Ad while playing.\n\nUsing your rubies can release new characters and tables for playing. The actual version comes with 3 pinball machines and 4 bodies-balls.\n\nThe score records and achievements are incorporated with Game Center services, where you can see the game rankings.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fat-rat-pinball", "videos": [{"id": 48193, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "yQzLFdGh5hs"}, {"id": 48194, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Jve_aYhvlXM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jve_aYhvlXM", "title": "Fat Rat Pinball iOS Preview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jve_aYhvlXM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
