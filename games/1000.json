Abe learned the Magog Cartel was mining Necrum, the sacred Mudokon city of the dead, to collect bones to make super-addictive SoulStorm Brew.\n\nAfter freeing the Mudokon spirits imprisoned in the Mudanchee and Mudomo Vaults, Abe gained scary powers from the Weirdos, including the ability to heal his Mudokon friends of SoulStorm addiction, and the power to turn invisible. Infiltrating the transportation hub of FeeCo Depot, and using explosive farts to survive adventures at the Slig Barracks and Bonewerks, Abe broke into SoulStorm Brewery.\n\nThere Abe learned the truth behind the secret ingredient of SoulStorm Brew... just before blasting the place to atoms with the combined power of the sobered-up Mudokon he\u2019d rescued. Then Abe joined his brew-addled pals at Alf\u2019s Rehab & Tea to take the cure \u2013 the journey of a lifetime starts with one step.\n\nOr is it twelve?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oddworld-abe-s-exoddus", "videos": [{"id": 71611, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eEx8lxXCsU4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEx8lxXCsU4", "title": "Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus Trailer 1998", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eEx8lxXCsU4/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 71612, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "O0THVeTNoxk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0THVeTNoxk", "title": "Oddworld Abe's Exoddus walkthrough part 1.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O0THVeTNoxk/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 5101, "name": "Mudokons"}, {"id": 5103, "name": "General Dripik"}, {"id": 5108, "name": "Glukkon Exec #1"}, {"id": 5106, "name": "Glukkon Exec #2"}, {"id": 5102, "name": "Spirits Sligs"}, {"id": 5107, "name": "Brewmaster"}, {"id": 5100, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3901, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm30d.jpg"}, "name": "Abe", "species": 5}, {"id": 5105, "name": "Vice President Aslik"}, {"id": 5104, "name": "Director Phleg"}]}
