Even your radar couldn\u2019t track them! Not wanting to panic the Claw over what you thought to be a radar malfunction, you went looking for the ghostly fighters. The search delayed your return to the Claw just long enough for the fighters to destroy the hapless carrier.\n\nLanding on the TCS Austin, you learned that you were the only pilot to encounter these \"stealth\" fighters. Furthermore, your flight recorder disk mysteriously disappeared right after you landed. Brought before a general court martial, you were charged with treason, and your claims about stealth fighters were ignored.\nA lack of evidence led to the treason charges being reduced to mere negligence, but you incurred the wrath of certain flag officers, Admiral Tolwyn among them. Your career appeared to be over. But you're still a pilot in the Terran Confederation Navy and in Wing Commander II, your goal is to defeat the Kilrathi enemy. Each mission you fly (and your success or failure in each mission) affects the Confederation's chances for ultimate victory.", "summary": "You may be the hottest pilot in the fleet, but this will cool your jets! In Wing Commander you blast your way through the Vega Campaign. You'd better be as good as your reputation because the stakes are too high to play it safe. Just when you think that the action can't get any more intense, or the opposition any stiffer, you'll plunge into Wing Commander II. Disgraced and unjustly court-martialed, you have to prove yourself once again and earn the respect of the Confederation High Command. Of course, there is also the little matter of preventing the destruction of the Terran home-worlds.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
