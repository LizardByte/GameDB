The main objective is to guide a cartoon character moving through an ascending pile of multicolored tiles, pushing the available blocks to create clusters of the same color. Groups of four or more tiles of matching colors can be removed by punching one of the connected blocks, with the vacant space being occupied by the falling stacks on top. The descending tiles that end up rearranged in new color clusters are automatically eliminated and give combo points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simple-1500-series-vol-48-the-puzzle-2"}
