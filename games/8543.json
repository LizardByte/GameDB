While the country is doing its best to hold off the onslaught of the Germans, an enemy landing force has landed in Siberia, far from the front. The despicable aliens have stabbed socialism in the back with treachery. However, Stalin does not care who to fight. His orders are not discussed, but executed. And so it is time to fill the camps and lumber camps with captive little green men!\n\nThe Great Leader is ready to dance on the bones of the vile aggressor. Tank brigades and rifle companies rushed into a decisive attack. Communists and Komsomol members are in the first ranks. However, the Martians also had their work cut out for them. Advanced technology faced the best troops in the world. Now the outcome of the war will be decided by morale... and Comrade Stalin personally!", "summary": "Stalin vs. Martians is a parody real-time strategy video game developed by Black Wing Foundation, Dreamlore and N-Game, released on April 29, 2009. Described as \"trashy and over-the-top\" by its creators, the game mocks World War II strategy games and utilizes pythonesque humor. The developers state that Stalin vs. Martians is \"obviously a parody, which sometimes gets close to being a satire\" and is \"halfway to becoming a trash icon of gaming industry for years\". In some interviews the lead designer of the game compares Stalin vs. Martians to the Troma films.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stalin-vs-martians"}
