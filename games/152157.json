Each level will bring more difficult puzzles, at the same time, newly encountered boxes with different mechanics will increase your thinking time. Egypt: Can you run away from the snakes or will you just crush them via the tomb of the mummy to open your paths? Greek: Sometimes all you need is Godly touch, let the Olympians help you in those dangerous adventures. Space: How are we going to save the world from outer space invaders? Maybe just like Sinatra says; we need to fly them to the moon!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/age-of-sokoban"}
