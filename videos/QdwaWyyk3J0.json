{"id": "QdwaWyyk3J0", "snippet": {"title": "ELRENTAROS WANDERING [ REAR SEKAI ] Announcement Trailer", "description": "Remember Rear Sekai? The new game from Yoshifumi Hashimoto, the producer known for the Rune Factory series and several STORY OF SEASONS titles, along with his team at Hakama Inc., brings a hack-and-slash RPG with a top-down view reminiscent of classic Rune Factory. The game features contributions from Motoi Sakuraba (composer for the Tales series and Star Ocean), Shie Nanahara (artist from Samurai Warriors 5), and Minako Iwasaki (character designer from the Rune Factory series), under the banner of Bushiroad.\n\nAfter nearly a year of being exclusive to Japan since its release in October last year, Rear Sekai is finally making its way to the western market, brought by Red Art Games. Interestingly, the game is receiving a new title for its western release. Instead of sticking with *Rear Sekai*, Red Art Games has opted for *Elrentaros Wanderings*. The name Elrentaros is derived from the name of a town at the farthest edge of Melvania, the game's main setting. However, the original name *Rear Sekai* is quite fitting as it represents the main character's story of \"amnesia\" in Elrentaros, only to find themselves in a completely different world mid-adventure. The term \"Rear Sekai\" combines \"Real\" and \"Isekai\" (another world), reflecting this twist.\n\nDespite the name change, the gameplay of Rear Sekai remains similar to a top-down Rune Factory, offering hack-and-slash combat combined with a crafting system called Build, where players can create equipment, magic, and various items to strengthen their team. Social elements are also present in the form of Visual Novel, including a bit of romance to add another layer to the battle mechanics. However, reviews from Japan indicate that the romance element isn't as strong as in Rune Factory.\n\nAre you interested in playing this game? Elrentaros Wanderings is set to release on Nintendo Switch on August 16, with a physical edition available on October 11. Interestingly, a Steam version will be published directly by Bushiroad, releasing on August 22. Note that the game does not support keyboard and mouse input, so you'll need an additional game controller to play it on PC.\n\nSource : Red Art Games - https://www.redartgames.com/games/745-elrentaros-wanderings-nintendo-switch.html\n\nRear Sekai / Elrentaros Wanderings\nNintendo Switch and PC (Steam)\nAugust 16 / August 22, 2024\n\n#Rearsekai #Elrentaros #RuneFactory #RS #RF", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QdwaWyyk3J0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QdwaWyyk3J0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QdwaWyyk3J0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QdwaWyyk3J0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QdwaWyyk3J0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ELRENTAROS WANDERING [ REAR SEKAI ] Announcement Trailer", "description": "Remember Rear Sekai?
