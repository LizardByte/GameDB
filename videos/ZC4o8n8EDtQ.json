But this also has one exclusive mode - the \"Event 2\" mode. In this mode, you're given 4 minutes 45 seconds to go through some challenging VS. rounds, and then spend a short 15 seconds racking up one final chain, all for a score and password to send to St.GIGA for an event prize.\n\nI don't have much more info on this one.\n\nYouTube is telling me to tell people to join and become a member for reasons, so here's the link for that ~\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOXvfoAZZJhmDZw0boGkSYA/join", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZC4o8n8EDtQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZC4o8n8EDtQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZC4o8n8EDtQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZC4o8n8EDtQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZC4o8n8EDtQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[\u30b5\u30c6\u30e9\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc] \u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u30dd\u30f3 \u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f32 | Panel De Pon - Event Version 2 (audio fixed)", "description": "(EDIT: Previous upload had an audio issue.
