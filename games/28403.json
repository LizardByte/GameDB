The engine has been recreated, providing new player movements, animations, and improved graphics.\n\nThe new version featured updated player rosters, an extended number of game modes, teams (including club teams for the first time), stadiums, and settings, providing a highly developed player editor.\n\nThe replays could be stored on a memory card, as well as won trophies and unlocked bonuses. In this version, the one-two-pass system was refined, becoming one of the greatest threats to the opponent. Dribbling, including trick shooting, was introduced as an element of the gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iss-pro-evolution", "videos": [{"id": 40002, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "lngsJhkwvwQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lngsJhkwvwQ", "title": "ISS Pro Evolution - Opening Movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lngsJhkwvwQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 75984, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "mw1uHHTSEfE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw1uHHTSEfE", "title": "Winning Eleven 4 [PS1] - Opening Movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mw1uHHTSEfE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 75985, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lIPfvKGOpE0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPfvKGOpE0", "title": "Winning Eleven 4 [PS1] Exhibition: Argentina vs Brazil (5 min)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lIPfvKGOpE0/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8365, "name": "ISS Pro Evolution"}, {"id": 8363, "name": "World Soccer Winning Eleven"}]}
