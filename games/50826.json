It's an action game of sorts, in which you play Beetlejuice himself and you have to kill (?) all kinds of skeletons with weapons -- you start with the ability to shoot a single loogie at the skeletons and, by collecting bonuses from destroyed skeletons, you may get additional loogies per shot or completely different weapons.\n\nAlso, after you hit a skeleton, your friend Lidia has to collect the skeleton's remains with a vacuum cleaner; however, if a skeleton find Lidia she becomes imprisoned in a cage and you have to release her by hitting another skeleton and taking a \"lightning bonus\" from his remains.\n\nAnother nice touch is the worm, which comes out of the playground every now and then and, should it hit you, kills you.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
