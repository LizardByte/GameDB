Bottom line, the technology would not survive the arcade environment, was slow and unreliable, and was very expensive for what you really got out of it. And I was right, but we started several games anyway. One was the turd Firefox. I actually did not make that game, I just did some work on it to help the team out.  Another one was Road Runner which was GREAT, and WAS tested in an arcade, and then redesigned to not have the laserdisc because it kept failing. Then we started Battlestar Galactica, for which an early laserdisc was made but not much else, and a preliminary test for Knight Rider, but nothing that was shipped.

Imaging a 3x3 of 4x4 grid of possible positions you can approach from, with the center being straight on. If you fly straight, the program would display every 9th frame which was the video of flying straight. If you moved right, you would select the proper \"frame view\" and it would look like you moved in the video to the right, and now play every 9th \"right position 1\" video frame in order. With this scheme, you could fly in 2 dimensions with the joystick while the game pushed you forward in the third as well, controlled by a throttle.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJ53K_DXUVk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJ53K_DXUVk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJ53K_DXUVk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Atari arcade Firefox laserdisc game (pt. 1 of 2)", "description": "This is a direct copy of the laserdisc footage that I archived several years ago, for Atari's Firefox arcade game.
