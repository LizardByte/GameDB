If you place two pieces of the same color together they will mend together into one piece.\n\nThere are six game modes: Solo Normal Game, Solo Scoring Marathon, Solo vs. Computer, 2 Players @ 1 Keyboard, 2 Players. Use Network, Computer vs. Computer. If the standard tetris pieces feels too uninteresting to play with you can select to play with two other sets of pieces: \"Planar Pantominoes\" and \"One-To-Five-Ominoes\". To make the game even more interesting you can activate the \"Power Pieces\"-option. A Power Piece can be one of four different kinds: The bomb (destroys all adjacent tiles), The Down (pushes each tile directly beneath it down as far as it can go), The Drip (all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it change to be the color most commonly occurring on the board) and The Skull (destroys all non-garbage tiles adjacent to it).\n\nAs standard there is no sound in the game but the user can add his/her own sound. The graphic style of the game can also be changed. There are 12 built in styles and additional styles can be created by the user.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alizarin-tetris"}
