Your dad died suddenly a few weeks ago. It looks like he left you the family house.\nReally though, you swore you'd never come back here. Nothing specific bad ever happened, but the place makes you feel sick to your stomach. Like you're some how allergic.\nYou know it's up to you to at least clean the place out. Your dad and stepmom had been divorced for years, and you've never been close with your half sister, Paige.\nFortunately, you get to do this alone, at your own pace.\nAs you start the process though, that same feeling from your childhood is still there. But there's more... a presence, maybe? It shifts from terrifying to comforting. And it all seems to circle around the basement that your dad never let you enter.\nYou need to find out what's down there. You need to understand what is in the house with you. And you need to open this lockbox that your dad left behind.", "summary": "A horror visual novel about coming home to your childhood home.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/in-the-foundations"}
