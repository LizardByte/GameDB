You\u2019ll step into a Black Box VR boutique gym and immerse yourself in a whole new way to get fit that will make you never want to visit an outdated gym again.\n\nThis video pulls back the curtain a bit more on what Black Box VR is about. It is still a teaser and only gives glimpses of the total experience, but overall you can notice a few things from our first teaser:\n\n1.) We now have a patent-pending Dynamic Resistance Machine we can show in the video. This machine delivers 110 Lbs. of dynamic resistance per handle and puts you through a highly optimized and personalized 30-minute full body workout that includes HIIT training. Testers regularly hit 80%+ max heart rate and are pushed to lean-muscle building zones, all based on exercise science.\n\n2.) We have dialed in our AI that automatically progresses you. You don't have to think about what workout you should do, what weights you should select, etc. You set it and forget it. The game pushes you to a healthier version of yourself automatically and, with the power of virtual reality, you experience time dilation (30 minutes feels like 10) and the immersive experience enables you to push harder without focusing on the workout itself.\n\n3.) We have narrowed in on our game experience that is a battle arena virtual sport. As you level up your body, you level up your characters and explore epic arenas. Because of the sporting nature of the experience, we can build on the core gameplay almost infinitely with championships, tournaments, social competitions and more.\n\nWe believe virtual and augmented reality are the next major computing platforms. These technologies will revolutionize the way we work, play, and learn. Black Box VR will take advantage of these advances to finally fix fitness and end the daily struggle that millions of people go through to get the exercise that they need to achieve the body and health that they desire. Today, fitness is boring, confusing, and almost impossible to maintain for the vast majority of people that set out to get into shape.\n\nBlack Box VR will change the way the world works out. You\u2019ll step into the Black Box room with your custom fitness headset and an entire new world will be created around you. As you go through the experience, you\u2019ll get a full body workout that is so immersive you\u2019ll forget you are working out at all.\n\nSome VR workouts in the future will include basic features like having your virtual trainer with you who is guiding you through a body weight workout similar to Wii Fit. We don\u2019t believe that is enough. Black Box VR will integrate resistance training through an electronically controlled cable system which will be seamlessly integrated into the game experience. Reach out to grab that rope or lift the handles on that object and you\u2019ll feel real cables, set to the exact resistance that you need. Functional fitness in a fictional word.\n\nOnly three Black Box experiences a week at 30 minutes each will be enough to increase your strength, endurance, and health while shaping your body in all new ways to help you achieve the body you\u2019ve always wanted. Each workout will automatically move you toward your goal by refining the resistance, intensity, and speed based on your goals and your current progress. Plateaus are not allowed.\n\nOur first Black Box VR flagship gym will open in San Francisco, CA on March 11, 2019 and then expand from there. Licensing opportunities will exist for gym chains to add Black Box VR workouts to help them leapfrog their competition and create additional revenue opportunities. Franchisees will also be able to open their own Black Box VR gyms.\n\nBlack Box VR is rapidly developing the next and final fitness revolution.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDf15sO5F2M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDf15sO5F2M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDf15sO5F2M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDf15sO5F2M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bDf15sO5F2M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Black Box VR - A Virtual Reality Gym Combining Gaming & Serious Fitness for Heroic Results", "description": "At Black Box VR, we are creating the world\u2019s first virtual reality gym experience.
