The Story Mode features Sackboy racing against The Hoard, who are planning to steal the Craftverse's prizes for \"no reason other than to hoard them.\" Players begin the story mode by hopping into a cart which had been crashed by a member of The Hoard, and takes off after them to reclaim the stolen prizes. Sackboy races through many places ransacked by the hoard. The Sackbots aid him in his quest.\n\nThe adventure begins with the Queen asking Sackboy to clear the Hoard from LittleBigPlanet. Afterward, Sackboy travels to a tropical beach-like planet called Monster Islands, where a local named Ray the Turtle asks for help locating the legendary Huge Monster. By the time they find her, they discover that the Hoard have stolen her egg, so Sackboy must take it back. The Hoard also attempt to steal \"brainergy\" and pastries from Victoria's Laboratory (now a separate planet).", "summary": "Give full throttle to your imagination and join Sackboy and Sackgirl on the starting grid for a kart racing adventure like no other.
