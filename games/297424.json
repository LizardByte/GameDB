First because it is the first game that combines four in a row with deck building and second because it is the first turn-based game in real time.\n\nThat means that while you are on your turn to make your move, things continue to happen on the board. This raises a new level of strategy never seen before.\n\nIn addition, the game has more than 100 real historical figures with which to form your deck and all of them will have a bio that will help us better understand who they were.\n\nAs if that were not enough, the characters will have different levels of strength, defense, life and dodge, in addition to having unique positive skills for allies and/or negative ones for enemies, thus being able to change the dynamics of the game at any time.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dirok--3", "videos": [{"id": 111360, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p5daTLcy8YM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5daTLcy8YM", "title": "Teaser D\u00eerok | Gamez Studio", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p5daTLcy8YM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 111361, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bMNWgvmQl28", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMNWgvmQl28", "title": "2024 04 04 16 26 12", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bMNWgvmQl28/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
