The developers are tearing up the rulebook and bringing a raft of new ideas to the table. These are the developers who have become synonymous with the world of virtual racing. Created for the players and building on the experiences of the serried ranks of bike fans, the new IP offers players the chance to ride over 100 bikes, in 4 different categories - Superbikes, Supersports, Naked, and Historical Bikes - and take them hurtling at full speed over a huge variety of city, country and historic circuits from the world of motorcycling. RIDE offers unprecedented levels of vehicle and rider customisation, presenting players with a vast array of options to keep gameplay fresh and exhilarating over the long term. The RIDE experience will accompany players and riders alike on the long road of the true motorcyclist.\n\nOver 100 items of clothing for men and women.20 bike upgrade packs, and a wide range of styles for your RIDE-AVATAR. These are just some of the features that make RIDE the game that every motorcycle enthusiast, and every gamer who loves bikes, has always dreamed of getting their hands on. RIDE players can customise:\n\nSTYLES\nChoose the gender of your Rider, from male and female avatars, choose their haircut, and their style - from full racing gear for the experts, to jeans and a t-shirt for a more casual chic look.\n\nRIDER\nChoose your favourite clothing from a wide selection of items, including: Helmets, Visors, Suits, Boots, Gloves, Jeans, and Jackets, all officially licensed gear*. Impress other riders with your style, and blow your friends away by recreating your real motorcycle gear in-game and then beating them to the finish line.\n\nBIKES\nThe bike is the focal point of RIDE, and the bike Upgrade Packs are an essential part of the experience: use them to stay ahead of the pack. Upgrade the engine, transmission, brake system, suspension system, wheels, and look of your bike. The changes you make don't just alter the bike's appearance, they influence the bike's performance on the track, and in some cases - such as the exhaust system - the sound of your bike as you roar around the track. In order to maintain the high level of realism the changes and customisable features available reflect each individual manufacturer's official options.\n\nAll the game items used for Rider and Bike customisation are accessible right from the start of the game. They can be acquired through a simple system of earning Credits. This virtual currency can be earned in any game mode, both online and offline.\n\nThe customisation possibilities are endless. For the hardcore motorcycle fans out there, the developers of the Milan Milestone team have developed a range of options to change your Rider's position on the Bike, accessible from the Riding Style menu. Recreate your own real riding style down to the last detail through a series of indicators - lateral and frontal head angle, shoulder position, seat position, inside knee position and so on - and then capture those magic moments with the Photo Mode, to share images of your avatar in action with your friends, and your rivals.\n\nFor those who want a sneak-peek of the game is available for PlayStation\u00ae4, Xbox One and Steam, the RIDE DEMO.\n\nRIDE has been developed by Milestone studios in Italy. It is available on PlayStation\u00ae4, PlayStation\u00ae3, Windows PC\u00ae, Steam. Xbox One and Xbox 360 versions will be available by Mid-April.\n\nFollow us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/ridegame, subscribe to the official YouTube channel http://www.youtube.com/ridevideogame, read what people are saying and join the conversation on #ridevideogame or visit the site www.ridevideogame.com.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD06n9sANgg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD06n9sANgg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD06n9sANgg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD06n9sANgg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zD06n9sANgg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ride - Launch Trailer", "description": "RIDE NOW AVAILABLE IN STORE AND DIGITAL\nBuy the PS4\u2122, PS3\u2122, Windows PC\u00ae/STEAM\u2122, Xbox One and Xbox 360 version\n\nRIDE: Milestone's development studios in Italy are back at work, doing what they do best.
