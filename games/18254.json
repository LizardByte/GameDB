Though the game was marketed as a tie-in with the February 14th release of the Daredevil film, the GBA title is more based upon a less realistic, comic book design with bright and vibrant colors and the occasional \"Pow!\" and \"Bif!\" when knocking out opponents. Some levels cut across rooftops, others over vehicles in traffic; some go in buildings and underground. As players get through the 23 different levels, they'll uncover the game's original plot through comic book-style cutscenes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 7421, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vd9OswOkH8o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd9OswOkH8o", "title": "Daredevil Game Boy Advance Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vd9OswOkH8o/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
