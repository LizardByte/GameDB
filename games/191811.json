Plundering Maine's rich economy, this mysterious organization was eventually found out and expedited viciously by a small force of totally radical warriors, chief among them the protagonist of our story: Anebriate. Order was eventually restored to the kingdom, but the riches lost could not be recovered. Totally unrelated, Anebriate became absurdly wealthy and spent his days loafing around in his house, drinking himself into comas and picking fights with local shopkeepers.\n\nThis story begins upon the eve of a series of catastrophic events which will lead to Anebriate suffering the loss of his vast wealth, his house, his memory, and subsequently, his impressive skills.\n\nThis is a tale of recovery - not just the recovery of monetary concerns or memory, but also the recovery of lost humanity.", "summary": "Tales of the Drunken Paladin is a fantasy-comedy RPG about a universally disliked hero who very suddenly loses absolutely everything - including his identity - and must go on a quest to find out who's responsible. It's also largely a game about interacting with thousands of inanimate objects. One full playthrough is between 40-60 hours. Once you've beaten the game, hard mode is unlocked.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tales-of-the-drunken-paladin", "videos": [{"id": 64591, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Ju8IHWVdGEs"}]}
