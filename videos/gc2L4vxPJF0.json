(FC \u00b7 Famicom / NES ) video game port | 6 loop session \ud83c\udfae\n\n\nThe Famicom port of Donkey Kong Jr. was released on July 15, 1983, while the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) port was released in June 1986.\n\nIn the Famicom adaptation of Donkey Kong Jr., you take on the role of Donkey Kong Jr. with the mission to save your father, Donkey Kong, who has been imprisoned by Mario. The journey is filled with challenges as you have to evade Snapjaws, leap onto moving islands, and navigate through a vine-filled jungle to reach the keys that will set Donkey Kong free. Despite being a port, this version retains the fundamental gameplay elements of the original arcade game, offering players a demanding yet captivating experience.\n\nThe objective of Donkey Kong Jr. is to rescue Donkey Kong, who has been captured by Mario. To do this, Donkey Kong Jr. must navigate through four different stages, avoiding various obstacles and enemies. In each stage, Donkey Kong Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. He must reach a key at the end of each stage to unlock Donkey Kong's cage. After completing all four stages and unlocking the cage, Donkey Kong Jr. rescues his father and the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.\nThe Famicom version of Donkey Kong Jr. has 6 difficulty loops. After completing all four stages in each loop, the game restarts at the first stage but at an increased difficulty. However, when you clear level 134 and reach level 135, it freezes and you have no choice but to reset.\n\nThe Famicom and arcade versions of Donkey Kong Jr. are essentially the same in terms of gameplay. However, there are some differences due to the change in platform:\n\u00b7 Demo Screen: The transportation scene in the demo screen is different.\n\u00b7 Donkey Kong\u2019s Animation: In the Famicom version, Donkey Kong, who is locked in a cage, does not move his hands and feet, and there are no shackles on his hands and feet.\n\u00b7 Snapjaw\u2019s Splash: In stage 1, there is no splash when the blue Snapjaw dives into the water in the Famicom version.\n\u00b7 Nitpicker\u2019s Egg: In stage 2, there is no scene where the egg dropped by Nitpicker splits in two when it hits the ground in the Famicom version.\n\u00b7 Game Freeze: In the Famicom version of Donkey Kong Jr., when you clear level 134 and reach level 135, it freezes and you have no choice but to reset. These differences are likely due to hardware limitations of the Famicom compared to the arcade machine.\n\n\n\n\nChapters\n00:00 Intro\n00:15 Loop 1\n02:50 Loop 2\n05:17 Loop 3\n07:35 Loop 4\n10:10 Loop 5\n12:59 Loop 6 \n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NenrikiGaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gc2L4vxPJF0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gc2L4vxPJF0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gc2L4vxPJF0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gc2L4vxPJF0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gc2L4vxPJF0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Donkey Kong JR.
