At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms. Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink. Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow! Why 20th Century Fox decided to cancel Meltdown is unknown, but was most likely due to the collapsing video game market. The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting 'Just Released' had already been printed. Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed. Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/meltdown--2"}
