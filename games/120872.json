It appeals to a more general audience, emphasizing on the game's atmosphere, soundtrack, and narrated-exploration to deliver players a poetic and emotional story. It is a story about Time, Death, and who we become when we forget who we are. Through this story we hope to make as many people as we can uncomfortable, but aware to the reality of millions around the world diagnosed with Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.", "summary": "We all live with the fear of reaching the shadow of dementia. The ultimate fear of forgetting. The fear of not remembering our past, what led us here. For who do we become when we forget who we are?\n\nBack Then is a first-person narrative game journey taking place in the mind of Thomas Eilian, an elderly writer diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. The gameplay, presented in first-person perspective, is story-driven and is heavily focused on interactions, puzzles and detective exploration.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/back-then", "videos": [{"id": 103807, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3zcMl_5ig0M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zcMl_5ig0M", "title": "Back Then - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3zcMl_5ig0M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
