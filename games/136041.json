He had a dream of a long, long stairway leading up to a door. As soon as the door opened, he was confronted with a world he had never seen before, spreading out as far as his eyes could see. When he strained his ears to listen, he heard a faint voice saying \u201cWelcome to the land of dreams. We have been cursed by Nightmare, he stole the Dream Rod and cast a completely evil spell. We have been awaiting your arrival. Please defeat Nightmare and return the land of dreams to its natural state. Nightmare has placed Meta Knight under his control (kono ko kono ko sa kudo kai kona misu saku ni kona misu ka ku.), to guard the Dream Rod, be wary Kirby!\u201d Kirby must now gain the Dream Rod and break the curse!\n\nWhen Kirby entered the world, he lost his ability to copy. However, the Dream Rod, with its last bit of power give Kirby the ability to use Dream Halos.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kirbys-adventure-2"}
