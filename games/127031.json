By utilizing \"senses\" and swaying others' \"intentions\", he can change history.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 40985, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NaC9aHgDHYM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaC9aHgDHYM", "title": "The Rewinder Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NaC9aHgDHYM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
