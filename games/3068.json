Like Sony's Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from road cars to race cars.\n\nPlayers can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/forza-motorsport-4", "videos": [{"id": 34904, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "7BTo-Wzdong", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BTo-Wzdong", "title": "Forza Motorsport 4: Trailer (E3 2011)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7BTo-Wzdong/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 141677, "name": "VGA 2010 Trailer", "video_id": "HIMnO30ZkD0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIMnO30ZkD0", "title": "Forza Motorsports 4 VGA Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HIMnO30ZkD0/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 448, "name": "Forza Motorsport"}]}
