Started as a smaller collab inspired by the VIPs, it quickly spiralled out of control and became a true sequel. JUMP\u00bd features even more of the wacky design and creativity JUMP is known for, on top of several new features and a significantly less brutal difficulty curve.\n\nJUMP's storehouses and dragon coin reward system return, along with the level info menu, hint movies, and a retry system for the hardest levels. This hack also boasts a brand new ASM-heavy boss or two, new unlockable items, plenty of hidden puzzles and 3-UP moons, saving at any time on the overworld, and a few other neat features.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
