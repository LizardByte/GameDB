(:\n- Destiny trailer from VGX 2013 \n\n\n---\n\n\nAbout Destiny - \n\nDestiny is an upcoming action role-playing first-person shooter video game in a \"mythic science fiction\" open world setting. It is developed by Bungie and published by Activision as part of a ten-year publishing deal. The game will be released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One video game consoles on September 9, 2014, with a Beta coming in the summer. Bungie demoed live gameplay footage of Destiny at Sony's E3 2013 conference.\n\nBungie has emphasized that the universe of Destiny will be \"alive\". Events may happen in-game that are not necessarily controlled or planned by the developer, which will help to create a dynamic developing experience for Bungie and a dynamic playing experience for gamers. The game's style has been described as an always-online first-person shooter that will incorporate massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements, but Bungie has avoided defining Destiny as a traditional MMO game. Instead, the game has been referred to as a \"shared-world shooter,\" as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to see and interact with all other players in the game or on a particular server\u2014as is the case in many conventional MMO games\u2014Destiny will include on-the-fly matchmaking that will allow players to see and interact only with other players with whom they are \"matched\" by the game.\n\nDestiny will incorporate a new game engine that allows global illuminations and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together. An innovation in Bungie's \"hopper\" technology, which has been the backbone for Halo's matchmaking system, will allow better player matchmaking in order to create a more natural experience in either cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes.\n\n\n---\n\nDestiny Official Gameplay Trailer (VGX 2013 HD)\nDestiny Official Gameplay Trailer (VGX 2013 HD)\nDestiny Official Gameplay Trailer (VGX 2013 HD)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2kff1e0zZ54/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2kff1e0zZ54/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2kff1e0zZ54/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2kff1e0zZ54/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2kff1e0zZ54/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Destiny Official Gameplay Trailer (VGX 2013 HD)", "description": "- All Trailers shown on my channel will be games I play so subscribe!
