Players take control of Ki-powered superheros and battle it out in a mostly aerial fight. The game is highlighted by the work of a great art team and an original style, and the gameplay is extremely fast paced.\n\nBFP started out as a Dragonball Z game, and neared completion as one. We ran into legal problems and had to repopulate the universe with original things. This delayed us quite a bit, but we ended up with a population of unique and cool characters to play.\n\nIf you are new to the game be prepared to have a difficult time finding a server. We had about 30 people playing at a time for about a year or two, but it has mostly died out. BFP has also been heavily modified by several different groups using the scripting system, so you may run into compatibility issues.\n\nBFP is no longer under development.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 36612, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EAhe8ISoXbo"}]}
