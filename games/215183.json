After the Harvey's go on vacation, Casper's human friends throw him a party to cheer him up but a revived Carrigan turns them into ghosts, using a magic spell from an old book in the library, and hides them somewhere in the manor as revenge for being tricked out of the ultimate treasure. The player must use various items to travel around Whipstaff to find traces of Casper's friends and take pictures of them for hints and collect items while defending against attacks by the Ghostly Trio who are on Carrigan's side. There was supposed to be a sequel as stated in the ending and the manual where the player would help Casper turn his friends back into \"fleshies\" but Morning Star went bankrupt before it was made.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/casper-the-interactive-adventure"}
