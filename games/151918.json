Hanashiro is planning on their death in 10 years, when the camellias fall, if they cannot find a reason to live by then.\n\nHanashiro and Shirayuri have witnessed THE END OF THE WORLD before. But no one believed them. Shiragiku has seen many, many apocalypses, but she has never been hurt by any one after the first. Shiragiku has remembered every single end; Shirayuri has remembered none; and Hanashiro only remembers some. Which? Even he doesn't know.\n\nHanashiro misses speaking her fey mother tongue, but she can't seem to find anyone willing to listen to her, not even her own kind. And then she makes an enemy who just might. Their name is Lun Kochouran.\n\nAnd they might be the first one in a millennium to learn the Amayuri tongue.\n\nThey also might be the first to kill an immortal.", "summary": "OCHITSUBAKI is a bilingual JPN/ENG transgender fantasy visual novel with an experimental poetic storytelling structure, a retro anime aesthetic, and a lush original orchestral soundtrack", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ochitsubaki"}
