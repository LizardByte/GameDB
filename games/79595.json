Players make a new discovery at every bend of the trail as they uncover and learn about more than 60 wildlife animals, plants, rocks, fossils, and more. With activities from stargazing to boat racing, creating cave paintings to singing around the campfire, children will gain a new respect for their environment without ever setting foot outside, and complete activities, earn badges, and search for examples of wildlife at Ranger Rudy's request. Once they find all the items listed on Ranger Rudy's clipboard, players are invited to test their knowledge at the Nature Match Game and ultimately earn their Junior Ranger Patch and recognition as an Official Camp Wonderoo Junior Ranger.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fisher-price-outdoor-adventures-ranger-trail"}
