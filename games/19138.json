Negotiations between humans and the Clagnor have failed, leading to an all-out war between the two races. The story follows Rawl Mastesen, a prison convict given the task of fighting the Clagnor for a year. After this, if by any chance he survives, his name will be cleared unless he takes an offer for another year on the job for twice the pay.", "summary": "Swarm is a top-down space shooter, similar to asteroids. You fly a ship around collecting an fuel source called EZT (Endron Zymithium Trisistaline) for the corporation you're indentured to. There is an aggressive alien species called the Clagnor which you must avoid / defeat. You can collect ammo for various weapons and mines which help you fight enemies / destroy asteroids, and shields which keep you alive when taking damage.\n\nThe game is level based. The main type of level requires you to connect enough EZT. The second type is a level where you must kill a certain number of enemies. And lastly there is an uncommon bonus level where you can collect as many items as you can in a short amount of time.\n\nItems carry over between levels, but are lost when you lose a life. If you lose all lives the game is over, though you may start again from the highest level you reached. There is a high score list as well. The game contains 100 levels of increasing difficulty.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 63612, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "V3jdU8cAIb4"}, {"id": 63613, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "v05Qf40bzZ0"}, {"id": 63614, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Ir4YleSNnVw"}]}
