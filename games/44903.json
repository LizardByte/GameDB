As in reality, there is a short period between the time the diver leaves the plane and has to open his chute and the game's challenge comes in aligning the free-falling team members to form impressive formations before the time limit expires.\n\nPlayers can lead their team in competition against a string of computer-controlled international contenders, or go head-to-head against a friend. Each squad can perform over 40 different formations and a practice mode allows the player to perfect his skills without the time limit.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/skydiving-extreme"}
