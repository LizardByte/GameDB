It's packed with a host of different elements, including survival, shooting, exploration, skills and much more, even including parkour! In short, it's a brand new gaming experience. The game tells the story of our future, after brain-computer interfacing technology has become highly advanced and human civilization has experienced another evolutionary leap, during which, great events have begun to unfold. Justice faces off against evil. The old stands against the new. And forces of conservatism clash with radicalism. \nIn this virtual world, all our heroes and heroines have acquired a \u201csuper power\u201d through the help of quantum droids \u2013 the ability to turn quantum cube energy into any tactical support device they need. From Optical Camouflage to Quantum Barriers, from a detector that alerts you of approaching enemies, to a medical instrument that heals squad mates; anything and everything can be built, by you, and that's not all. You can choose whatever skills you think will help your strategy the most in any battle. \nWe've even created a vertical combat concept. With parkour features including climbing, gliding, and rolling, players can experience vertical battles on a variety of terrain, including mountains, swamps and deserts. In this game, the arena that hosts your battles are not just a huge, flat map, but a world where you can fly in the sky and move underground. We have also created a number of exploration points scattered throughout the world. Here, you can explore temples in the desert with a chance of finding E-Cores to unlock new skills and weapons. Amid mounds of destroyed robots, you can also find gloves that greatly increase your climbing speed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 38365, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ikh86XuNqrU"}]}
