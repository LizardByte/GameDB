{"id": "QcNdExkaKAo", "snippet": {"title": "Clumzee teaser trailer", "description": "Next Thursday, you can help Furball Jimmy (a.k.a. Clumzee) conquer the Dreaded Path -- and prove his bullies wrong. You see, Jimmy\u2019s friends like to make fun of him for being a clumsy furball -- so they nicknamed him \u201cClumzee.\u201d Tired of dealing with the bullies, Jimmy decides to show them what he\u2019s made of:\n\n\u201cMight as well face certain death at the jaws of a hungry one-eyed monster. It\u2019s certainly better than having to listen to THESE guys!\u201d\n\nGAMEPLAY: THE ONLY WAY OUT IS UP\nThe Dreaded Path: a dangerous climb guarded by a monster who eats furballs for breakfast (and all other major meals, according to its PR rep). Touch the screen to move each one of Clumzee\u2019s limbs in the desired direction. Reach platforms, outsmart the monster\u2019s minions, and dodge projectiles such as cannon fire and buzzsaws to avoid becoming a protein-rich meal...\n\nClumzee includes eight thematic worlds -- all procedurally-generated. Each world grants you a unique ability:\n\n-- Factory: Use a magnet to collect coins from afar.\n-- Space:  Take off on a jetpack!\n-- Canyon: Trigger an avalanche to destroy all visible minions.\n-- Forest: Grow one leg back!\n-- Candyland: Can you find the mystery gift?\n-- Winter: Summon a freezing storm to slow time down.\n-- Castle: Destroy traps with powerful gloves.\n-- Spooky: Become an (almost) invulnerable ghost! Don\u2019t drop too low, though: The monster can still reach out and eat you...\n\nBut wait -- there\u2019s more! If you gather enough magic fireflies, you will be able to unlock more than 30 charming characters ranging from vikings to wizards -- and even \u201cClumzeed\u201d versions of popular characters like \u201cOzzee\u201d \n\nKEY FEATURES\n-- Unlock 30+ characters\n-- Experience 8 different worlds, and gain special abilities on each one\n-- Challenge your reflexes and get through minions, obstacles and projectiles without losing a limb\n-- Get a full serving of hand-drawn, cartoony graphics \n-- Share Clumzee with the whole family -- as long as no one is afraid of a cyclopean monster...\n\nPRICING & AVAILABILITY\nClumzee will be available on the App Store and Google Play next week (Thursday, February 4th). The game will be free to download and play -- and players wishing to customize their furball and level background can do so with in-app purchases.\n\nABOUT THE DEVELOPER\nTriple Hill was founded in January 2015 by three friends who previously worked with financial software for big investment banks, avionic test systems, and web authoring. However, the founders\u2019 true passion lay elsewhere: making the very games they wanted to play -- so they abandoned all those \u201cadult\u201d enterprises to pursue the dream of game development.
