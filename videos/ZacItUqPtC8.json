It features new and old characters as well as new tricks that you can pull off, though the levels are mostly streamlined and linear. The game supports two players and lots of action. It was developed with Easy Game Station. \n\nThe gameplay is mostly the same as SkyGunner. You can shoot regular fire, use special weapons and roll to evade attacks, though the latter two can cause you to overheat if you use them too often (which makes you temporarily vulnerable). You can also shop for extra weapons and a few neat extras. Enjoy.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZacItUqPtC8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZacItUqPtC8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZacItUqPtC8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZacItUqPtC8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZacItUqPtC8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Gunners Heart [\u30ac\u30f3\u30ca\u30fc\u30ba\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Check out collectibles for popular and obscure series that you know and love at Entertainment Earth!
