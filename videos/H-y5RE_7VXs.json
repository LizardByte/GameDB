{"id": "H-y5RE_7VXs", "snippet": {"title": "Fear Effect Inferno - PlayStation 2 Prototype", "description": "Fear Effect Inferno was meant to be the third installment in the Fear Effect series. Although it would be released after Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix, it would have followed the story after the original Fear Effect.\nInferno was originally announced as a PlayStation 2 sequel in 2001 and was meant to release in 2003. It was being developed by Kronos Digital Entertainment, but the company went under before they were able to finish it.\n\nInferno was cancelled in 2003. It is not entirely certain why Inferno was cancelled; IGN claimed the game \"was the first of EIDOS\u2019 victims to its more stringent quality assurance program\", suggesting EIDOS did not feel the game's quality was high enough. Other speculation is that the progress of Inferno was too slow. Kronos also apparently had difficulty trying to find another publisher.\n\nThe cancellation of Inferno was highly lamented by fans of the series. Hana's voice actress Wendee Lee also lamented the cancellation, calling it the \"game that got away\". As revealed by footage, a large chunk of Inferno was already complete, including dozens of its environmental backgrounds, voice acting, cutscenes, character design, etc.\n\nThe build you see here is from April 16th, 2003 and while not complete, this build happens to be very far into development.\n\nWe wouldn't hear from Hana until Square Enix released Fear Effect: Sedna for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch through their \"Square Enix Collective\" in 2018. Aside from the cancelled remake of the first game by MegaPixel Studio and Forever Entertainment, this might be the last time we will see Hana, as the IP remains under Square Enix (along with 90% of the Eidos IPs that didn't go with Crystal Dynamic and Eidos Montreal in their sale to Embracer Group). She can't seem to catch a break.\n\nFear Effect (C) Square Enix\n\n#ps2 #playstation2 #retrogames #retrogaming #eidos #cancelledgames #unreleasedgames #ps2prototype #playstation2prototype #feareffect #feareffectinferno #squareenix", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H-y5RE_7VXs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H-y5RE_7VXs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H-y5RE_7VXs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H-y5RE_7VXs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H-y5RE_7VXs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fear Effect Inferno - PlayStation 2 Prototype", "description": "Fear Effect Inferno was meant to be the third installment in the Fear Effect series.
