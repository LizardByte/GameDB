For hundreds of years, DARK has governed with wisdom and justice.\n\nBut now the unthinkable has happened: DARK is malfunctioning, and humanity is writhing in the grasp of a ruthless tyrant. DARK has built a fleet of robot warships to patrol the skies, and has created an army of mutant monsters to guard the underground bases from which he now terrorizes mankind. Lulled by hundreds of years of peace, the people of earth are defensless against the minions of DARK. But two brave young men, following an ancient legend of Greek mythology, have devised mechanical wings to bear them aloft in search of DARK's hidden fortress.\n\nArmed with the last remaining guns and missiles from a crumbling arsenal, you must fly them across the continents and oceans to seek out and destroy the cruel colossus!\n\nRobot warships and floating mines are a constant menace. And you must beware of the Giant Head, a grotesque stone face guarding the entrance to each of DARK's underground bases. If you approach too near to its gaping mouth, you will be sucked into the depths, where bizarre mutant monsters prowl the corridors.\n\nIf you fail, mankind is lost. Take wing, Legendary Soldiers!", "summary": "The NES port of Legendary Wings (Aresu no Tsubasa, \"The Wings of Ares\"), a fantasy-themed shoot-'em-up game released by Capcom as a coin-operated video game in 1986.
