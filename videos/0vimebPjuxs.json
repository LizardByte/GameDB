We have tested it but there are definitely still game-breaking glitches we need to fix. We are planning on leaving in most glitches to make the game hilarious but we need to remove some of them to make the game playable. We are planning on having 3-5 Alpha Versions before the full release which could be as early as The end of June to as late as The end of October or November.\n\nHave you ever wanted to roam around a Cartoon City and shoot things, blow crap up and go flying through the air at uncontrollable speeds?
