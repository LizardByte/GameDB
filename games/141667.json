But 4 June 1942 would see the tide turn, with three US Navy (USN) aircraft carriers waiting in ambush for the IJN near a tiny atoll whose name would become immortalized in history: Midway. \n \nBy the end of that day, the Japanese would lose four fleet carriers, and the course of the war would drastically change. \n \nNaval Campaigns: Midway covers not only this action but also other major carrier battles of World War Two, including Midway, Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz and Philippine Sea. \n \nCan you, as the fleet commander, sail your fleet and fly your air forces to victory, or will you be plunged beneath the deep blue waves never to be heard from again?", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/naval-campaigns-midway"}
