After Seth's escape, the S.I.N. corporation began another fighting tournament in order to draw out the most powerful fighters on Earth to complete the BLECE project.

It can be assumed that the only participants in the tournament are the playable characters in SFIV not including Seth.", "summary": "Street Fighter IV: Arena is a mobile fighting game based on the Street Fighter IV line of games.
