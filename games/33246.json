I'm Candice innit (that's me up in the photo, the biggest one as I am well important), and this is an Action RPG all about the incredibly trick lifestyle of me and my m8s!\n\nSo basically, I was going 2 get myself a new fake tan one day, when an evil singing sensation named Krystal turns up & startz causing havoc innit?!? Naturally I wasn't having that, and tried 2 stop her. Sadly I failed, and she stole my mate's tanning business.\n\nAll was lost. But then I remembered I have magical powers! I can shoot out magical bulletz in every direction, like some sort of human twin stick space ship or something! I used this knowledge to go on an adventure around the world to learn new magical powers, and ended up saving both the world and the tanning business!\n\nI had loads of fun along the way, did a bit of rapping (I am a well good rapper tbh), made new friends and had a few romances as well!!! Basically it was a right laugh, and u can experience it all in my new action rpg!!!!\n\nLove,\n\nCandice Xxxxx", "summary": "Candice DeBebe's Incredibly Trick Lifestyle is a saucy, sexy 3D action RPG about a young woman with a heart, voice and fake tan of gold.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/candice-debebes-incredibly-trick-lifestyle"}
