The tracklist is a mix between classic songs and new hits.\n\nIt's a karaoke game, giving points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time. There's a new mode called Harmony Duet, in which two players sing different lines of the same song, at the same time.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
