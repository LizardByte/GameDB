It is best known for the work of its art designer, Yoshitaka Amano, who had previously worked on the Final Fantasy series. The game was re-released on the Japanese PlayStation Network in 2011.

The first volume tells the story of Toxa Classico and the second volume is about Lacryma Christi. While each volume tells a complete story, the storylines intertwine in one major plot.\n\nEach \"chapter\" of both volumes revolves around phantoms, beings which can be summoned by certain humans using \"Kartia\", magical cards which create whatever is written on them, such as Fire or Water. The player must summon and control phantoms to fight for him/her, as well as managing Kartia supplies, casting magic with Kartia and creating weapons for the human combatants. Kartia cards can be combined to create more powerful spells or phantoms. While phantoms may die during battle, if a human party member dies, the game ends and the chapter must be restarted.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYBwvgKehtA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYBwvgKehtA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PYBwvgKehtA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Kartia:The World of Fate Official Trailer (1998, Atlus)", "description": "Kartia: The Word of Fate, known as Legend of Kartia in Europe and Rebus (\u30ec\u30d6\u30b9) in Japan, is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Atlus for Sony's PlayStation video game console in 1998.
