It was also later released by Ocean Software as a free game with Crash Magazine.\n\nControl is either with joystick or keyboard. gameplay is either single player against computer teams, or up to 8 players in a turn-based multiplayer mode.\n\nGames last about 5 minutes, and a timer counts this down, but stops to wait for penalties, free kicks, half-time, etc.\n\nThe player controls one team member at a time, and this player is shown by a halo above their head. If this player moves away from the ball too far or for too long, control is switched to the next nearest player on the football field. Players with highest score at the end win the match.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-soccer"}
