In the beginning of the game, Copper's father and two half brothers are slain by a dreadful rift hound, and Copper's own soul is torn from his body. As a result, Copper must not only retrieve his soul, but also settle the allegations now leveled against him as he was the only survivor. As the new sole heir to the Kingdom of Gladstone, many believe he orchestrated the whole incident with his father and brothers. Coupled with that is the fact that he is the result of an illicit affair between his father and a Dracoid barmaid\u2014a half-breed heir. He must not only deal with those issues but also seek out answers to help close new rifts that have appeared throughout the Lands.\n\nThe story unfolds over many portal worlds in which Copper has to retrieve lost pieces of the Shining Path (which shattered when the Draracle left the Gladstone world). The same Draracle has sent Copper on his quest to save his life and soul as well as to save his home and world.", "summary": "Coppert LeGr\u00e9, our 16 year old hero, is a bastard child of a prominent nobleman. But even the fact that he is a nephew of the king won\u2019t help him clear his name from the unjust charges of murdering his own kin. It\u2019s up to him to prove his innocence, regain the trust of the people of Gladstone, and face the evil, mystical force that\u2019s been menacing the land. It will take more than just courage to close the dimensional rifts that seem to be the source of the turmoil. Knowing that, Coppert sets off to find allies, avenge the death of his father and brothers, and save the kingdom itself!\n\nLands of Lore 3 offers diverse, RPG gameplay presented in first person perspective. It gives you a large amount of freedom, letting you choose your own path towards the game\u2019s ultimate goal, and to divert from it whenever you like to engage in one of the many side-quests. You can join one of four guilds as a fighter, cleric, thief, or mage. Gaining expertise in the skills associated with your class is as easy as putting them into use. You\u2019re not facing your destiny all by yourself, though. By your side you\u2019ll find a magical familiar-- a faithful companion in your journey. With its help you will survive--and thrive--in one of the most extensive RPG game worlds ever created.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lands-of-lore-iii", "videos": [{"id": 10634, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "G54A0Zsix80", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G54A0Zsix80", "title": "Lands of Lore 3 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G54A0Zsix80/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 24939, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "AaG2EdOne2Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaG2EdOne2Y", "title": "Lands of Lore 3 1999 PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AaG2EdOne2Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
