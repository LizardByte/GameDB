In 3K, you \"read\" the world as you play and interact with it, using thousands of intuitive verb commands. Want to wield that sword you just found? You would enter \"wield sword\". Want to take a closer look at that desk in the secret room you just found? You would enter \"examine desk\" and then maybe follow up with \"search desk\" for a closer look. To help you out in the game, all you need to do is type \"help\" to give you access to 3K's expansive help files. Beyond that, the same files are available online right here if you ever need them.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3kingdoms"}
