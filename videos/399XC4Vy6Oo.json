Been playing of and on for the past 2 months i think and its a lot of fun. Its pretty much War Robots only with better graphics, better ballance, better map layouts, better upgrade system, only one form of currentcy, no energy system what so ever and no game breaking p2w bots that make everything that came before it errelavent. So its pretty much perfect \ud83d\ude0d\n\nGot to admid i dont really get how the scoring system works. Most matchs i get a score of about 3000-5000, i thought this was a bad match as i wassent really paying attention and made many mistakes, only at the end found out that i scored 6000+. I have played much better and scored way lower \ud83d\ude02 \nIf anybody knows the formula for please let me know. Should be some comebination of damage, kills, positioning, dps and map controle. But not sure how it fits together\n\nGG AchapolkaZ \ud83d\ude03 You win \ud83d\ude09\n\n\nB.o.T (Battle of Titans) by Red Button Games https://battleoftitans.com\nOn android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rbuttongames.battlemechs\nOn ios: https://itunes.apple.com/app/b-o-t/id1231732980?mt=8\n\nSong: Fortress by Alter Bridge: https://www.youtube.com/user/alterbridge", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/399XC4Vy6Oo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/399XC4Vy6Oo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/399XC4Vy6Oo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/399XC4Vy6Oo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/399XC4Vy6Oo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "B.o.T: Battle of Titans | Nelly Sting T3, M.A.O.
