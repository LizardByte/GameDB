Pikmin 1\u00b2 aims to recreate the original Pikmin using the engine of Pikmin 2 as a base, along with loads of new improvements. It also features a whole second adventure starring Louie, and a complete randomizer with loads of options. Fully playable with a friend, and (for the most part) on a real console!\nThank you so much for your extended patience, and I hope this will be worth the wait. I cannot emphasize enough the amount of work that went into the creation of this, and I'm sure more videos will come over time to show that.\nAnd don't worry, I'll definitely be uploading the whole soundtrack here this time.\n\nYou can download it RIGHT NOW from my website, at https://pikhacker.github.io/\n\nIn the off chance that someone at Nintendo reads this, just know I've made 0$ from any of this, and I have no plans to make this for the Switch port, you can keep that one (Wii is possible though).\n\nMake sure you join my Discord if you haven't, you'll want people to share your playthrough with!\nhttps://discord.gg/WHSaSS5\n\nAnd follow me on these places:\nhttps://x.com/PikHacker\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/pikhacker.bsky.social", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aQ3U82Ulro0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aQ3U82Ulro0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aQ3U82Ulro0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aQ3U82Ulro0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Pikmin 1\u00b2 - Release Trailer", "description": "After nearly 4 years in development, my ultimate Pikmin project is complete!
