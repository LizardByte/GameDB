Fatigue is not simulated, but players can slow down their opponents after a series of large successful hits along with bruises, blooded and black eyes.\n\nThere are 21 different camera views to choose from, including first-person that will react to their fighters being hit (ex. if a player keeps getting hit in the eyes, the screen will start to blacken, simulating a swollen eye and if they take a hard enough punch they will actually see the game through double vision). Championship photos of each boxer is also show before a fight and commentary is provided by Tim Gammon.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/foes-of-ali", "videos": [{"id": 102161, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IiEXoBE6rqo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiEXoBE6rqo", "title": "Foes of Ali 3DO Gameplay EA Sports", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IiEXoBE6rqo/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3637, "name": "Slam Dunk"}]}
