There you get your first Pok\u00e9mon and can challenge the eight Leaders of the region to challenge the Champion. In your path will cross a completely untraditional Villain Team, what will they want? What will be their role in your adventure? They are up to something and you can be sure it won't be good.\n\nTraversing Nubia will be no easy task, full of story elements, quests, ruins, hidden treasures and colorful NPCs that will help you in your adventure (or not). If you are a person who enjoys exploring everything and looking for the hidden secrets of the game, you will find that the game is not easy.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-berilo--1", "videos": [{"id": 124154, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eHGkn_GiOds", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHGkn_GiOds", "title": "FINALLY!
