It featured a \"re-imagined\" disguised dark-haired B.J. Blazkowicz, retaining the unshaven look seen in Return to Castle Wolfenstein and dressed in civilian clothes rather than his usual military uniform.\n\nThe game mainly consists of the player shooting his way through hordes of different types of Nazis, ranging from normal soldier to ninjas. To deal with the large amount of enemies, the player has access to many typical WWII-weapons like the German MP40 or K98 rifle. In addition, during the course of the game he finds the medallion and learns four powers. While at first entering the Veil only allows him so see enemies more clearly and use strange flying creatures as bombs, he is later able to slow down time, surround himself with a protective shield or make himself stronger. However, the medallion's powers drain its energy, which needs to be refilled at power-spots that are nearly invisible in the real world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wolfenstein", "videos": [{"id": 34468, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VIao7j5e2-c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIao7j5e2-c", "title": "Wolfenstein (2009) -Part 3- *No Commentary*", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIao7j5e2-c/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119399, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "eKDIgycX1ww", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKDIgycX1ww", "title": "Wolfenstein Debut Trailer E3 2008 High Quality!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eKDIgycX1ww/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 5338, "name": "PA Voice"}, {"id": 2396, "name": "William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz"}, {"id": 3086, "name": "Elite Guard"}, {"id": 5767, "name": "Civilian Male"}, {"id": 10188, "name": "Pavel Cherny"}, {"id": 10158, "name": "Wehrmacht Infantry"}, {"id": 10161, "name": "Axis Soldier"}, {"id": 10162, "name": "Newsreel Voice"}, {"id": 10154, "name": "Wehrmacht Officer"}, {"id": 10156, "name": "SS Officer"}, {"id": 10165, "name": "Scienstist #2"}, {"id": 10170, "name": "Erik Engle"}, {"id": 10173, "name": "Hans Grosse"}, {"id": 10178, "name": "Resistance Medic"}, {"id": 10184, "name": "Airmen"}, {"id": 10189, "name": "Axis Field Command"}, {"id": 10152, "name": "Scribe"}, {"id": 10160, "name": "Axis High Command"}, {"id": 10163, "name": "Deathshead"}, {"id": 10166, "name": "General Zetta"}, {"id": 10168, "name": "Black Market Agent"}, {"id": 10169, "name": "Leonid Alexandrov"}, {"id": 10186, "name": "Jack Straw"}, {"id": 10187, "name": "Officer's Mistress"}, {"id": 10164, "name": "The Director"}, {"id": 10177, "name": "Hans Schmidt"}, {"id": 10179, "name": "Stefan Krieg"}, {"id": 10181, "name": "Resistance Soldier"}, {"id": 10182, "name": "Anton Krieg"}, {"id": 10185, "name": "Resistance Engineer Command"}, {"id": 10159, "name": "SS High Command"}, {"id": 10167, "name": "Golden Dawn Agent"}, {"id": 10171, "name": "Axis Medic"}, {"id": 10172, "name": "Scientist #1"}, {"id": 10174, "name": "Heavy Trooper"}, {"id": 10175, "name": "Resistance Field Mischa Pfister"}, {"id": 10176, "name": "Sergei Kovlov"}, {"id": 10180, "name": "SS Infantry"}, {"id": 10190, "name": "Axis Engineer"}, {"id": 3864, "name": "Assassin"}, {"id": 1197, "name": "Mechanic"}, {"id": 2569, "name": "Nurse"}, {"id": 4964, "name": "German Soldier"}, {"id": 2402, "name": "Caroline Becker"}, {"id": 10183, "name": "Kreisau Circle Agent"}]}
