It was downloadable for 80 points. Like all Picross games, the player must solve nonograms, where a picture is made by filling in squares on a grid within a time limit. Which squares are filled is determined by numbers on each row and column. The numbers indicate how many squares are filled in within that row or column. A wrong guess penalizes time. Too many wrong guesses, and the game is over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/club-nintendo-picross", "videos": [{"id": 27748, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "pE338kBMH40"}]}
