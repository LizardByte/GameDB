In Cargo Bridge your goal is to build bridges within each one of 24 levels, that allows your little workers to move heavy cargo (which include crates, safes, and even elephants) from one side of a valley to the other.\nWith every level, the difficulty increases. You have to build bridges across larger gaps, up and down inclines, and around obstacles in your path. You are also given access to new building materials. If you want to have a break from game levels, just enter the Challenge mode. Use money collected in game levels to build the longest bridge you can.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cargo-bridge"}
