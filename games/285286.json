The skill tree has been rebalanced so that skills that are underpowered and rarely used are now viable, allowing you to create many more builds than before. The end game has also been revamped so that more areas are worth exploring, allowing you to experience more varied content. These modifications combine the best ideas from both Diablo II and Path of Exile, two of the best ARPGs in existence.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/path-of-diablo"}
