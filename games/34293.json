Originally conceived as a utopia where a man would be entitled to all that he made without the interference of \"parasites\" by idealistic billionaire mogul Andrew Ryan.\n\nRapture has since decayed and festered from the infectious effects of civil war and anarchy, brought about by the very ideals it citizens and it's leader embrace. Aided by a sympathetic smuggler and a rogue geneticist, Jack salvages gene altering chemicals transforming himself into a superhuman, and uses his newfound powers and abilities as well as an arsenal of weapons to fend off the vicious hordes of psychotic mutants, security robots and armored supersoldiers that resulted from Rapture's unrest while given the choice to either rescue or lethally harvest the genetic material from Rapture's only citizens with a chance: the 10 year old \"Little Sisters\".\n\nAs Jack wanders through the condemning atmosphere of rapture, he treads towards a secret that for could shatter all that he has known forever.", "summary": "BioShock is a shooter unlike any other, loaded with unique weapons and tactics.
