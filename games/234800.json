From this point onwards, the Interstice, the space in between dimensions, is becoming unstable.

He knows the ultimate fate of the universe only too well, retaining his memories and power. Karluq may not be strong enough to affect these cycles on his own, but he can get help. Through the numerous Shatterings, by trial and error, Karluq recruits Travelers: Free Awarenesses merged with Vessels.\nPlayers find themselves in the Interstice as a Free Awareness, able to jump between multiple Vessels and travel through portals to other dimensions. Now they need to venture forth and make their Vessels strong enough to survive the upcoming Shatterings.", "summary": "Shatterpoint is an NFT-based, Free-to-Play, action RPG mobile game built on the Polygon blockchain.
