And from this people the author of the game chooses him to be the hero taking prominence and other legalities that a hero has, kiss a pussycat, participate in minigames, get strong punch bad guys, steal wallets of monsters, enter any house and talk to everyone as if no one cared that he invaded the house.", "summary": "This game is a Brazilian comedy game, an RPG produced in RPG Maker.
