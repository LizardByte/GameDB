He was abandoned at birth near the Asahi orphanage. Because of that event, Yuki strives for independence. He hates being a burden to anyone near him, but at the same time, he is afraid of being left alone. Moreover, ever since he can remember, he has had a strange ability that when he touches others, he can feel their emotion. Unable to control it, he's often made insensitive blunders in the past. He later meets a mysterious yet beautiful stranger who saves his life, but for some reason he feels like they've met before. While death looms and his ability gets stronger and stronger, a man who claims to be his older brother suddenly appears, which raises the question, \"What will Yuki do when he learns the truth?\"", "summary": "A PS2 visual novel based on the anime & manga series The Betrayal Knows My Name (Uragiri wa Boku no Namae wo Shitteiru).", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/uragiri-wa-boku-no-namae-wo-shitteiru-tasogare-ni-ochita-inori"}
