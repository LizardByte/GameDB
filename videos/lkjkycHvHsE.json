{"id": "lkjkycHvHsE", "snippet": {"title": "Accolade Comics:  Steve Keene, Private Spy (Story 1 - Rescue Professor Farad) (C64 Longplay)", "description": "Developed by Distinctive Software, and published by Accolade in 1987 for \u00a329.99.\n\nWell this is different! Accolade Comics was certainly an ambitious game, not to mention original and risky given its hefty price tag. Played through a series of comic panels and minigames, you inherit the role of Steve Keene, Private Spy.\n\nAt specific moments you are presented with choices, which often impacts upon subsequent scenes. There are also times when the option you choose makes no difference at all - therefore I've only included 1 response in such moments. Sometimes the path branches out and you must choose a specific route. However all routes reconnect, usually before one of the minigames. For this reason I reach the minigame via one route, then before playing it, rewind back to the initial route screen, and select an alternative path. Once all routes are completed it's onto the minigame. So there's some to-ing and fro-ing throughout just in case you wonder what's happening! Hopefully it'll make sense as you're watching, but I wanted to show absolutely everything the game has to offer. All death sequences are included too, including the minigames.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, and superbly animated. There are hundreds of different panels spanned across the 3 disks it came on (6 disk sides in total) There are also 49 different tunes! Clearly a huge amount of effort went into this release; nothing less than one would expect from a high quality publisher like Accolade.\n\nSo the gameplay itself? It's definitely funny in parts, and other times I haven't got a clue what's happening! Trying to follow the plot wasn't easy, thanks to the wackiness...but enjoyable nonetheless! It's also impossible to apply logic to distinguish between the correct response and that which leads to your demise; just pure trial and error. However the biggest issue is the speed - it's far too slow. The disk drive is continually being accessed, which badly affects the enjoyment level. The time taken to load panels generally ranges between 15 to 25 seconds. This is such a shame given the significant amount of time and effort spent developing this.\n\nSo, for you dear viewers, how is this now easier to watch? Well, days upon days were spent editing, in what can only be described as a monumental effort, and truly a labour of love!\n\nAll loading times were removed, and delays loading the panels. This left something that was now watchable. However the problem is that music plays throughout, and this is now all over the place! Therefore I split the output file into different parts; essentially every time a different piece of music played it was separated. I ended up with around 80 files. We're now left with files that contain the same audio, but totally disjointed, given the initial editing of loading times/delays. I therefore removed the audio completely, downloaded the SID file, extracted the required tune to WAV format (once found from the 49 available tunes!), and cropped the WAV file to ensure its length matched exactly the length of the video file). All files were then stitched together before being cropped and upscaled to 3840x2160. For this reason you won't discover a better, faster version of this game! Most of the minigames contain both music and SFX, so they were left untouched.\n\nThere are 2 separate storylines you get to choose from at the 02:08 mark.\nAlternative storyline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxKgO8PKPKA\n\nDesign:  Don Mattrick, Jeff Sember\nCoding:  Allan Johanson, Amory Wong, Jeff Sember, Kevin Pickell, Michael Smithson\nGraphics:  Dave Walters, Dean Griffiths, John Boechler, Theresa Henry, Tony Lee\nMusic / SFX:  Patrick Payne\n\n00:00 Title Screen / Credits\n01:36 Gameplay\n04:32 Path 1 To 1st Minigame (Climber)\n05:37 Path 1A To 1st Minigame (Climber)\n09:36 Path 1B To 1st Minigame (Climber)\n13:54 Path 2 To 1st Minigame (Climber)\n18:00 Path 2A To 1st Minigame (Climber)\n19:54 Path 2B To 1st Minigame (Climber)\n21:45 1st Minigame (Climber)\n23:00 Path 1 To Castle\n24:29 Path 2 To Castle\n26:13 Path 1 To 2nd Minigame (Swimmer)\n27:53 Path 2 To 2nd Minigame (Swimmer)\n29:32 2nd Minigame (Swimmer)\n31:47 Gameplay\n32:33 Path 1 To Professor Farad\n34:16 Path 2 To Professor Farad\n35:39 Gameplay\n37:24 Path 1 To 3rd Minigame (Conveyor Belt)\n38:39 Path 2 to 3rd Minigame (Conveyor Belt)\n41:27 3rd Minigame (Conveyor Belt)\n43:12 4th Minigame (Rail Car)\n44:38 5th Minigame (Bomber)\n47:15 End Sequence\n48:40 Hi-Score Entry", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lkjkycHvHsE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lkjkycHvHsE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lkjkycHvHsE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Accolade Comics:  Steve Keene, Private Spy (Story 1 - Rescue Professor Farad) (C64 Longplay)", "description": "Developed by Distinctive Software, and published by Accolade in 1987 for \u00a329.99.\n\nWell this is different!
