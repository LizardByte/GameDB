Apparently, it\u2019s a lost NES port of the old PROTO DERE arcade game which was showcased in 2017 for the AppSir launch party. I couldn\u2019t find information about the game in any of the listings. It\u2019s either an obsure bootleg, or a pre-production cart that never made it to release. Despite the internal damage on the game\u2019s circuit board, I was able to rip the ROM so you guys can have a look at it. It\u2019s filled with glitches, but I\u2019m certain I didn\u2019t corrupt the ROM. That\u2019s how it played when I got it working on my dusty old NES, so maybe that\u2019s why it was never released.\u201d\n\nOther users expressed their excitement for the game\u2019s discovery with some inquiring about the possibility of buying the physical cartridge. Some users have even claimed to have played the unreleased NES game before and have started sharing their nostalgic experiences. However, the group has now been archived as some of its users have been found dead.\n\nThis game is not for the faint of heart!\n\nIn 'PROTO DERE .NES', you play as a character trying to escape a burning underground mine. Use your athletic prowess to jump over fires and climb over ladders to reach the exit. From the ashes of dread, a new life is born.\n\n- High Quality Graphics\n- Four Channel Sound\n- Unique Characters\n- Endless Fun\n\nDo you have what it takes to survive?
