It was based on two earlier black-and-white coin-operated arcade games produced by Atari. Combat had color graphics and numerous gameplay variations. The 27 game modes featured a variety of different combat scenarios, including tanks, biplanes, and jet fighters. The tank games had interesting options such as bouncing munitions (\"Tank-Pong\") and invisibility. The biplane and jet games also allowed for variation, such as multiple planes per player and an inventive game with a squadron of planes versus one giant bomber.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 15436, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "GuCXiz45i9k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCXiz45i9k", "title": "Classic Game Room - COMBAT review for Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GuCXiz45i9k/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 15437, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "uk7fIrXpW8o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk7fIrXpW8o", "title": "Classic Game Room - TANK-PLUS review for Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uk7fIrXpW8o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
