The arc contains seven missions, culminating in an intense battle to protect the FHS Justice and its inhabitants from assimilation. \nThe character creator customization options in Ship of Heroes are the best of any MMORPG. Complex and unusual game mechanics keep the game varied, interesting, and challenging. Housing, harvesting, crafting, and trading are included in the game.\nShip of Heroes is a superhero sci-fi MMORPG with an original story. In the 25th century, you are defending humanity as a citizen on the Free Human Ship Justice, a 20 miles-long generation ship traveling the galaxy. Players start their journey on the first ship level, which includes Apotheosis City and the Engineering levels.
