Though it is listed as one of Doomworld's Top 100 WADs of All Time in the year 1999, its release on the idgames archive dates it at 17 March of 2000. It is known primarily for being composed of short, fairly straightforward levels, a possible progenitor of Erik Alm's Scythe.\n\nDemonfear is a compilation of small episodes released by Windsor between 1995 and 1999, known otherwise as Demonfear 1-6. An early, alternate version of Demonfear 6 was partially complete in 1997, but Windsor donated the maps to Requiem when the project had stagnated due to a handful of authors failing to provide maps for slots they had claimed. The compiler dropped Windsor's levels into the previously vacant slots so that his old Demonfear 6 MAP26, 27, and 28 appear as Requiem's MAP20, 26, and 25, respectively. Windsor would go on to create a new Demonfear 6 and then compile his own megawad.\n\nDemonfear comes with a text file that describes in detail the story of the megawad on a level-by-level basis. The plot involves another surprise demon invasion of Earth; mirroring the action of Doom II, the protagonist travels through various military complexes and into a city, eventually entering Hell itself in what is apparently a twisted facsimile of the normal world.\n\nIn 2019, Doomworld user P41R47 made a MIDI pack for Demonfear, which also includes miscellaneous enhancements for the intermission, text screens, and ending.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/demonfear"}
