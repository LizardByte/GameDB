Your goal is to shoot the circles that are bouncing around. You aim automatically and shoot at the current aim position. Hold a button to shoot. The circles break up into smaller ones and you have to shoot them until they can no longer be broken down.\n\nThe game is over when you touch any circle.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/b-cannon"}
