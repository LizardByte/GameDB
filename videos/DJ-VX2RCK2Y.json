The two guys are related to another game (and which had much more stellar translation, as I already played it, just will be made and uploaded later, tho true ending only.). This run probably almost has everything (or really has everything), I'm unsure if I missed something, and checks at both endings.\n\nOverall, without spoiling too much, as I want you to experience the game for yourself. This game is stellar in everything. BGMs are bangers, it is really funky. The CGs and Arts are also amazing, especially the animation. Puzzles are really low difficulty, and I enjoyed. I guess the only one I couldn't figure out, is the station travel one, and unfortunately had to look it up. I guess maybe I'm not good sometimes in figuring out in some of the puzzles, but at the same time, it might still have to do with some of the incomplete translations. And speaking of that.... I still think the translation is at least decent, ignoring my words about it at the end. And I think at least, it represents as well the character. Tho I'm not good at analyzing at times at cultural flavoring in translations, but at least I know one they did well, if I noticed it, kind of like when I playthroughed I Can't Be Human, and I think SHTDN also has as well. Well I'm unsure if there are missed ones on this one, so I'm sorry in advanced about this.\n\nStill nevertheless, I understand what's going on in the game at least. But yeah, the translation still needs more work. So we will see if there will be a Replaythrough of this one day.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy!\n\nHymeji on the Side of the vids by @/anya_nightmares", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DJ-VX2RCK2Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DJ-VX2RCK2Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DJ-VX2RCK2Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DJ-VX2RCK2Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DJ-VX2RCK2Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Banana shakes and exorcism action] GHOST SIX (v1.03 ENG Translation) (No Commentary)", "description": "[Fair Warning, I'm seeing mixed comment/s about the translation of this game in the game page comments.
