It contains the entire Dune 2 campaign with cutscenes but allows for any resolution, skirmishes allied or against humans and AI players, and even contains the extra sub houses Fremen, Sardaukar, and Mercenary guild from Super Dune 2 in the Skirmish modes.\n\nCONTENTS:\n- 0:00 Tour of cool features\n- 9:45 Skirmish Game\n- 30:44 Map Editor\n\nABOUT:\nDune Legacy is a truly incredible project! The AI has 6 levels of difficulty starting with 3 comparable to Dune 2 and then 3 very super hard ones. They've also implemented some badly needed improvements from later RTS games like allocating keyboard numbers to army groups along with selecting multiple units by dragging a box around them! Recently the Legacy team have updated the game to include the Super Dune 2 Classic Campaigns and have even upgraded their briefings (eg you now get proper Sardaukar briefings instead of the old Harkonnen ones just like in eXtended edition) and have developed a cool HD graphics scaler that sharpens textures and smoothes out edges of everything while still retaining the classic look of Dune 2, looks very cool!\n\nLegacy also comes with an excellent and easy to use Dune 2 map editor which has resulted in a lot of awesome maps created by fans and added to the game. I quite like playing skirmishes as the Sardaukar as they get the games best infantry and tanks, allying with the bad guys and battling it out against everyone else!\n\nNOTES:\n- I haven't played Dune 2 in over 10yrs so I suck a bit sorry lol.\n- Dune 2 Dynasty HD project doesn't have as many features but is a FAR more accurate Dune 2 reconstruction so if Legacy's AI & gameplay annoy you then try Dynasty here: https://youtu.be/4LB1ebNYZzI?list=PLZqnaGtTZxFYhzg4kOt6bN4qD02wbuGI9\n\nLINKS:\nDune 2 Legacy homepage:\nhttp://dunelegacy.sourceforge.net/website/\n\nDune 2 Legacy HD project Multiplayer 3 Players vs 3 AIs video:\nhttps://youtu.be/E3AM4h6Or6M?list=PLZqnaGtTZxFYhzg4kOt6bN4qD02wbuGI9 \n\nTo see more D2Legacy and Dune related info, downloads, pictures & video visit my Dune Games Webpage here:\nhttp://blakessanctum.x10.mx/Games/DuneGames/\n\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-\nWelcome To Blake's Sanctum! :)\nIntro: https://youtu.be/EsSfHqBz2IU\n\nIf you wish to donate or support my work:\nYoutube Subscription: https://youtube.com/c/BlakesSanctum?sub_confirmation=1\nPaypal Donation: https://paypal.me/blakessanctum\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/blakessanctum\n-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FJtU428Z5c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FJtU428Z5c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FJtU428Z5c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FJtU428Z5c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FJtU428Z5c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dune 2 HD Remake (Legacy Project) Tour & Skirmish", "description": "INTRO:\nDune Legacy is your ultimate Dune 2 remake option for modern systems.
