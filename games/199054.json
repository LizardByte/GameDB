The marble is only indirectly controlled by tilting the level with the mouse to make it move in that direction, taking inertia into account.\n\nThere are 14 levels in total, with most of them containing hazards such as holes, ice, fire, glue, or dangerous creatures. In addition to items that need to be collected on the way, some levels require the use of teleporters or special items that add features like different size and transparency.\n\nThe levels are timed but there is no time limit to complete them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spinoff"}
