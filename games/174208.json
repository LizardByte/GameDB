Step into the chaos of a magical England at the end of the Third Crusade. Maid Marian hides breathless amidst the brambles after the sack of her father\u2019s castle; Little John charges a bodyweight in gold to cross a lonely log; and Will Scarlet holds court in a brokedown tower surrounded by trees as tall as the sky, waiting for a king who will never come. The time is ripe, a spark is lit \u2013 from the ashes of your home, from the shadow of anonymity, step into legend. You are Robin Hood.\n\nStory and strategy collide as your reputation spreads and Merry Men join your band: Build and expand a base in the hidden deeps, manage your earnings from raids on tax collectors, and prepare for the coming of the Sheriff of Nottingham. There is no sure and easy path to victory, no one decision that will save your resistance; will you fall beneath the Sheriff\u2019s boot heel, or will you build a movement to last the ages? The choice is yours.", "summary": "Nocked! is a lushly-illustrated, text-driven role-playing game playable for minutes or hours at a time.
