{"id": "Xz99maNBLOM", "snippet": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [275] Zool", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nClassic Amiga game ported to the Mega-Drive. 50 fps PAL version played as I found the 60fps ntsc version too damned fast.  Other YTube vids use it do you can compare.\n\nThe longplay could certainly be a lot shorter, but I have tried to show where the big point bonuses are and some extra lives. It should be all of them, but I cant say for definite that I have found them all. I could only find the bonus mission once, and that mission is rock hard even if its only 30 seconds long. The collectible is shown by a Ship power-up in world 3-2.\n\nWorld 2-4 also has a bonus level by playing a specific set of notes on the first keyboard you encounter. I have accessed it before, but couldn't do so when recording this longplay. There is no collectible in this version that I can find which give out the note sequence.\n\nEDIT: I have since found a bonus level near the end of 2-1.  There is a High jump power-up on top of a speaker shortly after picking up the large hi-fi.  use it to jump up and left into a hidden bonus round.\n\nI have longplayed this to compare with Amiga AGA and snes versions of the game. This is a good effort for the mega drive. Its fast and gfx are very reasonable although lacking colour in certain elements. Some transparency is also used in foreground objects which looks nice and is unique to this version.  Try dropping the video to 240p to better simulate the crt blurring effect and look past youtubes terrible compression artifacts.  This version also retains the chupa chups branding in the background, but no collectables bearing the logo.\n\nThe level order matched the Amiga CD32 version including the edition of plant world, and just like that version it is missing the original zool ending and instead sets you up for the Sequel which never appeared for this platform. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xz99maNBLOM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xz99maNBLOM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xz99maNBLOM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xz99maNBLOM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [275] Zool", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nClassic Amiga game ported to the Mega-Drive. 50 fps PAL version played as I found the 60fps ntsc version too damned fast.
