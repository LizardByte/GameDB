The story is that long ago the mighty Infinity Sword was shattered and nor Dr. Doom and his minions are seeking the pieces, the Infinity Fractals. Each fractal is immensely powerful and gives whoever possesses it special powers. Super Hero City is in danger and only the Super Hero Squad can save the day!\n\nWith a story line like that the stage is set for lots of fighting, though the enemies can be targeted so players can throw objects and use long range attacks. Player(s) can either work their way through the story in Adventure Mode, or fight with other players in Battle Mode. The two modes of play offer different types of game-play and features:\n\nAdventure Mode: This is for two players and gives the player(s)\u2022Six campaigns to recover the Infinity Fractals and gain new and super powers.\n\u2022The chance to play as one of these characters: the Hulk, Falcon, Iron Man, Thor, Silver Surfer, or Wolverine.\n\u2022Two unlockable campaigns featuring Spider-Man and Dr. Doom.\n\u2022Co-operative play.\n\u2022Unlockable characters, battle areas and costumes.\nBattle Mode: This allows up to four players. \u2022Fight as a villain or super hero.\n\u2022Choose from over 20 characters including Avengers, Fantastic Four, and the X-Men.\n\u2022Use and create combination attacks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marvel-super-hero-squad"}
