{"id": "IRxOwmRpOgc", "snippet": {"title": "Zen: Intergalactic Ninja (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Konami's 1993 NES game, Zen: Intergalactic Ninja. \n\nPlayed through on the normal difficulty level. \n\nZen: Intergalactic Ninja is based on an eco-friendly comic character (think Captain Planet but much less lame) in this extremely well-made platformer that rivals the quality of most of Konami's late-gen license based titles (TMNT3, Monster in My Pocket, Bucky O'Hare, etc). If there was any question of their command over the NES hardware, let this game put it to rest. The graphics are pretty mind-blowing on this cart - even though flicker runs rampant in nearly every scene, the attention to animation and detail isnt typical at all of NES games. It might not look quite as consistently good as Little Samson, but it's absolutely a top-tier presentation. Some of these enemies are huge, the cinematics look great, and the perspective shifts are pretty impressive, especially when combined with the speed of the minecar stage. The music is kickass as well, with heavy bass and drum samples that really punch up just about every track.\n\nZen has quite a few moves that he can do and is quite responsive, and though the game is quite short and fairly easy (well, at least for a Konami-produced game), this might well be a case in showing how less is more - there's no filler at all. And that last boss fight and the ending - completely epic. \n\nSo, if you want a super-polished NES title with huge production values and classic gameplay, this is a great bet. If that's not your thing, well, I guess the NES has plenty of mediocre titles that might satisfy you more.\n____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IRxOwmRpOgc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IRxOwmRpOgc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IRxOwmRpOgc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IRxOwmRpOgc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Zen: Intergalactic Ninja (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Konami's 1993 NES game, Zen: Intergalactic Ninja. \n\nPlayed through on the normal difficulty level. \n\nZen: Intergalactic Ninja is based on an eco-friendly comic character (think Captain Planet but much less lame) in this extremely well-made platformer that rivals the quality of most of Konami's late-gen license based titles (TMNT3, Monster in My Pocket, Bucky O'Hare, etc).
