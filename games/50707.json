All it takes is a Wii Remote controller for a simple, yet fulfilling connection with nature. There are 12 animal types in total (four sold separately as add-on content). Select your favorites and nurture them to adulthood. Feeding them, petting them, and cleaning up their messes is a great way to form a lasting bond. Each animal's personality will change depending on how you take care of them. Watch them get spoiled, turn into over-eaters, and more as they grow on a daily basis. Some animals will even have a baby on occasion, and once it's born, you've got another mouth to feed. Game time passes much more quickly than real time, and the different animal types are active at various hours--some during the day, and some at night. Sometimes it's fun to just kick back and watch what they do. So what are you waiting for? It's time to create your own personal zoo.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-zoo"}
