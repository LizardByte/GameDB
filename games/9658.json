The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 3831, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "v6CVBQaedqM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6CVBQaedqM", "title": "Town of Salem Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6CVBQaedqM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 28830, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TfsKkRxcNwQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfsKkRxcNwQ", "title": "Town of Salem - iOS and Android Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TfsKkRxcNwQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
