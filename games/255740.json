There's no complex system of club types, swing meters or wind direction here. You just tap, drag, and release to take a shot.\nEvery day a new course appears. See if you can beat par on each hole, and how low you can score through all 18. If you do well, you may even make the high score board for that day. If not, there's always tomorrow.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/island-golf"}
