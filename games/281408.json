It makes use of the same engine as Shenzhen's other RPGs, though it attempts to incorporate the active battle system of the original game. Much content was cut to fit what could be fit onto the cartridge, and the game still does not continue past the battle with Magus, who is nearly impossible to defeat.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shi-kong-zhi-lun", "videos": [{"id": 104079, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "u_sRQlV-lBk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_sRQlV-lBk", "title": "Chrono Trigger  (Famicom bootleg) (Longplay) - Part 1: Saving Marle", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_sRQlV-lBk/sddefault.jpg"}]}
