When a violent event disrupts that peace, Ellie embarks on a relentless journey to carry out justice and find closure. As she hunts those responsible one by one, she is confronted with the devastating physical and emotional repercussions of her actions.", "summary": "The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game set five years after the events of The Last of Us. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. They can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game intermittently switches control between Ellie and Abby, and also briefly Joel in the opening sequence. The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii", "videos": [{"id": 16542, "name": "Discussion", "video_id": "gF1EQAtaZEo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF1EQAtaZEo", "title": "The Last of Us Part II - PlayStation Experience 2016: Panel Discussion | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gF1EQAtaZEo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16543, "name": "PSX 2016 Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "muniWyT4vTg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muniWyT4vTg", "title": "The Last of Us: Part II - PSX 2016 Announcement Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/muniWyT4vTg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16588, "name": "PGW17 Trailer", "video_id": "ArAdN5ilVRs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArAdN5ilVRs", "title": "The Last of Us: Part II - PGW17 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ArAdN5ilVRs/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16589, "name": "PGW17 Interview Trailer", "video_id": "HfxOtvmpsM8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfxOtvmpsM8", "title": "The Last of Us: Part II - PGW17 Interview Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HfxOtvmpsM8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 20624, "name": "E3 2018 Trailer", "video_id": "jziBvTUdCB0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziBvTUdCB0", "title": "The Last of Us: Part II - E3 2018 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jziBvTUdCB0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 30066, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "II5UsqP2JAk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II5UsqP2JAk", "title": "The Last of Us Part II \u2013 Release Date Reveal Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/II5UsqP2JAk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 33735, "name": "4K Trailer", "video_id": "t-BUJoqZRsw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-BUJoqZRsw", "title": "THE LAST OF US 2 Trailer 4K (NEW 2020) TLOU2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-BUJoqZRsw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35943, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mRj3B3GY9KM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRj3B3GY9KM", "title": "The Last of Us Part II - Inside the Story | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mRj3B3GY9KM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
