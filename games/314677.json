The main difference lies in presentation, with higher-quality music and significantly more detailed graphics. The gameplay is mostly unchanged, with the exception of the possibility to equip four options on the player-controlled ship (as opposed to only two in the original version) and a few tweaks to secondary weapons and power-ups. Two new stages and four boss enemies have been added to this version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nemesis-90-kai", "videos": [{"id": 124077, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CDl26nhhLTM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDl26nhhLTM", "title": "VG Museum: Nemesis '90 Kai (X68000)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CDl26nhhLTM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
