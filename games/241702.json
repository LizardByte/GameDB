At the top of each column, and at the side of each row, you will notice a set of one or more numbers. These numbers tell you the runs of red balls in that row/column. So, if you see '10 1', that tells you that there will be a run of exactly 10 red balls, followed by one or more blank cell, followed by a single red ball. There may be more red balls before/after this sequence.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pixpuzzle"}
