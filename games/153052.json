The town is what you would a commuter town, and is a nice, quiet refuge from the hustle and bustle of urban cities.\n\nThere are no skyscrapers to be found, nor any big-box stores. Instead the townscape is comprised of houses and apartments. It has a nice, relaxing ambience, and there's a certain nostalgia that fills Takeru's chest when he looks out his window at the two. The only tall buildings so to speak of are the buildings around the station, or the apartment towers along the redeveloped riverbank.\n\nHere one doesn't need to look up to see the beautiful, blue sky. When the sun sets in the evening, the mountains in the distance, and the hill road leading up to school become tinged in a crimson hue. If you ever want to know what time it is, all you need to do is check the sun.\n\nOur story begins in late September. The time of the year when an end to the blistering summer heat is finally within sight.\n\nIt was a normal day for Takeru. He was leisurely walking down the riverbank with his friends as he always does, just as the sun was about to set. It was all part of the same daily routine he was used to. But tiny changes can cause that daily walk home to change, in ways that may one day come to tell a story of love.\n\nThey were tiny indeed, nothing special. Just the small, daily happenings that we each experience in our daily lives.\n\nIt could be the moment his eyes met hers. It could be the moment their hands touched when trying to grab a book. It could be the moment she smiled at him, for the very first time--\n\nThose tiny, minuscule moments that occur randomly throughout our daily lives can be the start of magical things to come.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/meltymoment", "videos": [{"id": 51412, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iyuHrzzKlIk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyuHrzzKlIk", "title": "Ceui - Melty Moment - Opening Movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iyuHrzzKlIk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
