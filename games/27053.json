A universe of possibilities is open to your species as it takes its first fitful steps into the great unknown. Here you can turn your back on the divisive politics of the home planet. Here you can build something new. Here you can unify your people and build that perfect society.\n\nOnly in space can you build Utopia.\n\nUtopia is the first major expansion for Stellaris, the critically acclaimed science fiction grand strategy game from Paradox Development Studio. As the title suggests, Utopia gives you new tools to develop your galactic empire and keep your people (or birdfolk or talking mushrooms) happy. Push your species further out into the galaxy with new bonuses for rapid exploration or stay closer to home before striking out against all who would challenge you.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stellaris-utopia", "videos": [{"id": 11967, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "svnH2mmONiw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svnH2mmONiw", "title": "Stellaris - Utopia, Reveal Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/svnH2mmONiw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
