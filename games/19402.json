At the Pet Rescue Center, kids can wait for rescue missions, explore, or tend to pets in the Care Center. Missions involve finding lost pets in different environments and using problem-solving skills to entice scared animals or retrieve those trapped in trees. Successful missions earn printable awards. Rescued pets recover at the center before returning home, where kids can nurse them back to health, give them treats, and play with them in the playrooms. Special mini-games for each type of animal add an extra layer of fun.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-pet-rescue", "videos": [{"id": 94674, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0MNO853spYE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MNO853spYE", "title": "Barbie Pet Rescue", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MNO853spYE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
