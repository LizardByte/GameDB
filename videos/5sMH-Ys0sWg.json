If you like what you see, join me every week as I live stream my progress right here on this channel!\n\nThis trailer is actually an updated version of the trailer I submitted (but never uploaded) to Kaze's F3 Presentation.\n\nMusic in this trailer was created by Badub, make sure to check out his other custom BK music here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZdpOhL2oFU\n\n-----\n\nSome frequently asked questions:\n\nQ: When will the game be released?\nA: I work on the game when I have the time, I have other priorities before BKR. So I can't even give a rough estimate - don't expect it any time soon!\n\nQ: When will you release a demo?\nA: I already have! You can check it out here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T61vu6l5mI\n\nQ: Why isn't this more like Banjo Tooie?\nA: The game runs on the Banjo-Kazooie engine. Banjo's Backpack, the level editor I use, is only compatible with this game.\n\nQ: Can I help with music?\nA: I work on this project alone, but I will need someone to help with music in the future. BUT, I'd like to look for help in the music department when I'm comfortable with the amount of work I have done. Please don't contact me just yet, I'm not ready to start looking!\n\nQ: Will this run on the original Nintendo 64?\nA: Hopefully! But this is not my goal so I will not be optimizing the game to run on the original hardware.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sMH-Ys0sWg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sMH-Ys0sWg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sMH-Ys0sWg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sMH-Ys0sWg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sMH-Ys0sWg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Banjo-Kazooie Returns - (Full Custom Mod) Trailer #7", "description": "Join the BKR Discord | https://discord.gg/pAfbjB2\n\nThe latest trailer for Banjo-Kazooie Returns, a fan-made rom hack I've been working on for over five years.
