The game is heavily inspired by 8bit and 16bit hits of the 90s, but developed with the modern player in mind. Tons of great animation, hand-drawn backgrounds, variety of in-game situations and powerful soundtrack! Red Rust is only several hours long, but it is packed with boss battles, huge mechanical beasts, crazy plot twists and lots of fighting.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/red-rust", "videos": [{"id": 56603, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "wjA0POwUBF8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjA0POwUBF8", "title": "Red Rust Demo Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wjA0POwUBF8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 49091, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0O8qeemXF0s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O8qeemXF0s", "title": "RED RUST / Trailer HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0O8qeemXF0s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
