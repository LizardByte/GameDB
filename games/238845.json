Playing it will require careful planning, improvisation, and correspondence with your city's constituents to fix problems and make everyone happy. You can personally telephone residents to hear their opinions, or even tune in on various TV channels to survey Tokio. Every little counts: your political party platform, the techno-industrial automation needed to power Tokio & its economy, and even space tourism via space shuttles and other programs\u2014among others!
