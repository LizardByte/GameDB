You\u2019ll never know what you find, who you meet and where you end up.\n\nHyperdrive Inn is full of surprises, and who says you can\u2019t have fun while the world is coming to an end? After all, there are only two things that are infinite: the hotel and human stupidity.\n\nFeaturing plenty of oddball humor in the vein of those good old LucasArts titles, the world of Hyperdrive Inn is filled with references to popular culture and classic adventure games. It\u2019s like living your childhood again but trapped inside an ever-shifting monster that some people call a hotel.
