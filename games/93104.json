The city regulations declare, however, that the rip-down job can't proceed until all the items within had been removed. \n \nAs an adventurer hired by the demolitions contractor to kleptomaniacially clear out this mansion, you must engage in wordplay in order to gather all the items inside. It is not necessary to think of puns, cliches, or homonyms, however, as has been the case with previous logological interactive fiction. The puzzles in Ad Verbum are of a different\u2014and perhaps even unique\u2014nature."}
