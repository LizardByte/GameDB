This time, he is called to investigate the disappearance of a film crew at a two-bit ghost town known by the name of Slaughter Gulch located in the Mojave Desert in California. Among the disappeared crew is Emily Hartwood, Jeremy Hartwood's niece from the original. Edward soon discovers that a curse has gripped the town, and an evil cowboy from the Badlands named Jed Stone is the villain who is responsible for the crew's disappearance. Lurking around town are many trigger-happy sharpshooters, deranged prospectors, and bloodthirsty lost souls whom Edward must ward off with both his strength and his wit.", "summary": "Edward Carnby looked up. An Eagle was visible as it skimmed the light of the moon. Slaughter Gulch, never had a ghost town been so aptly named! The hot sierra wind blew open the swing door to the old saloon bar... A scream echoed through the night air... The old Navajo witch doctor was right. Emily Hartwood's life was at risk. A sudden crack... A Winchester being loaded... Carnby drew his six-shooter... Empty!\n\nThe hell of his boot split into pieces. He had to find cartridges... Quickly! The moon began to cloud over. Carnby rushed out. His shoulder hit against a stone object. The statue of Jed Stone towered above him. He felt the second bullet tear into his back... Slowly, he tumbled into the darkness... Alone, Alone in the Dark!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 10779, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "v0oiDnGaM4Y"}, {"id": 17742, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "4xeTETIa2gA"}]}
