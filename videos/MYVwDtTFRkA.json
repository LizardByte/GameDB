We found ourselves dreaming about a new game that could combine those two passions, a new game on the market that could satisfy our thirst of innovation. Given our past working and gaming experiences, we decided to take matters into our own hands to create the motorcycle simulation game we always wished for.\n\nRELEASE 2021\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe roots of TDR have been intertwined from the very beginning with the most important academic papers regarding motorcycle dynamics (eg. V. Cossalter). We worked really hard to understand the physics regarding motorcycles to be able to replicate it as accurately as possible in this project. This is not pulled out of the air: everything is validated by industrial simulation formulas, such as Magic Formula by Pacjecka, which we used as foundation to create our tire physical model. Our intention was to build a game that could give an experience as faithful to real life as it can be.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are fully committed to creating a game that could offer the maximum realism available, but that could also be enjoyed with a simple Joypad and without frustration. TDR surely isn\u2019t an Arcade game, which means that you will make some mistakes. A late braking, a wobble, an unwanted wheelie, one too much skid will ruin your lap. Thanks to a learning curve within anyone\u2019s\u2019 reach, the more you will race the more you will learn your limits and become a better rider with each lap. We surely want TDR to be the peak of the simulative experience, but also something to have lots of fun with! \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow us\n\nDiscord server\nhttps://discord.gg/5wytnM254v\n\nFacebook Page\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TrackDayR\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/trackdayr\n\nTwitch \nhttps://www.twitch.tv/trackdayr\n\nSteam Please \"FOLLOW\" and \"ADD TO YOUR WISHLIST\"\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1511630/TrackDayR/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYVwDtTFRkA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYVwDtTFRkA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYVwDtTFRkA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYVwDtTFRkA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYVwDtTFRkA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "TrackDayR - Early Access Trailer", "description": "TrackDayR - Early Access trailer \n\nRELEASE ON 17th MARCH 2021!\n\n\n---------------------------------\nWE ARE ON STEAM!
