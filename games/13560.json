Using the motion-sensing SIXAXIS controller, the player tilts a bathtub filled with water to move a rubber duck around the tub. There are many pitfalls to avoid, such as jumping out of the tub and toy sharks which will try to eat the smaller ducks. Online leaderboards track users fastest times, and allow users to see the replays of those fastest times. The game has three levels: fun, tricky, and tough. Each of these levels has 20 tubs that one needs to beat to proceed to the next level.\n\nIn August 2008 the game received an update named 3.00. In the update, there are now 9 different ducks to unlock, monthly leaderboards and an online store.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 5905, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "v6e-dCHLGh0"}]}
