Instead of being a complete reworking of the game, this is essentially \u201cVanilla HeartGold+\u201d, with versions exclusives fixed, trade evolutions rectified, evolution items and berries both renewable, and alternatives provided for the more luck-based encounters. A good-sized amount of dialogue has been changed, as well as a handful of NPCs being added to explain some of the more obscure mechanics, not to mention superbosses to test your mettle. The core plot is identical to vanilla HeartGold. If you want to go back to HeartGold, whether to revisit memories or make new ones, this mod is meant to help make them a little more vivid.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 78717, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7-AkJrS11F8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-AkJrS11F8", "title": "Refined Gold (Pokemon HGSS rom hack)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7-AkJrS11F8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
