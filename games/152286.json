You are left alone to fight for your survival. With only marginal supplies you have to fight off of the cold, the wildlife and find your way to an abandoned ranger station in hope to be able to call for help.\nWhile you haven\u2019t suffered any injuries during the fall, you lost your backpack and hence most of your gear and supplies. You will need to find shelter, find some food and rest. Then it\u2019s about making your way to an old ranger station to call for rescue.\nSounds easy enough, doesn\u2019t it? It is, except for the supplies you are going to need for the trip, the weather, the freezing cold, not to mention the wildlife. The goal of the game is to survive. To prepare enough to make the trip to the ranger station and to deal with all the surprises along the journey.", "summary": "Dive into the ultimate winter survival experience and see if you can survive long enough for rescue to arrive.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/winter-survival-simulator", "videos": [{"id": 51044, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VS7aYn0zsac"}, {"id": 51045, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "N099190SwqI"}]}
