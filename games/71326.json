Making things more difficult for long-range planning, the asteroids are all moving at their own particular speeds, so the planet next door may be on the other side of the system a hundred turns from now!\n\nNow that your people have emerged from their long cryo-sleep, you must resume the old struggles against rival guilds...all the while trying just to survive in the strange new Malkari system.", "themes": [{"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "videos": [{"id": 60090, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9v6v-vGhrlk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v6v-vGhrlk", "title": "Malkari - Official Trailer - 1998", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9v6v-vGhrlk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 60091, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CaisQ_EN3cQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaisQ_EN3cQ", "title": "Malkari (1999) Windows 98 Qemu", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CaisQ_EN3cQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
