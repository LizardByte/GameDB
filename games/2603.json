It was widely successful, and resulted in two follow-ups, many copy-cat games, and a remake for Steam on PC. The only significant criticism the game received was the weak chess AI, as it was not until the mid 1990s that chess ai began to consistently win against strong opponents.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-chess", "videos": [{"id": 17813, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "CyGlNKemyvU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGlNKemyvU", "title": "Battle Chess - Gameplay video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CyGlNKemyvU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 101177, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8hvLlnTS0Wg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hvLlnTS0Wg", "title": "Battle Chess (3DO): Red vs. Blue", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hvLlnTS0Wg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
