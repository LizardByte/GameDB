Your vehicle also carries two rocks which only one can be deployed at a time. This will block your opponent for a short time. Each car has five lives and if you crash into the other car then you lose one of five lives. The game keeps going, letting you build up a score and it only ends when all lives are lost.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
