You control Ashe, the new Arbiter, whose job is to hunt down the demonic Ether and Umbra spirits that threaten humanity.  Being the opposite type of your enemy will allow you to hurt them, while being the same type will make you immune to their attacks.  The game's fast-paced combat and challenging enemies force you to master the art of transformation in order to succeed.  \n\nI'm currently developing the game entirely on my own, and I intend to keep it as a shorter action game with hopes of release in late 2018 on PC (Steam).  You can support Arbiter's development through Kickstarter!  The full game lives and dies by the Kickstarter's success, so please consider backing it if you're interested!  \n\nThe demo is a polished, fully playable tutorial level that will most likely appear in the final game. It\u2019s about 15-20m long, filled with various enemy encounters and a boss at the end. The game is currently only supported on Windows (PC).  \n\nI recommend playing with a controller since the tutorials aren't built for KB/M, but the game is still fully playable either way.\n\nWEBSITE:  https://arbitergame.ca/\nTWITTER:  https://twitter.com/jordy_j_s\nFACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/arbitergame/\nEMAIL:  jordyjs.biz@gmail.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WJWmkT6NG8E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WJWmkT6NG8E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WJWmkT6NG8E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WJWmkT6NG8E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Arbiter - Kickstarter Trailer (2017)", "description": "KICKSTARTER:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/427189558/692596883?token=c732018c\nDEMO:  https://jordyjs.itch.io/arbiter\n\nArbiter is an action game about transformation.
