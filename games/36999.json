Engineer spaceships, compose fleets and command them in in real time battles. All ships are completely defined by their module composition. Achieve victory with briliant command on the battlefield or by engineering it into your fleet.\n\nRTS-style battles with up to dozens of ships per side. Fixed fleets, doesn't include building of units or resource management mechanics.\n\nShips are made of and entirely defined by their modules. The modules such as generators, thrusters, weapons, armor etc. form the structure and define the behavior of the ship. Ships can have anywhere between 5 to over 1000 modules.\n\nShip and level editor. You can not only create new ship designs and battle challenges but edit all existing ones using in-game editors.\n\nNo-cheating Newtonian physics. All movement is driven by forces from thrusters and other actuators, and there is no friction or dampening. Ships and other objects are simulated as rigid bodies with accurate collision geometries and inertia.\n\nPer-module damage model. Ships can get partially disabled and split in two. The damage model also includes armor penetration and ricochet calculations.\n\nShip resource system. Most modules have a single function such as power generation or heat dissipation. The resource system gathers, stores and distributes resources such as electricity, heat and fuel between modules on every frame.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battlefleet-engineer", "videos": [{"id": 14282, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HZffAzdOAj8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZffAzdOAj8", "title": "Battlefleet Engineer Early Access Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HZffAzdOAj8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
