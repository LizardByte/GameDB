Even worse, a set of ancient documents tells you that you have but three days to find and disarm 15 devilish mechanisms that the medieval architect Victor Paz has hidden throughout the ancient building. The parchments give one vague clue to each mystery, but many others are concealed within the church. Why does the great organ have one lever more than it has records? Why did Victor Paz have a well drilled in the catacombs? Could the rumor of a hidden spiral staircase in one of the big columns be true? With an eye for details and an alert mind, you will uncover secrets almost everywhere in the awe-inspiring building.\n\nFortunately, you are not alone: the cheerful Dani accompanies you on your quest. As you travel back in time with every step into the cathedrals past, Dani is first replaced by the butler Jasper, then by the medieval monk Daniel. Your companions are vital for your progress; not only do they provide clues and carry surplus equipment, but you may also give them specific orders to help you solve puzzles: on your command, they will go to any location, operate machinery or help you move things that are too heavy for one person alone."}
