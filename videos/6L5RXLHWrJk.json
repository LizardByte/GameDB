{"id": "6L5RXLHWrJk", "snippet": {"title": "Space Firebird Arcade", "description": "You control the ship at the bottom of the screen. Although you can only move to the left or to the right, your ship arcs slightly upward when you are on either side of the screen. \nThis gives you a closer shot at enemies who are along the side, but also makes you more vulnerable to enemy attack.\n\nYour primary weapon is your ships gun, which can fire up to four shots on the screen at one time. Once per ship, you have access to a secondary warp-drive weapon, that propels you to the top of the screen. When the warp-drive is engaged, you are invincible.\n\nYou pilot it along the bottom of the screen at all times. As you move closer to the left or right edges of the screen, the height of your ship of the bottom of the screen increases slightly. As you return to the center, your ship lowers. You can fire up to four shots on the screen at any one time. Try not to shoot more than three, and always keep a fourth in reserve for emergencies. Once per ship, you can activate the warp-drive which surrounds your ship with an invincibility field. \nThe warp-drive slowly propels your ship up the screen, protecting you from any weapon. If you collide with a bird while warping, the bird is destroyed. When the warp drive brings you all the way to the top of the screen, you return at the bottom. You will no longer be able to activate the warp drive until your ship is destroyed and you start over with a new one. \n    \nYou must destroy or avoid 50 birds every stage. As the stage progresses, birds spawn on the screen, and the counter at the top of the screen counts down as you continue to eliminate them. Birds tend to fire bullets at your ship in groups that fan out.\n    \nThere are three different types of birds. They all behave in a similar fashion, following very particular swooping paths across the screen. It is easier to hit them when they are slowly moving down closer to your ship than when they are flying quickly up above. A bird is deducted from the counter of birds necessary to complete the stage when they are either destroyed, or when they make it past the bottom of the screen. There is no penalty for allowing a bird to reach the bottom of the screen, you simply earn no points for it. The last few birds of a stage can not be avoided. They will continue to attack until you destroy them. \n    \nBombs are the only other threat to the survival of your ship. They appear occasionally when flocks are flying overhead and slowly drop down to the bottom of the screen. They will detonate whether you shoot them or not. When they detonate, they send a shower of bullets scattering in every direction but straight down. As a result, you stand a much better chance of surviving the detonation if you destroy the bomb and remain directly underneath. The number of points you are awarded depends on how low and close to you the bomb is when you destroy it, ranging from 50 for far away, through 100, 150, and 200 points for being successively closer to the bomb. \n    \nYou must avoid colliding with any bird, an any bullet. You advance to the next stage when all 50 birds have been destroyed or left the screen.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6L5RXLHWrJk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6L5RXLHWrJk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6L5RXLHWrJk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6L5RXLHWrJk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6L5RXLHWrJk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Space Firebird Arcade", "description": "You control the ship at the bottom of the screen.
