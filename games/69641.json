Though having left his home in a peaceful state, Calintz decided to return home years later only to find Shudelmir in chaos. The sheer growth of monsters, as well as the rise of two important factions, have left Calintz with no choice but to join the Schwarz Strum as the 7th Squad Leader. Rumors have surfaced about the origin of the monsters. Particularly, the monster growth has been attributed to the enthroning of the new Emperor, Shulenlord. Many people believe that Vermillion, one of the two rising factions, is releasing the creatures in hopes of dethroning the new Emperor, and that the Emperor is retaliating against Vermillion in this same fashion. Amidst this conflict, political struggles between the fallen Princess, Juclecia, and the new Empress, Leona, have contributed a fair share to the chaos of Shudelmir. Having lost her mother to a senseless crime of murder, Juclecia was stripped of her royal authority and cast out into the rural district to conscribe to the lifestyle of a mere commoner. Though Juclecia was entitled to inherit her mother's throne, she held no say in the enthronement of the new Empress nor the Empress' decision to abolish Juclecia's royalty. Rallying the support of other nobles, Juclecia hopes that she can achieve Empress Leona's dethronement and restore peace to her kingdom.\n\nCliave, father to Princess Juclecia and Emperor Shulenlord, invaded and destroyed the prosperous Kingdom of Krios many years ago. This invasion was thought to take place in order to preserve the integrity of Cliave's power, as he feared that Krios had grown too strong. Ironically, Krios was Cliave's homeland, and his own uncle was its ruler. Still, Cliave would regard his own family as a political enemy and carry on his back the shame of hailing ruthless destruction against Krios. Krios' remaining citizens, reduced to mere slaves, had risen up against their adversity and formed the Vermillion faction. Heading up this group were two mysterious figures\u2014the ominous Ferenan, and the strange outsider, Tristan. Though Vermillion intently sought to rebuild Krios, their violent methods were often put into question, and have earned the group a fearful reputation with the public. Focusing their attention on Shudelmir's political presence, Vermillion has met much resistance from the Schwarz Strum.", "summary": "While it was never localized for western audiences, Magna Carta: The Phantom of Avalanche is notable for being the first entry in the Magna Carta series, developed and published by Softmax in Korea for Windows in 2001.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magna-carta-the-phantom-of-avalanche", "videos": [{"id": 143325, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "0cT2j8D1GVc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cT2j8D1GVc", "title": "Magna Carta PC (2000) -01- Opening", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0cT2j8D1GVc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
