Gliding and wings will no doubt be there as the IP\u2019s signature element. NCsoft even claimed Aion 2 will have features which could not be realized in the PC game, and that its vision for the game is \u201cno longer a dream\u201d. Such big lofty words.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is that there are no longer the 2 opposing factions, Elyos and Asmodians (due to the timeline). Players are free to choose to invade others of defend. Another eye-opener is the claim of not having \u201cclass segmentation\u201d in Aion 2, with players able to wield different weapons without restrictions and choose their playstyle. NCsoft claims that Aion 2 will \u201cshowcase a new battle system that did not exist in the old Aion\u201d.\n\nFinally, another huge change is the removal of gliding constraints found in Aion. While this was not explained in detail, NCsoft is aiming to make gliding part of the combat loop to create a \u201cthree dimensional battle system\u201d. NCsoft did not mention what engine Aion 2 is developed on, but my guess is Unreal Engine 4.
