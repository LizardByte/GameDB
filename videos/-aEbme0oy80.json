I thought this was really cool.\n\nThis game was supposed to be sequel to the original Glover for the Nintendo 64. They were also going to make a version for the PlayStation, Dreamcast, and they were probably going to release it for Win9x versions of Microsoft Windows too. But I'm not 100% sure about that. It was going to launch somewhere in 1999, but then for some reason it was cancelled. In 2011 NESworld was able to leak it on a ROM. There are two versions of this game. The first prototype which is what I was playing in this video, and there is a second prototype. It's pretty much the same as the first one, but it uses the engine from the original Glover with some improvements. If I find that one a ROM I'll probably upload a video of that. I don't know if I'll make more videos of this version.\n\nWhat I think was supposed to happen in this, was the wizard was on a trip and wasn't going to be back for ages from what Glover said, and while the wizard was gone, Cross-Stitch wanted to take over everything like in the first game. So he tricks Glover into making a spell to give Cross-Stitch his evil powers again thinking he was making a recipe for pie for picnic. Now what kind of pie recipe requires a tomato, mushroom, and an onion? And how do they make a spell? I guess Hasbro couldn't make up a kind of magical food in this game.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-aEbme0oy80/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-aEbme0oy80/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-aEbme0oy80/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Glover 2 Gameplay", "description": "I saw some people upload videos of this game and I wanted to make my own video about this.
