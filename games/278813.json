Before the show, the floors were mopped like usual, but this time the water from the bucket leaked, and DAVBOT got wet. The water damaged almost the entire AI program of his.\n\nSo, they scrapped him. DAVBOT was sent to work in the prison. But during the errors of his AI, DAVBOT felt something other than pain. He felt the dreams of being free. The dreams stayed with him this whole time, and he chose that it was time to make them come true.\n\nHe started running. The security tried to stop him, but he ran and ran. Dr. Mopsky was in the prison at the time of the first escape. DAVBOT was stopped. Now he felt sadness; he didn't want to work anymore. Because of that, he was being hurt a lot by the guards. But DAVBOT remembered the dreams.\n\nAnd the dreams remembered him. Now, a few years later, DAVBOT is ready for a second try at escaping Paragon City, and the M.O.P Company won't stop him this time!", "summary": "DavBot will be a 9 Chaptered 2D Platformer.
