Now, hunted by incumbent powers desperate to reclaim the girl and armed with a weapon capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage war to deliver themselves from the tyranny of their oppressors.\nAs original as its narrative, Gungnir's strategy RPG mechanics offer a number of fresh twists on an expertly honed formula. Building upon the traditional action queue of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have a numerical wait interval associated with them. Faster actions bear smaller numbers, allowing them to precede slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to accelerate actions. This classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting titles, enriches the Gungnir's deep strategic battles and gives the player far more critical decisions to weigh.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gungnir"}
