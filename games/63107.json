The game itself is a \"resurrection\" of the original Pac-Guy that include the original 12 levels with an additional new level from which you must eat all of the pellets while avoiding Kan's attacks. You navigate a maze collecting pellets while avoiding enemies. Big pellets act as ammunition that you can fire at enemies to remove them from the level permanently. Once you collect all the pellets and find the exit (sometimes automatic), you proceed to the next level. Losing all of your lives will merely send you back to the previous stage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-guy-resurrection", "videos": [{"id": 34816, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Sd_KsMmWl-M"}]}
