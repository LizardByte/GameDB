Sweet Dreams Alex is a peaceful game to take a break with. You don\u2019t destroy any monsters, but just hold them off until the morning. You don\u2019t battle some terrible evil; you just help Alex process her days and get a good night\u2019s sleep. The game\u2019s plot is a simple slice-of-life story about Alex discovering the world\u2014and all the adventures she has on the way. There are no antagonists (except for a group of particularly nasty ducks) and the tone is consistently light and happy. Sweet Dreams Alex is comfort food in a challenging world.", "summary": "Sweet Dreams Alex is a cute, relaxing puzzle game in which you build labyrinths to keep Nightmares away. Every level presents a new challenge that you can solve in a variety of creative ways while experiencing a cute slice-of-life story about the wonders of childhood.
