The game features RPG elements and FMV clips for combat; most of the animation is original to 1st Impression (with the voices of the original Evangelion voice actors and some other content recycled from the TV series).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neon-genesis-evangelion-1st-impression", "collections": [{"id": 4077, "name": "Neon Genesis Evangelion"}]}
