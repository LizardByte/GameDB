It consists of randomly generated dungeons, lite survival elements, and permanent death. The combat consists of strategic real-time action, using different styles of melee combat, ranged combat, and magic. There is no class system, as it allows absolute freedom of the player to choose their attributes, stats, and skills. However, there are some class archetypes for players who may want to choose a narrower suggested path.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/voidgate", "videos": [{"id": 25202, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wuS_m9WwrXw"}]}
