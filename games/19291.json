Did ever wonder what a leaping-laser-mouse-bomb would look like?

By tinkering with chips you can provide objects with individual properties, like floating, rotation or weight. Nothing is impossible. If you don't like that wooden plank, take your pick from 15 different materials and millions of colors. It is, after all, your own machine...\n\nAdditionally, we also let you use the Steam Workshop to gain access to an unending supply of puzzles and machines to implement into your game.
