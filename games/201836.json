The game stars a young boy named Hazuki, who has rather light-hearted dreams. What makes this game different from most fangames is that you don't start from the Nexus, rather than that the player starts from a random main world, and is forced to find a leaf to take them to the Nexus. The location is then linked to the leaf permanently, so you can visit it later."}
