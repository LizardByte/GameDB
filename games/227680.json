There will be quite a strong theme of nostalgia - we will meet many familiar characters, go through similar mini-games and visit places we know. The game uses the formula of Reksio's Adventures (adventure game interspersed with mini-games) adapted to pixel art; the best comparison I can find in the gaming industry is Oneshot.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reksio-i-kretes-odkop"}
