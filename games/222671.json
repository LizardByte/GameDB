Play on HNTR or HMP. I spent the vast majority of time working on HNTR and HMP for maps 01-03. UV is an extra special difficulty that most likely only I will find fun.\n\nMaps31 and 32: These two maps are special bonus maps. Only UV is implemented for Map31. Map32 has HNTR, HMP, and UV implemented but I recommend almost everyone play HNTR on Map32.\n\nDifficulty descriptions: HNTR: I dont really play slaughter/I rarely play slaughter\n\nHMP: I like slaughter maps but it definitely isnt my primary focus.\n\nUV: I love going up against overwhelming odds, fighting tens (sometimes hundreds) of cybs/viles at a time, pain elemental swarms, Reality category of speedrunning.\n\nDue to the nature of these maps I recommend playing with infinite height off in ZDoom based ports due to the flying monster behavior mixed with high ceilings. These maps were designed for PrBoom+ cl9 which has vanilla flying monster behavior.\n\nBecause of my mapping preferences play in software mode for best visual results!"}
