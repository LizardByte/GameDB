All you can do is wait for it to be over.\n\nAnd hey! while you're at it, why not strike up a friendly conversation? I hear you're quite similar to a couple of those girls, and quite intriguing to a couple others. Besides, it's not like the awkward moments will really matter in just a little bit. So listen to them for a while, to pass the time!\n\nOr don't.\n\nAgain, it really does not matter.\n\nYou are going to die.", "summary": "The world ends in 1 hour. It can't be saved.
