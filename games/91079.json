The horror aspect will be delivered through the atmosphere and environments, rather than an endless stream of jump scares. Graphically the game imitates the original PlayStation's graphical capabilities as closely as modernly possible, and the gameplay is heavily inspired by obscure games of the era such as LSD: Dream Emulator.\"", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 18661, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "043ksaPZbp4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=043ksaPZbp4", "title": "Bvoid Gameplay Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/043ksaPZbp4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
