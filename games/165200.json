The mechanics are pretty much the same, but like the 1st FNIA game, as the nights progress you'll find animatronic additions that wasn't in the original, and different mechanics being used. And of course, all the animatronics are Anime styled Girls... of course.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-in-anime-2"}
