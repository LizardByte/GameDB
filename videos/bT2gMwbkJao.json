You do also have an alternate attack, in the form of a sliding kick. The sliding kick doesn't deplete the sword meter, and in fact quickly replenishes a large portion of it. Buster is an excellent game that also has great graphics and music. The controls are tight and the stages are designed with deliberate precision. Nothing in the game feels arbitrary or accidental. \n\nTWO CENTS\n\nGraphics, musics and good, gameplay is very good.\n\nThis is probably my favourite game for the sharp x68000.
