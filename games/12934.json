In a bid to liberate himself, he bites his lip, triggering a transformation into the Hulk. However, his efforts are thwarted as the room is filled with gas, seeping through his skin and causing him to revert back to his human form. Surveying his surroundings, he identifies three dome-shaped edifices enveloped by a grassy expanse. Outside these structures, Banner can successfully transform into the Hulk. While exploring, he unexpectedly encounters an astral projection of Doctor Strange. The projection advises him to recall the concept of Nightmare and drops a hint about searching for Scott's upcoming Marvel Adventure at his preferred store before fading away.\n\nWithin a cavern, the Hulk crosses paths with Ultron, who has ensnared Ant-Man in a cage. With resourcefulness, the Hulk gathers an army of ants from the nearby field, enabling Ant-Man to control them. This alliance results in the incapacitation of Ultron and the subsequent liberation of Ant-Man. During his expedition, the Hulk accumulates an assortment of gems. Upon acquiring all of them, he is confronted by the Chief Examiner. This enigmatic figure imparts the keyword \"Aria\" before departing.", "summary": "Questprobe featuring The Hulk is a graphic adventure video game.
