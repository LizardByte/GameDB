Help them survive the perils that await them on every planet! Are you up to the challenge of saving the Furries from the villainous Furax?\n\nFurries are cute little green creatures who just love visiting strange planets. Unfortunately, Furries are not the most intelligent of critters. They like to spend their time wandering into deadly situations involving galactic creatures, giant pits, mountain peaks, explosions and more... To help the Furries survive all 60 levels, you will need to rely on the laws of physics and use a whole range of different objects such as pinball flippers, ropes, crates and cannons... in fact, just about anything can be used to help them make their way around the planet safely and avoid ending up as the evil Furax's dinner.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/save-the-furries"}
