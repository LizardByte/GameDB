I say alas because there is no proper way to replicate the 3D effect on YT as far as I'm aware, but as someone who owns the 3-D glasses and this game, I can tell you that it's easily one of the best games to use the glasses, but few people have seemingly played or heard of it. It's also one of the only games worth tracking down that uses the glasses too. I've done a few things with this video:\r\n\r\n1) I've recorded the first level off of an emulator so people can see what the game looks like.\r\n2) I've recorded a small segment of the first level off of real hardware without removing the \"3-D\" effect. It may induce nausea, but it will show you what the game does when the 3-D is in effect. Take note of things like when the hero jumps and the different layers on the level.\r\n3) I've recorded a few samples of sound from the game under Fusion, which can apply FM/YM/etc. audio to the old SMS game.

The object of the game is to simply collect a key hidden on each level spread across several layers to get to the exit, but you'll have to fight many enemies along the way. You get several power-ups to help you and the game is fun, but it stands out for its at-the-time spellbinding visuals.
