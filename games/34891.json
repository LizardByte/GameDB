The story focuses around the main protagonist Raywin who, because of prophecy, has to go off to fight in the war of Salemsun and save the kingdom. Along the way he is accompanied by his friend Helena who he at first hates, but along the way they grow closer than ever. The game uses a turn base battle system and 16-bit graphics that are reminiscent of 90's Final Fantasy games. Playing this game will certainly bring memories of when times were more simple.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/raywin"}
