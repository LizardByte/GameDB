The game was later released on several other formats such as the SNES, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game was inspired by the Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator, General Kilbaba, and the United States. The player controls a lone Apache helicopter and attempts to destroy enemy weapons and installations, rescue hostages and capture enemy personnel, while managing supplies of fuel and ammunition.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 2438, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "RYVDt8XhTBM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYVDt8XhTBM", "title": "Mega Drive Longplay [167] Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RYVDt8XhTBM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
