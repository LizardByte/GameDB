To that end, the Space Ops were formed as an elite cadre of first-responders ready to take on any task the galaxy can throw at them. As an enlistee, the player is tasked with familiarizing themselves with the arsenal and tactics of the Space Ops. This includes their array of specialist weaponry as well as the unique tactical teleport tool that helps them evade their foes. Rigorous training exercises packed with tough alien foes will put the Space Ops skills to the test. Players can complete these courses solo, cooperatively, or race head-to-head to get the highest score on global leaderboards.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-ops-vr", "videos": [{"id": 27184, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "E90_y_SlQZI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E90_y_SlQZI", "title": "Space Ops VR trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E90_y_SlQZI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
