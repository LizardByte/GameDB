And the Ottoman Empire began to expand their influence in order to keep the European powers in check.\n\nThe passion to explore the unknown, the desire for endless riches, and the power to enrich the nation's glory.\n\nWith their own reasons, numerous people begin to set sail into the vast oceans.", "summary": "Commemorating 30 years of the Uncharted Waters series.
