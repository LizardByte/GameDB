This is why we will unite all the flowers that are growing with the intention of sending more and more intense attacks.\n\nIn Merge Flowers we will have to use our best strategy in order to unite the same flowers, at the most appropriate time, to find other powerful species. Only in this way will we be able to send many automatic attacks to each of the zombies that approach our surroundings. In fact, at the top of each enemy we will see a status bar with which we will identify their vital state.\n\nAt the bottom we will find a golden button through which we can invest the coins that we are going to obtain many. This is how we will increase the rate of attacks and therefore it will be easier for us to kill each zombie and the respective level bosses. However, we will also have a store from which to acquire new characters and functions that make us more powerful.\n\nMerge Flowers is one of those titles in which we won't be able to take our eyes off the screen of our smartphone. The continuous hordes of zombies will encourage us to produce flowers tirelessly and thereby protect our garden from these unpleasant beings.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/merge-flower", "videos": [{"id": 73981, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "nPQdMxvUYa4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPQdMxvUYa4", "title": "Flower Denfense", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nPQdMxvUYa4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
