In the 90's, there was a major Crazy Bones crazy, a game based off of astragalus with plastic figurines with weird and odd shapes, sizes, and faces.\n\nInsane Skulls is based off of games like Astragalus and Crazy Bones, where a player picks a team of 4 characters (or skulls), all with different stats and properties. Players take turns flicking their skulls at the opposing skulls, carefully aiming, giving a nice amount of upward or forward force, in hopes of knocking the other player's skulls over.\n\nInsane Skulls has 16 different characters, including guest characters like Circuit Dude and Dusty Argile, and supports either a single player mode against the CPU or head-to-head mode against another human.\n\nSee how many times you can beat the CPU in a row with the team you make to beat the high score!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/insane-skulls"}
