It was one of the last games published for Game Boy Advance, at a time when the Nintendo DS was already halfway through the most prominent phase of its product life cycle.\n\nAnother game with the same title was also released on the Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and PC, and the other handheld game on Nintendo DS, and PlayStation Portable video game consoles, though this version is vastly different from any of the others released, it being a 2.5-D side-scrolling beat-'em-up game involving no three-dimensional game play whatsoever.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 48483, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Xw5Bn9HvLXY"}]}
