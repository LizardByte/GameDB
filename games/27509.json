When a roboticist from the University of Iox goes missing, Aliya begins a trail of discoveries that will lead to the very edge of her world - and the ancient secret of Heaven's Vault.\n\nSail an open-world of fast flowing space-rivers, discover lost ruins, explore ancient sites, find artefacts and translate their strange hieroglyphics. Piece together the history of the world and an entire ancient language.\n\nFrom the creators of massively-branching interactive adventure 80 Days, Heaven's Vault is not your usual linear adventure game. Progress through the game in any order you choose - the game's fully adaptive narrative remembers every choice you make, every discovery and every action you take, influencing what happens next. Meet a diverse cast of characters who remember everything you say, and who's attitude to you will change with how you act. Some are friendly, some are cautious, and some are out to trick you.\n\nWho will you trust? What will you find? What will you learn? What will you risk? What will you lose?", "summary": "Explore the lost ruins of the Nebula, read ancient inscriptions, and uncover a forgotten past in this narrative archaeological science-fiction adventure game from the creators of 80 Days.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heavens-vault", "videos": [{"id": 18993, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7MZZ6glfDZ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MZZ6glfDZ0", "title": "Heaven\u2019s Vault \u2013 Announcement Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7MZZ6glfDZ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 24398, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RUgtMlkwXRA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUgtMlkwXRA", "title": "Heaven's Vault - official trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RUgtMlkwXRA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
