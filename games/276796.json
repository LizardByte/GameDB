Behind each level are the properties of shapes, with each move you are interacting with geometric proofs.\n\nBuild Your Army\nTo help you defeat Osgard and win the game, you must build an army. Your army is full of cleverly hidden shapes that only appear once you have successfully completed the proof.\n\nWho is Euclid? What are his Elements?\nDragonBox Elements takes its inspiration from \u201cElements\u201d, one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics. Written by the Greek mathematician Euclid, \"Elements\" describes the foundations of geometry using a singular and coherent framework. Its 13 volumes have served as a reference textbook for over 23 centuries, and DragonBox Elements makes it possible for players to master its essential axioms and theorems after just a couple of hours playing!", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragonbox-elements", "videos": [{"id": 101735, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rm-6pDiSH44", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm-6pDiSH44", "title": "DragonBox Elements - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rm-6pDiSH44/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 9184, "name": "DragonBox"}]}
