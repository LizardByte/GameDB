A terrorist organisation has kidnapped Doctor Masker Lindberry and his daughter. \nThe United Nations Special Service Agency has dispatched their agents to investigate, but to no avail. Its leader is leading a task force (code named Night Striker) using armoured vehicles to rescue them and destroy the organisation.\n\nThe player controls the car and shoots enemies encountered during the stage. Enemies and bosses include helicopters, aeroplanes, lorries, robotic spiders, and boulders. \nThe car can be manoeuvred in a similar manner to Space Harrier; can be moved around the screen. There are 21 stages, although the player only needs to complete six to complete the game. \nStages' themes include, factories, tunnels, and city themes such as centres, suburbs, and streets. Certain stages contain obstacles such as barriers which must be manoeuvred around. \nAt the end of each stage, there is a boss, and after its defeat, the player is presented with a choice of route, like Out Run. The car's \"armour\" refers to its shield capability; the car can absorb a certain number of hits before being destroyed. Defeating a boss gives the shield the capacity to withstand another hit. If the shield has run out and the car is hit, the game is over. \nIn certain final stages, the car transforms: depending on the stage, it can become vehicles such as a motorbike or a robot.\nThe game features different endings depending on which route is taken.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Reb7nxgOTvQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Reb7nxgOTvQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Reb7nxgOTvQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Reb7nxgOTvQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Reb7nxgOTvQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Night Striker Arcade", "description": "The game is set in a futuristic city in 2049.
