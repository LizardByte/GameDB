It is a game about crisis and permanent conflict in human society. You will run out of vital resources in times you need them the most. People will protest and riot despite your best efforts to help them. Not everyone will survive.\n\nYou'll have to run a city with limited resources. To balance between people's needs and city development. To deal with angry crowds on the streets. You are the one to shape the future of your people. Just remember - there is no way to make everyone happy.\n\nThe population of your city consists of 3 classes: nobles, bourgeois and workers. Each class has a unique role in the city economy. Nobles serve as officials and policemen, bourgeois pay taxes while workers provide the labor force. Their vision of the future is very different and they are ready to fight for it.", "summary": "Kapital is a hybrid of city-builder and society management game. You play as a new mayor of the city that was recently destroyed by war. Your goal is to restore the city to former glory by managing limited resources, resolving social conflicts and overcoming crisis situations.\nThe population of your city consists of 3 classes: nobles, bourgeois and workers. All of them want a better tomorrow.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "videos": [{"id": 46832, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "4k63Qtx3j2k"}]}
