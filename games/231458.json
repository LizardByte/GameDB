The Dragon Sword is the fabled sword which has the power to defeat a powerful creature like Oijngate.\n\nThe Dragon Sword is an RPG similar to the Wizardry series of games. You will explore large maps which you view in the first person and fight monsters in turn-based combat. You will create characters by giving them names and choosing their race and class and picking from randomly generated attributes. Then your selected group will dive right into the adventure.\n\nMonster encounters pop up unexpectedly so be ready to fight at any time. Your warrior and m\u00eal\u00e9e class characters can use an array of weapons against foes while magic casters can likewise use an array of magical spells and weapons. Once in a while you will run into a store where you'll be able to use collected gold and items to trade and purchase items of your choosing.\n\nThe thirty levels that you will battle through will not only present combat but will also try to stump you with puzzles. The puzzles may involve literally asking quizzing questions or may involve requiring you to figure out how to open a door or pass a certain obstacle. The maps will also get easier to get lost in as you move up the level and will get lengthier. Character leveling is also done automatically with attributes distributed amongst your team members once they pass a certain experience level.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-dragon-sword--1"}
