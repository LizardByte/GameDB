Max Payne is an original third-person 3D game based on the MAX-FX engine and uses photo-digitized textures and radiosity lighting, resulting in one of the most realistic looking games ever seen on the PC.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LnlqpATCYR4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LnlqpATCYR4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LnlqpATCYR4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LnlqpATCYR4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LnlqpATCYR4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Max Payne - Full Game Walkthrough in 4K [Dead on Arrival Difficulty]", "description": "Max Payne Full Movie Walkthrough / Guide video in Dead on Arrival Difficulty - 4K Ultra HD 60 fps [Played on PC]\n\nRockstar Games Walkthrough Videos Playlist: https://bit.ly/2RP61Bl\n\n\u25ba YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/GTASeriesVideos\n\u25ba INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/GTASeriesNews\n\u25ba FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/GTASeriesNews\n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/GTASeries\n\u25ba DISCORD: https://discord.gg/GTASeries \n\n0:00 Intro\n\nPART 1 - The American Dream\n2:01 Prologue\n5:47 Chapter 1 - Roscoe Street Station\n12:30 Chapter 2 - Live From the Crime Scene\n20:32 Chapter 3 - Playing It Bogart\n29:53 Chapter 4 - The Blood Veins of New York\n37:27 Chapter 5 - Let the Gun Do the Talking\n43:45 Chapter 6 - Fear that Gives Men Wings\n51:17 Chapter 7 - Police Brutality\n1:00:34 Chapter 8 - Ragna Rock\n1:08:49 Chapter 9 - An Empire of Evil\n\nPART 2 - A Cold Day in Hell\n1:15:17 Prologue\n1:22:08 Chapter 1 - The Baseball Bat\n1:32:19 Chapter 2 - An Offer You Can't Refuse\n1:41:58 Chapter 3 - With Rats and Oily Water\n1:51:15 Chapter 4 - Put Out My Flames With Gasoline\n1:54:51 Chapter 5 - Angel of Death\n\nPART 3 - A Bit Closer to Heaven\n2:03:37 Prologue\n2:09:48 Chapter 1 - Take Me to Cold Steel\n2:16:38 Chapter 2 - Hidden Truths\n2:23:32 Chapter 3 - The Deep Six\n2:31:09 Chapter 4 - Backstabbing Bastard\n2:41:33 Chapter 5 - In the Land of the Blind\n2:50:29 Chapter 6 - Byzantine Power Game\n2:56:37 Chapter 7 - Nothing to Lose\n3:09:02 Chapter 8 - Pain and Suffering\n\n3:18:41 Bonus mission\n3:20:46 End Credits\n\nPlayed, recorded & edited by: Joe9411\n\n#MaxPayne #RockstarGames #GTASeriesVideos\n\nABOUT US\n\nGTA Series Videos is a dedicated fan-channel in no way tied to Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive.\n\nHere you can find all the latest news, video walkthroughs and official trailers of the most successful video games published by Rockstar Games, including Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne, L.A.
