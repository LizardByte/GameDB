{"id": "ohjf6HTMTp4", "snippet": {"title": "One Last GoB (feat. James Holt) (Official Music Video)", "description": "(Streaming and Download links below!)\nThe war is nearing its end...\n\nThis is the official music video for the song \"One Last GoB (feat. James Holt)\" from the GoB 2020 original game soundtrack. It is a personal tribute to the 4 years of development the game went through, calling back to iconic weapons and characters that have developed both fame and infamy over the games lifetime. \n\nIt was written by Sayincraft Studio's: Scott Warren (aka me), and performed by the very talented James Holt. James Holts's vocals and instrumental truly exceeded all expectations, and I can't recommend checking out his other works enough! (I'll link them below.)\n\nSpecial shoutout to Ethan (Kaiser), and Sarah (Emo Goose) for helping me film the extra character movements in the video.\n\n***\n\nJames Holt: https://www.youtube.com/user/jamesholtartist\nhttps://www.jamesholtmusic.com/\n\n***\n\nSubscribe, like, and follow me on other social media for more updates on GoB, and future games from Sayincraft Studios!\n\nGoB Official Discord: https://discord.gg/S3St6SF\n\nGoB 2020 Soundtrack:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/4hSxVECzYUKxg4n9to0ksi?si=UcVKJVjZS9mUATEutCgEFw\nItunes/Apple Music: https://music.apple.com/us/album/gob-2020-original-game-soundtrack-single/1531498491\n\n***\n\nGAME DOWNLOADS:\nItchio: https://sayincraft.itch.io/gob-2020\nGameJolt: https://gamejolt.com/games/GoB2020/537471\n\n***\n\nGoB Release Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZvA92N5l5I&ab_channel=SayincraftStudios\n\n***\n\nSocial Media and Stuff:\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/sayincraft\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sayincraft/#\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sayincraft\n\nhttps://www.sayincraft.com/\n\nRemember, not everything is as it seems...", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohjf6HTMTp4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohjf6HTMTp4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohjf6HTMTp4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohjf6HTMTp4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohjf6HTMTp4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "One Last GoB (feat.
