The city has been seized by unknown forces, with a special crack team of hardened soldiers sent to the valley of Karnak, to uncover the source of this trouble. However, on the journey there, the player's helicopter is shot down and the player barely escapes. The player is sent in to the valley as the hero to save Karnak and the World. The player finds himself battling hordes of extraterrestrial insectoid beings known as the Kilmaat, as well as their various minions, which include mummies, Anubis soldiers, scorpions, and evil spirits. The player's course of action is directed by the spirit of King Ramses, whose mummy was exhumed from its tomb by the Kilmaat, who seek to resurrect him and use his powers to control the world.", "summary": "Powerslave is a first-person shooter featuring an arcade-style level progression. The game comprises 20 consecutive single-player levels and 12 multiplayer deathmatch levels.\n\nThe storyline unfolds in the city of Karnak, which has been invaded by unknown alien forces, isolating it from the rest of the world. The inhabitants are subjected to torture or injected with a substance, transforming them into servant mummies. Not even the mummy of King Ramses is spared. As world leaders' attempts to send armed forces fail, you are selected among a few of the world's best special forces to infiltrate Karnak and eliminate the invaders from within. However, the mission takes a dark turn when your helicopter is shot down, leaving you alone to navigate through the chaos, aiming to complete your mission and survive.\n\nIn contrast to later console adaptations, the game's 20 single-player levels are played consecutively. The player searches for keys and secret areas to progress to the next level, akin to other games of the time, such as DOOM. The game employs a single save slot for each playthrough and incorporates a checkpoint system, enabling players to resume from the latest checkpoint they have discovered. Levels encompass ancient cities, temples, sprawling lava-filled caverns, and alien Kilmaat ships, each riddled with traps and keys concealing multiple pathways.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/powerslave--1"}
