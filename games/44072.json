The green, prosperous Milinia and its majestic palace is no more, everything has fallen apart around Aisya when she finally came to her senses.\nWhile the casualties are great, miraculously, some warriors survived the flame, this include the regent. Although they are no longer human, they are alive as ash soldiers. Accompanied by these survivors, Aisya sets off to find out the truth behind the flaming serpent and ways to revive her country.\"", "summary": "Newly crowned Queen Aisya has to find the bracelet of her kingdom of Millinear in order to restore it after the fiend named Salamander put it to ruin.
