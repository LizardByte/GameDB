It is a remake of the 1981 Game & Watch video game Manhole. In order to play the game the player had to scan a single card with two barcodes using the e-Reader. The game was included free of charge with the e-Reader. It should also be noted that a version of the game was included in the E3 2002 Promo Pack, though the actual card looked differently, sporting the E3 logo. The actual game contained within, however, was the same.\n\nThis was the only Game & Watch e-Reader game to be released. Nintendo initially planned to release a variety of games under a Game & Watch-e Collection label, though their plan was never fulfilled, perhaps due to the unpopularity of the e-Reader.\n\nThis card represents a \"direct\" port of the game, thus Classic Version. Other versions (Color and Collector versions) of each game in the collection were being produced but were never released.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/manhole-e-classic-version"}
