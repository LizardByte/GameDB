All crimes will be treated as equal and will result in a trip to the Zombie Dome. We are all equal in the ravenous eyes of Zombie Lady Justice. Only the strongest, fastest and most innocent will survive. Come out and watch the spectacle of our modern justice system, see as the guilty are devoured and the innocent earn their freedom.\n\nUltimate Zombie Death Ball is a 1v1 arena sports game set in a zombie apocalypse. The object of the game is to get a ball in your opponent\u2019s net, while being chased by a hoard of hungry zombies. Also, the ball is electrified, and will stun you if you kick it. Luckily, the zombies can kick it for you. You can get them to do this by having them chase you, or by throwing meat on the field for them to chase instead. After 3 minutes play is over, and the winner is whoever has more goals.", "summary": "Ultimate Zombie Death Ball is a 1v1 arena sports game set in a zombie apocalypse.
