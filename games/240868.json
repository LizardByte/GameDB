Super fast gameplay means average game length is less than 15 minutes. Touchbacks, Safeties, Touchdowns, Field Goals, Extra Points, 2 Point Conversions, it's all in the game.\n\nDynamic AI driven solely by the physics system means no two games are ever the same vs the CPU. 3 difficulty levels to choose from.\n\nInnovative two player mechanic where each player sits across from one another and takes turns attempting to score. Think \"old school arcade\". Great on larger screens like tablets.\n\nSupports 1-6 human players. Single elimination bracket, progress can be saved and resumed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pixel-push-football"}
