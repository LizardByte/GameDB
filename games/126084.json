Run around and try to eat as many gold blobs to gain points. But you're not alone. Your bot opponent will try to eat gold blobs before you can. Special power blobs give you superpowers. You can get super fast or super-size yourself, shrink, temporarily blind or freeze your opponent. There are infinite levels for you to play. With every level you unlock, your opponent gets smarter and quicker.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
