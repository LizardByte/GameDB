{"id": "NJBL_dclMcA", "snippet": {"title": "DOOM RPG - The first major mobile phone video game trailer", "description": "Statement from friends: \"THE BEST MOBILE PHONE VIDEO GAME TRAILER EVER!\"\r\nQuestion: How can you make a trailer of a mobile phone game using nothing but in-game graphics?  A mobile phone is so small, the graphics are no way as good as a Playstation 2 or Xbox so can you do it without using LIVE actors or anything of that sort?  What is the best way to approach making a in-game trailer of a game that can run at most 15fps on a 176x220 screen?  How can you make something that people normally wouldn't care about appear completely amazing?  That was the challenge and I believe that I have delivered with the creation of this trailer. \r\nIf you're wondering how come you're seeing a few mobile phone game trailers of late then let me honestly tell you that it was in response to this trailer.  Yes, THIS trailer was the one that kickstarted all other mobile phone in-game trailers.  \r\nEnjoy!  And in case you were wondering, \"yes\", this trailer is official, its for real and I've made everything; excluding the Id Software intro.  Also, click on my nickname to see my other videos.
