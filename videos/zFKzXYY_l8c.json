No One Can Stop Mr. Domino(!!!!!!) is one of those really strange games that you don't expect to see released outside of Japan but they end up getting released anyway. A game like this may not seem so strange these days with so many niche games getting the green light, but this was one of those exceptional conversation pieces of gaming back in the late nineties and among collectors and gamers.\n\nThe object of the game is to topple dominos onto specific buttons to cause a chain reaction. Sound simple? Sure, but it's harder than it looks. This is amazingly NOT the first game that I've played in the U.S. that dealt with toppling dominos. A very little-known game released for numerous platforms including the SNES titled \"Pushover\" or \"Push-Over\" would be the first. In that game, you played as an ant who had to knock down all the dominos on a level.\n\nAnyhoo, in Mr. Domino's game, you get to play with numerous characters each with their own distinct personality and traits. You're always moving in the game and you can slow yourself down (you lose points) or speed yourself up (you gain points). You can lay dominos with any of the four major buttons and you must make a path leading to each switch for the best score. Of course, there are a mess of obstacles in your path and a switch that can reverse time and start the level over (it looks cool when you do though). You also have a time limit. Take too long and Mr. Domino and his pals will change into dull, ordinary dominos. You don't want that to happen, do ya? Of course not!\n\nThis video shows the opening movie and the first two levels. I chose Mr. Domino, donned him with the lucky number seven and set him to move \"Fast\".
