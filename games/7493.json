The player can choose the Historical mode where the characters of the game will follow history to the letter, acting the way the did in real life, but players can also choose a Fictional mode where everything is random and the player can change history as they see fit.\n\nThere are 650 playable characters to choose from, as well as the ability to create over 100 different officers. Players can also trade generals and view stats using online capability.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-x"}
