Playable from start to finish as of 2020, the hack boasts 43 total chapters, 62 playable characters, and various unique mechanics that help to set it apart from the game it deviates from.\n\nOn the continent of Yaska lies six distinct nations, including the empire of Nevan, led by Emperor Festan. The imperial state of Belaro, led by Lord Gradin, has resorted to heavily taxing its citizens, jailing those who cannot comply. Needless to say, this proves unpopular with the state's population, including Storch, a young farmer, and his friends and family. Soon, he's resorting to stealing from the rich to be able to help his family avoid prison. One excursion into a relatively wealthy part of Belaro ultimately leads him down a path that would change the course of Nevan's history.\n\nDesigned to be played as an ironman run, hence the large cast, Vision Quest boasts an incredible amount of content and a tone that slides carefully between drama and humor with its character interactions and small scale compared to most Fire Emblem games (more in line with Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 than anything else). The game is divided into four parts, similar to Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, with each progressively growing in scale without ever resorting to having you fight dragons or gods. The patch can be found at the link provided. A sequel is currently in development, though pandan has only shown a couple of screenshots on a Twitch stream so far.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
