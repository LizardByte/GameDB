It is announced that the capture of Field Marshal Tannenberg will end the war.

The game introduces Bridgette Bleu, a spy for the Blue Nation. She has developed a serum that reverses plastrification. Your job as Sarge and sometimes Vikki is to destroy the serum, eliminate Tan soldiers, and capture Plastro and Tannenburg.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 75188, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Sg0heayqXzA"}]}
