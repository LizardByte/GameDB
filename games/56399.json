It has a new compilation of songs: \"CHIHAYA BlueMIX\". This volume also marked Ryo Akizuki's second HD appearance, featuring him in a special mode of the game. This mode allows players to take pictures of him wearing the \"Sailor Swimsuit\" costume and listen to him sing \"Dazzling World\" as the BGM music. Like the previous volume, an option was developed to allow pictures to be taken on a horizontal, empty beach as well as the option to use the \"Sailor Cap\" accessory. An unlockable costume is also available for Ryo to wear, \"Good Sleep Pajamas\", if you play wirelessly on the PS Vita. The costume is also available to be unlocked without the use of a PS Vita in the iM@S CHANNEL version of the game. The summer kimonos were also a new costume introduced by this volume.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-idolmaster-gravure-for-you-vol-9"}
