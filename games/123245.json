Monsters roam both revealed and unrevealed areas, causing the player to lose a life on contact or if the monsters cross an unfinished beam.\n\nRandomly appearing bonus symbols can grant various effects, such as extra lives, instant death, speed boosts, and more. Letters are also scattered across the levels, and spelling complete words is required to win. The standard objective is to reveal 75% of the screen to complete each of the 15 levels.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/powerstyx"}
