Experience brand new, bigger, more lively environments - Jericho City is a massive location, packed with secret passages, buildings, factions, friends, foes, and terrifying bosses. Abandoned, half-finished mega-structures sit alongside ostensibly serene parks that have become nanomachine hunting grounds. As you progress through this nightmare, earn TechScrap and equipment pieces by tearing off enemy limbs to equip them to your exo-rig.\n\nAs the nanomachine infestation eats Jericho City, new, horrific amalgamations of man and machine roam the streets as gangs, the government, and cultists war for control over the most valuable areas.
