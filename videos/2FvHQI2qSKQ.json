{"id": "2FvHQI2qSKQ", "snippet": {"title": "Apple II Game - Ultima III: Exodus (1983 ORIGIN Systems, Inc)", "description": "An RPG game sequel to Ultima II. After Defeating Mondain and Minax peace was returned to the land of Sosaria. As time passes by, after the death of Mondain and Minax, it was soon revealed that they both had an offspring named Exodus. Now Exodus is out to get revenge to avenge the death of their parents by terrorizing the land of Sosaria. The stranger hero is now summoned once again by Lord British to protect and defend the land of Sosaria. The player also takes a quest to dungeons to receive magical marks, the quest to Ambrosia to find the Shrines to gain stats, and the dungeon to find the Time Lord which must be done in order to confront Exodus. Exodus cannot be killed directly (just like the previous games) by a group of party adventurers. You must use clues in defeating Exodus. This the last Ultima game to take place in the land of Sosaria. The  Ambroisa and the Isle of Fire takes place in later Ultima games.\n\nThis is the first Ultima game to feature music. It's also the first ever RPG game where you play in the party rather than a single player, which influenced and inspired games like Dragon Warrior (or Dragon Quest)  and Final Fantasy games. This game seems demonic mainly because of the satanic devils that was featured in this game just like Ultima II.  The last Ultima game to take place in the Age of Darkness. Also reminds me of the Gauntlet games.\n\nThe characters I've played are:\n\nMale Human Barbarain - Conan\nFemale Elven Thief- Carmen Sandiego\nMale Human Ranger - Rocker\nMale Bobbit Druid - Healer\n\nPlayed on Applewin emulator 1.22.0.0\n\nNote: This game is buggy. When I got closer to leveling up to 20, graphical bugs start to appear which made it impossible for me to progress further in the game. I had no choice to get to the last part of the level after I've gotten everything I needed to beat the game. Once that's done it's over. If I had not been able to beat the game, I would have simply gave up. Also, some parts of the video showing me repeatedly showing me doing the same thing over and over again have been sped up using Virtual Dub to keep the length of video as short as possible and some of them have been edited out. The video was originally about 20 hours long but YouTube keeps rejecting the video as being too long. You will see some parts being fast forward just like fast forward a Vhs tape on a VCR player. \n\nSpeed up effect look at 7:22:04\n\nWalkthrough guides available:\nhttp://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Ultima_III_Walkthrough\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/562659-ultima-iii-exodus/faqs/20688\nhttp://www.freegameempire.com/games/Ultima-3/walkthrough\nhttp://killass.lardpirates.com/oldstuff/faqs/pc/ultima3.txt\nhttp://guides.gamercorner.net/ultimaiii/\nhttp://www.lairware.com/ultima3/manual.html\nhttp://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/walkthroughs/ultima3walk.htm\nhttp://www.lairware.com/ultima3/Ultima-3-Maps.pdf\n\nMore info available:\nhttp://atariage.com/forums/topic/177237-ultima-ii-apple-question/\nhttp://shrines.rpgclassics.com/nes/ultima3/\n\nStay tuned for the full playthrough/walkthrough video for the Apple II version of Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2FvHQI2qSKQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2FvHQI2qSKQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2FvHQI2qSKQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Apple II Game - Ultima III: Exodus (1983 ORIGIN Systems, Inc)", "description": "An RPG game sequel to Ultima II.
