Lily Salvatana, a particularly sagacious headhunter, takes it upon herself to claim the massive bounty set on Franco's head. However, Lily soon encounters a mysterious gunslinger who refuses to speak her name who seems to have the same idea - exactly who will end up claiming the bounty? And in the first place, who exactly is Franco?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 39838, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aXFXGlFVf8c"}]}
