As the game advances further into the dungeon, you will gather Runes, which will be used to combine into 285 unique spells. Discovering new spells will unlock their entries in your Runedex; unlock them all! But be careful \u2013 if you die, your playthrough is finished.\n\nWe wanted to make a game that had a lot of replayability, customization, and discovery. Almost every design choice we made focused on furthering those three goals. We want the player to be able to choose the playing style that suits them: long range sniper, mid range run and gun, or an up close brawler. There are many features to facilitate this level of customization. When you earn enough experience you will level up and be able to choose from 4 random traits to make you even stronger.\n\nEach floor is procedurally generated, so the enemies, rooms, event rooms, and bosses you face are all randomly chosen, making every playthrough different. You will not encounter everything in the game in one playthrough, or even five: there is always something new to encounter.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 5311, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EhGniHv2IzQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhGniHv2IzQ", "title": "Runers - Available On Steam Now", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhGniHv2IzQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
