Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops.\n\nChoose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.\n\nThe competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.\n\nThe Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-2", "videos": [{"id": 402, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Qr088DN1AIw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr088DN1AIw", "title": "Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qr088DN1AIw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
