Regardless, his racing days are over; that\u2019s why he gave you the keys to his old truck and a little money to get started. The future is now yours and you have a family legacy to uphold.\n\nStunning effects, amazing fire and hard racing with bullets - is that what you were craving for so long? Prepare to listen to the burn-in noise of madly spinning tires at the start. Just get in a car and try to survive on the track. Be quick, be smart, be fearless and the Trashpit Cup will be yours! Just don't forget to take a good minigun and couple of mines, the competition is anything but friendly."}
