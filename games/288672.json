Unfortunately there are dangerous craters there. Fortunately your car can jump over them!\n\nThe game has some resemblance of the classic arcade game moon-patrol which was released in 1982. A clone of this game was released for the Commodore C64 in 1983. This ASCII art version of moon-buggy was written many years later by Jochen Voss.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moon-buggy--1"}
