But as you grow, rivals will notice your rise, and enemies will emerge.

Are you ready to strike harder to break this monopoly? If so, you will need a good army and good tactics, but it will cost you in manpower and money. It will be a journey from looting their ATMs and damaging their stations to completely destroying other banks. You'll be in space, but you may need to keep your planet under control and get away with your intrigues.", "summary": "Explore the realm of space banking, where strategic competition, intricate dynamics, and absolute profits define the landscape.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-manifest"}
