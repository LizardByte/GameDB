As with its predecessor, Scramble Wars, the game is a tactical turn-based war simulation in which each side uses their Gundam mechas to defeat the other and are occasionally aided by a \"gachapon\" - or capsule machine - that dispenses additional Gundams in a manner similar to their toy counterparts.\n\nThe game was the first of the series to be released on a Famicom cart, as Scramble Wars was a Famicom Disk System-only game. Capsule Senki was also rereleased on the Japanese Wii Shop's Virtual Console.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sd-gundam-world-gachapon-senshi-2-capsule-senki"}
