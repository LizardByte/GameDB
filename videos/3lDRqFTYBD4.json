The story is set in China in the final years of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BCE), with Fusu \u2013 the heir apparent to the first Qin emperor, Qin Shi Huang \u2013 as the protagonist. Although the game has a historical basis, its setting is purely fictitious because the historical Fusu died in 210 BCE.\n\nThe game balances team-fighting, with up to five heroes per team, and the use of various skills and abilities. The player is challenged by many enemies in more than 100 unique scenes accurately depicting the society and architecture of the Qin dynasty. The game's novel features include multi-scenario and multi-ending systems, randomly created weapons, items and enemies, an equipment-creating system and a sophisticated fighting system rooted in the ancient Chinese philosophy of the Five Elements.\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 PC Hardware \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7 8700K\nRAM: 32 GB\nGPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080\nOS:  Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 Recording HW/SW \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nNvidia Share", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3lDRqFTYBD4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3lDRqFTYBD4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3lDRqFTYBD4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3lDRqFTYBD4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3lDRqFTYBD4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Prince of Qin (2002) - PC Gameplay / Win 10", "description": "Prince of Qin (2002) - PC Gameplay / Win 10\n\nSubscribe here \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FirstPlaysHD\nAlso SHARE, COMMENT, LIKE \u263a\n\n\nPrince of Qin (Chinese: \u79e6\u6b87; pinyin: Q\u00edn Sh\u0101ng) is a 2002 action role-playing game developed by Object Software and published by Strategy First.
