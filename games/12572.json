This unique puzzle game combines elements of espionage and geometric problem-solving, as the agent navigates levels by walking on walls, lifting objects, and shooting. The core gameplay involves assembling geometric shapes by dragging and dropping pieces onto translucent slots within a time limit. Players must balance speed and strategy, collecting power-ups and avoiding enemies while solving increasingly complex puzzles. With its blend of action and brain-teasing challenges, Devious Designs offers a fresh take on the puzzle genre, complete with a password system for progress tracking.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/devious-designs"}
