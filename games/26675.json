You control one character as they progress through the different eras of life on planet Earth, fighting turn-based battles with damage being based on stats that you control directly.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve pushed a stat to its uppermost limit, your character evolves into a completely different creature with different abilities in battle. The story itself is somewhat similar to Search for Eden, but much more fleshed out with a lot of different stories for each era that the game explores. And while Search for Eden ends with humanity as the pinnacle of evolution, The Theory of Evolution goes a bit further into the future\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 70151, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Jyee2aZhcjc"}]}
