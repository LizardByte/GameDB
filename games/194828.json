They are also tasked to complete eight gym challenges and defeat the Elite Four and its Champion by battling their Pok\u00e9mon. Along the way, they make two rivals: May or Brendan, the child of the Pok\u00e9mon Professor Birch, and Wally, a timid child from Petalburg who the player assists in catching his first Pok\u00e9mon, a Ralts. They also encounter Wallace, the Hoenn Region's Champion. Along their journey, they face both Team Magma and Team Aqua, who originally could only be faced in Ruby and Sapphire, respectively. Both have a goal to change the world they believe will benefit Pok\u00e9mon\u2014Magma desiring to expand the landmass and Aqua desiring to expand the sea\u2014and both plan to accomplish their respective goals by summoning the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. Both teams make repeated efforts to alter the landscape. Team Magma attempts to make a volcano erupt and Team Aqua tries to steal a weather-altering Pok\u00e9mon. Between the player's visit to the seventh and eighth gyms, both teams summon their respectively-sought legendary Pok\u00e9mon with mystical orbs stolen from Mt. Pyre; however, the Pok\u00e9mon refuse to obey either team and begin fighting, which puts the world in a constantly switching state of droughts and heavy rainfalls. The player climbs a tower in order to summon the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Rayquaza, who quells the other two Pok\u00e9mon's rage. After the player defeats the Elite Four, they are able to encounter two Pok\u00e9mon flying across Hoenn, Latias and Latios, and can access an area called the Battle Frontier, which adds several new challenges for the player.[5][6] The player gains access to a battle with former champion Steven Stone in Meteor Falls, who uses a powered-up version of his team in Ruby and Sapphire. The player is now able to catch Kyogre and Groudon, which can be tracked by talking to the scientist in the Weather Institute.", "summary": "Pok\u00e9mon Theta Emerald EX is a remake of the difficulty/enhancement rom hack Pok\u00e9mon Theta Emerald.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
