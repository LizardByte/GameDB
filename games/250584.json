Accompanied by a group of party members, Reimu is out to save the land from peril. Mugen no Spellcard, literally translated as Spellcard of Infinity, is a traditional turn-based RPG, influenced by SaGa Series and Dragon Quest. Players control a party of characters that can walk into towns and buy items to defeat monsters outside of the towns. Touhou Quest features a skill tree, a tiered skill system that typically branches out into multiple paths, giving the character the ability to perform a new action or giving a boost to one of the character's stats. Skill trees also affect characters attributes such as magic points, weapons, gold, etc. The weapon synthesis system from Touhou Soujinengi is back, so that players can forge stronger weapons.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-quest-mugen-no-spellcard"}
