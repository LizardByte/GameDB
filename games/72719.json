After his mother died an unexpected death, it left a deep emotional scar on him, which caused him to become very lonely and reserved. Due to this, Takuma and his uncle move from the city out into a rural area and Takuma is enrolled into a new junior-high school. At his new school, he meets several new girls, though three of whom he gets to know the most out of anyone else. They are, the firm and obstinate Hayami Kohinata, the kind and obliging Hinata Kagura, and the cheerful and mysterious Otoha. As Takuma interacts with these girls, his medical condition gradually begins to heal. \n \nAn updated release titled H2O \u221a after and another Complete story Edition was released in 2009, containing the story content from both H2O ~Footprints in the Sand~ and \u221a after and another combined into one game. \n \nOriginal H2O release contained: Hayami, Hinata and Otoha routes as well as their respective after stories (\u306f\u3084\u307f\u306e\u53cb\u9054, \u96ea\u306e\u632f\u308b\u9053, \u9b54\u6cd5\u5c11\u5973\u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u3072\u306a\u305f).
