And last year, the four members of KiLLER KiNG joined as a new addition.\n\nShining more and more each day, their presence in the industry is more prominent than ever.

If you close your eyes, you can still hear the voices of the 14 members echo in harmony throughout the venue.\n\nThat was step one towards greater success.
