{"id": "QobWrTtLWdM", "snippet": {"title": "Fairy Tail - Unison Raid | PS4", "description": "The story picks up at the conclusion of the popular Tenrou Island arc. Tenrou Island is known as holy ground to the FAIRY TAIL guild, a collection of mages who fight for glory and honor, and have now gathered together for a promotion ceremony to see who will become the next S-Class Mage. But after a frightening premonition comes true and the guild is ambushed by the evil Hades, the heroes jump into battle, launching an adventure that will take them from Tenrou Island to the Tartaros arc and beyond as they attempt to restore the FAIRY TAIL Guild to their rightful place of prominence. \n\nAnd if gamers aren\u2019t familiar with the beginning of FAIRY TAIL\u2019s story or fans of the anime/manga need a quick refresher, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you covered. As you walk through our beautifully animated 3D town of Magnolia, simply head down toward the river until you find the original FAIRY TAIL guild building (not the run down guild hall your current crew works out of). As you make your way down the stairs, you\u2019ll discover a special place that will bring a smile to the face of FAIRY TAIL fans -- a section of the building known as Lucy\u2019s House. To me, this is one of the coolest spots in the game as you can read character backgrounds and even catch up on the original FAIRY TAIL storylines (takes you from the beginning of the anime all the way up to where you\u2019re now playing in our game!). You\u2019ll also be able to view the various in-game cutscenes, listen to the game\u2019s soundtrack, and even make quick costume changes. Add to that the ability to get rewards for all the hidden candy the adorable Nikora collects on battlefields, and this is one room in the game you won\u2019t want to miss. \n\nBut Lucy\u2019s House isn\u2019t the only feature die-hard fans of the series will want to check out as we\u2019re also introducing a collection of all-new unison raids specially designed for the game by FAIRY TAIL creator and mastermind, Hiro Mashima. These powerful magic attacks chain together some of the most spectacular spells the guild has to offer. Check out this exclusive video to see some of the amazing action play out across Fiore, then get ready to cast your own spells when the game launches July 31.\n\nhttps://www.fairytailgame.com/us/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QobWrTtLWdM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QobWrTtLWdM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QobWrTtLWdM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QobWrTtLWdM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QobWrTtLWdM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fairy Tail - Unison Raid | PS4", "description": "The story picks up at the conclusion of the popular Tenrou Island arc.
