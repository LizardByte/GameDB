The game features 12 playable heroes, an extensive metagame progression hub (\u201cThe Altar of Hope\u201d), 10 companion pets with different run-defining properties, and optional thematic difficulty modifiers in the form of the Radiant and Infernal Flame equipable items for those who want less or more challenge. \n\nDarkest Dungeon II has been optimized to run on Switch and takes full advantage of the system's touchscreen.
