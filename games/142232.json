This story is built on the foundation that was pulled from the demo itself, and has you traverse Nihon, based on the entirety of Japan, while you collect badges and catch Pokemon. You'll also have to face off against Team Rocket, who are building a machine that would give them incredible power over Pokemon! Silver is portrayed in the manner that he was in the demo - not as an antagonist, but as an energetic rival, kind of similar to gen 4's Barry. The story is admittedly kind of simple, but intentionally so. It was written to feel like the story that might have been in the demo had it been completed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-super-gold-97"}
