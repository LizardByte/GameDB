The constant ridicule and persecution caused Gaou to become bitter, and hardened, eventually turning to a life as a murderous bandit. In spite of his wicked and corrupt lifestyle, Gaou met a woman who saw goodness in him, and the two were married. However, one day, over nothing more than a trifling disagreement, Gaou lost control of himself, and killed his wife. Realization of what he had done caused Gaou to deeply regret his wicked deeds, and reform his behavior. Gaou encountered a Buddhist monk who helped him change his ways, and discover his passion for sculpting. Renouncing his previous life of violence, Gaou became a Buddhist sculptor, devoting himself to the creation of magnificent sculptures renowned for the raw and powerful emotions he was able to invoke in his work. One day, together with a fellow sculptor Akanemaru, Gaou encountered a mythical phoenix, who, according to legend, can bestow eternal life to those who drink its blood. Inspired, Gaou devotes himself to the creation of a magnificent phoenix sculpture. However, shortly after finishing the sculpture, it was stolen from him, broken into 16 pieces, and hidden in different time periods of the past and the future. In order to recover the 16 phoenix sculpture pieces, Gaou embarked on a perilous journey that would take him through space and time.", "summary": "Hi no Tori Hououhen: Gaou no Bouken is a licensed action platformer with block placing mechanics, based on Osamu Tezuka's Hi no Tori manga series."}
