A year into its mission, after a confusing burst of static about 'light' and 'angels', the Endeavour was never heard from again.

As the Ensign, you must explore fetid hallways and abandoned facilities, scavenging for parts and blueprints, expanding your arsenal to up to four deadly weapons and freely customize each to fit your combat style against intelligent, reactive enemies. Dark Matter delivers a hard-hitting take on the survival horror genre in deep space, with a heavy emphasis on tactical combat and exploration.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WbPirB-DGRk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WbPirB-DGRk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WbPirB-DGRk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Dark Matter Release Trailer", "description": "Dark Matter (http://j.mp/DrkMttr_GOG), DRM-free on GOG.com!\n\nThe Endeavour was a deep space exploration vessel, tasked with exploring an anomaly at the edge of our galaxy.
