In an effort to return to his original form, the story begins. After the main antagonist is beaten, your character will progress in one of two ways. Despite the warnings at the beginning of the game, if you use your magic in reckless amounts, it will corrupt you easily. If you do not, however, you will advance to a more direct path to the final boss, heading through Balmwood Haven. No matter which path you go down, you will miss something from the other. This guarantees a certain amount of replay value.", "summary": "Knight's Quest is a tight, easy-to-control introduction or new challenge for new players and veterans respectively to the genre of bullet hell. There are several, engaging mechanics to look out for and many new friends to meet along the way. \n   In every level (unless you are playing through the Hard-core mode), you will start out with three health points represented through Apples in the top-left corner of the screen. Once the level has been completed, those Apples will regenerate. If you are in the middle of an encounter with a boss, however, your apples will not regenerate until the encounter has come to an end. Throughout the game, your character is surrounded by a box. As objects approach you, you must dodge and come up with cunning ways to avoid projectiles in short amounts of time. In some rooms, the dimensions of the box will distort, creating more complex layouts and levels simultaneously. \n   If you know the game front to back, it should only take around 40-60 minutes. However, for a new player, it will likely take 4-5 hours. Of course, Adventure mode isn't the only thing to do, nor will a second play-through seem stale immediately. Once adventure mode is completed, it is suggested to complete your collection, and fight the secret/final boss. \n   The game auto-saves upon entering a new area, and the room before a boss. Text will appear in the bottom-right corner to notify the player that it is currently auto-saving.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 27238, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "jN8PN6tJi0s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN8PN6tJi0s", "title": "Knight's Quest", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jN8PN6tJi0s/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
