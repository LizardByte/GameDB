It is primarily focused on teaching the player to play go like the pros, with the meikan (or directory) in this case being a list of techniques and tactics. As with all versions of go, the goal is to surround the opposing player's pieces, thereby capturing them and removing them from the board. The winner is whoever has the most pieces on the board left when both players have stopped taking turns (usually because there's no more legal moves).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/igo-meikan"}
