If you dream of a life in the countryside and a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, if you want to recall the holiday time you\u2019ve spent with your grandparents or simply try your luck as a Junior Farmer, this game is for you. In Everdream Valley you will get the chance to direct the actions of an 11-year-old boy spending his summer holiday at his grandparents\u2019 farm. \n\nBy day, the Junior Farmer will have to help his guardians run the farm. This means taking care of your very own vegetable patch. Searching for parasites destroying crops, holes in the fence or broken agricultural tools, and reporting all issues to grandparents. It\u2019s also very important to make friends with the farm\u2019s long-time resident, The Cat, so he starts hunting pests or chasing away the birds that feed on the fruits and grain. All while not forgetting to train The Dog that accompanies you to live in the country, herd the sheep or scare away wolfpacks threatening the farm. \n\nBy night, however, you will experience some fantastic dreams featuring original, animal-related minigames. And if successful in all challengers, you will be awarded with the materials, equipment, and furnishings needed to build your very own treehouse!\n\nBecome a Junior Farmer now \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf3e \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1403650/Everdream_Valley\n\ud83c\udf3e http://everdreamvalley.com/\n\ud83c\udf3e https://www.facebook.com/EverdreamValley\n\ud83c\udf3e https://twitter.com/EverdreamValley", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hYB9RB_8vE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hYB9RB_8vE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hYB9RB_8vE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hYB9RB_8vE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hYB9RB_8vE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Everdream Valley - Announcement Trailer Gamescom 2020", "description": "Everdream Valley is a unique experience that mixes adventure with RPG and sim elements.
