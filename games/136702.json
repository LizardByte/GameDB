To make matters worse, he falls into some sort of love triangle with two beautiful girls, leaving his fate up in the air.\n\nUnlike other dating simulations, where your goal is to get girls to fall in love with you, in Death Match Love Comedy, you\u2019ll be doing everything you can to avoid just that, as you try to figure out the reason behind the love-fueled explosions.\n\nAdditionally, there will be another mysterious phenomenon, such as angels, a friend who has some sort of prediction, weird dreams and whispers, and a strange pink cat-like creature.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/death-match-love-comedy", "videos": [{"id": 49377, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4QBmnD_tA8s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QBmnD_tA8s", "title": "\u300e\u30c7\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30c1\u30e9\u30d6\u30b3\u30e1\uff01\u300fPV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4QBmnD_tA8s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 135294, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "4uHg3yAyxnY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uHg3yAyxnY", "title": "Death Match Love Comedy! | Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4uHg3yAyxnY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
