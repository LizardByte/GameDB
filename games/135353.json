The thaw brings unexpected experiences, help your friends to feel as good as you in this new season! \n \n \nThis game is made using Unreal Engine 4 during the 2020 Unreal Spring Jam. \n \n \nEvery single asset in this game was made during the Jam by a single developer, me, Francisco Fuhro and the development was streamed on twitch. There was around 70 hours of work put on this game, no crunches, no late or early morning bed. It was an awesome experience! Surprisingly, the game is also under 100mb of download! Play the game and enjoy!"}
