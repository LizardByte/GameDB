Enough digging and an external clip later, and I almost pieced together the entire presentation for the game at Spaceworld 2001!\n\nSource Videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rLhIwp2iGk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66_xvhHdCv4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HD00DuVxKc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcnaC_9qpLs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dePt5wTOPr4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cP-83WRRQ\n\nThere is also this clip, which likely fit into the first cut somewhere, but it seems strange given that two clips featuring the level starting exist.  In hindsight, I probably should have included it instead since it features more of the stage.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXRxaz7SzpI\n\nI'm not really in a position do do anything about the lost quality.  If you know about more clips that I didn't find, I'd love to add them!\n\nEdit 4/14/2020\nI found a recording of the full presentation.
