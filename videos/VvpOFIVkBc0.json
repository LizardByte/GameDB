Travel to different parts of Duck City and play mini games that encourage logic, interactivity and IT skills development. Released on CD-Rom for Windows 3.1 and Macintosh computers in 1996.\n\nDuck City is a wacky and fun collection of 6 action and puzzle games designed for kids of all ages. Designed by Alan Snow. Duck City stars a talking cartoon duck who wanders around in his cartoon world, getting into one trouble after another. In one mini-game that is similar to basketball, you will see how a duck can pull off spectacular slam dunks. In the farm, you must fatten slugs by feeding them cabbages. The barber shop is the site of one of the game's most unique games: here, you cut and dry customers' hair to make cool haircuts. In the garage, you can participate in a fun cross-country racing. And finally in a lab, you can tinker with various gadgets and interact with RoboDuck, a cross between RoboCop and a duck.\n\nGames included are:\n\n\u2022 SlamDuck\n\u2022 RoboDuck\n\u2022 All Terrain Duck\n\u2022 Ducklab\n\u2022 SnipSnip\n\u2022 Slug Farm\nLooking for ways to capture your game footage for your Youtube channel or live stream?
