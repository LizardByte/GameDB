However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.\n\n\"Elysion\" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
