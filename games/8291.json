The game incorporates many characters from non-Rincewind Discworld adventures, such as Nanny Ogg, The Ankh-Morpork guards, Cut-me-own-throat Dibbler, Trolls, the Patrician and Death.", "summary": "Discworld is a game released for PC (subsequently Mac, and Playstation) by Teeny Weeny / Perfect 10 studios in 1995. The game was released both on floppy disk and CD-Rom. The latter featured a commentary team created of many veterans of famous Brit-Coms. This included Monty Python's Eric Idle, Radio 4's (later to be more famous) Rob Brydon, ex- Doctor Who John Pertwee, 70s pop singer Kate Robbins, and Blackadder star Tony Robinson. The game is a riff on the Discworld title 'Guards, Guards', however many elements of the text have been shifted, not least the inclusion of Rincewind as protagonist.\n\nThe game featured puzzles which were considered far too difficult and obtuse for gamers of the time, but the game itself has had a lasting legacy, now being accepted into such emulators as SCUMMVM.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "characters": [{"id": 6641, "name": "Rincewind"}, {"id": 1141, "gender": 2, "name": "Voice Talent", "species": 5}]}
