Each of the shards is a little world unto itself, with geography and denizens of its own. The power over the shards is bitterly contested by Masters, the immortal beings mortals believe to be gods.\n\nTake the role of a mighty Master and shape the destiny of Eador, on land and within the astral plane itself. Explore the land and rule provinces as you see fit, defend them, and keep the populace in line or they may rebel. Choose from thousands of items--swords, spells, weapons, armor, and more--to outfit the heroes you recruit so they may best meet any challenge. Keep your heroes healthy and they will grow stronger as they gain experience from battle. Forge alliances and engage in the delicate art of diplomacy as you negotiate trade agreements or wage war against a mutual foe. Eador with its many wonders and adventures awaits, will you answer the call?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eador-genesis", "videos": [{"id": 79667, "video_id": "JYpCurjIxV0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYpCurjIxV0", "title": "Eador: Genesis trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYpCurjIxV0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
