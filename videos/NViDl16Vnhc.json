Basically... the more excess damage you do past what's required to destroy a robot, the more Scrap Coins you get when it is defeated. \n\nIf you only barely beat a robot, you'll get nothing. But if the finishing blow is devastating, you'll get 1, 2, 3, or maybe even more Scrap Coins. This is the main method of gaining money in the expansion, so it really does encourage you to get very strong, and to fight many enemies. \n\nThese clips were made for Dawko's WWF Charity Stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfC024iDNqg\n\nPOPGOES Arcade: https://gamejolt.com/games/arcade/478668\n\nJoin my membership to access my Discord server and check out exclusive content: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kanecarter", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NViDl16Vnhc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NViDl16Vnhc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NViDl16Vnhc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NViDl16Vnhc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NViDl16Vnhc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "POPGOES Arcade Premium - Clip #4/Final - \"Overkill\"", "description": "Wishlist POPGOES Arcade on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1986840/POPGOES_Arcade/\n\nA new mechanic in POPGOES and The Machinist is something called \"OVERKILL\".
