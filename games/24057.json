It is the sequel to Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2, and is the sixth game in the Dragon Quest Monsters series. It was released in Japan on March 24, 2016.\n\nThe top screen of the Nintendo 3DS shows a third-person perspective of the main character and the world around him, called \"Break World\", while the bottom screen shows a map of the nearby area, with the current goal circled in red. The protagonist carries a device known as a Reactor, which can be used to discover hidden objects or paths. Some paths require the player to be riding a monster to traverse. Players will be able to ride on the 500 different monsters that populate the game world. The monsters come in either land, sea, or sky varieties, meaning that different types monsters are required to traverse different paths. Players can also equip them with accessories and level them up.\n\nLeveling up a monster can give it new abilities, such as the ability to do more jumps in a row and therefore access areas previously out of reach. The Reactor device can also be used to scan monsters to discover information about them. If the player attacks a monster while riding, the other monster begins the battle stunned or knocked out. A competitive mini-game is included called \"Great Riders Cup\" that uses the monster riding system of the main game and allows up to four players to compete either with the game AI or with local players or others over Wifi. The games protagonist can be visually customized with different color for hair, scarf, boots, pants, and gloves. Monsters can also be color customized by finding and rescuing a monster called Color Fondue who can perform \"Color Fusion\" on monsters a player controls.\n\nAs with the previous game, Square Enix released Joker 3 Professional, an expanded version of the game, on February 9, 2017. Professional is the final entry in the Joker series.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-quest-monsters-joker-3", "videos": [{"id": 9960, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KhRuhmFPCgw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhRuhmFPCgw", "title": "\u300e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\uff13\u300f\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6620\u50cf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KhRuhmFPCgw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9961, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "925D87DHuho", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=925D87DHuho", "title": "\u300e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\uff13\u300f\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u6620\u50cf\u2461", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/925D87DHuho/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9962, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cBFXn_rlnBQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBFXn_rlnBQ", "title": "\u300e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\uff13\u3000\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u300f\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u6620\u50cf\u2460", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cBFXn_rlnBQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
