With summer break over, a new semester of fall events awaits. There\u2019s the annual academy festival, the sports meet\u2014the list goes on! As I walk to class on my first day, my heart races in anticipation at what my new campus life will be like. That is, until students start approaching me a short distance from the campus gate\u2026 You see, Ainoshima Academy has two student councils that are always vying against each other. Here, let me break it down for you real quick:\n\nGekka Council: Steeped in history and tradition, Gekka is as old as the academy itself. Its supporters wear uniforms featuring flowing, dark-green skirts for added noblesse.\n\nGekka President Alicetia: \u201cJoin Gekka\u2026 Let\u2019s be friends\u2026\u201d\n\nTendo Council: Tendo is a new student council that was formed after Gekka. Its supporters prefer a dress style that incorporates the latest in uniform chic, including burgundy bolero jackets, pleated miniskirts, and neckties.\n\nTendo President Usagi: \u201cJoin Tendo\u2014let\u2019s get this academy inspired!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, various student associations have been involved in a proxy war, with the sports teams supporting Gekka and the liberal arts clubs backing Tendo. Before I transferred, the student vote was split evenly between them, which means my vote will be the one that decides who gets the majority! Word has it that a similar deadlock happened six years ago, and it was a transfer student who broke it. Coincidence, huh? Anyway, as you can imagine, since day one of me moving here, neither faction will give me a moment\u2019s peace! This isn\u2019t how my sister said it would be at all\u2026?!\n\nGekka Vice President Mashiro: \u201cI wish the sports jocks and liberal arts gang could just get along.\u201d\n\nTendo Secretary Tateha: \u201cWith your vote, something might actually change around here.\u201d\n\nI was planning to live my new campus life in peace, but as the academy\u2019s 777th student, the entire student population is watching my every move. Being 777 might sound like the jackpot, but the way things are going, I just might be the unluckiest guy here\u2026\n\nWith two student councils to deal with, plus the ongoing proxy war, my new life at Ainoshima Academy is already off to a challenging start!", "summary": "As new rivalries and old divisions threaten to split Ainoshima apart once again, only a new \u201cTriple Seven\u201d can restore peace once more!
