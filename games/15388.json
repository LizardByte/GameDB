Arena Wars is a single and multiplayer game.\n\nMultiplayer supports up to 8 players, who can fight against each other and challenge other players from all around the world via the AW Server, whilst the single player mode is loaded with action-packed single player missions against one or more computer opponents.\n\nThere are 3 different game modes: Capture the Flag, Bombing Run and Double Domination. In AW the goal is not simply to destroy the enemy's base or units. To score points in the various scenarios you must complete objectives that range from stealing the enemy flag, carrying a bomb into your enemy's base or seize and hold Domination zones for a period of time. The winner is the player who satisfies that particular game's objectives. For example, in a Capture the Flag game with a 'capture limit' of 5, the winner is the first player to capture 5 enemy flags.", "videos": [{"id": 50169, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oJ3QyZZ0F7I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ3QyZZ0F7I", "title": "Arena Wars PC Games Trailer - Trailer.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oJ3QyZZ0F7I/sddefault.jpg"}]}
