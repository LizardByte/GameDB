These 5 are the ones responsible for putting an end to Eggman's plans this time around.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog: The blue blur filled with attitude, Sonic's always itching to embark on a new venture! With the prolonged absence of Dr. Eggman after their last battle, he starts to gain a false sense of security during his vacation, little does he know of what was to come...\n\nMiles \"Tails\" Prower: Sonic's closest ally and most trusted friend, this curious fox is always willing to follow alongside Sonic in his adventures! After scanning the badniks that disturbed their vacation, Tails (alongside Sonic) make haste for their source location, Dr. Eggman!\n\nKnuckles the Echidna: The steadfast protector of Angel Island and the Master Emerald. Knuckles quickly caught on to Dr. Eggman's resurfacing with the badniks that attacked Angel Island. None of them coming to target the Master Emerald raised Knuckles' suspicion well enough. Understanding what this meant, Knuckles meets up with Sonic and co. to take Dr. Eggman down for good.\n\nFang the Sniper: This cunning weasel always has a plan to make himself a bountiful profit (most of them to his detriment...). Fang didn't take too kindly to being abandoned in the Atomic Destroyer by Dr. Eggman, so he's teamed up with Sonic and co. to take him down... for purely selfish reasons and rewards, of course!\n\nTunnel the Mole: This excitable young mole is adventurous and always up for a challenge! After noticing the abnormalities of Illusion Island caused by Dr. Eggman, Tunnel makes the decision himself to follow Sonic and co.'s trail after deciphering they're to be trusted to get to the bottom of what's going on!", "summary": "Sonic Galactic is a 2D fan-game inspired by the Classics. Taking a more \"Saturn\" approach with its art direction, Galactic aims to be a sort of continuation to where the classics left off. Aiming to follow the classics, Galactic features new zones, brand new sprites, and a new character! This energetic mole is more than willing to join the team in their battle against Dr. Eggman!\n\nThis has been a fan-game under the works for about 3 years, and is currently using Hatch Game Engine, an engine built from the ground up with accuracy perfectly replicating the classics.", "videos": [{"id": 62577, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xUr5ajmJ8W4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUr5ajmJ8W4", "title": "Sonic Galactic SAGE 2020 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xUr5ajmJ8W4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62578, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BNPVYZCxr1g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNPVYZCxr1g", "title": "Sonic Galactic: Sonic is fucking balling", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BNPVYZCxr1g/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
