Episodes on Google. I never even knew this game even existed. The only Golgo 13 game I thought existed was Golgo 13 on the Nintendo Entertainment System which was released in 1988 by Vic Tokai. Golgo 13 on the NES was the only reason I even know about Golgo 13. \n\nThe game itself is basically a shooting gallery game where you snipe targets with a light rifle. Not all the scenes are sniping scenes, there are some scenes where you shoot multiple people in semi-auto mode. During the mission briefing, you see a comic book scene. I can't read it, because I cannot read Japanese, but the original Golgo 13 series was based on a comic book character. The Golgo 13 comic was a series of comic books that were written in 1968, and they are still published today. They even turned Golgo 13 into feature length anime movies in the 1980s and 1990s, and T.V. shows in 2008 to 2009. I did watch Golgo 13 the anime Golgo 13 T.V. shows which aired on the Anime Network on cable T.V..  The T.V. series had 50 episodes, and I saw every episode. \n\nGolgo 13's character is a typical Japanese character, he is neither good or bad. The man never smiles, he has a very calm and silent persona. I did watch Japanese some T.V. shows back in the 1980s and 1990s on NHK with English subtitles, mostly like Samurai shows. Duke Togo is a man who works for the very wealthy and powerful people. He is a man who takes contracts and carries out his deeds without a second thought, he rarely fails in taking out his victims. He has no regrets, and he is very business like in his demeanor. When I played this game, I failed in some missions that is because I am not Golgo 13!   \n\nThe game is a bit short on game play, but the stories are long. Sorry I couldn't translate the text, I can't read, speak, or write Japanese. It would be interesting to understand the text. The game's difficulty varies from mission to mission, some shots are very difficult while others are very easy. \n\nGolgo 13 is a late 1990s game, so it has 3d acceleration. The graphics isn't as good as today's 3d graphics, but for a late 1990s game it was very good. The game used polygons, and other geometric shapes like modern graphics cards but with much less fill rates, and textures. The character textures look very crude, but the buildings and other objects look great. The comic graphics is very good, 2d graphics was at its pinnacle in the late1990s. \n\nI am got a chance to play this game.
