Once again you play as the legendary Bugs Bunny as he explores the mysterious Crazy Castle in search of the mother lode of carrots. The castle has all-new rooms with all-new puzzles, so prepare yourself for even more hare-brained action than the last time around. The Crazy Castle is chock-full of hazards and traps that will end your merry little jaunt in a hurry, so keep a sharp eye out. In order to test your reflexes as well as your wits, several Warner Bros. cartoon characters have returned to make Bugs's life that much more difficult! Fight off Sylvester, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd, Tweety Bird, and the Tazmanian Devil with one of your weapons, or just turn tail and run as fast as you can. Naturally, the game comes complete with a password function so you can explore the floors at your leisure once you've cleared them.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bugs-bunny-crazy-castle-3", "videos": [{"id": 51487, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PBum6K2TiVY"}]}
