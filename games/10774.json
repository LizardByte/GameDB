Renowned as the linchpin of civilization and the cultural centre of Europe, Venice was the most important trading post between Western Europe and the eastern stretch of the Mediterranean Sea. It was also the stage for political corruptions and clandestine dealings.\n\nThis is where your story begins. As a young man striving for success, power and wealth and with the support of your family, you begin to build up a trading empire across Genua, Tripoli, Rome, Alexandria and Constantinople in addition to many other significant cities from the Renaissance. As you progress through the ranks of Venetian society, increasing your power with smart trading moves and calling in the occasional favour you can begin to assemble your own fleet. With this you will start to build up new production facilities, test yourself in challenging sea battles where you will face off against pirates as well as political enemies to finally become the Doge of Venice.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-venice", "videos": [{"id": 5291, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SRdm5Pm1MY0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdm5Pm1MY0", "title": "Rise of Venice - Launch Trailer (US)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SRdm5Pm1MY0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1434, "name": "Rise of Venice"}]}
