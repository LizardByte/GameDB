It's now a beat 'em up that plays similarly to games like Burning Fight and Robo Army, but with a rubber-suited movie monster theme. Pretty sweet, right?\n\nI personally think that it's a blast. It's not a particularly great game - KotM 2 is short, lacks any sort of variety, and includes an obnoxious boss rush during the final stage - but it's *fun*, especially in two-player mode. \n\nIt feels like a Godzilla game should feel. Playing as your pick of *not Godzilla*, *not Ultraman*, and *not cyborg King Kong*, you get to piledrive gross mutant things, rip skyscrapers up by the roots to use them as weapons, stomp suspension bridges - all sorts of stuff that you'd expect of a hundred-story tall lizard who occasionally likes to treat himself to leisurely strolls through densely populated metropolitan areas.\n\nThe monster design is pretty fantastic here. Some of these bosses are pretty horrifying, and they all react well to whatever damage you subject them to. The backgrounds look great, too, though everything suffers somewhat from the cuts made in the port to the  SNES. The characters are smaller and have fewer frames of animation, the backgrounds have lost some detail, and the tag-team mode and a couple of the selectable characters are missing. Of course that's to be expected when a game starts life as a 74 megabit Neo Geo cartridge and is then condensed to fit a 16 megabit SNES cartridge, but the omissions are still a bit disappointing. \n\nHowever, the missing features aren't enough to really drag it down too much. Though shallow, King of the Monsters 2 is still a great arcade-style brawler that provides the means to live out some of your most destructive childhood fantasies. \n\nAnd that last boss - so gross!
