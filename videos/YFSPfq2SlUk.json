Planned for released for 2013, Wargame: AirLand Battle will bring the series to a brand new dimension. Today's video gives a glimpse of the spectacular new features to come!\n\nJust like its predecessor, Wagame: AirLand Battle takes players through a series of conflicts commanding NATO and Warsaw Pact troops between 1975 & 1985 at a turning point of the Cold War. In this episode, war rages in Northern Europe, notably Scandinavia, whose architecture and magnificent landscapes are faithfully recreated in the game. Wargame: AirLand Battle allows players to command all military resources of the Cold War era from tanks to planes. A total of 150 planes strengthen the playable arsenal of the game, from fighters to bombers to electronic warfare planes. Four new nations and their vehicles join the original eight from the first installment, making a total of over 750 vehicles and combat units rendered in realistic detail! Wargame: AirLand Battle also brings authenticity to the next level thanks to a new weapons system, better handling of fire effects, and a new Urban Combat Interface (UCI) allowing for battle inside cities.\n\nThe solo campaign is composed of several new dynamic campaigns, during which players manage all aspects of battle by leading each squad of the Theater of Operation and making good use of reinforcements and strategic support. Wargame: AirLand Battle still allows customization of armies in solo and multiplayer modes thanks to the 'Deck' system, which is now being enhanced with an integrated 'viewer'. Ultimately, each decision made will have an impact on the tactical outcome of battles and evolution of the global conflict! Prepare to re-enter the Cold War in 2013!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFSPfq2SlUk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFSPfq2SlUk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFSPfq2SlUk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFSPfq2SlUk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YFSPfq2SlUk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wargame: Airland Battle - First Teaser", "description": "More info on : http://www.wargame-ee.com/\nDevblog: http://devblog.wargame-ab.com/\n\nWargame: AirLand Battle, is unveiled for the first time in this teaser video !
