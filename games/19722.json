After getting through Horizon Heights, Sonic encounters a small robot resembling Tails. It then activates and attacks Sonic, and after a brief duel, it's revealed to be a trap by Eggman. Sonic is trapped in a magnetic forcefield, unable to stop Eggman from stealing the Chaos Emeralds. Just before Eggman could get his hands on them, Tails knocked the emeralds away, sending them back to the Special Zone in the process. Eggman then makes a hasty retreat to his temporary base, Storm Station Zone, with Sonic and Tails in hot pursuit.", "summary": "Sonic: After the Sequel (abbreviated Sonic ATS), is a fan game created by LakeFeperd that is meant to explain the events that may have taken place between Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic 3 and Knuckles.
