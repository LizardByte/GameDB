In all versions of the game, the events take place in the Valdi System, where an evil space pirate, Kaiser Greedy, has used mind control to make the planets' leaders obey him.\n\nIn the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Planet Neer (Flora in the English-language version) pray for a hero before Greedy's mind control minion, Rhio, snatches the planet elder. The desperate prayers reach the nebula of the Star Goddess, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world in the galaxy to restore peace to the galaxy.\n\nIn the English-language version, Oruto is omitted altogether. Instead, Ristar has a father figure, the Legendary Hero, who is a shooting star that protects the Valdi System. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the Legendary Hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well.", "summary": "Ristar is a platform game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis in 1995. A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, Ristar, was also released, which shared similar themes while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics. The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released the game a number of times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ristar", "videos": [{"id": 136382, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "M2ZKPiwo2J4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2ZKPiwo2J4", "title": "Ristar (Genesis) - Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2ZKPiwo2J4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
