On the bright side, donut burgers and peanut butter cups will be served.\n\nThe dozens of ships act as templates in which you can equip the hundreds of unique abilities. The possibilities for different builds are almost infinite, but you can jump straight into the action in one of the 30 unlockable pre-customized ships. Many of Ring Runner's abilities were inspired by modern fantasy RPGs, so you can expect more than rockets, lasers, and barrel rolls. You can do everything from summoning comets and swinging gamma hammers to slowing time.\n\nSeamless host migration allows you to drop in and out of multiplayer matches without ever having to wait in a lobby. You can play most of the 6 scenarios either alone, cooperatively, or competitively online. There's even local 2-player coop - one pilot, one gunner, one ship. \n\nThe multiplayer scenarios are procedurally generated, so every time you can expect a different challenge. The backgrounds are procedural as well, giving you a fresh starscape every mission.\n\nRing Runner also has tons of options for customization. You can play with a gamepad, a mouse and keyboard, or a trackpad. You can turn on and off most UI elements and remap your controls any way you like. There's even an option to add a list of your favorite sounds, like movie quotes or sound effects, to be played when you defeat an opponent.\n\nThe included expansion, Space Defense League, brings the fast paced fun of MOBA games, like League of Legends and DotA, into space. But it's Ring Runner's Newtonian-physics-driven game play that really adds a new dimension.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4IO04UTpMk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4IO04UTpMk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4IO04UTpMk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4IO04UTpMk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i4IO04UTpMk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ring Runner - Indie Game - Trailer HD", "description": "Ring Runner is an indie space shooter RPG, six years in the making.\n\nIts 20-30 hour long story driven campaign is set in the same rich universe as the Ring Runner novel, Derelict Dreams.
