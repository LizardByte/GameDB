You'll need to explore, hunt for supplies, uncover clues, and fight your way through each anomaly \u2013 each consisting of semi-procedurally generated instances where both the environment, and the undead, are out to kill you! Immediately after the events of Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, you find yourself trapped within the remains of Arzt Memorial Hospital \u2013 the hub to organize your inventory and storage cache, level up your character, or just to take a breather before venturing back out into the chaos. There\u2019s more to discover in the world besides murderous hordes of the undead \u2013 find the journals scattered about to learn more about the outbreak and ultimately where to find refuge! Don\u2019t think death can save you \u2013 every time you die, you'll awake trapped in this nexus. Outbreak: Endless Nightmares focuses on extreme replayability by offering multiple character options \u2013 each with their own abilities, upgrade paths and more! Each time you venture into the anomaly, it\u2019ll change and become increasingly difficult as you grow in power. You'll need to think carefully about what weapons, healing items, and other supplies you'll bring along. If you're lucky, you may find storage caches that give you access to your expanded inventory, and offer an opportunity to restock. But it's all on you to search your environment for supplies.
