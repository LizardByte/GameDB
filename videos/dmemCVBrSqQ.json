Therefore, this version of the mod might break on the Android version. For the 1.1 release, there will be a soundless version of the mod. Additionally, you can check the repository of the Android port for the current progress regarding audio files https://github.com/robertkirkman/sm64ex-coop/issues/2\n\n-Q: Is this PC port only?\n-A: Currently yes, specifically sm64ex-coop. the entire mod is written in Lua which is not exactly the same the decompiled C code of the game. But I do have some plans in the future to make a full romhack out of this for n64 emulators. The assets that matter the most (animations, models) can be ported easily. But this won't be done anytime soon.
