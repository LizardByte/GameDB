More information and the latest updates you can find on http://patreon.com/cutepixel \n \nEscape form Titan is a mixture of survival and RPG.

Your goal will be to escape from Titan, and if possible, and save some of the prisoners in this place people. \n \nBriefly about the features of the current version: \n \n- At the moment the game is completely without sound. The voice acting is being prepared and in the next versions it will certainly appear. \n- The saving system has not yet been implemented. In the case of the death of a character, all game progress is lost and the game will have to start anew. However, do not despair, because at the moment the gameplay will take 10-15 minutes :) \n- As mentioned above, there may be numerous glitches, errors and other amenities of the alpha version. I will be glad to hear about all such finds in the comments here. \n \nGame Management: \n \nAWSD - movement \nSpace - Jump \nRight mouse button hold - overview \nW + Left Shift - running \nE - use, pick up \nR - hack \nEsc - main menu \nP - character parameters window \nG - settings window \nM - map \nKeys 1-6 - use the item in the appropriate cell inventory \nKeys 1-6 + Left Shift - discard an item from the corresponding inventory cell", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/escape-from-titan", "videos": [{"id": 23682, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "yL6EzbhDgd8"}]}
