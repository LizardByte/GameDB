Also on screen is a piece of cargo orbiting the same star and you must adjust the speed of your craft by moving inwards and outwards to catch it.\n\nSniper: A man appears on the screen in one of ten positions and you must press one of the number keys 1 to 0 where you think he is on screen.\n\nMeteors: You control a craft on the top of the screen and you must move left or right through a meteor storm that moves up the screen.\n\nLife: A program that was devised by J. H. Conway in 1970 and allows you to see a pattern come to life and hopefully grow. You place cells on a 16 x 16 grid and when you are happy with your placements you can let it come to life. Three cells adjacent to each other produces a cell, two or three neighbours, the cells survive and one or more than three cells, the cells die.\n\nWolfpack: You control a ship on the top of the screen left or right, and you must drop a depth charge to hit a submarine below moving across the screen right to left. You only have one depth charge per sub and when the sub reaches the edge of the screen it has escaped.\n\nGolf: You must hit a ball into a hole at a random distance by selecting the range from 35 to 75.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/games-1"}
