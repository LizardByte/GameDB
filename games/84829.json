He came to Ascalia with his most valued possessions, including the powerful Grimoire that will open new possibilities for you and your friends. \n \nThe Grimoire allows players to challenge themselves in randomly generated battles in return for additional visual customization options for the party members. It is divided into chapters and within the Grimoire, the kid gloves are off - all sorts of unexpected combinations can happen. Do you know what would happen if you were to fight the Dwarven Ashigaru and the Visage of Anguish at the same time? What if the Fomorian Ancient allied itself with the Mau? These battles will thoroughly test your skills - and sanity. \nFighting within the Grimoire takes no in-game time (they do not advance the calendar) and can be played anytime you want, right from the point when you build the Mystic's Tower for Bassanius. \n \nThe Unending Grimoire DLC comes with: \n- A whole new activity - the Grimoire \n- An entirelyl new feature - Visual Customization for Characters \n- 39 character skins to unlock! \n- New battlegrounds for the Grimoire battles \n- A new villager to recruit - Bassanius the Mystic \n- A new building to construct - Mystic's Tower \n- A new Personal Bond to pursue \n- New cutscenes with additional voiceover\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
