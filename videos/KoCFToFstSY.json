{"id": "KoCFToFstSY", "snippet": {"title": "Tetris Game Sample -- Philips CD-i", "description": "OH!!! Most people probably didn't see this coming... Philips CD-i footage. We've already had a nice little collection of CD-i games for years such as \"Zelda: Wand of Gamelon\", \"Zelda's Adventure\", \"Chaos Control\", and several others, but it wasn't until recently that we ordered a system online so we can put up footage of the darn thing. Now we're putting up good quality footage of these games recorded from original hardware doing the best we can to play with its godawful two button paddle-style controller. Hooray!! Anyway, enough with the introduction-- let's start talking about some CD-i games! We'll begin with the classic game of \"Tetris\".\n\nIf you've played one Tetris, you've practically played them all. Tetris for the Philips CD-i is mostly like any other Tetris game out there, except with pretty limited options, nature-themed level backdrops (which change along with your speed as you clear more lines), a high-quality CD soundtrack that's mostly calm and peaceful (but doesn't capture the feel of the original game... sounds like a Pure Moods CD), and no competitive or multiplayer features in which to speak of. The game also differs in the sense that the game flow is interrupted by the shifts in levels as it has to load new animating backgrounds and, for whatever reason, adjust the position of the playing area (likely to show the most interesting aspects of the background elements). It's not an ideal Tetris game, but it does look great for its time and was one of the more enjoyable early CD-i games, before it shifted its focus to becoming more of a gaming machine. Thankfully, with the exception of a little lag, it's also easy to play with the controller. This is a video showing the game in action, purposely delaying certain actions or not clearing certain lines to prolong the playing of the music. The game naturally has no sound effects... weird.
