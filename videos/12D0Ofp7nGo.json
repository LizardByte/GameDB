The Godfather (I) is a very captivating game released in 2006 by Electronic Arts pretty much following the action from the movie series with the same name. Enjoy!\n\nGame Info:\nThe Godfather is a 2006 open world action-adventure video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. Originally released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows, it was later released for the PlayStation Portable (as The Godfather: Mob Wars), Xbox 360 (as The Godfather: The Game), Wii (as The Godfather: Blackhand Edition), and PlayStation 3 (as The Godfather: The Don's Edition).\n\nThe game is based upon the 1972 film of the same name, and tells the story of an original character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. His actions in the game often take the form of events that happened off screen in the film; for example, he avenges Bonasera's daughter, he drives Vito Corleone to the hospital after he is shot, he plants the gun for Michael Corleone to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he places the horse's head in Jack Woltz's bed. Although the game was condemned by Francis Ford Coppola, who claimed Paramount never told him about its development or asked for his input, it does feature voice acting from several stars of the film, including James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. Marlon Brando also recorded dialogue for Vito Corleone, in what would be his final acting job, but his ill health made most of his recordings unusable. Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone in the film, is absent in both likeness and voice, choosing to lend his image instead to Scarface: The World Is Yours.\n\nPlease comment & rate!\n\nSubscribe for more classic games videos!\n\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/igcent\n\nCheck out our website: http://www.igcent.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12D0Ofp7nGo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12D0Ofp7nGo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12D0Ofp7nGo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12D0Ofp7nGo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/12D0Ofp7nGo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Godfather PC Gameplay HD", "description": "The Godfather PC Gameplay.
