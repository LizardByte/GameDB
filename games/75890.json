Each page contains multiple kaiju, which can be clicked on and interacted with. This causes some kaiju to perform different animations, while with some kaiju it will activate minigames. The player is in control of Godzilla.\n\nThe first page is a forest, and features Sanda, Gaira, Gorosaurus, Mothra, Kamacuras, Kumonga, Dogora, two Biollantes and the Cosmos. Clicking on Godzilla causes him to dance, after which everyone on the page will applaud. Eventually, a large spotted egg will drop down onto the screen, startling everyone on the page. If Godzilla interacts with the egg, it will hatch into Little Godzilla. Interacting with Sanda and Gaira causes them to punch and kick each other. Interacting with the Biollantes causes them to briefly shift from their rose forms to their final forms and roar at Godzilla. Interacting with the Cosmos causes them to sing, which will briefly summon Mothra onto the screen, who roars and flies offscreen again. Occasionally, Kumonga, Dogora, or Kamacuras may appear through the trees on the top of the screen. Gorosaurus is constantly stalking Godzilla from behind the trees. Interacting with him activates a minigame. In this game, Godzilla ties balloons to his tail and competes with Gorosaurus to jump into the sky and grab stars. Whichever monster has more stars in their possession by the end wins. A second minigame is available on the page, which appears to be initiated randomly. This minigame consists of the Cosmos standing on a teeter-totter. A kaiju - either Godzilla, Biollante, Mothra larva, Dogora, Kumonga, or Kamacuras- will be placed on one side of the teeter-totter, and the player must balance it by placing other kaiju or differently-sized weights on the other side. After the player successfully does this multiple times, the game is complete. Another minigame that also appears to happen randomly features Godzilla standing next to three differently-sized rocks, and three differently-sized holes. Godzilla will grab one of the rocks, and the player must choose which of the three holes it fits into. After the player does this correctly for all three rocks, the game will be complete.", "summary": "Godzilla: Heart-Pounding Monster Island!! is a game for the Sega Pico developed by Sega and released on July 25, 1995.\n\nThe game consists of multiple \"pages,\" which act as hub levels.
