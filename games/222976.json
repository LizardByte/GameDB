But instead of darkness, there is light.\n\nYou play yet again as The Batter, in a search for his Add-Ons, while on an unfamiliar, yet familiar world. Suddenly a mysterious hooded woman appears while you sleep, and then you meet two alternates after you awake: the angry, vulgar\nyet brutally honest Ghost Batter and the polite, cheerful and constantly-looking-for-trouble Bad Batter."}
