When he makes a hole to the surface he will attempt to steal a carrot. The farmer must hit the gopher to send him back underground or fill in the holes to prevent him from reaching the surface. If gopher has taken any of the three carrots, a pelican will occasionally fly overhead and drop a seed which, if the farmer catches it, he can plant it in the place of the missing carrot. The longer the game, the faster the gopher gets. The game ends when the gopher successfully removes all three carrots. There are two skill levels and is for one or two players, giving a total of four game variations.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gopher", "videos": [{"id": 106207, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "v_4XgpHOU14", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_4XgpHOU14", "title": "Gopher for the Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v_4XgpHOU14/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
