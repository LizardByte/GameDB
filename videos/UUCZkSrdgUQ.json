I included the basic part (with the normal ending) in the first part, and I left the extra missions and the last ones (that lead you to the good ending) for the second part. In the second part, missions 11 and 19 are with an asterisc since I missed one of the special pilots, one time because of the incorrect info in the guide I used, and the second time on porpouse, so I could get the normal ending. Anyway, my recommendation is to just watch those missions in part 1 and skip them in the part 2, as they take more time to beat.\n\nPART 1\n\nMission 1 - 04:14\nMission 2 - 07:41\nMission 3 - 11:38\nMission 4 - 16:14\nMission 5 - 20:23\nMission 6 - 27:33\nMission 7 - 33:44\nMission 8 - 37:03\nMission 9 - 41:47\nMission 10 - 47:46\nMission 11 - 51:51\nMission 12 - 56:33\nMission 13 - 1:04:11\nMission 14 - 1:11:42\nMission 15 - 1:19:59\nMission 16 - 1:25:00\nMission 17 - 1:28:47\nMission 18 - 1:34:31\nMission 19 - 1:41:27 -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UUCZkSrdgUQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UUCZkSrdgUQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UUCZkSrdgUQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UUCZkSrdgUQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [080] Ace Combat 2 (part 1 of 2)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Deskawa\n\nThis is the sequel to Air/Ace Combat, which includes a new mission structure and special enemy pilots that must be killed so it takes longer to beat the game.
