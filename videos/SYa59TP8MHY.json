Not only taking visual cues from the classics, It is the an intended design goal that the play style of the game also feels reminiscent of the classic games 2D as well. which should provide a unique experience to other 3D sonic games.\n\nThe completed project consists of 10 levels, across 5 zones each with a boss fight\nWith this being my first project ever, I personally don\u2019t call this a game as such more of a proof of concept\nand the result of many hours of love and trial, error and lessons learned.\nAs such it will serve as foundation to build my skills from.\n\nBecause of this the Project lacks any sort of story or plot and is more of a greatest hits of some of my favourite levels.\nRead the Update section below for what's new and what to be aware of.\n\nUpdates\nUpdates: My goal was to have the project completed by SAGE and call it a day, However as the law of Murphy is strong and cant be avoided, I have fallen short of that mark.\nWhat I do offer is close to complete so far, with post sage I will collect feedback and finish off and release the final build.\nSo what is in this release, well lets list some.\n\nAll levels will be playable!!\nYes all levels will now be playable, including a new Emerald Hill intro level, just for that Green hill meme we all love. All the levels have had some sort of adjustment some even a full redesign so should be a new experience.\n3 play modes. Selecting Play game will string all the levels one after the other.\nWhile selecting level select will enable you to choose level you wish to play. Within this also it the Time Attack option.\n\nAll characters!\nYou now have the option of playing Sonic, Shadow, Blaze, Knuckles, Tails, Ray and Mighty.\n\nNotice: due to time constraints, only Sonic, Ray and Mighty. I would consider in a finished state. The other will work fine. Just you may experience some possible Overpowered behaviour or Animation quirks I\u2019m still ironing out.\n\nKnuckles Flight: Yes I managed to get it working But its no where near to a state that I am allowing it in\nBut a player may get into a moment when it briefly functions try to avoid doing so as you my bug or break something.\n\nBosses:\nAll bosses are made But not implemented. As these were the main issue of the delay of development. Most should be functioning Except Aqua lake Act 1 and the final boss which I have not implemented. The rest should be functioning fine with one or two feeling lacking due to still needing tweaks or final polish.\n\nOptimization:\nThis is something I have focused on and even was the reason for some zones to be remade from scratch.\nwhile steps have been made to improve performance. I have only my own PC to test on and it runs fine.\n\nWhile I am also aware of a couple of other things to try, some stem from some big mistakes I made at the very beginning I\u2019ve now since learned but to remedy would require a remake from the ground up which I\u2019m not prepared to do.\nRather I learn from this and move on.\nif it will help I run this on an I7 with a 1080 Ti and maintain a constant frame rate with perhaps a barely noticeable dip sometimes in ice cap. That\u2019s at max graphics it may run on a potato with things turns way down to min.\nplease don't complain about this, I am aware it will be an issue for some and I wish I could do more.\n\nother issues to be aware of.\nMoving platforms have been a nightmare. And some have unexpected interactions with a player.\nlike player hopping, slingshotting. Or even damaging/killing a player for no reason. Some of the worst offending ones have been disabled.\n\ncharacter checkpoint spawns are random facing. This is a problem with the Bumper framework that not even GT fixed and was a primary reason for players getting lost from spawning facing backwards.\nI have a work around that corrects the camera so if you see it whip around when you re-spawn that\u2019s\nwhy\n\nThere are many other issues I am aware of and trying to fix but please understand this project\nIs one person show and I\u2019m not a rock star at every role required in game dev.\n\nFinally Have fun and enjoy my first attempt at game dev. I hope I can learn and build from this project to be better.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SYa59TP8MHY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SYa59TP8MHY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SYa59TP8MHY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SYa59TP8MHY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SYa59TP8MHY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic Encore Sage 2022 trailer", "description": "Sonic Encore is a fan-game that re-imagines the some of the classic levels from Sonic 2D era into a more modern 3D environmental setting.
