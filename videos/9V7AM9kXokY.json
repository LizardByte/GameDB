Unlike the first two template hacks, we tried to spice things up with some modified and some new levels. Of course this is not going to compete with actual hacks in terms of custom levels, but hopefully you will still enjoy it.\n\nQ: Does this work on all regions?\nA: As seen in the video at 1:00 this hack will work with every available region of Super Mario Galaxy 2, as long as its on a real Wii/Wii U or emulator. The American, European and Korean releases were tested on console, the Japanese and Taiwanese releases were tested on emulator. HOWEVER due to differences in HUD design, text may appear distorted on the Japanese and Taiwanese regions. We cannot include original files in my hack to counter this effect. Thus I suggest players from said regions to use an American ROM or set their system language to English if applicable.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9V7AM9kXokY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9V7AM9kXokY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9V7AM9kXokY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9V7AM9kXokY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9V7AM9kXokY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Mario Galaxy \u96f6 Zero + Galaxy Level Engine V3 [Released, V1.2]", "description": ":-:-:-:-: DOWNLOAD :-:-:-:-:\nSMG0 (GLE-V3 Template Hack): https://github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine/releases/download/V3.0.0.0/SMG0v1-2_GLE-V3TemplateHack.7z\n\nThe powerful Galaxy Level Engine has now been updated to Version 3!
