Edition is a 3D bowling-style video game made in 2001 by HyperEntertainment. It was published by Microsoft, and could only be accessed by use of a Microsoft Plus! CD-ROM.\n\nThe version of HyperBowl included in Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP contains two of the six lanes initially available (Classic and Pins of Rome) and is designed for a single player. When the upgrade has been purchased and installed, four additional lanes are installed. Multiplayer support is also enabled, allowing up to four players to bowl and keep track of their scores during a game.\n\nHyperBowl is similar to a basic game of ten-pin bowling: the goal is to knock down as many of the ten pins as possible within thirty seconds. Unlike in normal bowling, the lane also contains obstacles, like moving vehicles in the Tokyo and San Francisco lanes and trees in the Yosemite lane. The player can use a mouse or trackball to guide the ball while it's moving in order to avoid obstacles and aim for the pins. A clock at the upper-right corner of the lane window displays the time left to knock down pins. The game displays players' scores in a similar way to the displays found in traditional bowling alleys. The game ends when all players have completed the ten frames.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hyperbowl-plus-edition"}
