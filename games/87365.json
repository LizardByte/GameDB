Stop reading, just download now!\n\nOffroad Outlaws gives you what you want in an off-road game: Complete control over how you build, setup, and drive your rig, tons of challenges to complete, and multiplayer so you can explore the open-world trails with your friends.\n\nCONTROL\nYou build your rig the way you want it. You have total control over chassis setup - stiffness, damping, travel, etc... and can even swap to a different type of suspension if you want (want a modern truck with an I-Beam setup in front, and a solid axle in back? No problem.) For vehicle control you're given Tilt, Arrow, or on-screen Steering wheel controls. You choose!\n\nDRIVE\nWith several maps to choose from you can drive your rig slow across challenging rock routes, or fast over the flat sands of the desert. Want to take a break from the trails? Go play in the stunt park where you can use the ramps to \"test\" your rig's durability.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nExplore the trails with your friends or other players, or battle it out in the capture-the-flag mode! Race up mountains, rock trails, or through rivers with friends!\n\nNote: By joining as an Offroad Outlaws Member, you are agreeing to an auto-renewing monthly subscription plan (unless auto-renew is turned off) that will automatically be charged every month through your iTunes account for $4.99 within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.
