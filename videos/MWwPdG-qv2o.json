You don't know what Hazuki Dies is? Let me tell you something. Hazuki Dies is like when you play an RPG like Live-A-Live except your character sucks so bad that she dies immediately. What's the fun in that? Well, it's your job to make her not suck! You gotta turn this garbage tier character into one that has the confidence to fight for all of her friends? Who are her friends? Alright, homie. Listen up. You see, Hazuki wants to be a doctor. BUT IMAGINE WHEN THERE'S PAYWALL BLOCKING YOU FROM BECOMING A DOCTOR. So we just gotta get a job right? Nah, we don't have years for this because Hazuki is homies with thugs and now she gotta do all the shady stuff to become a doctor faster! And that's why you gotta protect her! Because she gets in to all sorts of insane adventures! Now you know what Hazuki is, now go make that Hazuki handholding doujin ok.\n\nIt\u2019s the Nutshack!
