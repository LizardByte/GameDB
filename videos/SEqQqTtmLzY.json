{"id": "SEqQqTtmLzY", "snippet": {"title": "Become Dirt | EEK3 Teaser Trailer", "description": "A young girl arrives home one day to find her home strangely quiet and her brother is unresponsive when she calls his name. Perhaps, she thinks, he's down in their hideout in the crawl space. Perhaps, she considers, he's hiding from their mother and grandmother. Perhaps, she realizes too late, he may have used the family's forbidden spell... and now he has no way to break it on his own. \n\nBecome Dirt is a PS1-style Exploration Horror game that heaps the weight of family legacy, the decay of knowledge, and your own powerlessness on your back like a mountain of dirt. Fortunately you can become dirt yourself, at almost any time, and fall through the floorboards to worm your way through the crawlspace and seek out the safety of a hideout you share with your younger brother. It\u2019s what you do almost every day and really, it\u2019s not so bad being dirt: No one wastes their time yelling at dirt, no one thinks about dirt, and no one expects anything of dirt. Your little brother, though\u2026 they expect a lot of him. He\u2019s smart, unlike you, and he\u2019s got real talent \u2014 enough to learn all of the family\u2019s spells, and enough to live up to your grandmother\u2019s expectations. Then he disappeared. Something is stalking through the halls of your home, stealing doorways and strangling lights just out of view. You need to find your brother, and quickly \u2014 before your house and your family bury you both. \n\nFollow Become Dirt for development updates, an upcoming demo announcement, and more! https://runa-liore.itch.io/become-dirt", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEqQqTtmLzY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEqQqTtmLzY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEqQqTtmLzY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEqQqTtmLzY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEqQqTtmLzY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Become Dirt | EEK3 Teaser Trailer", "description": "A young girl arrives home one day to find her home strangely quiet and her brother is unresponsive when she calls his name.
