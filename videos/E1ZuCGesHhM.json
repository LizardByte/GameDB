Developed by Beenox and published by Activision, it is a sequel to 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man, and is set in the same continuity, different from that of the films. The game's main storyline loosely follows the plot of the film, and introduces new threats for Spider-Man to face, primarily crime lord Kingpin, and serial killer Cletus Kasady, who has a twisted sense of justice and is regarded as a dark reflection of Spider-Man.\n\nThe game was released on April 29 in North America and May 2 in Europe for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox 360, to mixed reviews. The Xbox One version was released alongside the other platforms digitally while the release of physical copies was delayed by two weeks.[3] Gameloft also released a mobile version on April 17 for iOS and Android devices as a paid game. The game was also localized in Japan as a Sony-exclusive title. This is the last Marvel video game (and by extension, the final Spider-Man video game) to be published by Activision, and also the last major Spider-Man video game to be released for the non-Sony platforms, as the license for Spider-Man games was passed to Insomniac Games, which developed the 2018 game Marvel's Spider-Man only on PS4 and its follow-up Spider-Man: Miles Morales, set to be released on November 12, 2020 on the PlayStation 5.\n\n\n\nFootage taken from:\nhttps://github.com/citra-emu/citra-canary/releases/download/canary-1850/citra-windows-mingw-20200910-063cae9.7z\n\n:::::download citra nightly / canary here:::::\nhttps://citra-emu.org/download/\n\n\nBE A FACEBOOK FAN: https://www.facebook.com/Citraemulatorforfans/\n\nCITRA - http://citra-emu.org/\nCITRA GITHUB - https://github.com/citra-emu/citra\n\n\nPC specs:\nCPU - Intel Core i7 8700K @ 5.0 Ghz\nRAM - G.SKILL 32GB DDR4 3600MHz CL16\nGPU - GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GAMING OC 8G\nOS - Windows 10 64bit", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1ZuCGesHhM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1ZuCGesHhM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1ZuCGesHhM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1ZuCGesHhM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1ZuCGesHhM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - 3DS Gameplay 4K 2160p (Citra)", "description": "The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - 3DS Gameplay 4K 2160p (Citra)\n\n\u2665\u2665 Support Citra developers: https://www.patreon.com/citraemu \u2665\u2665\n\nSubscribe for more videos https://goo.gl/aDX1a1\nJohnGodgamesHD Channel subscribe: https://goo.gl/W9f1n4\nVisit us at http://www.godgames-world.com for more\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an open world action-adventure video game based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, and the 2014 film of the same name.
