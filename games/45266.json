Rulue recognizes Carbuncle and becomes upset - she is convinced that Satan chose to marry Arle. Arle is clueless about her jealousy and thus takes her casually, but Rulue summons Minotauros to chase her into a forest.\n\nArle manages to escape out of the forest dungeon but her hands are torn and bloody due to frostbite caused by overusing 'Ice Storm'. She finds a pharmacy in town and requests the merchant for medicine that can rid of the frostbite. However, he tells her that the raw materials to make it are in Mokemoe Labyrinth, which has recently been rampant with monsters. Rulue sends Minotauros to fight Arle, but Arle defeats him, ending the game.\n\nThis plot-point was entirely removed in the Game Gear version and replaced with an entirely different story. A frog follows Arle around on her adventure, you get a new pink armor along with a powerful staff, fight an Egyptian Guardian, Carbuncle gets sick, Arle travels to space to cure him, Minotauros is only the third boss (the second being a super form of Draco Centauros) and Rulue is the final boss instead.\n\nAfter Arle defeats them, she figures out that Rulue was the one who had unleashed monsters throughout Mokemoe Labyrinth. Rulue claims that the area belonged to her and that the townspeople were roughing it up. Arle continues to object that people cannot gain the raw materials, and Rulue shows no care for it. Instead Rulue tries to make a deal, that she goes to the same Magic School as Arle and learn to be a wonderful mage and impress Satan.\n\nAgreeing to the deal, Rulue orders Minotauros to get up and prepare to leave. Arle's frostbite is cured and says \"Two dogs and two men, were heading to the Magic School\". As she, Rulue, Minotauros, and Carbuncle look in one direction. Thus ending the trilogy.\n\nIn the Game Gear version, though, Rulue still is angered by her defeat. The frog appears, turning out to be Satan the whole time, and tells them that he wanted Arle as his wife and everything was a plan of his. They both send him flying, unimpressed and annoyed. The ending remains the same except without Carbuncle and Minotauros.", "summary": "Madou Monogatari III: Kyuukyoku Joou-sama is a Sega Game Gear sequel to Madou Monogatari II: Arle 16-Sai.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/madou-monogatari-iii-kyuukyoku-joou-sama", "videos": [{"id": 91046, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-_3pLMLavwQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_3pLMLavwQ", "title": "GG Madou Monogatari III:  Kyuukyoku Joou-sama (US Sorcery Saga III: The Ultimate Queen)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_3pLMLavwQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
