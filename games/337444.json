The power commonly called Rainbow Despair.\n\nMy tale begins, innocently enough, with a 16 year old girl named Molly Despair. Enrolled in the academy of witchcraft in the southern part of the kingdom of Elzdor, she was being instructed in those magical arts essential to a woman of high stature. Spells for cooking delicious meals, creating beatiful quilts and decorations, entertaining guests, and other highly useful tasks made up Molly's daily studies. But Molly was not interested in such things. She dreamt of a life of high adventure, not high society. And so, one day, she left the school of witchcraft to make her mark on the world as an adventurer.\n\nAccompanied by her friend and familiar, Larry the cat, and armed with her trusty broom, she was determined to succeed. Little did she know that the forest surrounding the academy of witchcraft was filled with strange and vicious monsters who loved to devour little girls who were foolish enough to wander into their domain. And so, my story begins.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rainbow-despair"}
