However, we get some extra insight into the story during the bonus levels. Unlike in the main version, prince is indeed able to use the sand gates for teleportation across the city. Each sand gate takes to a bonus levels, making for a total of 9 bonus levels. 3 out of those 9 levels go to the exact same place which is similar to the Life Upgrade sections seen in Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, each time they are visited, the prince is given a new sand power. Out of the remaining bonus levels, 3 bonus levels are directly connected to the story. It is revealed that the vizier has uncovered the secrets of the lost temples of Zurvan. In each of these levels there is a statue of Zurvan which is destroyed piece by piece as the prince completes each bonus level. The damage done in previous bonus levels is mirrored in the statue of present in the current level and gets destroyed when the prince completes the final bonus level. The damage of the statue symbolically indicates the downfall of Zurvan/Vizier and exactly shows how the final boss fight is going to be.", "summary": "Prince of Persia: Rival Swords is the PSP and Nintendo Wii port of Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones. It made use of some motion control features for the Wii version. The US version of the PSP version featured a lot of bonus content including bonus levels, chariot races and a multiplayer mode where two people can race to finish a level the fastest. The rest of the levels and gameplay is pretty identical to Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones with minor to no differences.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/prince-of-persia-rival-swords", "videos": [{"id": 44847, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "Iop5Hq8v1O4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iop5Hq8v1O4", "title": "Prince of Persia: Rival Swords Nintendo Wii Trailer - Wii", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iop5Hq8v1O4/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44848, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "L7llBDFh6Go", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7llBDFh6Go", "title": "Prince of Persia: Rival Swords Nintendo Wii Trailer -", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L7llBDFh6Go/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44849, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "F8xNrMhcDbQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8xNrMhcDbQ", "title": "Prince of Persia Rival Swords bonus level #1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F8xNrMhcDbQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44850, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "isFeaWRQ7IA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isFeaWRQ7IA", "title": "Prince of Persia: The Rival Swords | Bonus Chariot Race 2 (No sands used)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/isFeaWRQ7IA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44851, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Sz78Fxwlrfg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz78Fxwlrfg", "title": "Prince of Persia Rival Swords - all five multiplayer locations for Light Prince.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sz78Fxwlrfg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
