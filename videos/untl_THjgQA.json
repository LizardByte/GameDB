It'll be releasing on Steam in December 2022.\n\nIn Fairy Card Rogue, you play as Lily White, a fairy who's been joining in on the card game that's all the rage in Gensokyo as of late, but isn't satisfied with her cards. She decides to head out to find better ones, as well as to discover who's behind the spread of the cards in the first place.\n\nFairy Card Rogue offers random card selections, different card sets to choose from, a variety of treasures, potions, and events to spice up your dungeon dives, and difficult bosses. It can be quite fast-paced, and it's honestly much better played than watched!\n\nIts Steam store page is up, so add it to your wishlist if you're interested!\n\nSteam Store Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183210/Fairy_Card_Rogue/\n\nCircle Rep's Twitter: https://twitter.com/46_29\nCircle Homepage (Japanese): http://46flare.net/\nFairy Card Rogue Online Manual: http://46flare.net/cardrogue_eng/manual.html\n\n\nAdditionally, as of the time of uploading this, donating $5 or more to my Patreon or Ko-fi will currently get your name in the game's credits. I don't charge devs for my translations nor do I profit from their sales. I instead get by with the donations of overseas Touhou fans who want to play these games, so any support is appreciated.\n\nThe donation deadline is the end of Wednesday, November 23rd 2022, in Eastern Time.\n\nDiscord Server: https://discord.gg/jfCZ5Dk5td\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HakanaiBlue\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/HakanaiBlue\nKo-fi: https://ko-fi.com/hakanaiblue", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/untl_THjgQA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/untl_THjgQA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/untl_THjgQA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/untl_THjgQA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/untl_THjgQA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fairy Card Rogue English Trailer", "description": "I've worked with 46flare, the developers behind a Touhou fangame called Fairy Card Rogue, to translate it into English.
