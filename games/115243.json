The wandering Hakenkreuz.\nThough his saga was passed down as naught but a stale ghost story, it was no mere urban legend.\nFor he was Wilhelm Ehrenburg - hunted in absolute secrecy by the UN as a remnant of the Third Reich, enemy of the world, and one of the infamous members of the demonic Longinus Dreizehn Orden.\n\nAnd after over half a century, the time had finally come for him to depart for Japan in order to fulfill his most ardent desire.\nHumoring this interviewer he would have ignored or slain any other day was merely a whim birthed from the exaltation of the promised time drawing ever closer.\n\nThat was the only reason our intrepid interviewer found him in a talkative mood.\n\nThus, as he reflected on his life, Wilhelm grew nostalgic - sentimental, even - for the path he had walked.\nAnd when asked, he unveiled his past piece by piece.\n\nFrom the accursed blood that poisoned his very soul, to the blight wrought by the works of Mercury.\nHe spun a tale of the day he awakened to the truth of his being, and of the woman who had the nature of Wilhelm's existence engraved upon her very being.\n\n\"Don't you worry, I'm gonna tell you everything. From the first moment I met her, to the very end of our story.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dies-irae-interview-with-kaziklu-bey", "videos": [{"id": 39825, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BK3Axg9T4is"}]}
