In Pitfall you manoeuvre your ship down a seemingly neverending shaft while avoiding the rock edges and disembodied faces. Use the left right keyboard keys to move your ship side-to-side and use the up and down arrows to slightly speed your ship up or slow it down. Hitting rock faces will take points off your hit-points but hitting those creepy floating faces will mean instant death. Your ASCII graphics ship has ten hit points to start with. Five additional points are rewarded as you manoeuvre further down deeper into the shaft every three thousand points. Occasionally you will find a floating star in the depths which will reward you a bonus of two hundred points. There are no multiple attempts down the shaft. Each destroyed ship means you must start all over again.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pitfall--2"}
