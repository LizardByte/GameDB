Once in a while a portal between the two opens. Demons known as BEMs (\"big-eyed monsters\") have stolen precious jewels and escaped to Earth through that portal. It is up to two demon hunters, Lime and Bass, to assume the likeness of a teenage girl and boy and restore peace and order.\n\nThe third episode of the series is, like its predecessors, an interactive cartoon with visual novel elements. The interaction is sparse, consisting of repeatedly selecting simple verb commands from a menu and triggering animated cutscenes.\n\nIn this episode a fit of jealousy on Lime's side sends Bass to the hospital. Upon arrival, however, the two discover a very strange hospital manager and begin to suspect yet another BEM infiltration.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/houma-hunter-lime-dai-03-wa", "collections": [{"id": 5649, "name": "Houma Hunter Lime"}]}
