It is an standalone expansion of the first game in the Nostalgia series and a spiritual successor to Konami's Keyboardmania series. \n \nThe game consists of falling bars corresponding to certain areas of the keyboard. When the bars cross the judgement line it is time to play that key. There are three type of notes - Normal note which you play as normal, slide note where you slide your hand across the keyboard and trill note where you rapidly and alternately press two neighbouring keys. \n \nThe game adds a grade system where your overall skill in the game is measured. A NEAR judgement has also been added, which is obtained when you press the wrong key near the right key, but in the right time. It does not earn any score, but stop you from losing your combo. Arcade matchmaking is extended to 4 players at the same time. \n \nThe game extends the base games 83 songs with 98 new songs for a total of 181 songs.", "videos": [{"id": 37912, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eDdvnJQmQaQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDdvnJQmQaQ", "title": "[ \u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30a2 FORTE ] phantasmagoria [ Expert ]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eDdvnJQmQaQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
