This is a 3D racing game on the 3DO.  Released in 1995, only in Japan, you play this game with a controller.  The steering is slow and cumbersome, but yet you can send your car into a twitchy, hard to control powerslide around corners.  It is possible to be able to drive this game decently, I actually first recorded footage for this game a year ago or so, and my driving was better then.  I wasn't able to really use that footage because the audio was distorted, however.  \r\n\r\nThe thing that's fun about this game are the glitches.  Having the sky change suddenly from one view to another, getting stuck on your opponent's car...good good times.  This game really just feels half done, but they put it on the market anyway.  It's published by Panasonic, you'd think they would want a game that showcases the console they manufacture in a good light.\r\n\r\nI still find a certain charm in this game, mainly due to how clunky everything is.  It's certainly not a game I would recommend, but, I got it cheap and have had some fun with it...well maybe not fun exactly, but, laughs.  Laughing at the silly stuff that happens.\r\n\r\nAnd uhm, YouTube has \"katy\" and \"perry\" as suggested tags, so, you win YouTube.  You have come up with tags that are so far removed from what this video is about that...I give up.  Katy Perry.  There.  Hope you're happy now.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxIqhS3pMVE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxIqhS3pMVE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxIqhS3pMVE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Nice and Games -- AutoBahn Tokio [3DO]", "description": "AutoBahn Tokioooooooooo!
