The game is based on Piers Anthony's Xanth novels and loosely follows the plot of his novel Demons Don't Dream, in which a young man uses a computer game to enter and explore the world of Xanth.\n\nTypical of Piers Anthony's novels, the game is filled with puns and visual gags, and some knowledge of the Xanth universe is helpful; for those players who haven't read any of the Xanth novels, an in-game 'Com-Pendium of Xanth' is provided to the player for the majority of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/companions-of-xanth", "videos": [{"id": 31988, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Y5G57nqXEV8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5G57nqXEV8", "title": "Companions of Xanth (1993) PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5G57nqXEV8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
