There is no horror element, no secret ARG, you can't even die or fail.\nIt's a short, relaxing experience throughout. Takes 15-20 minutes to complete.\n\nFeatures excellent voice acting, custom music, and quite possibly the cutest Doomcute that you've ever seen.\nClosed captions are also included, so you can play the game without sound if needed (though sound is recommended).\n\nInspired by the house cleaning section from \"The Beginner's Guide\", as well as games like \"What Remains of Edith Finch\" and \"Gone Home\". If you're a fan of Walking Simulators, you'll feel right at home. If not, there's probably little to win you over. \ufeff", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moving"}
