In addition to the weapons from the first two F.E.A.R games, in Perseus Mandate the player has access to a grenade launcher, a lightning gun and an advanced rifle, all of which will be necessary to dispatch a tough new cast of bad guys. Unlike the previous expansion, this title can be played stand-alone and does not require the original game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/f-e-a-r-perseus-mandate", "videos": [{"id": 555, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6cHuLFNxsLE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cHuLFNxsLE", "title": "F.E.A.R.
