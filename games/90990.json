There are four stages: a Marshalling Area, a Harbor, an Air Base and a Siberian Camp. The omnipresent knife can be supplemented with captured arms. By killing certain enemy soldiers, the player can obtain a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. At the end of each stage, the player will face a unique group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs, Stage 3 with three shooting autogyros and Stage 4 with a skillful multi-shot flamethrower operator. When the mission is accomplished the four rescued POWs salute and the player restarts the game from the first stage on the next difficulty level. While the player can remain still in one area and rack up points, if he takes too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There's also an invisible time limit that will kill off the player if he takes too long to complete the stage.", "summary": "A run & gun shooter by Konami, also known by the title Green Beret, in which the player takes the role of a soldier infiltrating a military base.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 64718, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "R8GgscAEUTU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8GgscAEUTU", "title": "Green Beret gameplay HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R8GgscAEUTU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 64719, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_Cs-SZxZlIU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cs-SZxZlIU", "title": "Green Beret aka Rush'n Attack (1985) [Arcade] Complete Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Cs-SZxZlIU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
