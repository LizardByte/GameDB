During each half, players alternate playing ten cards to simulate a full game's highlights. Each card represents both an offensive and a defensive play, both of which will be used to resolve your opponent's and your own offensive plays.\nDo you try to thwart your opponent's threatened offense, or put up a strong offense of your own? The player who makes the best use of their plays will score the most points through touchdowns, field goals, and even safeties to win the game!"}
