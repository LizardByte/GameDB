The Tier 2 and 3 crafting recipes were tied to the game's normal progression, so the bosses Beatrice the Tailor and Sir Magnus the Overseer had to be defeated before they could be used.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/v-rising-razer-night-serpent-pack"}
