He has already conquered the world. His enemies (including you) are scattered, their armies broken and cities torn down. His dark minions have free reign to terrorize the survivors everywhere except a few tiny outposts of civilization (like the one you start in) too insignificant to crush.", "videos": [{"id": 4665, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yEUhFyav4j4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEUhFyav4j4", "title": "Sorcerer King Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yEUhFyav4j4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
