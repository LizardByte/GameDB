You won\u2019t get those without clients. And you won\u2019t have clients until you hire an accounts team. \n \nAdd other workers to complete the projects and get paid. It\u2019s that simple. Or is it? \n \nTake care of your workers. If they're underpaid, or your agency becomes a sweatshop, don\u2019t be surprised if they bolt. \n \nEncourage your staff to work faster and juggle more projects with a steady supply of donuts, and other surprises. \n \nAnd choose your clients wisely.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/advertising-agency"}
