Armed with a sword and a \u2018hand cannon\u2019, all manner of nasty dungeon dwellers, bosses and traps will need to be defeated or traversed in order to emerge from the dungeon victorious!\n\nTo aid you in your quest, you may be lucky enough to encounter one or more upgrades or new abilities scattered throughout the dungeon, or bump into the remnants of other players (Champions) via the unlockable 'Champion Mode'. Champions wander atop the dungeon walls, ready to unleash their souls upon passers by. Be careful though, as not all Champions are helpful.\n\nA randomly generated dungeon is created every playthrough, with many secrets and multiple outcomes.\n\nThe game features a dynamic difficulty and ranking system - the better you do, the more challenging the game will become. Only the most skilled dungeon escapees will attain the highest ranks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 9840, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Hw1N2UVRcPo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw1N2UVRcPo", "title": "Diehard Dungeon v1.4 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hw1N2UVRcPo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
