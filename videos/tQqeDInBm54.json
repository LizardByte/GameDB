{"id": "tQqeDInBm54", "snippet": {"title": "Hang On GP (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 1995 motorcycle racing game for the Sega Saturn, Hang On GP.\n\nThis video shows the entire GP mode played through on the normal difficulty level. \n\nI love this game. The gameplay is classically-styled Sega arcade goodness, and everything about it is big, loud, and in your face, and it's nowhere near as difficult as Sega's standard, so even the newbies will stand a shot at finishing a race once in awhile. \n\nHang On GP has always reminded me the racing games that use gaudy digitized sprites - like a superscalar game just done in 3D, and it looks great.  It brings to mind Cyclemania and the later Road Rash games the most, but it controls better than either of those. I'd probably judge it as being almost on par with Super Burnout on the Jaguar (Almost. SBO was much smoother at 60fps in-game!).  The wildly overdone wailing guitars in the background are also a huge plus. \n\nJust beware - this is not a game you want to play with a digital controller.  It's miserable and clunky doing it that way.  The arcade racer wheel is by far the best way to play, with the 3D pad a distant second (it's pretty twitch, but still better than a d-pad). With the right controller, there are few arcade style racers that I've had as much fun with as this one.\n\nAnd it's just so f**king tacky, everything about it. If the 90s could vomit, I think this would be found somewhere in the effluvia still somewhat intact and quite potent. I'll stop gushing now, but trust me. It's awesome.\n____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQqeDInBm54/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQqeDInBm54/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQqeDInBm54/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQqeDInBm54/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Hang On GP (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 1995 motorcycle racing game for the Sega Saturn, Hang On GP.\n\nThis video shows the entire GP mode played through on the normal difficulty level. \n\nI love this game.
