As part of this trial, the two are separated from each other and sent to worlds previously destroyed by the Heartless that have since been restored, though now in a state of \"deep sleep\" which disconnects them from the other worlds.\n\nThese seven worlds are plagued by Dream Eaters \u2014 creatures born from darkness that seek out the sleeping worlds' Keyholes. Sora and Riku's given task is to reawaken the sleeping worlds by unlocking the seven Keyholes they find there and then return to the realm of light, recruiting benevolent \"Spirit\" Dream Eaters to guide them and battle the malevolent \"Nightmare\" Dream Eaters, after which they will be deemed Keyblade Masters.", "summary": "Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD is a full HD remaster of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance designed for the PlayStation 4.

The conversion from two screens to one is the most notable of the changes seen. Little has changed in terms of gameplay. However, three new Dream Eaters have been introduced and minor game features have been altered to adapt to the PS4.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 26658, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "v6nqHBopIis", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6nqHBopIis", "title": "Kingdom Hearts 3D Trailer - Dream Drop Distance - E3 2012", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6nqHBopIis/sddefault.jpg"}]}
