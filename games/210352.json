The POSITRONIC, coveted by many other countries, endangers the tense peace in the zone.\n\nThe only solution is to destroy it at any cost and for this purpose a Vietnam veteran, Charlie Montinni, a weapons expert and fierce fighter, has been hired. His partners Humphrey Stallone and Billy Von Pettet will help him in such a risky mission. In TRIPLE COMMANDO you can be any of them and go into the jungle in search of the fearsome cannon.", "summary": "Triple Commando is an arcade game, were we find the possibility of creating a small combat strategy, due to two factors: the possibility of simultaneous play of up to three players, and the varied and original actions that each of them can carry out: place mines and wire fences, cut the latter, radio our aviation, lie on the ground, and of course shoot both bullets and grenades. This makes it possible for the different players to create a small attack strategy -mining certain areas or blocking the enemy's way with wire fences-. This makes \"Triple Commando\" reach a realism that was never achieved by the classic war arcades.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 72232, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "w5UD0w_Rbio", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5UD0w_Rbio", "title": "Triple Comando (Dro Soft, 1988).
