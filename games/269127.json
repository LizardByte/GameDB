It is the fifth installment in the MAYhem series, and the first not to be led by TheMionicDonut, with management taken over by Michael Fraize (Marcaek). The WAD used a custom texture pack made up of resources from Quake, The Darkening Episode 2, and Malice. Two restrictions were used, with mappers having a choice of being limited to 160 things in their map, or having a monster count of the map number multiplied by 10.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mayhem-2016"}
