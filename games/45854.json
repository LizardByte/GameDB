Of course, they are all a mix of human and humanoid, and depending on their strengths, have a range of different moves and styles.\n\nThe main aim of the game is to defeat each of the opposing 3-man teams ahead of you, and dominate cyberspace.\n\nThe game mixes a little of Street Fighter with a dash of Virtual On, allowing you to fight in close or use long range attacks all inside a 3D landscape.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heavy-metal-geomatrix"}
