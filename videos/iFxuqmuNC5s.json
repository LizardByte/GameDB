The goal is to remove all of your friend's pieces. The game unfolds in two phases, the Drop Phase and the Move Phase. In the drop phase you and your friend take turns placing your 12 pieces onto the board. Then in the move phase, you take turns moving your pieces to try and form three-in-a-row, which allows you to remove one of your friend's pieces.\n\nLike chess, it's a game of complete information and pure skill. If you're not that into defeating an opponent through superior strategy, then this game is not for you. But if you love strategy board games like Chess, Checkers, Nine Men's Morris, or Go, then you're going to love Daka Dara.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFxuqmuNC5s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFxuqmuNC5s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFxuqmuNC5s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFxuqmuNC5s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iFxuqmuNC5s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Daka Dara Trailer", "description": "The announcement trailer for the game Daka Dara.
