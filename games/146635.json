You are now officially a sorceress. As you walk along the underground passages that lead to your home village, you reflect with pride upon your accomplishment.\n\nSuddenly you stop. Something is wrong, your sixth sense tells you. You hold still, listening for any sign of danger. You hear nothing. Then it strikes you: that is exactly what's wrong. This close to the village, the air should be filled with the sounds of life. Instead, there is only a horrible silence. Quickly you run for the entrance to the village.\n\nYou step through the final tunnel. Before you lie the empty streets of your home village. Has it been abandoned? Why? Or did something worse happen? Surely there must be some clue somewhere. You stifle the impulse to run away and set out to explore the village.\n\nWrath of Darkness is an action role-playing game played in first point perspective. It is the story of one dark elven sorceress' quest for revenge.\n\nWrath of Darkness is no longer distributed as a standalone game. To play Wrath of Darkness, you need to download Lightslayer instead.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 48862, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QcoygrbN_-o"}]}
