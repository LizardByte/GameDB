However, to appreciate the game\u2019s introduction, you need to know that, in the first episode, Link locked Zelda up in his cave after a drinking night.\n\nThe story takes place some months after that terrible night. While Link was trying to make up for his fault, a very rich business man named Mr Grump took over the kingdom and bought everything.\n\nThere begins your next adventure, in a world where everything has a price and where truth and lies become undistinguishable.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda XD2: Mercuris Chess is the sequel of the first XD parodic game, and was also released on April 1st, in 2017 this time. As a direct sequel, the overworld is expanded, the story is extended and the funny tone is kept, if not bettered!\n\nThe game was made in 10 weeks (!), beginning with an a discussion about how people always mispronounce Mercuris Chest (note the T at the end). Diarandor suggested that a game could be named Mercuris Chess to make fun of the title, and the same day it was decided that it would be the next big April\u2019s fools joke.\n\nThe team worked really hard, and you can feel the improvements from the previous games. The game has 2 dungeons, and lots of side-quests and secrets everywhere, and also feature silly NPCs around the overworld. Be sure to speak to every one to not miss a joke!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-xd2-mercuris-chess", "videos": [{"id": 87155, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "M2tAk5hRMHk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2tAk5hRMHk", "title": "Zelda XD2 Mercuris Chess Trailer [en]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2tAk5hRMHk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
