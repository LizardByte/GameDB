On top of this we have been inspired by the narrative elements in Dear Esther and Deus Ex\u2019s non-linear story telling and environments, the resulting gameplay maintains aspects of all 4 games. There will be many puzzles to solve, horror sections and some more narrative focused areas. So we hope it will have a range of elements for everyone to enjoy.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dream", "videos": [{"id": 19262, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "O0jiIPlIfO4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0jiIPlIfO4", "title": "Official \"Dream\" Steam Greenlight Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O0jiIPlIfO4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 19263, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "r5iv-YoC950", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5iv-YoC950", "title": "\"Dream\" Unedited Pre-Alpha Footage", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r5iv-YoC950/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
