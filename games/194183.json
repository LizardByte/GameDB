Rapidly gain new weapons and abilities while trying to make it through an intergalactic conflict.\nMost troopers won't make it. The few that do survive become permanently playable as clone squad commanders. In the auto battler-like Command Mode, players build and organize squads while fighting to last as long as possible against overwhelming odds."}
