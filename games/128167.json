Trying to hide from the undead will make your heart race and take your breath away, because you cannot kill what is already dead. In creating Deadness the emphasis was on the game looking as realistic as possible, including intuitive controls, naturalistic graphics and horror atmosphere. Just like in reality, on the wheelchair you can only move using your hands which control all the movements which makes the game feel even more realistic.\n\nYou are going to feel utterly helpless.
