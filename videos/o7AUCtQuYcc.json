It's a game that's pretty under-the-radar as far as I know, so i thought i'd do a let's play and see what everyone else thought of it.

Hope you enjoy ;)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o7AUCtQuYcc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o7AUCtQuYcc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o7AUCtQuYcc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Let's Play Vlad Tepes Dracula pt1(b)", "description": "Hello ladies and gents, thank you for returning to my Let's Play of Vlad Tepes Dracula, a game i played as a kid and enjoyed it thoroughly.
