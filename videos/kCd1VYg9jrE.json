This mod also introduces seven new levels together with new intermission briefings, new weapons together with some new & changed monsters. There are also some new toys for your inventory like highly damaging grenades which can kill a lot of weaker monsters without any problems, medikits to use whenever you want and night googles useful in dark areas (especially Sewers). As for the monsters, there are some new like Dark Imps (very annoying because these can cloak and suddenly spawn in front of you), cyber enhanced Pinkies who are faster, cybernetically enhanced Barons of Hell armed with Rocket Launcher and Minigun (these are extremely dangerous when you are caught of guard) together with much bigger variations of Arachnotrons and Mancubus. Don't get yourself too cocky while playing this mod on higher difficulty levels, this ain't Brutal Doom but still quite challenging in a lot of situations, especially when you are very low on ammo. As for an interesting note, some of these levels were an inspiration for SgtMarkIV Recurring Nightmare and his newest Starter Pack which is still in development. Because mod was made in 2010, you may have some problems with newer versions of sourceports but it can be run with ZDoom/GZDoom and Skulltag/Zandronum.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kCd1VYg9jrE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kCd1VYg9jrE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kCd1VYg9jrE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kCd1VYg9jrE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "ArmageDoom (Levels 1 & 2), Pre Brutal Doom mod from SgtMarkIV", "description": "http://www.youtube.com/user/MartinKiller88/videos\nCheck my other longplays (mostly in HD quality) on my channel.
