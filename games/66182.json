There is no main story line in the game, beside the cryptic mentioning of a legendary group of heroes who fought demons and as a result became demons themselves in the introduction sequence. There are no \"main goal\" in the game, and no plot-advancing events; it is entirely dedicated to free-form exploration and role-playing.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lunatic-dawn-ii"}
