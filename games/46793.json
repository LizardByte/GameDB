The various shapes of the falling blocks and their rotation are identical to the prototype. What makes the game different from a standard Tetris clone is its objective. Each stage already contains a pattern of blocks, usually arranged as symbols, characters, or other images. Among these blocks are several bombs. The goal is to make these bombs detonate by clearing out the rows they are in. Once all the bombs have been detonated, the stage \"explodes\", and the player advances to the next one.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flash-point", "videos": [{"id": 27783, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "9KyUgK3o5cM"}]}
