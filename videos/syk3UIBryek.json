Its influence can be seen in various later games in the shooter game genre.\n\nVersions were released for various home computers and consoles. The game also appears on Capcom Classics Collection, Activision Anthology, and on the Wii Virtual Console Arcade, as well as Capcom Arcade Cabinet for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nThe player takes control of a soldier named Super Joe,[1] who starts by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter, and has to fight his way out singlehandedly, fending off a massive assault of enemy soldiers.\n\nSuper Joe is armed with a sub-machine gun (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades. While Joe can fire his gun in any of the eight directions that he faces, his grenades can only be thrown vertically towards the top of the screen, irrespective of the direction Joe is facing. Unlike his SMG bullets, grenades can be thrown to clear obstacles, and explosions from well placed grenades can kill several enemies at once.\n\nThis is an emulated arcade version using mame.\nCaptured and played at 60fps\nDifficulty has not been lowered through service mode!\nThis is the default arcade difficulty.\nNOTE: NO cheats were used on the first credit, ONLY on the second credit.\nAlthough i abhor using cheats an invincibility cheat was used as this is a notorious difficulty game and it is the first time i've seen the end of this game and for this reason, so can you!
