The game features a unique weapons system: instead of collecting power-ups, Ace must down enemies using the incredible power of the Recyl-o-Ray! before turning the Scumbags\u2019 own weapons against them!\n\nThe game sees our titular hero blasting into outer space to defeat a race of psychopathic cephalopod invaders intent on wiping Earth from the face of the galaxy: if the galaxy even has a face that is... Ace must speed across the surface of the earth, before blasting into space, speeding through a deadly asteroid field, taking on a Scumbag Factory Ship and defeating them on their home planet before blasting into the mysterious Dimension X to put an end to the Scumbag menace once and for all!
