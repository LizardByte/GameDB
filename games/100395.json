Pick from an assortment of rooms and facilities that will grow both your floorspace and your revenue stream. Build restaurants for the foodies, day spas for the vacationers, and conference halls for the workaholics. There\u2019s a wide range of rooms to choose from.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve laid down the foundations, it\u2019s time to pick out the decor. That\u2019s right; you get to customize everything down to the furniture and decorations. Make it wacky, make it classy, or change up the theme from room to room. You will attract different types of guests as your hotel grows and its rating changes, bringing new opportunities and challenges. Remember, the customer is usually wrong, but you\u2019re in the service industry now. Get your hotel in shape, slap on your best smile, and be prepared for whatever comes.", "summary": "Have you ever wanted to design and manage your own hotel, motel, resort, or tent?
