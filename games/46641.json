Hansel, the little boy, and Gretel, the little girl, are brother and sister. Once upon a time they lived with their father (a poor old woodcutter) and their new stepmother (a selfish, heartless woman) in a small cottage at the edge of a dark forest.\n\nTimes were hard, and there just wasn't enough food to go around. So the wicked stepmother hit upon an evil plan. She convinced her gullible husband to take the two children deep into the forest and to abandon them there. \"Someone will find them and feed them there\", she lied. Secretly, she really just wanted to be rid of the children so that she could have their share of food for herself!\n\nOn the way, Hansel dropped crumbs from his last morsel of bread to leave a trail so that they would be able to find their way back home. But the birds ate it, and the children didn't know which way to go! They were all alone, and scared because there were bears and wolves in the forest. Hungry and desperate to find a way out, the children wandered ever deeper into the forest... until at last they came upon a wicked witch's home.\n\nTo the starving children, it was a wondrous sight... a castle made entirely of cakes and candy and a million other goodies. Little did they know that it was all only an illusion designed to lure her victims inside. For once the children were there, the witch took them prisoner... planning to first fatten them up, and then to put them in her oven!\n\nBut of course Hansel and Gretel eventually do escape and live happily ever after... as children always do in all good fairytales. And the rest of the story is about how they manage to do that. In the game, it can get a mite complicated...", "summary": "The classic children's fairy tale in cartoon format with puzzles to solve, and all the drama, realism and music of a feature film. Hansel and Gretel are abandoned in a forest where a Wicked Witch takes them prisoner. They must figure out how to escape, lest she put them in her oven! Two levels of difficulty, and it can also be used as a language learning tool (English, Spanish, German, French, and Japanese), since you can pick one language for dialogue and another for the objects named (or both the same).", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hansel-and-gretel-and-the-enchanted-castle", "videos": [{"id": 31598, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "-iqaBR_aXTA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqaBR_aXTA", "title": "Hansel & Gretel and the Enchanted Castle (Longplay / Hard / English): Part 1of4: Menus", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-iqaBR_aXTA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
