Every game of Sleuth is different so you must fully explore the house each time that you play. As your investigation proceeds the murderer will begin to grow suspicious and will most likely start plotting your demise. If you have not figured out who the murderer is by this point in the game, your chances of survival are slim.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 59916, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3ijVKr9BYtQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ijVKr9BYtQ", "title": "Sleuth \u00a9 1983 Norland Software - PC DOS - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ijVKr9BYtQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
