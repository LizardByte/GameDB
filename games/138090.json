This time, the player takes on the role of an Airborne soldier in 1944 as the Allies are beginning the liberation of Europe. The ten mission campaign takes place around three major engagements: Operation Market Garden, the battle of the Bulge, and the battle for the bridge at Remagen.\n\nThe game uses the LithTech Jupiter engine and the same basic mechanics of the Marine Sniper games, although the emphasis is more on action and less on stealth. There are a few rail style vehicle missions and the player usually operates without an A.I. sidekick (although some missions include protecting and providing cover fire for friendly soldiers). Most of the time, the weapon of choice for eliminating enemies is the Springfield M1903 Sniper Rifle, but there are a few additional choices available for when things get hairy including Thompson submachine guns, grenades and bazookas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-war-ii-sniper-call-to-victory"}
