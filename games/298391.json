Here he will find death and a deadly virus, already widespread throughout much of the Outer Rim of the known galaxy. Seeking help, he finds an old resistance outpost, seemingly abandoned. In an attempt to find a means of communication to call for help, he enlists the help of his faithful but damaged droid DD5.
