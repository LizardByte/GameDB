It seemed only natural that developers would create advancements to the original AY-3-8500 chip to incorporate color and even more games. This explains the amount of PONG systems since each machine contained a different chip. However things were handled different in some areas particularly in Europe. \n \nEurope did not see the release of the Intellivision and Atari 2600 till the early 1980s. This allowed Pong to have a longer success. Rather then creating a new machine for each new chip, developers took the General Instruments popular line of chips and slapped them into cartridges. These carts were not like ROM carts used in later systems. They simply housed a specific General Instruments processor chip with pin outs to interface with a console. These were the PC-50X line of cartridges. \n \nWith the PC-50X cartridges available, console manufacturers were able to produce a machine that could play several games and market them at a low cost. The units were made in various countries and were marketed by Creatronic, Hanimex, ITMC, Rollet, GrandStand, Soundic and lord knows how many other manufacturers. There are literally over two hundred console variations that utilized this technology. \n \nThe initial model SD-050 varied in terms of outward appearance (colors, etc), manufacturers names and slight modifications. However each unit had the same overall design with two detachable controllers with 10 buttons located on the top of the machine. These 10 buttons, which clearly identify a PC-50X based console, were used to select the different games available on each cart. The SD-050 model only produced black and white video. \n \nNew models such as the SD-070 and SD-090 appeared and sold well into the 80s since the units were far cheaper then the newer consoles making waves in the US and Japan. These newer models played the same carts, but added additional settings, sound and SECAM color (4 colors).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/pc-50x-family/version/initial-version"}, {"id": 205, "name": "Tele-Cassetten-Game", "platform_logo": {"id": 132, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dpwrkxrjkuxwqroqwjsw.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 245, "date": 283910400, "human": "1978", "m": 12, "region": 8, "y": 1978}], "summary": "This is a typical incarnation of the PC-50x systems using cartridges based on General Instruments chips. \n \nTen small buttons, are used to select the different games offered by the inserted cartridge. The cartridge offering the greatest number of games is \"10-Ballspiele\" with 10 games. The playing options are activated by the three switches. Each option depends on the cartridge inserted, the meaning of switches being explained on each cartridge label. The joysticks are detachable and are connected to the system through connectors placed on each side. \n \nCartridges released are the classic ones for these systems using cartridges based on General Instrument chips: Ball games, Motorcycle, Car racing, Submarine, Super wipeout, Tank battle and maybe Shooting gallery. These are generic english titles. Real titles are in German. \n \nConcerning the Tank Battle cartridge, the problem is that this game requires digital controllers as opposed to the analog joystick of the system. The Palladium system is one of the few GI based systems which offered optional numeric keypads to play this game! \n \nThe shooting games require the use of a light gun, which usually came with the cartridge. \n \nThere are in fact two models of the Palladium Tele-Cassetten-Game. The cases are different (see \"more pictures\" section), but everything else is identical (games, front panel, controllers, etc.). Why two systems? Maybe Palladium first marketed this licenced product using a \"common\" case used by other brands such as MBO and Optim, and then decided to redesign its own case so that consumers would identify more clearly the Palladium system. \n \nThis system (at least the \"first\" case style) was also marketed as the MBO Tele-Cassetten-System and Optim 600.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/pc-50x-family/version/tele-cassetten-game"}], "games": [{"id": 68144, "cover": {"id": 29986, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmmsdcp5kqhbjdtyxiqi.jpg"}, "name": "Solo", "release_dates": [{"id": 113348, "date": 220838400, "platform": 140, "y": 1976}, {"id": 113349, "date": 252374400, "platform": 141, "y": 1977}]}, {"id": 68146, "cover": {"id": 29988, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bjnmpsoe9db8uprjoxwj.jpg"}, "name": "Target", "release_dates": [{"id": 113356, "date": 220838400, "platform": 140, "y": 1976}]}, {"id": 37788, "cover": {"id": 203589, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4d39.jpg"}, "name": "Thoroughbred Breeder II", "release_dates": [{"id": 336502, "date": 771033600, "platform": 58, "y": 1994}]}, {"id": 68145, "cover": {"id": 29987, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bc9dpyjxkbr2cv05capo.jpg"}, "name": "Skeet", "release_dates": [{"id": 113354, "date": 220838400, "platform": 140, "y": 1976}]}, {"id": 68458, "cover": {"id": 30165, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxjskizvhftmz1jtko7l.jpg"}, "name": "Submarine", "release_dates": [{"id": 113955, "date": 252374400, "platform": 146, "y": 1977}, {"id": 113956, "date": 283910400, "platform": 142, "y": 1978}]}, {"id": 28353, "cover": {"id": 30166, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vkvfjaklnxzbatvvedof.jpg"}, "name": "Super Wipeout", "release_dates": [{"id": 113959, "date": 283910400, "platform": 142, "y": 1978}]}, {"id": 68273, "cover": {"id": 30014, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nusqdqb5bjqqdhdqsjvx.jpg"}, "name": "Supersportic", "release_dates": [{"id": 113401, "date": 283910400, "platform": 142, "y": 1978}]}, {"id": 37952, "cover": {"id": 49199, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qnggg1ogpua0khx4zhtl.jpg"}, "name": "Koushien 3", "release_dates": [{"id": 333461, "date": 775440000, "platform": 58, "y": 1994}]}, {"id": 28354, "cover": {"id": 30101, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyo5tzuxg8n26ecplbvu.jpg"}, "name": "Car Race", "release_dates": [{"id": 113771, "date": 252374400, "platform": 145, "y": 1977}, {"id": 113772, "date": 283910400, "platform": 142, "y": 1978}]}, {"id": 68274, "cover": {"id": 30015, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n5tjcvvhdhid3nvwz9dj.jpg"}, "name": "Motor Cycle", "release_dates": [{"id": 113402, "date": 283910400, "platform": 142, "y": 1978}]}, {"id": 18587, "cover": {"id": 30182, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zbfqazjwzpnldo4fbml7.jpg"}, "name": "Shooting Gallery", "release_dates": [{"id": 114075, "date": 252374400, "platform": 148, "y": 1977}, {"id": 114076, "date": 283910400, "platform": 142, "y": 1978}]}, {"id": 68143, "cover": {"id": 29985, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/is3p1cpsgagxlqo4rp3f.jpg"}, "name": "Squash", "release_dates": [{"id": 113344, "date": 220838400, "platform": 140, "y": 1976}, {"id": 113345, "date": 252374400, "platform": 141, "y": 1977}]}]}
