The virus, called Romulus, is followed by a computer virus called Remus which is programmed to delete files on any computer in the world, in this case, files relating to Prometheus and Romulus, so an anti-virus cannot be formulated. Prometheus then plans to blackmail the G8 countries at a summit in Switzerland for billions of dollars. It is revealed throughout the course of the game that a mole inside The Shop may be feeding information to the terrorists.", "summary": "Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix is a video game created by Raven Software, a sequel to Soldier of Fortune. It was developed using the Quake III: Team Arena engine. Once again, Raven hired John Mullins to act as a consultant on the game. Based on comments and criticisms of the original game, Raven Software developed Soldier of Fortune II to be a more \"realistic\" game, with tactical shooters like Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six as inspirations rather than Quake. A sequel titled Soldier of Fortune: Payback, made by Cauldron HQ was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2007.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soldier-of-fortune-ii-double-helix", "videos": [{"id": 37698, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eNc2SZKpn0A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNc2SZKpn0A", "title": "Soldier of Fortune 2: Double Helix Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eNc2SZKpn0A/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 424, "name": "Alexei Nachrade"}, {"id": 429, "name": "Dr. Dmitri Sestrogor"}, {"id": 435, "name": "Huang Zhenmeng"}, {"id": 434, "name": "Domingo Sanchez"}, {"id": 437, "name": "Domovra Nemec"}, {"id": 438, "name": "Sgt.
