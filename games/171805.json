Centers around filling a temperature gauge by staying alive and generally playing well; as it rises, enemies become more dangerous, but more points are rewarded for collecting items and clearing boss special attacks, now called \"Tricks\". A new type of special attack, the \"Ignite Shot\", is introduced to allow the player to decrease this gauge. Features four playable characters (including bosses from the previous game). Also contains eight Challenge Tricks for the eight new characters, but these must be unlocked by capturing certain Tricks on all difficulties.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ore-no-animism-resurrection-chapter"}
