As Carbuncle was dancing about, a book with a moon and sun fell out of the sky and in front of the duo. As they approached the book, the cover flings itself open, revealing a portal that draws them into a world inside the book. As the book shuts its covers, Arle and Carbuncle come crashing down into the middle of Grimp Forest like shooting stars. This draws the attention of Ally, who was taking a leisurely walk with her pendant glowing upon their presence. As Arle regains consciousness, she is confronted by Satan to be informed that she is the heroine of the world she's transported to. However, before Arle could admonish him, Satan tells her to head for the tower before he gets spirited away.", "summary": "An action puzzle RPG for 3DS set to celebrate the Puyo Puyo series\u2019 25th anniversary.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-chronicle", "videos": [{"id": 90518, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vY9f6FBVX1c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY9f6FBVX1c", "title": "Puyo Puyo Chronicle | debut trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vY9f6FBVX1c/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3350, "name": "Puyo Puyo"}]}
