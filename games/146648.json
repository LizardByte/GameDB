And... while on it, she may find files and things that where hidden... for a good reason.\n\nIncarnate as Liza discovering odd secrets, fighting bunny-suit troops, deceased computer garbage, among other deep digital-creatures from the computer insides.\n\nThe gameplay for Fi da Puti Samurai is quite simple.\nThis is not a cumbersome RPG game, bug an action-oriented roguelite.
