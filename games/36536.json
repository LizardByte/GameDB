In this offshoot (pardon the pun) of the series, you are a combat pilot during World War II, for either the RAF, USAAF or Luftwaffe.\n\nEight different planes and the battered cities of Berlin, Paris and London are incorporated. Full cockpit designs and damage models are featured - watch for engine smoke and explosion debris.\n\nThere is a full campaign mode, which takes in the Battle of Britain, defending London during the Blitz, and finishing the job started on D-Day by pummeling ground targets.You can also play individual missions or fly freely. Online multiplayer options allow you to take this worldwide fight around the real world.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/microsoft-combat-flight-simulator-wwii-europe-series"}
