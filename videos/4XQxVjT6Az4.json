Wishlist on Steam: https://bit.ly/Wishlist-Aloft\n\nAloft is a co-op sandbox survival game where you soar freely through a beautiful world of floating islands, each with its own living ecosystem. Build a home and a helm, and transform any island into your own personal skyship to set sail for the ever-present hurricane in the distance.\n\nHarness the winds to automate machinery and production, explore islands to find new technology, and seek out seeds and animals to create your own cozy farm in the clouds. In dark places you will find a spreading corruption of mushroom creatures. Defeat them in combat, cure the islands, and restore their ecosystems.\n\n#Aloft #survivalgame \n\nJoin us in the skies\nhttps://x.com/Aloft_Game\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@aloft_game\nhttp://discord.gg/aloft-game", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XQxVjT6Az4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XQxVjT6Az4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XQxVjT6Az4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XQxVjT6Az4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4XQxVjT6Az4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Aloft \u2013 New Multiplayer Demo Trailer", "description": "We are proud to announce our partnership with Astrolabe Interactive to bring you feel-good survival game set in the sky, Aloft.
