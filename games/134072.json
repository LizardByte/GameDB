This substance, known as the \"Soul of Jiu Xuan\", possesses the ability to reanimate the dead. In an attempt to take possession of the substance, the \"SAI\" - a massive terrorist organization controlling its own army - has used a cutting-edge piece of technology known as a \"Quantum Transporter\" to infiltrate the SRO research facility and steal top-secret and incredibly dangerous data. To make matters worse, while attempting to calibrate coordinates on the Quantum Transporter, Shelia mistakenly activates the device, immediately transporting everyone in the vicinity to the Floating Island - an airborne continent near the North Pole, undisturbed in its slumber for over 1000 years. It is soon discovered that the various beasts and corpses of those who once populated the island have been reanimated by the \"Soul of Jiu Xuan\", and they're coming for Shelia...", "summary": "Bright Memory is a lightning-fast fusion of the FPS and action genres, created by one-man development studio FYQD using Unreal Engine.
