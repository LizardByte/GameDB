Heading out with his senior partner Anna Steele, Lazarus sets off on what he believes is a routine call but, in the true spirit of survival horror, it's not long before the crime-bothering duo are knee-deep in ectoplasm. After much bickering between the pair, Jones somehow inadvertently sets free a horde of ghosts contained in the school's secret paranormal research lab. An errant apparition materialises, grabs Anna, and drags her away with him to a dark, eerie place (the school canteen, perhaps?). One of the wayward spooks (Astral) also manages to 'bond' with Jones, giving him the gift of supernatural sight, allowing him to see dead people. Nice. Picking up the reins as Laz, you'll start out in search of Anna, and attempt to figure out the mysteries buried deep in the school's past along the way...", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ghosthunter", "videos": [{"id": 132028, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bQvkjX74dew", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQvkjX74dew", "title": "Ghosthunter - PS2 Trailers [High Quality]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQvkjX74dew/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 132029, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XsvRqDl2R5w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsvRqDl2R5w", "title": "Ghosthunter (PS2) Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XsvRqDl2R5w/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 132030, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0GArMySbq5A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GArMySbq5A", "title": "Ghosthunter (2003) - E3 2003 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0GArMySbq5A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
