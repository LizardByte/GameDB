Not only is it difficult, but the original release is actually impossible to complete.\n\nThe objective is to collect the flashing crosses on each stage as you control some random guy on a mission to rescue is girlfriend from various spooky ghouls and zombies.\n\nYou have a finite amount of energy that gets used up just by walking and jumping, whilst touching enemies or collecting toadstools will sap your energy even further. To make matters worse, your energy does not recharge between levels. The only way to replenish health is to collect the purple mushrooms lying around each level.\n\nYou might think this is simple enough until the game throws you a curve ball; when you find your girlfriend, you have to replay all the levels again in reverse order controlling both the guy and his girl, each having their own crosses to collect. Trying to keep both characters out of harms way is hard enough, but any mushrooms you collected will NOT reappear; if you used too many getting to your girlfriend then there's no way to replenish health on the way back.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, the developers placed several crosses in places that you can't get to, meaning the game could never be finished. Not until, that is, that a cracker group got their hands on the game and moved these crosses to areas that you could get them.\n\nThe final thing of note about this game is the original release had a soundtrack obviously \"inspired\" by Michael Jackson's Thriller. The story goes that litigation was threatened and a new version was released with a different soundtrack, which is the one I'm playing here.\n\nOh, and even if you DO manage to beat the game, it loops straight back to the first level again; no ending at all.\n\nEnjoy!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oeC8qRbUvE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oeC8qRbUvE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oeC8qRbUvE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oeC8qRbUvE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_oeC8qRbUvE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Chiller Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Released by Mastertronic in 1985.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nThere's no doubt that old games were much harder than those released today, but even by those standards, Chiller takes some beating.
