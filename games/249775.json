Gameplay has the player drop bombs over a city to clear an area that you can land.\n\nOriginally released as 'Bomb Buenos Aires', the game's theme was developed early in Jeff Minter's career, \"intended as a tongue in cheek\" response to the then ongoing Falkland Island, where buildings with small Argentinian flag's and the \"Rule Britannia\" play if the plane landed successfully. Written complaints and negative press would lead to the game quickly reissued and amended into \"Bomber\" or \"City Bomb\" as it's know today.\n\nBomber was one of the earliest games developed by Minter under Llamasoft.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bomber--5", "videos": [{"id": 128646, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rZej1gGbeM8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZej1gGbeM8", "title": "Bomber / City Bomber (Llamasoft, 1982) (video 2) (ZX Spectrum)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rZej1gGbeM8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
