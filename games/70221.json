The Trade Federation blockade has been destroyed and the deadly Darth Maul has been defeated. Queen Amidala has returned to her people in triumph.\n\nThe cost of victory was great. Qui-Gon and many brave Gungans and Naboo perished in the final battle. Much still remains to be accomplished. Yoda has returned to the Palace of the Jedi, where he awaits the arrival of a young new recruit sent by Obi-Wan...", "summary": "Just as Yoda instructed Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force, now he can instruct your children in the ways of math, music, reading, and other skills -- well, almost. Instead of the swamps of Dagobah as a setting, your kids can sit comfortably in front of the family computer as they play Star Wars: Yoda's Challenge Activity Center.\n\nAimed at children between the ages of six and eight, the animated program features six games meant to entertain them as they learn. Each game has four difficulty levels and focuses on teaching a designated subject. In addition to Yoda, several characters from Star Wars movies help to administer the activities, most notably Jar Jar Binks, Queen Amidala, C-3PO, and the Mos Eisley cantina band.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-yodas-challenge-activity-center"}
