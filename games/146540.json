What you are about to experience is the result of over 18 years of grueling research on one of History's most elusive GameToy titles. I have attempted here to faithfully recreate the experience as it was intended- salvaging interviews, screenshots, and promotional videos from Nindendy Power- to give the most complete simulation of this masterwork as can be done with modern technology. I hope some enjoy it- and more are moved by it. What started as a hobby has become a life-changing opportunity to enlighten the gamers of the world, and I think this is it. Thank you.\n\nDR.
