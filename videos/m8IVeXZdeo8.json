The minigame, tho seen a number of times I guess, is good I guess.\n\nWell we are not done yet on this game jam, as there's one more game, specifically I mentioned this during one game in commentary version, of playing a game by someone else released on this game jam, so stay tuned!\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8IVeXZdeo8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8IVeXZdeo8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8IVeXZdeo8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8IVeXZdeo8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8IVeXZdeo8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[RPG Maker Horror Game Jam #7 Game: Hunter Becomes Hunted] RACK AND RUN (No Commentary)", "description": "Game link: https://lwlvyei.itch.io/rack-and-run\nCommentary Version: https://youtu.be/pWuQhzk1lF0\n\n(A bit of capitalization typo on the game info in video, so I'm sorry in advanced about that.
