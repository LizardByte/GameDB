Armed to the teeth with new exciting gear these diverse robes will give the players plenty of new tactics to employ in all existing game modes:\n\u2022 The Zombie Robe is a resilient one. This number has a freaky, yet oddly appealing, parasite attached to it\u2019s head. For some reason it turns the wearer into some type of shambling, incomprehensible, crow bar wielding monster. But that\u2019s okay because, while a bit slower, the wearer can now take a punch or two thousand.\n\u2022 Wizards have been known to go through great lengths in order to cosplay as their favorite game characters. The Tentacle Robe, and it\u2019s accompanying Ray-Gun, are great for conventions as well as general forest wear. While some people might point and laugh at this wizard, others would just love to have their photo taken next to him (or her.)\n\u2022 Epic Robe is epic claims this wizard. While he may have lost his mount he still has all his other epic gear. The epic amount of hours and sodas he consumed to earn it is no match for the even more epic-y-ness of the sword and armor.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magicka-gamer-bundle"}
