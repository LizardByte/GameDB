{"id": "mtCq53IouHk", "snippet": {"title": "Mountain King: Scariest Game Ever", "description": "Resident Evil?  Pfffft!  This game is way scarier.\n\nLet me explain the rules, because this game is a bit ambitious for a pre-NES game that stars a nameless stick figure. It uses both sound and light.  There are three parts to the game.\n\n1)  Descend into the mountain and collect 1000 diamonds.  You can also use your flashlight to find treasure chests full of diamonds.\n2)  Find the flame spirit to gain access to the golden crown.  The golden spirit can be found by following the music.  You have to use the flashlight to see it.\n3)  Collect the golden crown and get back to the top of the mountain.  Avoid the bats (else you have to start over) and never, ever fall into the bottom pit.  I SAID DON'T!!  ACK!  PRESS RESET!!!!  RESET!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe controls are a bit rough because you jump by pressing up/right or up/left.  The fire button is reserved for the flashlight.\n\nNote that I actually sort of edited this video.  I had dozen of more minutes of me trying to escape and failing.  In one playthrough, I ran out of time.  The game will start random fires in the last minute to try to end your game.\n\nI created this video with the YouTube Video Editor (http://www.youtube.com/editor)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mtCq53IouHk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mtCq53IouHk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mtCq53IouHk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mtCq53IouHk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mtCq53IouHk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mountain King: Scariest Game Ever", "description": "Resident Evil?
