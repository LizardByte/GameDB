It was developed and published by Gottlieb, and became their most successful game. The concept serves as a precursor to the isometric platformer genre, where the title character must work to turn all cubes to a certain colour in a psuedo-3D world, made 3D through isometric graphics in the same way that the Penrose Stairs was made. The game was widely successful and has become a highly recognizable brand of the 1980s gaming era.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/q-bert", "videos": [{"id": 106437, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HKIbhaQfs-A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKIbhaQfs-A", "title": "Arcade Game: Q*bert (1982 Gottlieb)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HKIbhaQfs-A/sddefault.jpg"}]}
