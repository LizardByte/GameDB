The less dithered look makes it look abit better than Road Avenger, but seems to come at the cost of an even lower resolution. The final level was a real pain as there is literely split seconds between all the targets on screen and you have to shoot the missile at them before the enemy is on screen. Another enjoyable Arcade game though. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0V5gboD9AIw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0V5gboD9AIw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0V5gboD9AIw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega-CD Longplay [121] Cobra Command", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nCobra Command played on Advanced difficulty, no visual hitboxes shown.
