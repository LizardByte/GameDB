Meet the training crew of the USS Mercury - a rag-tag of gorgeous aliens, sexy cyborgs and predatory milfs. Seduce your beautiful fellow cadets in an ongoing dating-sim to see just how close you can all get. Visit strange new worlds and new civilizations with very different moral codes.\n\nYour path is open for you to choose.

Seduce your childhood sweetheart; or humiliate your school bully. Explore kinks you never even knew you had!", "summary": "SpaceCorps is a 3DCG sci-fi adult-comedy with insanely lewd content from start to finish. There are a huge number of kinks in SpaceCorps - including LGBT content - but they are all entirely optional for players.
