A huge emphasis has been placed on Pok\u00e9mon availability, with most areas in the game offering 10 or 11 species that haven't been seen before that point. The mostly equal chance of encountering any of the Pok\u00e9mon in an area also mean you're unlikely to get the same thing twice on the first encounter, making the game lend itself well to Nuzlocke runs (if you can handle the extra challenge from the trainer battles!).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-rising-ruby"}
