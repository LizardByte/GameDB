{"id": "_kqsm9Oq5bI", "snippet": {"title": "Troll Patrol", "description": "\"A Troll's Tale - Troll Patrol\" is a puzzle game which combines the tile-matching and RPG genres by offering a unique experience: Play as the last defender of the threatened troll den where vicious village people and heroes from far away castles and kingdoms knock down your door.\n\nStand firm, take whatever weapon is close and fight them off to get your family and friends to safety. Protect what is rightfully yours, your home, your heritage. They come for blood, for revenge, to still their blood thirst. But you won't allow it.\n\nMore and more enemies pour through the broken door and by connecting them to sword tiles you can fight them off. Once you get hit you can connect potions to heal your wounds or connect shields to improve your armor. Connecting gold might lead to new treasures that help you defend what is yours and keep their filthy hands of your stuff.\n\nFeatures (might be more now as more are added during the beta):\n- Over 50 unlockable types of enemies\n- 6 unlockable weapon types\n- 6 unlockable playable classes\n- Endless waves of enemies\n- Over 50 active and passive skills and powerups\n- Over 40 event cards with multiple choices and outcomes\n- Over 15 quests to choose from\n- Improve your cave for permanent bonuses\n- Leaderboard and Achievements\n\n\n\nAvailable for:\n Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fellhuhn.monstermatch\n iOS: [TBD]", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kqsm9Oq5bI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kqsm9Oq5bI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kqsm9Oq5bI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Troll Patrol", "description": "\"A Troll's Tale - Troll Patrol\" is a puzzle game which combines the tile-matching and RPG genres by offering a unique experience: Play as the last defender of the threatened troll den where vicious village people and heroes from far away castles and kingdoms knock down your door.\n\nStand firm, take whatever weapon is close and fight them off to get your family and friends to safety.
