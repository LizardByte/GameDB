Despite being a total novice when it comes to Pok\u00e9mon, she does own one. Finally, she does you the favor of retrieving the Pok\u00e9mon. At first the task seems very simple. Run to Team ShockIt's HQ, defeat the few members, and retrieve the Pok\u00e9mon and the E. But the Pok\u00e9mon and the E have already been taken away. In a top secret laboratory. There they try to create the ultimate Pokemon! To make matters worse, after storming Team ShockIt HQ, the police are after you.
