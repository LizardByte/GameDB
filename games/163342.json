She overhears Itou talking about how he lost something precious and that he has to find it before it falls in the other members' hands. When Chizuru finds and opens the box that Itou lost, suddenly everyone goes into chibi mode and now Chizuru (and your dude of choice) have to figure out a way to return back to normal. The challenge is, you must successfully pass a bunch of mini games to get to the bottom of things!"}
