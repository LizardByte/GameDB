However, the enemies in Galaga have the power to steal your ship to use as reinforcements (meaning the player loses a life). However, if you are able to destroy the enemy who has captured your ship, you are able to pilot both ships at once, doubling your firepower at the expense of being a bigger target.\n\nThough Sega-Galaga is essentially the same game as the arcade original, the limitations of the SG-1000 means the graphics and sound are not quite as advanced. Also the \"challenging stages\" have been omitted, meaning each stage is identical to the last.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-galaga", "collections": [{"id": 1971, "name": "Galaga"}]}
