I've been wanting to do this for a while and somehow found the motivation to finally do it. This is a full playthrough of the Indigo demo with my commentary on version v0.1.11, which is not available publicly. (Not much important has changed since v0.1.10, the current public version, so don't worry). I share some of my thoughts and motivations that went into making the game, as well as interesting insights I've gained from watching other players. I hope you'll enjoy this!\n\nMy goal is to release another small demo by the end of the year, primarily aimed at testing all of the new items and mechanics we've created. This second demo will likely be the last public version until the full game is released.\n\nTP Link model used in Indigo created by Skilar Babcock:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/skilarbabcock\n\nSkybox used in second dungeon created by Zel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXUJgD8VMY_yEHY8ebY4k-g\n\nThe Indigo team is no longer just me!
