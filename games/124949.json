The alliance of the Twelve Colonies was severed in two. Lucinda Cain disbanded Colonial Fleet, and Daidalos was abandoned, an empty husk left to drift the storm clouds of Ragnar.\nLachesis held true to its promise of a year-long ceasefire. But the minute the ceasefire expired, Cylon forces invaded the remaining two-thirds of the colonies.\nThe vicious ground war has raged across Cyrannus since. Rebellions formed early on Caprica and Tauron. Ex-soldiers and armed civilians formed underground resistance, and fight an insurgent war against the invading forces.\nThe battle weary rebellion has launched an ambitious project; the secret reconstruction of the battlestar Galactica. With it, the reborn Colonial Fleet has again become the last beacon of hope for mankind, a testament of human tenacity and its will to survive.", "summary": "Battlestar Galactica Deadlock: Resurrection is the expansion that marks the beginning of Season Two and introduces a plethora of new features and content.
