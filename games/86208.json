The game begins with a qualification lap before the race itself starts. Racing is arcade-style, with Outrun-style 3rd person perspective view graphics and a timer that indicates how much time is left before the next checkpoint has to be reached. Opponents fill the track and billboards fill its sidelines - crashing too fast into either displays a spectacular crash animation and takes valuable time off the clock. The game offers a choice of automatic or manual gear switching. The time of day passes during racing, thus offering driving in sunsets and sunrises and during the night.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 55193, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "MixXYnw58KA"}]}
