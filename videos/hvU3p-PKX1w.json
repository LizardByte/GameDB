This is a video of when that happened. \n\nDISCLAIMER: All credit goes to Toby Fox, Fangamer, and the team behind Deltarune. I own nothing shown in this video.\nI make no money from this video. I have no control over any ads shown. If someone knows how I can turn off ads in this video, let me know.\n\nOriginal Stream:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksOYId-cNA\nThe entire stream is worth watching, but skip to 3:52:20 for the part that this video takes from.\n\nChapter 2 is out now on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, and PS4.\n\nA week ago on September 8th, Toby Fox, creator of Undertale and Deltarune, announced that he'd be streaming Deltarune Chapter 1 with live commentary from him (in the form of text-to-speech). After a four-hour stream and the ending cutscene plays, we see this video. \n\nKeep in mind that up until this point, Toby has said that he planned to release all of the chapters at once and not individually, so him deciding to release Chapter 2 early, probably for free, is completely out of left field. For me, I was prepared to wait for years until being actually able to play this game.\n\nMaybe replay Deltarune Chapter 1 to refresh your memory a bit on the game. But yeah, September 17th, 8PM EST. See you all there. \n\nChapters:\n0:00 Deltarune Chapter 1 Ending Cutscene\n1:30 Deltarune Credits \n2:14 To be continued (Usually says \"To be continued in Chapter 2\")\n2:37 Continue?\n3:37 Toby comes on camera\n5:14 Chapter 2 Start!\n12:27 Release Date\n\n#deltarune #deltarunechapter2 #undertale", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hvU3p-PKX1w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hvU3p-PKX1w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hvU3p-PKX1w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hvU3p-PKX1w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hvU3p-PKX1w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Deltarune Chapter 2 - Initial Reveal (Spoilers for Chapter 1!)", "description": "Toby Fox revealed Deltarune Chapter 2.
