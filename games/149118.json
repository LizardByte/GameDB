They founded farms, raised cattle, dug for gold, built settlements and towns. A small find of gold is often enough to draw hundreds of daring adventurers while quickly a small settlement becomes a flourishing town with saloons, merchants, gambling, adventurers, and gunslingers...\n\nEnter this breathtakingly exciting time and conquer the Wild West. Emerge from being a lonesome cowboy over founding a settlement to becoming the mayor of a gold-digger town: there are hardly any limits to your personal endeavors.\n\nYou start out as a lonesome cowboy who comes across an abandoned ranch and decides to stay. You start repairing and expanding. You gather food, hunt for animals and sell their meat and leather to settler trecks. Once you have established a decent ranch, other settlers may decide to stay and ask for permission to settle down. You start building a town with all its classic locations such as saloon, Sheriff office, stores and even hotels. Bandits will come your way, so you better learn shooting and defend yourself and the township properly. Hopefully you will find a wife and have a heir - so that your wild west dynasty can last for long.", "summary": "Wild West Dynasty: Cowboys, Settlers & Gunslingers!
