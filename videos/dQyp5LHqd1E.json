You will use freaking creepy mutations and lurk among the shadows to hunt your preys. There is a briefly tutorial, but it's up to you to discover the special habilities of the infected ones.\n\nThis project is part of the \"One Game a Month\" Jam. Each month I gonna put all my efforts to create a game from scratch and deliver a playable and nice looking project. Once I hit the 30th day, the game is released as it is, therefore, it might have some issues. Leave me a comment if you find any bugs.\n___________\n#walkthrough", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQyp5LHqd1E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQyp5LHqd1E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQyp5LHqd1E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "You Are Undead Walkthrough", "description": "This is a walkthrough of the game \"You Are Undead\".\n\nPlay the game here: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/713535\n\nYou can visit my Patreon page if you want or something:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/awalkthroughlife\n\nGame created by fabioecco (Fabio Esteves)\n___________\nGame description (from creator):\nYou didn't survive the zombie apocalypse and now you are a brain eater undead feeding on the last remnants of humanity.
