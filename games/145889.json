At first, only one course can be selected, two others can be unlocked through tournament play. Four characters are available for visual representation. The aim is visualized by a punctured line indicating the direction of where the ball will go, the power of the shot is simply controlled by a button press and showed on a bar. There is an eight-stroke limit per hole. Some of the challenges are in tune with the medieval theme, like putting the ball at the right moment into a hole while an armour suit puts a sword down.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mini-golf-castles"}
