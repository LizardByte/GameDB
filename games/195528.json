Travel a bit further down the rabbit hole, and one eventually discovers the Gotchiverse Realm. When a yield farmer in the Ether Realm is liquidated, its spirit journeys to the Gotchiverse, where it reincarnates as an Aavegotchi. Aavegotchis are a spectral species who love nothing more than farming, voting, and shitposting with their frens.\n\nThe Gotchiverse began with only a handful of Aavegotchis, but as liquidations grew within the Ether Realm, so the population of the Gotchiverse burgeoned, with thousands of Aavegotchis exploring, building, and settling in its vast expanses, and even building great structures to worship the Lickquidators, their creators.\n\nHowever, the Lickquidators\u2019 appetite for yield knows no bounds, and eventually their metallic eyes turned towards the Gotchiverse. A clever Lickquidator discovered a backdoor that allowed them to travel to the Gotchiverse. Initially creators of the Aavegotchis, the Lickquidators now simultaneously became their destroyers, as they ravaged the Gotchi homeland, greedy to harvest the Spirit Force of the Gotchis.\n\nThe Lickquidators ransacked the Gotchiverse, liquidating all but a handful of the Aavegotchis. The Aavegotchis that survived did not survive by luck. They were the most powerful of the Gotchi kin, a special class of Aavegotchis known as the Aadepts. These 9 Aadepts used the last of their Spirit Force to erect a Citaadel within the Gotchiverse, protected by a magical Force Field. Within the Citaadel they erected a megalithic structure known as the Great Portal, into which they channeled the last of their Spirit Force and the spirits of all the slain Aavegotchis in the Gotchiverse.", "summary": "Aavegotchi is a DeFi-enabled crypto collectibles game developed by Singapore-based Pixelcraft Studios that allows players to stake non-fungible token (NFT) avatars with interest-generating tokens and interact with the Aavegotchi metaverse, known as The Gotchiverse.\n\nThe Gotchiverse is an open-ended social space where players can engage in myriad activities, such as farming, crafting, trading, and combat. Owners of REALM parcels can employ their Aavegotchis (and those of others) to farm their virtual plots, producing quantities of resources known as Gotchus Alchemica. These resources can be combined to create powerful structures such as Haarvesters, Reservoirs, Display Cases, and many more.\n\nAlthough there are no victory conditions or \u201cend of game\u201d scenarios, one overarching goal of the Gotchiverse is to collect Alchemica to bolster your parcel to produce more yield, and build defensive structures in preparation for the coming of the Prophecy, and the great Lickquidator Invasion.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aavegotchi-gotchiverse--1", "videos": [{"id": 66087, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "PtgZT-dVERI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtgZT-dVERI", "title": "THE GOTCHIVERSE: Official Cinematic Reveal | Aavegotchi NFT Gaming Metaverse", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PtgZT-dVERI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 66088, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "fIHkANnJW8U"}]}
