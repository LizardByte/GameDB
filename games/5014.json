Race on circuits in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and even Antarctica. Drive trucks that have different car frames like a taxi, a mini cooper, an ambulance, a school bus, the original truck frame and much more. All of these can be customized with vinyls, paint jobs and performance parts. While racing you can score points to unlock hidden cars and tracks, by hitting barrels that can hurt opponents, and hitting tires, crates and buildings."}
