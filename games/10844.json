Thor's Hammer Organization (THO), is a shadowy organization with connections all over Europe and the goal of world domination.

The obvious influence of Norse mythology on the organization's name is further shown by the fact that all THO members use a mythological name as their call sign.\n\nIn exchange for the services of both Allied and Axis higher-ups, Thor's Hammer provides them with some of their inventions, including Panzerkleins. Panzerkleins are very difficult to destroy, as they are essentially immune to small arms fire.", "summary": "1943: The world seems to face its destruction in all parts; war is raging like never before.
