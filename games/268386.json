The original is a golf manga produced by Japanese cartoonist Fujiko Fujio A. The protagonist is often called \"ape\" because he looks like a monkey. In the game version, players have to compete with assassins organized by Shadow Golf in the natural environment. The various nirvana skills that appeared in the original work also have a very gorgeous performance in the game. Using the somatosensory operation of the Wii remote control, players will be able to experience a very realistic feeling of hitting the ball during the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pro-golfer-saru", "videos": [{"id": 112672, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "YLrAFEneRRw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLrAFEneRRw", "title": "Wii - Pro Golfer Saru \u30d7\u30ed\u30b4\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u733f", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YLrAFEneRRw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
