The game also has an affinity with the sick and righteous, much like Sonic, Toejam & Earl and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.\n\nYou play the role of Deathbulge, a band that stumbles into a cursed Battle of the Bands contest, where all entrants can attack and be attacked with music. After all, it just wouldn\u2019t be a real BATTLE if no one got hurt, would it?\n\nDeathbulge is made up of Faye on Guitar, Ian on Bass and Briff on drums. The name Deathbulge is inspired, of course, by Ian's deathly face and bulging muscles.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 80911, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "spWr6AK7C-Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spWr6AK7C-Q", "title": "Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands Early Demo GAMEPLAY!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/spWr6AK7C-Q/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
