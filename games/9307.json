And when we say fast, we mean breakneck, flat-out, adrenaline fuelled fast! What\u2019s different from the other shooters is your goal isn\u2019t to run through levels and finish the game, but to survive for as long as possible under increasingly frantic conditions (we say as long as possible because ultimately you will die!).\n\nSurviving longer also gains you ZKW-Points which you can cash in to totally customize your character, customize your weapons, buy new weapons, buy different perks, open new maps, and a lot lot more! Players also earn XP as they play, allowing them to level-up their character and develop them to fit their chosen gameplay skills. Survival is all about the margins, and every little extra helps!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zombie-kill-of-the-week-reborn", "videos": [{"id": 7466, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8sYi7aSeEEA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sYi7aSeEEA", "title": "Zombie Kill of the Week - Reborn Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8sYi7aSeEEA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
