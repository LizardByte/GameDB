It gives the player all the aircraft flown by the US Thunderbirds air demonstration squadron at the time of its release, together with their USAF equivalents, and a host of bonus aircraft. At the time this add-on was released the F-22 Lightning was not in service as congressional funding was needed before it could go into production and be deployed, hence the 'Future' element in the title.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-5-dot-1-the-virtual-squadron"}
