From many of these links emerged the hives.\n\nThe usual mission objectives in the game are to destroy the mutated creatures and the hives, rescue local inhabitants, while \"beaming up\" weapon upgrades along the way. Players are then awarded \"trophies\" for each world saved or if it is saved quickly.
