There are four different cars to choose from: a rally sports car, a high-wheeled muscle car, a monster truck and a buggy. There are two sets of six tracks each, each track measuring roughly three by two screens in size. Apart from the usual simultaneous two-player option, where both play on the same computer, there is a (null) modem link option, allowing four players to compete at the same time. Additionally, messages can be sent via the serial line, so as to taunt the opposing team. Depending on the available memory, there are either one, two or four kinds of cars partaking in the race.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/skidmarks"}
