This element will be secretly spread around the house along with all the furniture in the move. In addition to enter the relationship that the main character has with the parents and with their dog. \nThe player will have as much time as he wants to explore the environment and knows his family well. Because, if he doesn't know it, he may end up activating some alternative ending to the game's story. \nIn For Fun mode, the player lives a night of escape against the monster (in this mode the story is not explored, it is only mentioned).

It is a way that can make the player tense for not knowing where the monster is and even more, for the aggravating player being blind.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "videos": [{"id": 45397, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dL0iISC0riU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL0iISC0riU", "title": "Not a Happy Family (game) - Trailer do modo For Fun (Catarse)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dL0iISC0riU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
