It was made to celebrate the world coin total reaching 300 billion gold coins in New Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Nintendo 3DS. The pack consists of level designs inspired by past Super Mario games such as Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3. As a direct consequence of the circumstances behind its creation, it came out as the sixth pack, while the original sixth pack, Coin Challenge C, as well as the planned seventh DLC pack, Platform Panic Pack, were released as the seventh and eighth DLC packs, respectively. It is rated one out of five stars, meaning \"very easy\". This pack uses 2 blocks from the SD Card's memory. From its release until the end of January 2013, the Gold Classics pack was free to download", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/new-super-mario-bros-2-gold-classics-pack", "videos": [{"id": 36394, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "S5oOm5z7vxE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5oOm5z7vxE", "title": "New Super Mario Bros. 2 - Coin Rush - Gold Classics Pack", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5oOm5z7vxE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
