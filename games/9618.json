It is the second video game in the series. The game has over 100 recruitable characters which can be chosen to accompany the player in the game's dungeons. Gameplay combines elements of a MMORPG\u2014albeit in a simulated fashion as it is not an online game, though it does include limited multiplayer via ad hoc for up to four players\u2014as well as elements of a dating sim. The game takes place in the same continuity as the prior game in the series, Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment, which exists in an alternate storyline from the Sword Art Online anime storyline. The player controls the main character Kirito, who has been trapped in a MMORPG where dying in the game will lead to his death in real life as well. Part of the game is actually a high definition recompilation of Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment, the original game in the series released for the PlayStation Portable, including all content of \"Floor Clearing\" from the previous game with the addition of new unexplored \"Hollow Area\" of Aincrad.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sword-art-online-hollow-fragment", "videos": [{"id": 5341, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9Z29SnnIRaY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z29SnnIRaY", "title": "Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment - Ps Vita - Survive to SAO (E3 2014 Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Z29SnnIRaY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
