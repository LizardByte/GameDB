You on the other hand are just shocked, disbelief, apathetic and have a pounding headache from drinking so much last night.\n\nYou recall the what had happened prior to this unwanted congratulations. In the morning, you had received a text message from your dad who mentions that your cousin is getting married and that you should also find a man and settle down. You respond with a lackluster response (considering you hear this all the time). You then start your day and there's been nothing but strings mentioning marriage. You don't prioritize marriage at all and are content with your current single life as you're able to enjoy your dream job, alone time, hobbies, interests, and you also have friends to keep you company when you do feel lonely. You encounter different higher-ups who are considered eligible bachelors and very much sought after by your female colleagues.\n\nAn after office party is also being held at night so after finishing your shift, you head on over to the party place. There once again, you have to state that you're not interested in marriage when one of the married drunken managers loiter over to state his opinions. Ukyo defends you as he shares your opinions marriage and effectively shuts down the drunken manager who scurry away. Then Kunihiro joins you, Ukyo and your office friend, Miyuki in the conversation. You grab a glass with alcohol, down it and then excuse yourself because you received a message from a client.\n\nAt your desk, you email the client on what they're requesting. Satisfied, you're about to stand up and get back to the party when you feel dizzy. As it turns out, the drink you downed was very strong alcohol making you feel very drunk. That's when you start contemplating on the things you've been told throughout the day and it makes you feel pressured because you're very content with the life you have now. However, you think that there's possibly a way out by drafting up a contract on marital conditions so that it'll appease your parents, society, and still be able to keep your interest.\n\nBut, you stop. Thinking that it would probably be futile until a man decides to take that offer and sign the contract. He reasons with you as both of you share the same reasons for needing a contract marriage. In your drunken state you somewhat agree with it and sign the contract.\n\nBack to present day, your coworkers crowd around you and congratulate. As they are bugging you about the truth behind this, the man you signed the contract with comes over, puts a hand on your waist and proclaim that you're his wife and that you're both moving in together. This man you married is...?", "summary": "I lived a fun and trendy life as a working woman, but after a night of drinking, I found myself married to a coworker!?\n\nA welcome home kiss, a ring on my finger... I shouldn't feel love for a contract marriage, but why does my heart beat so fast?\n\nAn oath and a marriage registration later, can love be born from marriage?", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oops-i-said-yes", "videos": [{"id": 85074, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "GxG38S10gJo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxG38S10gJo", "title": "Oops, I Said Yes?!
