It also contains some elements from the film Slayers Gorgeous.\n\nLina Inverse and Gourry Gabriev travel to the remote countryside town of Dorutohaut after Lina receives a summons from that town's local sorcerer's guild. Once the two arrive, they speak with the local guild director who indicates that some bandits robbed the local church and stole a valuable amulet and that Lina apparently with the aid of a blonde swordsman and a long-haired sorceress defeated these bandits. Lina and Gourry encounter Naga the Serpent and it is made clear that Naga was the long haired sorceress Greg was talking about and that two individuals have been going around impersonating both Lina and Gourry. Arriving at the church, they are promised a rich reward if they can recover the amulet from the impostors. Lina and Gourry accept the job and set out to find Naga. In the midst of searching for the amulet, a mysterious person who calls herself Alicia attempts to halt the group's progress, stating that the amulet must not be found without giving an explanation as to why. Lina and Gourry, now accompanied by Naga eventually find the imposter Lina, but Naga turns on Lina and Gourry in order to claim the reward for herself. Eventually, Lina and Gourry manage to reclaim the amulet and by extension the reward.\n\nAt this point, the church's priest Robert explains the true value of this legendary amulet, stating that it is the key to opening the seal to five towers scattered throughout the land that were created long ago by the legendary sorcerer Rei Magnus. Robert then tasks Lina and Gourry to uncover whatever secrets these towers may hold. This task is made difficult though as Naga accompanied by the two imposters seeks to claim the treasure for herself and Alicia periodically appears to try to halt Lina's progress. Along the way, Lina and Gourry once again meet with Zelgadis, Amelia, Sylphiel and Lark from the first Slayers Royal game all in a quest to uncover the truth behind the five towers of Rei Magnus.", "summary": "Saturn and PlayStation game based on the hit anime series.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slayers-royal-2", "videos": [{"id": 94355, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "Nk7hbTUy_EU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk7hbTUy_EU", "title": "Slayers Royal 2 Opening", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nk7hbTUy_EU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 94356, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jTirmU7uIpY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTirmU7uIpY", "title": "PlayStation - Slayers Royal 2 (1999)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jTirmU7uIpY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
