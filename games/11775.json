The game has the players visiting the heroines\u2019 rooms in search of the \u201cNandala Gandala\u201d book. While doing this, you can select a point in the room to try and trigger a prank. If your prank is successful and you level up, Chiranosuke will appear and the story will advance. When the player peeks at the heroines\u2019 panties, their \u201cOutbreak Gauge\u201d will increase, and if it reaches its max, the entire human race is destroyed. The story will follow parts and mysteries not seen in the anime, as well as have different endings. According to scenario writer Kotaro Uchikoshi, the game adds 10 episodes over the 12-episode anime and the second half of the game will have entirely different mechanisms than the first half.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/punch-line", "videos": [{"id": 5926, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GKdIEmJIOkk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKdIEmJIOkk", "title": "\u300e\u30d1\u30f3\u30c1\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u300f\u3000TGS Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKdIEmJIOkk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 19412, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4ITHIb6pqLQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ITHIb6pqLQ", "title": "Punch Line - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ITHIb6pqLQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
