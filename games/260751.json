Just as its original version was an add-on to Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II, this is an add-on to Revival Xanadu.\n\nThe player begins in the same town, creates the protagonist, and then follows the same way to enter the dungeon area, which is the actual game world. It is there that the games become different, as the maps of Revival Xanadu II: Remix are different not only from those of the main game, but also contain layout changes and additions compared to the original version (Xanadu: Scenario 2). New regular enemies and bosses are introduced, and their design is enhanced according to the graphical standards of the previous remake.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/revival-xanadu-2-remix"}
