The entire playthrough is around an hour long so I tried to just make it as one long clip, but when I tried to render it all in one go, half the video would just be a black screen with sound. Then I moved out of my old apartment and couldn't really render anything as most of you know, or as evident by my direct-to-youtube playthrough of Ys 1 for Sega Master System. Still working on that one though since I need to replay it after my old laptop died so I lost everything I had recorded.\n\nBut what about this game?\nAppleseed: Oracle of Prometheus was released in 1994 and follows the plot of the Appleseed manga but not all the way, just one of the story arcs in the manga which I haven't read so I couldn't tell you, but I'm sure that if you've read it, you'll know exactly after watching this playthrough.\n\nThe game itself is.. rather dull frankly. But I found myself rather addicted to it's simplicity of ugly sprites and slow controls - They aren't sluggish, they just feel slow - and as such, I played through the entire game and I found myself enjoying it to a certain degree.
