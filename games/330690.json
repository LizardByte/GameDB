She's got places to be and bones to crush. Of such appointments she travels to and from by means of locomotive. She ain't in the business of lettin' strangers take her spot at the trainhouse neither \u2014 and to The POW-er, everybody's a stranger.\n\nCrash through three unique stages and get The POW-er to the station before the train arrives, with enough strength to uproot whatever poor soul finds themselves sat at the single seat this side of the Milky Way that'll quickest get them a knuckle to the nose... Not that The POW-er needs your help none anyhow.\n\nThis game was created in seven days for the Bigmode Game Jam 2025.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-pow-er"}
