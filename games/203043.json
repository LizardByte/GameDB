If Pageboy fails to catch a pig, it's destroyed and Pageboy loses a life. Lose all three, and the game is over. Pageboy can only carry 10 pigs on his head at one time.\n\nIn Mode A, you control all three characters at once.\n\nIn Mode B, Hank and Frank move up and down the ladders in a predetermined pattern (when Hank goes up, Frank goes down and vice-versa).\n\nThe number of points you earn for dropping off pigs is directly related to the number of rungs up Hank/Frank are on the ladder. Therefore, the bottom rung (or one pig on head) is worth 1 point, while the top rung is worth 10.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pigs-on-head"}
