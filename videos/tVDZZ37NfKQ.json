It is equipped with 10 USR multibarrel cannons with an effective range of over 25,000m and an optimum range of 15,000m. This weapon system supports one of the largest damage outputs of any ship operating today.\n\nIt is also equipped with jamming and missile systems and its launch bays can deploy an entire squadron of bombers that can act independently from the Destroyer. \n\nThe Destroyer is an area control vessel that uses its weapons to dominate strategically important locations from range. However, the Destroyer can be vulnerable to close range attacks and so is often paired with Protectors or fast moving attack ships that can respond to these threats.\n\nFractured Space is team-based space combat fought in gigantic capital ships. With the intensity of a shooter and the big-picture-thinking of a strategy game, Fractured Space is at the forefront of an exciting new frontier for the genre.\n\nThe game is available exclusively on Steam : http://store.steampowered.com/app/310380\n\nJoin us on Twitch.tv for developer live streams : http://twitch.tv/fracturedspace\n\nVisit the official website for more information : http://fracturedspace.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tVDZZ37NfKQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tVDZZ37NfKQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tVDZZ37NfKQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tVDZZ37NfKQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tVDZZ37NfKQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fractured Space : USR Destroyer", "description": "The USR Destroyer is one of the largest combat ships in Fractured Space.
