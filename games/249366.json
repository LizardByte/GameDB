In Sushi Cat Words, you'll find all sorts of mouth-watering sushi dishes for our rotund hero. You'd better have eaten plenty of brain food, though. The only way to feed that feline is by searching out words in hundreds of levels of puzzling fun. Find big words, small words, words that go up, words that go down, or words that go all the way around.\n\nEach level gives you a set of letters you need to use to make words. There's a set menu, and you'll need to figure out all of the required words to move forward. If you run into trouble, you can get a hint in exchange for a few coins. You'll earn more as you go, but if you want to build up a stockpile you'll need to think up lots of bonus words. The bigger your vocabulary, the more food you'll be able to prepare for Sushi Cat. The more Sushi Cat eats, the happier it gets! The taste of victory has never been so fresh!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sushi-cat-words"}
