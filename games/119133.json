It was previously ruled over by the immortal Queen Marika, who acted as keeper of the Elden Ring, a powerful force that manifested itself as the physical concept of order. When Marika shattered the Elden Ring and disappeared, her demigod children began fighting over pieces of the Ring in an event called The Shattering. Each demigod has a shard of the Ring called a Great Rune, which corrupts them with power. In the game, the player character is a Tarnished, one of a group of exiles from the Lands Between who are summoned back after the Shattering. The player must traverse the realm to repair the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord.", "summary": "Elden Ring is an action RPG developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, released in February 2022. Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, with world-building contributions from novelist George R. R. Martin, the game features an expansive open world called the Lands Between. Players assume the role of a customisable character known as the Tarnished, who must explore this world, battle formidable enemies, and seek to restore the Elden Ring to become the Elden Lord.\n\nThe game builds on the challenging gameplay mechanics familiar from the Dark Souls series but introduces a more open-ended structure with vast exploration, dynamic weather, and a day-night cycle. It offers deep lore, complex characters, and an interconnected world filled with secrets, dungeons, and powerful bosses.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elden-ring", "videos": [{"id": 50584, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "E3Huy2cdih0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Huy2cdih0", "title": "ELDEN RING - Official Gameplay Reveal", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E3Huy2cdih0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 58619, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "D1mDo1CEMuE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1mDo1CEMuE", "title": "Elden Ring - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5, PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D1mDo1CEMuE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 61874, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "D8YkCHkWRyk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8YkCHkWRyk", "title": "ELDEN RING \u2013 Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D8YkCHkWRyk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62187, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DbPbQMuEyX8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbPbQMuEyX8", "title": "ELDEN RING \u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc \u30102021 The Game Awards\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DbPbQMuEyX8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62188, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "l6pCyV7PnqI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6pCyV7PnqI", "title": "ELDEN RING \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3010SummerGameFest2021\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l6pCyV7PnqI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 64564, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "qqiC88f9ogU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqiC88f9ogU", "title": "ELDEN RING \u2013 Rise, Tarnished | Official Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqiC88f9ogU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 121254, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "e5wwSxl0atc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5wwSxl0atc", "title": "Elden Ring - E3 2019 Announcement Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e5wwSxl0atc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
