Thor can also gain access to various magic abilities that you can use such as healing magic, lightning that destroys nearby enemies, etc. Not bad... not bad at all.\r\n\r\nThe game has rather crude visuals even for its time and the music isn't particularly amazing, but it is sort of charming in its own right (like dealing with drunken NPCs or being warned not to shoot and kill innocent people despite how fun it is due to a score reduction) and is fairly entertaining. My main concern is that using Thor's hammer for puzzles is fine, but fighting some enemies with it can be pretty annoying as it has to hit something before it returns to you and if you miss, it can take a while before you get another chance to throw it.
