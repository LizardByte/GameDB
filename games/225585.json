This story shows the everyday life of a humble signal tower keeper, with both work and adventure, duty and hope.\n\nMany signal and military towers have been built throughout the mountainous country. They serve as outposts for caravans of a Great Silk Road branch, as well as for warning of enemy invasion. It is up to signal tower keepers to make the people ready to repel an attack.\n\nRumor has it that the enemies are planning to attack through the gorge, guarded by the protagonist. There has been no signal from the Gate Tower, which is the last and most crucial link in the chain of signal towers, for several days now. If the warning signal is not transmitted from it, all the work of the keepers will be futile.\n\nFind out what happened to the Gate Tower! The road is hard, but it may be the start of the adventure you've been waiting for your whole life.", "summary": "Land of Towers is a VR adventure game for the whole family.
