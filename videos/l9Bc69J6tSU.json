{"id": "l9Bc69J6tSU", "snippet": {"title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ultra's 1989 NES game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\n*I've now uploaded a new playthrough in 4K. Please watch it for the best video quality! https://youtu.be/k4MjHpc25eg\n\nI loved this game as a kid, and playing it over and over (and over) during my elementary school days was the only way I ever managed to get anywhere in this. Without TONS of practice, most people probably won't get past the first couple levels, and it is the difficulty level that most people criticize the most about this game. Thankfully, the graphics and sound are fantastic, and help to make seeing the same areas OVER and OVER again a bit less of a chore. \n\nIt gets cheap at the very end, but otherwise, the challenge is extremely steep but usually fair once you get used to the finicky controls (I have no doubt people lacking an absurd amount of patience will completely disagree!). I actually managed to get through it without losing a turtle once, though I almost lost Donatello a few times. Without good ol' Don, you might as well just reset the NES and try again.\n\nAnd, is it just me, or does April's hair make her look like Davy Crocket in just about every cinematic that she appears in? I swear she's wearing a coon-skin cap! Just look at the intro or the ending and you'll see what I mean, I'm sure. \n\nThis replacement to my original, 240p recording is a much better video in just about every way. I practiced a fair amount more before playing this time, don't struggle anywhere near as much in the harder parts near the end, and happen to guess the correct area to find the Technodrome entrance in the very first time! I hope you enjoy this sadistic classic!\n___________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l9Bc69J6tSU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l9Bc69J6tSU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l9Bc69J6tSU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l9Bc69J6tSU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ultra's 1989 NES game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\n*I've now uploaded a new playthrough in 4K.
