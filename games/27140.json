Predictable grid-based movement ensures that you know where you are, but other players don\u2019t. Vigilance is key as environmental tells such as footprints and other disturbances will point out careless cadets. Using special abilities and firing your Invisigun will also momentarily give you away. Along with items and powerups, these mechanics reward stealth, trickery, reflex, forethought, deception, bluffing, and awareness. A variety of lovingly-made environments, maps, game modes, and abilities combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 12083, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "_0PuwR2SbAc"}, {"id": 12084, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "0P121Clpk_A"}]}
