It utilizes the familiar top-down perspective featured in many action-adventure games, such as The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Shining Force. What sets it apart is the linear style of the game, as well as the limitation of one primary character. Interestingly, Arkista's Ring is an example of an early game with a female protagonist-an elf named Christine. The game is now considered to be a particularly rare NES title.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arkistas-ring", "videos": [{"id": 3497, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "P7qjA56StVM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7qjA56StVM", "title": "Arkista's Ring - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P7qjA56StVM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
