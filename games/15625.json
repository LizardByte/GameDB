Your ultimate goal is to free yourself from this tormenting place and understand the origin and the purpose of this never ending Evil.  \n  \nVigil is a stylized gothic horror adventure game that uses black and white imagery similar to Frank Miller's Sin City to create a unique visual that draws you deeper into the gruesome world of your character, Dehon. Avoid deadly traps, solve puzzles to unravel your past, and even devour the faces of your slaves for sustenance towards your ultimate goal of freedom.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vigil-blood-bitterness"}
