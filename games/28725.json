Straight after his return to the present day, Bond realizes that he's still alive. He tracks down Patrice, whom he was after in the very beginning of the game, to Shanghai where he stops an assassination plot and eliminates the hitman.\n\nThe game presents a What if? scenario where all of the \"classic\" Bond adventures have taken place during the six-year gap between the storylines of Quantum of Solace and Skyfall.", "summary": "Play as Eve from the SKYFALL movie.
