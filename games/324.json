In this way, players are able to defeat and conquer rival towns and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four \"Ages\": starting in the Archaic Age, the player may upgrade to the Classical Age, the Heroic Age, and finally, the Mythic Age. Each upgrade to a higher Age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthens their settlement. However, upgrading requires a sum of resources to be paid and a certain prerequisite building to be constructed. \n \nThere are three playable cultures in Age of Mythology: the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse. Each culture has three \"major gods\"\u2014important deities such as Ra, Zeus, or Odin. The player chooses their major god before the game begins. Every time a player advances to the next age, a \"minor god\" is selected. Minor gods are slightly less significant historically than their major counterparts. Some minor gods include Bast and Aphrodite. All gods grant the player unique technologies, myth units, and a unique \"god power\"\u2014A one-time special ability that can either damage an opponent, or benefit the player that uses it.", "summary": "Age of Mythology is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released on October 30, 2002 in North America and a week later in Europe. \n \nA spin-off from the Age of Empires series, Age of Mythology takes some of its inspiration from mythology and legends of the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse, rather than from actual historical events. Many gameplay elements are similar to the Age of Empires series. Its campaign follows an Atlantean admiral, Arkantos, who is forced to travel through the lands of the game's three cultures, hunting for a cyclops who is in league with Poseidon against Atlantis. \n \nAge of Mythology was commercially successful, going platinum four months after its release after selling over one million units. In 2003, it was followed by an expansion pack, Age of Mythology: The Titans. On May 8, 2014, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition was released for Windows via Steam. This was followed by a second expansion pack, Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon, released on January 28, 2016.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 243, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Onik-BD92Ow", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onik-BD92Ow", "title": "Age of Mythology- Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Onik-BD92Ow/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 2320, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 3884, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm2zw.jpg"}, "name": "Athena", "species": 5}, {"id": 5646, "name": "Miscellaneous"}, {"id": 5650, "name": "Agamemmnon"}, {"id": 5641, "name": "Brokk"}, {"id": 5653, "name": "Chiron"}, {"id": 5644, "name": "Amanra"}, {"id": 5655, "name": "Theocrat"}, {"id": 5643, "name": "Odysseus"}, {"id": 5647, "name": "Kamos"}, {"id": 5649, "name": "Eitri"}, {"id": 5656, "name": "Micellaneous"}, {"id": 5654, "name": "Setna"}, {"id": 5657, "name": "Reginleif"}, {"id": 5642, "name": "Skult"}, {"id": 5648, "name": "Kemsyt"}, {"id": 5652, "name": "Ajax"}, {"id": 3550, "name": "Kastor"}, {"id": 5645, "name": "Gargarensis"}, {"id": 5651, "name": "Arkantos"}]}
