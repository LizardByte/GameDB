It was released for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1999 and for the Dreamcast in 2000. As the second game in the Legacy of Kain series, Soul Reaver is the sequel to Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. Soul Reaver was followed by three games, one of which, Soul Reaver 2, is a direct sequel.\n\nTaking place 1500 years after the events of Blood Omen, Soul Reaver chronicles the journey of the vampire-turned-wraith Raziel, lieutenant to the vampire lord Kain. Raziel is killed by Kain, but is revived by The Elder God to become his \"soul reaver\" and to exact revenge. Raziel shares this title with Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, which he acquires during the game.\n\nCrystal Dynamics began development of the game in 1997, but a deteriorating relationship with Silicon Knights, who had developed Blood Omen, created legal problems. This and other delays forced material originally planned for Soul Reaver to be instead released with later games of the series. Soul Reaver was generally well received by critics and praised for its intriguing gothic story and high-quality graphics. However, the game was criticized for simple and repetitive gameplay and an unsatisfying climax. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 PC Hardware \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7 8700K\nRAM: 32 GB\nGPU: GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER\nOS:  Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 Recording HW/SW \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nNvidia Share", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_pT4dumJww/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_pT4dumJww/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_pT4dumJww/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_pT4dumJww/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_pT4dumJww/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999) - PC Gameplay 4k 2160p / Win 10", "description": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999) - PC Gameplay 4k 2160p / Win 10\n\nSubscribe here \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FirstPlaysHD\nAlso SHARE, COMMENT, LIKE \u263a\n\nUseful infos / how to run:\nhttps://pcgamingwiki.com\n\nTry these if game is not working:\n\u25aa dgVoodoo 2\n\u25aa DxWnd\n\u25aa Turn Off DEP (Data Execution Prevention) in Windows\n\u25aa Play with compatibility settings\n\n\u25aa If you can't install a game in Windows 10 directly, download\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org and install Windows XP 32bit for example.Then install game there and move files to Win 10 (sometimes you need to export and edit registry too).\n\n\u25aa New method how to install 16bit applications.Download https://github.com/otya128/winevdm/releases and just drag your setup.exe to otvdm.exe\n\n\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is an action-adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Eidos Interactive.
