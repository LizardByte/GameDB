As you approach, you see a girl who has fallen over on the grass. You cautiously approach and soon realize that she is bleeding onto the ground!\n\nYou approach now with fear and trepidation on your mind when the girl suddenly grabs your arms. The next words out of her mouth are outrageous. \"Please, give me some of your blood.\" she groans. Surprised and frightened, you listen to your first instinct to run away. Before you can get too far, though, you feel guilty for leaving the bleeding girl there and return to her side.\n\nYou strengthen your resolve before thrusting out your neck towards the girl. The next thing you know, you are drifting into unconsciousness. The next morning, you notice that you wake up in your bed at home. You instantly believe that everything that happened yesterday must have been a bizarre dream. That is\u2026 until you see the girl from yesterday - Alice, as you find out she is called - sitting in your living room and eating a donut.\n\nAfter this incident, everything changes. Your classmate Seychelles and Merle - who comes from the demon world - begin to try and get closer to you. Thus begins your exciting new life!", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-dragon-girlfriend"}
