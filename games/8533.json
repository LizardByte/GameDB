Zelda ventures off to Gamelon to find both Link and the King, accompanied by her elderly nursemaid Impa.", "summary": "Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon was the product of a compromise between Nintendo and Philips following their failure to release a CD-ROM based add-on to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed in tandem with Link: The Faces of Evil and marks the first game where the eponymous princess Zelda is playable. The Wand of Gamelon differ from most conventional Zelda games as it is a platformer with a side-scrolling view, similar to The Adventure of Link. Stages are accessed from a world map, with more becoming available as Zelda clears an area or defeats a boss. The game have been subject to much criticism and Nintendo does not recognize it as part of the series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon", "videos": [{"id": 82333, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "M52zKfu-cHk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M52zKfu-cHk", "title": "Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon (CD-i) Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M52zKfu-cHk/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 106, "name": "The Legend of Zelda"}]}
