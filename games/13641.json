To do that the player must pass the nine tests such as breaking all the rocks, scaring away the evil spirits, activating the energy of the spirit serpent, feeding up a hungry frog, and others - all inside a modified pinball machine.", "summary": "Enchanted is a Pinball game in which a magician must travel through his space-time ship to different worlds to prevent them from being destroyed by an evil entity that threatened the entire galaxy.
