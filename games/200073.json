Nothing is impossible here, but trying to reach the end of a level and make it safe home can be very tricky.\nEvery piece of information, every detail needs to be followed. That will obviously be a challenge, and it\u2019s the type of thing that will push you to the next level. You will appreciate the fact that every level has multiple solutions, so it\u2019s up to your creativity to find the right approach and focus on better understanding and enjoying everything.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/muksi"}
