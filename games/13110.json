The game involves the player moving characters in a turn based fashion across a large grid from an adjustable isometric perspective. At the beginning of the game, the player can chose to play as either a male or female protagonist, and chose from 4 separate \"Cross\" (partner) characters. Which combinations are selected affect both the dialogue and story progression, leading to eight separate paths to take through the game. The world of Summon Night changed dramatically for this entry. Now the medieval setting changed completely to a more contemporary world mixed with many of the other cultures and tribes already present in other Summon Night games. The stage for this title is the city of Savorle, a model city in this new era where people from all the different world can coexist.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/summon-night-5", "videos": [{"id": 5616, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "QzngEtR5itQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzngEtR5itQ", "title": "Summon Night 5 PSP/PSVita English Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QzngEtR5itQ/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 927, "name": "Summon Night"}]}
