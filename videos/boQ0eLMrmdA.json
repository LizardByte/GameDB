{"id": "boQ0eLMrmdA", "snippet": {"title": "Bally Midway NFL Football Raiders vs. Chargers (White Caddy) FULL Arcade CED Videodisc (AUDIO 'B')", "description": "One part of CED history that is often overlooked is that there was a CED-based arcade machine made in 1983: Bally Midway's NFL Football. The idea was identical to laserdisc-based arcade games from the same decade: to provide realistic footage during gameplay to enhance the experience. The beginning of the disc (i.e., everything before the coin toss) is the 'teaser' that would play to attract fellow patrons.\n\nIn the game, after the coin toss determines who's on offense and who's on defense, you have five plays to choose from--the exact plays depended upon your position. Then the machine plays a clip from the disc to see how the play turned out, and rinse and repeat...that seems to be all there was to it. (Also, because of the need for random access, the player used was the SJT-400--the one instance where the 'Control' port ever got utilized.)\n\nWhile there was a whole series of these planned, only two ever got made before RCA pulled the plug on the format: this one, the first, with the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers; and one released shortly thereafter as an optional upgrade with the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins. This version (housed in an unlabeled white caddy, hence the namesake) is the easier of the two to find, and the one most would have seen during the arcade's time.\n\nBoth discs are dual-channel all the way through; aside from each channel giving different audio for the coin toss, it seems to just have the two tracks for some variety in the narration of the plays. The track presented here is audio track 'B'; you can only access this channel on a stereo player.
