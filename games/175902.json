He is actually planning his revenge on the whole universe by transforming everyone into his slimy, dumb, fat, and hateful self. In the sequel, you must guide Stan, Kenny, and Wendy through 30 huge levels of mayhem and destruction which is inhabited by the same Cartmans that appeared in plan, plus many more deadly critters and new recruits to Cartman's ranks. Expect to see Cartmans with jetpacks, Snakoid Cartmans, Cartmans that wield big mini-guns that can take a beating and many more brand new enemies that are as deadly, if not deadlier. This South Park game also features 3 different difficulty levels that should challenge every kind of player around, different types of levels through the whole game. The new obstacles include underwater sections, moving platforms, and expect some puzzles to solve in your quest as well.", "summary": "This free South Park-themed game strikes us as an amusing little diversion, yet we have some quibbles with its design and somewhat small feature set. If you watch the rather long intro story, you'll learn that Cartman has turned to the dark side, infecting local citizens with a virus. As Stan, it's your job to traverse different levels, smiting Cartman's minions to get to the main man himself. Planet of Cartmans 2 is played like other platform-style games, as you jump over rocks, water, and other hazards while blasting away at your foes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/planet-of-cartmans-2", "videos": [{"id": 55799, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "DtxfcZOK0mQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtxfcZOK0mQ", "title": "Planet of Cartmans 2 Act 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DtxfcZOK0mQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 55800, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "_xWqnKdN9Z0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xWqnKdN9Z0", "title": "Planet of Cartmans 2 Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_xWqnKdN9Z0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
