The winners received the cartridge as a prize. Only 3000 copies were distributed. In the opening scene instead of having the cinematic intro sequence showing all the team logos, there is an advertisement of Xaqua featuring Roberto Baggio (1993 FIFA World Player of the Year). Also the box art is different, and in the UCC Xaqua version there is a strong hidden team called Xaqua.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-formation-soccer-95-dell-serie-a-ucc-xaqua"}
