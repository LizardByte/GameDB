This particular version was designed to run from a 16KB cartridge (although there are also tape and disk versions available to download as well).\n\nThe game was developed as an entry for the RGCD C64 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition (2011), and the name C64anabalt was suggested by Adam Atomic himself. The physics and procedural algorithms are based on those documented in the original game's open source code.\n\nThere are two versions of C64anabalt available; one with a SID chip conversion of Danny B.'s original score by Mikkel Hastrup (Encore), and an alternative build featuring music from the PC indie game ThrustBurst by Andreas Slotte (Ghormak). Unfortunately it wasn't possible to fit them both into a single 16KB ROM, so we've made two versions available to order (more on that in a bit) or download.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/c64anabalt"}
