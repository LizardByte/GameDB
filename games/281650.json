It is a friendly chess partner for beginners and amateurs. It will teach you to play chess from scratch, and can automatically adjust its playing strength to suit your needs. It will warn you when you go wrong in a game, giving you hints on how to play better. Fritz 5.32 (32-bit) is a great tool for any chess player desiring to achieve the FIDE Master title. The most useful tool is the \"Analyze Game\" option, which is like having a grandmaster sitting next to you reviewing your game for mistakes and improvements. Combine Fritz with ChessBase Light and you'll be set for your entire chess career short of the IM and GM titles!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fritz-5"}
