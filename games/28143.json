The second mode might be bit boring, since you do nothing but drive a truck and do nothing more, but it's worth it for two reasons - primarily the extremely beautiful landscape you drive through. It is designed with the utmost care and detail and you can really feel like you're really there. And secondly, the game simulates the job of a truck driver pretty accurately. While driving, you get to experience what a real truck driver feels and does on the road. Now, multiply that by a 1000 miles. But mostly, this is a truck racing game. You can change the view from behind the wheel to outside of the truck, whatever you like. There is also a good rearview mirror that helps you while driving. Overall, this is a fantastic truck simulation and racing game and you should try this one and the games sequels, Hard Truck 2 and the rest of the game's series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hard-truck-road-to-victory"}
