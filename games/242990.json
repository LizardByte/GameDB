Here, players have the opportunity to challenge racers to different styles of driving in order to earn coin that can be spent on upgrades; the GBA game features a garage of fourteen different licensed vehicles from Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Subaru and Acura, and each of these cars can be customized with paint, bumpers, decals, rims, ground effects, and more. The further into the Underground you go, the more extras you can unlock in order to create the most tricked out road machine the streets have ever seen. Most of the races are the traditional kind, with players racing against as many as three other opponents in the competition. There are also Drag challenges where racers will have to blast their way down a stretch of road, and Drift challenges where players score points by powersliding around the curves. Every win awards a dollar amount which can be converted into extras for the vehicle...either for performance or cosmetic purposes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-underground--1"}
