Leaving Eugene to hold off the Allied onslaught, the Emperor returned to France to work his magic and out of the recruits of France a new army was formed.\n\nMeanwhile, Eugene had fallen back in the face of the larger Allied host. The Prussians walked a diplomatic tight rope for the first months of the year but by March were in open revolt. The Prussian generals formed new forces in East Prussia and Silesia and other parts of the realm. Along with the standing army they were ready to stand with their Russian allies. England helped the Allies with cash and clothing and munitions. The Sixth Coalition was formed to liberate Germany and take the war to France. In the battles to come both sides would be sorely tested to hold their armies together.", "summary": "Campaign Bautzen allows the players to refight the battles of L\u00fctzen and the massive battle of Bautzen, which was the largest land battle fought in Europe up to this time, and many other actions of the Spring Campaign of 1813.
