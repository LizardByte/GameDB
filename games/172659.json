The project offers players an immersive in-game environment with four playable character classes (Knight, Assassin, Warlock, Mage) and countless spells, abilities, and environments.\n\nGet a champion, choose a kingdom to fight for, and set out into the mysterious world with your weapon, your mount, and your pet to prove your worth in the action-packed combat system by defeating monsters, bosses, and other players, or explore the world as a peaceful forager of goods and rares, establishing a reputation as a skilled refiner, miner, fisher, and craftsman.\n\nIn-game NFTs are obtained via rare monster drops and in-game events. ForgottenChain's NFTs aren't like the conventional \"collectible card\" NFTs that are so popular in crypto nowadays. Instead, they're useful and functioning NFTs that can be put into the Game Framework and turned into unique in-game objects. These NFTs can be purchased or sold in-game (auction houses, player marketplaces) as well as via third-party NFT exchanges outside of the game world.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/forgotten-chain", "videos": [{"id": 80936, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bFVUc0Hde4I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFVUc0Hde4I", "title": "ForgottenChain - Blockchain Game - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFVUc0Hde4I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
