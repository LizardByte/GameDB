Choose from ten wrestlers who have their own power attacks. There are ten rounds in the game, and each one of them has you fighting other wrestlers that are much tougher than the previous ones. You defeat each one by biting, kicking, and performing other moves to the point where their damage meter is empty. But just because it is empty doesn't mean that you win. You have to pin him for the infamous-three count. Also features competitive play and tag match battles.\n\n3 Count Bout by SNK Corporation attempts to take you into the world of professional wrestling by giving you control of one of many different wrestlers as you fight both in the ring and in the seedy underworld in your quest to become an accomplished wrestling champion. Choose from one of ten different characters, each with his own strengths and weaknesses, and employ your wrestling moves using a combination of three buttons. There are also a number of hidden moves and combinations which can be unlocked for even greater variety in the gameplay. When you have your opponent on the mat, keep him there until the count of three and you've won the match. In two-player mode, you can either take on your opponent in a match or wrestle tag team. This game uses the Neo-Geo MVS cartridge system.", "videos": [{"id": 2397, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "AJ3gLOwUmB8"}]}
