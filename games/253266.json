Instead of tapping red shapes to remove them you must use explosions to knock them off the screen. Don't knock any green shapes off though or you'll fail the level. To add to the fun there are 8 planes of gravity - look at the shapes faces to see which way they will fall.\nToo easy? Try replaying the game in the extra challenging coin mode!", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/red-remover-blast"}
