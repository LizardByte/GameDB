Upon entering the motel, the player is greeted by a rather unfriendly clerk who hands them a message that reads: 'I have your friends, only a warrior can free them.' The player walks into their room, sets down their bags and goes to bed. Once the player drifts to sleep, they have a strange dream involving a car wreck and a dead body. Once awake, the player is free to explore the town.\n\nThe player will quickly discover that their immediate goal is to find the twelve bahos (prayer sticks) scattered throughout the town and return them to the sacred kiva in Devil's Mouth Canyon just outside town. The bahos have been hidden by the villain known only as Darkcloud, a mysterious figure who wears a kachina mask, in order to test the player so that they may become \"the warrior\". The player is assured that once they become \"the warrior\", they will be able to free the members of Trip Cyclone, who have been transformed into petroglyphs. The player must ultimately deduce the true identity of Darkcloud and discover his actual plan.", "summary": "Your friends of the rock band Trip Cyclone win the Battle of the Bands and decide to make video clips in the secluded desert town of Cyclone, Arizona, located amidst the red rocks of Devil's Mouth Canyon. They stay at the house of aunt Pearl and help her out part-time in her cafe. The town seems to have gotten stuck in time decades ago, people are strange and not welcoming to outsiders. When two hikers do not return from their trip in the canyon, on which people believe an ancient Indian curse rests, the villagers set out for a search expedition, only to lose a local villager in the process. The town is restless, tourists stop coming and the band believes they may not be able to make their rock videos, lacking the money to buy equipment. Then they are approached by a strange man wearing a traditional Indian Kachina mask, who names himself Darkcloud.\n\nDarkcloud expresses strong interest in their music and decides to finance the band, even hiring a technician from LA. It is very suspicious but on the other hand the help is welcome. But then strange events begin - as their videos are broadcasted on the local TV network, people gradually turn into mental zombies, lured to Devil's Mouth Canyon. One by one they disappear. When the band witnessed more than they would like to, and they decide to pack their bags and leave town, a landslide occurs and virtually isolates Cyclone with no more supplies or people going in or out. People are trapped. Only one more person manages to make it to the town after a rough motorcycle ride - you. When you arrive, all people have disappeared, including your friends. What is going on here? Who is Darkcloud? And can you save your friends? Clues are scattered in their videos and in the buildings around the ghost town. Your friends' lives depend on your witts and puzzle-solving skills, Warrior.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shivers-ii-harvest-of-souls", "videos": [{"id": 66940, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "vUwFvo44PLQ"}]}
