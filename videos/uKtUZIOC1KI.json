You can download and play for free here: https://laserbrick.itch.io/hyper-time-disruptor\n\nAfter the Black Hadron Collider experiment failed miserably and turned the whole world into dangerous mutants, Doctor Professor Mobius is the only one unaffected by the time disruptions the BHC caused. The only way to fix this is to take the B.I.R.D. into the BHC and travel back in time to stop yourself from conducting the experiment in the first place.\n\nFly through the black hole of time-space frequency and try to catch up with yourself. Only by flying in sync with your own time waves, you can accelerate yourself to the speed of light, making time travel possible. But beware, don't get on the wrong frequency or the world will be lost forever.\n\nCredits: \nProgramming: Sybren Kruizinga, Rando Wiltschek\nGame Design & Testing: Friso Roolvink\nArt: Mitchel Bonnema\nMusic & Sounds: Menger & Meester", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uKtUZIOC1KI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uKtUZIOC1KI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uKtUZIOC1KI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uKtUZIOC1KI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uKtUZIOC1KI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hyper Time Disruptor", "description": "This game was made during the Global Game Jam 2017 in Leeuwarden.
