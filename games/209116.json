Dinwiddie, Physician-in-Training", "platforms": [6], "release_dates": [{"id": 372594, "platform": 6}], "summary": "Developed by Health Media Lab with grants from the National Institutes of Health, D.M. DINWIDDIE, PHYSICIAN-IN-TRAINING teaches children to identify and treat 12 common medical conditions: burns, choking, insect bites and stings, bumps and bruises, cuts and bleeding, sunburn, sprains and broken bones, food poisoning, common cold, influenza, tonsillitis, and appendicitis. Kids play as D.M. Dinwiddie, a 12-year old girl or boy (player's choice) who is earning a Medical Arts Achievement Badge. Through a series of interactive adventures, D.M. finds injured characters in her virtual neighborhood, including her little brother who has an insect bite.\n\nBy looking at and talking with the injured characters, and then using a special MedLab (an onscreen database that serves as a reference and diagnostic guide) and her first-aid kit, D.M. is able to diagnose and treat the hurt people."}
