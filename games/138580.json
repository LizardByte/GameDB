They're sinking into an abyss of surreal horror, isolated but not alone. Join this terrible yet heartbreaking little marshmallow, a mysterious and intrusive romantic named Simon, a gang of friends who may not even be real, and other strange characters as they struggle in a hell of doubt... What's even the point? Is there any future our tortured little marshmallow can look forward to?\n\nCreepy mementos of love... A plague that makes people stare at dirt... A familiar yet grown up face of someone who should be dead... What do all of these things have in common? When the fangs behind our facade sink deep into the mind and reflect our darkest thoughts, it becomes a struggle to not let our shadow take over.", "summary": "A 3D surreal horror game that combines fixed camera angles with 2.5D elements. The game is mostly focused on its dark world that is occasionally littered with a strange threat or puzzle. Things start off a bit slow but gradually escalate, all while being mindful to pace itself and balance a level of intrigue, involvement and introspection.\n\nTravel between several strange locations, varying from a decrepit theater to a small forest village with no people in it, partake in strange events and overcome any challenges that may come your way. But be wary, things are often not what they seem.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/feast-your-eyes"}
