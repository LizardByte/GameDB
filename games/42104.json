Players use the cash earned when they win a race to power up their machine. Not only can they change the \"tire\" and \"body\" of their vehicles, but they also can add \"special\" parts. Jump over tall obstacles with a \"hopper\" and blast past rivals at incredible speeds with \"nitro.\" What multiplayer game would be complete without attack items? Use a forward-launching \"grenade\" or a backward-dropping \"bomber\" to blow up and knock away rivals. Outmaneuver rivals in all eight heats to become the champion.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
