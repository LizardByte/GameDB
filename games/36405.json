Designed for the WonderSwan Color, Judgement Silversword has the unique distinction of being one of the few shooting games designed for a handheld console, and it's also one of the best! Destroying enemies as quickly as possible is essential to scoring in Judgement Silversword, giving the game a ruthless tempo. One of indie developer M-KAI's first games, it can be seen as the inspiration and predecessor to the gameplay ideas in Eschatos.\n\nCardinal Sins puts an interesting twist on shoot 'em up gameplay with a score trial marathon spanning 7 different areas, each with a unique objective themed around the 7 Deadly Sins. Collect lives in Sloth, Hoard enemy data in Greed, and avoid Destruction at the hands of Wrath. Mastering the different objectives gives the game a great sense of variety. Getting an S rank in every trial is very challenging!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/judgement-silversword-resurrection", "videos": [{"id": 49166, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8FQsTU2A-qM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FQsTU2A-qM", "title": "JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD - Resurrection - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8FQsTU2A-qM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
