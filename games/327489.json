The discovery of an ancient stone tablet in the museum sparks her interest. She ultimately concludes that solving tile-matching puzzles will lead her to a secret Aztec city. Emily's journal acts as a record of her findings, and newspaper articles and other documents keep the story moving along at a preset pace.", "summary": "The objective in this tile matching game is to collect all of the sparkling gems in a level before the time runs out on the ticking pocket watch. The number needed for the level is displayed above the main grid. Swap one stone at a time by choosing a pair, which trade places with a click, slowly eliminating all those which contain gemstones. The entire board can be shuffled twice and hints can be purchased for the cost of points.\n\nThere are also timed mini-games sprinkled throughout the game which provide more opportunities to earn gold stars.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-treasures-of-montezuma--1", "videos": [{"id": 137353, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VKrGT1rz4nM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKrGT1rz4nM", "title": "The Treasures of Montezuma #1 Level 1-1 \ud83c\udfae James Games", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VKrGT1rz4nM/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 137354, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "CQHJ2cuPN9Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQHJ2cuPN9Y", "title": "The Treasures of Montezuma (2007, PC) - Level 1 & 2 [720p]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CQHJ2cuPN9Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3426, "name": "The Treasures of Montezuma"}]}
