You control a man with a hammer, who seems to be in the desert, and is surrounded by holes. Periodically the holes will light up and then some sort of rodent appears popping out of it, and you need to smash him back down to his burrow. If you don\u2019t hit him in time, then he will escape and run around the screen trying to bite you. Hitting a rodent gives you 100 points and if he touches you then you will lose points. You also have to be careful not to fall down a hole as you run around the screen, if you do, then you will lose one of your 3 lives. You are given 20 minutes to get the highest score possible. When the times run out, or you lose all 3 lives, it\u2019s game over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mole-hunter--1"}
