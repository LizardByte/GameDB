It's a mod in which you can create your own team with the characters of Dragon Ball Z.\n\nThe title is basic, I didn't look for a specific title... Actually, I just wanted to have fun by making this game.\n\nHere are the main modifications:\n-Pokemons are replaced by \"fighters\". There are 147 fighters.\n\n-There are 167 attacks including 137 new attacks (techniques from Dbz)\nwith new animations of course, and 30 old attacks (from Pok\u00e9mon, like Headbutt for example).\n\n-I added new maps for some cities. I didn't change all the maps, only some of them.\n\n-I've changed some overworld sprites too. (mini-sprites on the maps)\n\n-Many items were added. (capsules, senzu...etc) The list is in the thread.\n\nMaybe this is not the perfect game but I've made it alone. It took me many time to do it, then there can be some defects.\n\nAbout the save: It's the same problem with the other pokemon games. You have to adjust the settings on VBA.\nGo to \"options\" ; \"emulator\" ; \"save type\" and choose Automatic and Flash 128K. Then, put the files (emulator and rom) in the same folder. There must not be a save file (\".sav\") in the folder before opening the rom.\nThen you should be able to save. You can also find tutorials.\n\nIf you're on Android: Use the emulator Myboy Free and go to Settings, advanced, cartridge type and choose 128. The save should work like that.\nYou can also watch this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV-KmED_XR8\n\nIf you want more information, go to the thread on Pokecommunity, on the wikia managed by PureRage,  or on the facebook page. (links at the top)\n\nNow, just enjoy ;)\n\nOther credits:\nThe music in this video is a cover of \"Fight Theme\" by Diego Ariel Miranda.
