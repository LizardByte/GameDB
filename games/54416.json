Slice, dice, roll and hammer sushi, and then serve it to customers as quickly as you can. Make sashimi, roll uramaki, pour sake, and feed the hungry hordes to collect cash. Catch coins as they fly by, and use the money you make to upgrade your equipment and purchase more recipes.\n\nThe characters and tone of Sushi Bar Express are presented in a light-hearted and comical style, designed to appeal to all types of players \u2013 ranging from children to adults, and all genders.
