We lampoon some of the current directions and movements in the game industry with regard to profitability, privacy, independent development, and intellectual property controversies. After a few quick set-up steps, players can choose one of 1000 possible games from a list of randomly generated titles and enjoy the truly mind-blowing graphics that await. Each unique game experience is only available once and may just challenge your notions of what is \u201clegal\u201d in terms of games and their possible social meanings. What are you waiting for?...
