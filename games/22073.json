The unique turn-based mechanics are easy to play but very challenging to master. Pick your favorite team and try to win the Tournament!\n\nThe game play is unique - it is turn based, you are in the control of the player nearest to the ball. Each move is time limited to 10 seconds. The controls are very easy to use. Just tap the player and drag him downwards to kick and release him to shoot. There is also an option to dribble (move the player over the ball and release it or shake your device).\nEach team consist of 5 footballers (goalkeeper, two defenders, midfielder and striker). Each footballer has 4 unique characteristics (precision, mobility, technique and power) which reflects his skills on the field. For each position there is a replacement footballer - it is your job to find the best lineup.\n\nThe sounds are atmospheric, which give you the feeling of being in a big stadium as you hear the kicks, the fan chants or the whistle of the referee.\n\nYou can play a friendly game or start a tournament which allows up to 8 human players.\nBefore play you have to choose your national team (48 countries are represented), the game length (2-10 minutes), difficulty (easy, normal, hard) and the weather (sunny, rain, snow or indoor).\n\nFor all football (soccer) fans this game guarantees hours and hours of fun.\n\nDownload the game and start scoring those goals...", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fun-football-tournament"}
