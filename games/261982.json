Even the gods, who descended from the heavens to fight the curse, succumbed to the catastrophe. With their dying breath, these deities created the Final Bastion, a land free from the Spiritblight, or so they thought. Rumors have spread that this living corruption has somehow broken through this last haven. You awaken inside this sanctuary as Dew, a strange creature with seemingly no past, and an equally strange weapon that is able to resist the scourge.\n\nWhile not every race survived the Spiritblight, those that did exist in an uneasy alliance, living in constant fear that the barrier to the Final Bastion could go down at any moment. Despite this, they continue to hold on to the smallest threads of hope. With the gods apparently dead, and the Spiritblight as aggressive as ever, these threads are slowly being cut. You are the last line of defense that can tip the scales. It is up to you to explore the Final Bastion, discover the secrets that the gods left behind, and fight against the onslaught that aims to end it all.", "summary": "In this new hand-drawn, story-rich metroidvania, explore the last haven of a dying world, and discover the purpose you play in saving it.
