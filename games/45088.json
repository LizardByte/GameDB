Strategy comes in choosing the right lure for the circumstance and it takes skill to hook the big ones and reel them in successfully. Underwater shots and \"fish-eye\" views of the lure offer a perspective on the sport that few ever see on an actual outing. Players can even take a \"picture\" of their prize catch before releasing it back into the virtual wild.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reel-fishing"}
