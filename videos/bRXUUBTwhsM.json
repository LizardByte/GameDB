Ridiculously good pixel art and gameplay and scoring worthy of an arcade release. It's also still tragically obscure. \n\nI did a video on Very Hard earlier but this time it's time for Extreme. You unlock Extreme mode by going through Very Hard. Extreme mode is completely different from the normal game in terms of mechanics and patterns. You even have a much smaller hitbox in this mode. It's also really silly. \n\nBullet cancelling is a big part of this mode. If you destroy an enemy with lock-shot, then the enemy explosion causes a chain reaction to nearby enemy bullets and cancels them into red suicide bullet walls.\nIf you destroy an enemy that's near the suicide bullets with normal shot, then the suicide bullets will be chain reaction cancelled into small stars.\n\nExtreme mode, like the Hard 2nd loop, has a TLB. It's pretty crazy but luckily the first two forms don't have bomb invincibility. For the final phase it's very important that you get damage in when the pattern isn't super crazy yet. There is no way to practice the TLB apart from going through the entire game.\n\nBy going through Extreme mode you unlock Simple mode. Simple mode is an extra option that removes all the bullet cancelling from the currently selected mode. \n\nScoring system:\nhttp://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=54077\n\nFor scoring in Extreme you pretty much want to cancel as much as possible while keeping your item counter high. You still want to kill high-value enemies and bosses with a high item count as well. \nHard to tell how to properly score without knowing the exact enemy value's though.\n\nAll of the slowdown is intentional. \nDon't go away just yet at the ending. \n\nDeveloper page:\nhttp://naut-mark.com/\n\nBuy the game here:\nhttp://www.dlsite.com/eng/work/=/product_id/RE157191.html\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bRXUUBTwhsM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bRXUUBTwhsM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bRXUUBTwhsM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bRXUUBTwhsM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9 ~ Battle Traverse - Extreme Mode ALL Clear - 953 Million", "description": "Battle Traverse is still one of the most impressive doujin shmups I've ever seen.
