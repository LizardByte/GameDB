Though my oath binds me to his service, the Magistrate is not my liege. He rules in the absence of a rightful heir.\n\nMy men await their orders; they too are uneasy. It is for their sake that I stay my tongue, and place my faith in the Almighty that my fears are unfounded.\n\nTomorrow, we make for the East.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ash--3", "videos": [{"id": 31746, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MztpqPNJYm0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MztpqPNJYm0", "title": "3DS eShop Game ASH Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MztpqPNJYm0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
