The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the BlackBerry's trackwheel, the computer's mouse or the touch of a finger (in the case of touchscreen). The player gets three lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. There are 34 levels. Many levels have unbreakable silver bricks. If all lives are lost, the game is over. There are many versions of brick breaker, some in which you can shoot flaming fireballs or play with more than one ball if the player gets a power up.", "summary": "Brick Breaker is a video game developed by Canadian Developer Ali Asaria that came preloaded on certain BlackBerry devices and is now available on the iOS App Store.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brick-breaker--5", "videos": [{"id": 96884, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "fXSxHZbqP74", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXSxHZbqP74", "title": "BrickBreaker Level 26 Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fXSxHZbqP74/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
