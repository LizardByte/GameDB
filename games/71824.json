The player guides a disembodied glove with the ARROW keys through an isometric maze with a chess board on the ground and many chess pieces placed. The glove has to push (ARROW keys + space bar) these pieces to clear its way to the exit. The pieces move in the same pattern they have in chess: pawns move forward, knights have an \"L\" shaped movement, etc. The gauntlet can be killed if it is in your way. The chess pieces are arranged in small rooms as a series of puzzles to be solved.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chess-housers", "videos": [{"id": 99939, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hB9FZZF09VU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB9FZZF09VU", "title": "Chess Housers CGA PC Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hB9FZZF09VU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
