It's amazing - one of the best games on the Genesis in my opinion - and it's even harder than Bad Dudes, which certainly saying something. It's not formally the \"sequel\" to Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja, but it might as well be.\n\nIt's been awesomely retooled for the 90s - maybe it's listened to Klax's intro message and retooled it into a mantra? But the classic play is all here - punches, kicks, random weapons, absurd screaming sounds, uber-powerful yet foiled by pattern-based attack bosses, and a stiff challenge. This really is arcade-styled 16-bit gaming at its finest. Bravo, Data East. This was one of many reasons that I've loved you as a developed since the days of the NES. \n\nIf you'd like to see the original arcade game, Crude Buster, you can see my video of it here: https://youtu.be/E6sY_sMl2aQ\n_______\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e6y5Dpoqu3E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e6y5Dpoqu3E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e6y5Dpoqu3E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Two Crude Dudes (Genesis) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A complete playthrough of Data East's 1992 Sega Genesis beam 'em up arcade port, Two Crude Dudes. \n\nPlayed through on the default difficulty level.\n\nThis game is no joke!
