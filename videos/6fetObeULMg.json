{"id": "6fetObeULMg", "snippet": {"title": "The Hunt For Red October [GB] - Real Time Longplay (No death)", "description": "This is a, no commentary, Longplay of The Hunt For Red October for Game Boy. The game follows the homonym movie where you play as Red October, a high-tech nuclear missile submarine with stealth technology.\n\nThere are 8 levels with a boss fight at the end of each one. No difficulty or option settings. The are 4 powerups, the heart that gives an extra life, the M-symbol that gives you 3 homing missiles, the wrench that completely repairs submarine and the five prong star symbol that gives you one caterpillar drive (stealthy submarine, pretty handy). The bosses in levels 4-6 are harder versions of bosses in levels 1-3 (luck of innovation I guess). There are 3 kinds of enemies, the submarines that are quite easy to destroy, the ships that shots homing missiles and also a jamming device of the caterpillar drive that halts stealth making them very lethal enemies, and finally the military planes/helicopters that are quite hard to destroy and also shot homing missiles. There is no time limit. The max number of each powerup is 99, getting one more resets to 0 which is pitty (one time I died due to luck of homing missiles by getting more than 99). There is a VERY handy radar-map at the bottom of the screen that shows the forthcoming enemies, you have to keep your eyes in this map to stand a chance.\n\nRegarding the game itself, graphics are ok for a 1991 handheld game but nothing exceptional. My main concern is the boring and repetitive design of levels. Music is quite good with a variety of tracks (each level has its own music), definitely above average.\n\nControls are, unfortunately, not responsive. The submarine moves very slowly (that's understandble for a huge machine) but the response time is poor. Also the movement is very annoying, especially when trying to turn the submarine: You need to tap the directional-pad fast otherwise the submarine will move to this direction without turning (needed a lot of practice to master it).\nAs for difficulty, the game is hard and average in length, you need to plan every movement beforehand, a simple mistake could ruin everything (especially for a no death run). Levels are linear as the only objective is to reach the end. There is no replayability since there is no reward or something to unlock after completing the game.\n\nIn short, The Hunt For Red October is a mediocre title with some nice mechanics (using the radar to plan your actions), but with slow-pace and difficult gameplay. The graphics and music are acceptable but the very linear gameplay with zero replayability, cannot hold the gamer for long. Most pickups collected (enemy missiles can destroy pickups).
