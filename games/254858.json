A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come.\u201d\n\nIOI added: \u201cFor many, this journey is also a deeply personal one that began long before we started making games for a living \u2013 and it started with the fantasy genre. From the \u2018Fighting Fantasy\u2019 books compelling you to choose your path, alone, against wizards, lizards, and thief kings. To the togetherness, camaraderie, agony, and delight found around the tabletop.\"\n\n\u201cFor some it meant taking the role of a game master: Part storyteller, part AI opponent, part guide, part villain. For everyone around that table it meant creativity, imagination, building a world together, and a shared goal in creating a great game experience.\"\n\n\u201cThis idea \u2013 that a diverse group of individuals with different skills and strengths can work together and become more than the sum of their parts \u2013 is what inspires us. It inspires the fantasy world we are building \u2013 and it inspires how we build it.\u201d", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/project-fantasy"}
