They're the D.R.A.G.O.N. Force \u2014 Drastic Response Assault Group Operations Network \u2014 an elite international strike force made up of the 14 finest combat soldier, in the free world. Your assignment in this individual combat simulation is to lead your team of top-secret trouble-shooters on special operations to the hottest hot spots worldwide.\n\nYour missions, should you choose to accept them, include rescuing hostages, raiding terrorist camps and cocaine labs, blowing airbases - 12 'delicate' operations.\n\nAs team commander, you'll enlist 7 men for each mission. Choose the best of the best from the D.R.A.G.O.N. Force files. Classified dossiers detail the specialty, experience, and individual strengths of each Force member.\n\nBe a big hero, and you might get a medal (if you don't get killed). Get caught, and your one mother will disavow all knowledge of you.", "summary": "D.R.A.G.O.N. Force is a turn-based tactics game. During each round, the player assigns orders to the men, e.g. moving, firing or special actions, which are then simultaneously (together with the AI's choices) performed. There is a strategical map (shows the whole mission area) and the closer zoomed in tactical map. As expected, the three fire commands are especially important: the usual direct fire at an enemy, targeting a specific spot or an opportunity fire which gets triggered by passing by enemies. The environment, e.g. hedges buildings, may be used as cover and affects the line of sight.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-force--1"}
