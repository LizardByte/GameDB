Trouble Makers ( \u3086\u3051\u3086\u3051\uff01\uff01\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba), is a 1997 side-scrolling platform video game developed by Treasure and published by Enix and Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The player assumes the role of Marina, a robotic maid who journeys to rescue her creator from the emperor of Planet Clancer. The gameplay revolves around grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects. There are five worlds and 52 levels, and the game is displayed in \"2\u00bdD\".\n\nThe game was the first 2D side-scroller for the Nintendo 64, and Treasure's first release for a Nintendo console. The company began Mischief Makers's development in mid-1995 with little knowledge of the console's features. The 12-person team wanted to make a novel gameplay mechanic, and implementing the resultant \"catching\" technique became their most difficult task. The game appeared at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was first released in Japan on June 27, 1997, and later in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief_Makers\n\n0:01:55 - Start\n\nWorld 1 - Planet Clancer\n0:03:16 - Stage 1-1 Meet Marina!!\n0:05:15 - Stage 1-2 Meet Calina!!\n0:06:48 - Stage 1-3 Clanball Land\n0:08:38 - Stage 1-4 Spike Land\n0:10:15 - Stage 1-5 3 Clancer Kids\n0:12:16 - Stage 1-6 Blockman Rises\n0:13:43 - Stage 1-7 Wormin' Up!!
