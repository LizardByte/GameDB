It is the first Albert Odyssey title to be released in English, as well as the first to feature traditional turn-based role-playing elements as opposed to tactical, strategy-based gameplay. Legend of Eldean was created as a \"gaiden\", or sidestory to the original titles, and contains back story, characters, and plot that are independent from earlier games in the series. The North American version received generally favorable reviews, with the game's translation invoking mixed criticism both for its overly-humorous tone and departure from the original Japanese dialogue.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean", "collections": [{"id": 1991, "name": "Albert Odyssey"}]}
