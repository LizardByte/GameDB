Ltd. The game is based on the Dragon Drive series and was only released in Japan.\n\nGameplay[edit]\nDragon Drive was an aerial combat game, set primarily in large, outdoor arenas where players had to face several waves of enemies. With multi-directional dash and lock on abilities, the game has sometimes drawn comparisons to the Zone of the Enders series.\n\nThe game also has a handful of rail shooter levels, drawing frequent comparisons to Sega's Panzer Dragoon series, but these comprise only a very small portion of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-drive-d-masters-shot"}
