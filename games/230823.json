It is a continuation of the long-running Sega Master System line seen in the country, succeeding the line of \"Master System 3 Collection\" consoles (which in turn followed the \"Master System III Compact\"). Like the last two models of its predecessor, this Master System 3 lacks a cartridge slot, relying solely on built-in games. It has a shorter name and also opts for a radically changed design over previous consoles, presumed to be unique to Tectoy products.\n\nInternally, it is likely the same as the Master System 3 Collection with 131 games, since they have the same menu saying \"Master System 3 Collection 131 Super Jogos\" and share the same list of games.\n\nThe Master System 3 comes with 131 built-in games (or so it claims), the same number as the last Master System 3 Collection console to be released. It also comes with two Sega Mega Drive-style six button control pads which plug into two DE-9 ports, although most of the buttons on the pads are redundant as the console has no built-in Mega Drive games.\n\nIn order to count 131 games, Pense Bem counts as 10 and 20 em 1 counts as 20 games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/master-system-3"}
