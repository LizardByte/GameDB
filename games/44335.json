During your mission, you soon discover that the area you were sent to scout is a dangerous one, teeming with several innocent-looking creatures-schools of fish, manta rays, starfish, jellyfish, and an occasional \"Nereis,\" a marine creature which excretes a paralyzing poison. In addition to these native aquatic creatures, there is an enemy navy destroyer which fires depth charges with your submarine as its target.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slay-the-nereis"}
