It features 50 stars, spread out in 15 new worlds. All rights for Super Mario 64 are owned by Nintendo.\n\nThis hack was over 2 years in the making, so it's on par with the amount of time Green Stars took (mainly because I got so demotivated from making levels, and I was also very busy). I focused on trying to make this an overall better experience than Green Stars by making it more player-friendly (as in, add more hints etc.) and I feel like I have achieved that. The difficulty of this hack is harder than Green Stars, especially more end game. \n\nI'll get around to uploading the Music from this hack sometime soon, but I want to give everyone a chance to play before I do so. If you find any bugs, or have any questions, just let me know in the comments. Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this hack :D\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod - Killers", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b8pC1TLEP68/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b8pC1TLEP68/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b8pC1TLEP68/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "v1.1 Super Mario and the Marvel Adventure - Release Trailer", "description": "Pre-Patched Download (v1.1): http://www.mediafire.com/download/z0nfpfm3athke5b/SMMA+v1.1.zip\nPatch Download (v1.1): http://www.mediafire.com/download/ur3y23r30adri86/SMMA+Patch+v1.1.zip\n\nv1.1 Changes (17th July 2016):\n- \"Mystery of the Invisible Star\" from Haunted Forest (previously star 3) now changed to \"X Marks the Spot\" due to many complaints of it being too hard to find (though none directly messaged to me, so you're lucky I have the decency to even change this at all)\n- Stars 1 and 3 in Haunted Forest have been switched around\n- Edited a few of the sign/bob-omb messages\n- A couple of other minor improvements\n\nIf you don't know how to use patches, then just download the pre-patched version!\n\nSuper Mario and the Marvel Adventure is a Super Mario 64 hack made by Kampel125 (that's me).
