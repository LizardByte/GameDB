It rather openly brags with the feature by showing a bunch of digitized photographs in the intro. The plot actually tells a postapocalyptic scenario after the total pollution of the world, but the graphics don't do much to distinguish themselves from the average fantasy stuff. \n \nOf course there can't be expected too much from a freeware game, and there's not too much to it. One just walks around killing monsters to raise experience, before one is able to receive five special questions to solve the quest. Like Zinnia, Bultaneun Yeonghon is technically an action RPG, but its very heavy on the action and grinding.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bultaneun-yeonghon"}
