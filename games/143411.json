You begin a match with 8 soldiers, 2 archers, 2 riders, 2 mages, a champion and a king. Each piece has unique movements, attacks, and health points. Every turn has 2 phases, the movement and attack phase. During the movement phase move your character into the best position, then use any character with an available attack in range to deal damage to your opponent. Take your opponent's king out and you win, nice work. Don't savour that victory too long, your next challenge will likely be harder!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 45529, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ioysalQsdeY"}, {"id": 45530, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "PG1EwvOEYms"}, {"id": 45531, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mV86w7Cmab8"}]}
