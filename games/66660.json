Tokubetsu-hen: Fukkatsu! Shouwa no Yamanotesen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Special Edition: Revival! Yamanote Line of the Showa Period\") is an electric train driving simulation game developed by Ongakukan and published by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS in Japan on July 22, 2010.\n\nA handheld spin-off of the Densha de Go! series (and the only one not developed by Taito, instead developed by the studio behind Train Simulator), Tokubetsu-hen utilizes the platform's dual-screen display to simulate the driver controls using the touchscreen.\n\nCelebrating the 100th anniversary of the electrified Yamanote Line in Tokyo, this entry focuses solely on that route with trains both modern (E231-500, 205, and 103) and historical (101, 72, 31, 30, and DeHa 6285). With historical trains, the route appears as it was during the 1950s. The game also includes a quiz about the Yamanote Line as a mini-game.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/densha-de-go-tokubetsu-hen-fukkatsu-shouwa-no-yamanotesen", "videos": [{"id": 48820, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rnpDQuH7lek", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnpDQuH7lek", "title": "DS \u96fb\u8eca\u3067GO! \u7279\u5225\u7de8 \ud83d\ude83 \u5fa9\u6d3b! \u662d\u548c\u306e\u5c71\u624b\u7dda \u25ce\u25ce", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rnpDQuH7lek/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
