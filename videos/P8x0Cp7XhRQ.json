This auto racing game puts you in the cockpit of a Drag Racing car!  Sort of... you push the button for gas, hold left to use to the clutch and push right to shift.  Your objective is to earn the fastest time without blowing your engine up.  As far as racing games on Atari 2600 go, Dragster is pretty dull.  Enduro from Activision is a better bet for fans of racing games on the old school Atari VCS video computer system.  This CGRHD review of Dragster has gameplay from the Atari 2600 version of this classic retro game cartridge.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8x0Cp7XhRQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8x0Cp7XhRQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8x0Cp7XhRQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8x0Cp7XhRQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P8x0Cp7XhRQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Classic Game Room HD - DRAGSTER for Atari 2600 review", "description": "Classic Game Room HD reviews DRAGSTER from 1980 for the Atari 2600.
