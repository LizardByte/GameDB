The Emperor, the Empress and your own wife, Antonina, vie for your attention, demanding arduous and often contradictory services. Completing these tasks will provide you with the men and supplies you need, but offending the wrong person will greatly weaken the fragile Expedition.\n\nAlternatively, you might declare independence and attempt to re-establish the Western Roman Empire under your own banner, seeking glory and immortality away from the court at Constantinople.\n\nWill you stay loyal to Justinian\u2019s vision of reclaiming Rome from the barbarians? Or will you follow your own path, establishing yourself as a new Emperor in the West?", "summary": "The Last Roman Campaign Pack is an epic expansion for Total War: Attila, delivering a narrative, mission-based experience on a new, highly-detailed campaign map of the Mediterranean theatre.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/total-war-attila-the-last-roman-campaign-pack", "videos": [{"id": 17678, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZPOHiFTQDyc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOHiFTQDyc", "title": "Total War: ATTILA - The Last Roman Campaign Pack Trailer  PEGI UK", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZPOHiFTQDyc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
