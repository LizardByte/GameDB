Set in the unforgiving waters of the southern US Gulf Coast, players will fight to survive in rivers and streams as well as the open ocean, with danger lurking at every depth. Their only tools are their wits, their jaws, and an uncanny ability to evolve as they feed. Anything and everything is on the menu... kill or be killed. In this tale of revenge, players can take on the role of an ever-evolving shark and terrorize the coastal waterways, tearing swimmers and divers limb from limb, giving the humans a reason to fear what lies below. Immersed in a living, breathing world full of threats and rewards, players will have a vast world to explore sunken wrecks, lurk in swamps, or cruise the open ocean looking for their next unsuspecting meal. As your shark evolves customize your maneater to fit YOUR play style. Eat, Grow, Evolve.\n\nhttps://www.tripwireinteractive.com/#/maneater\nhttps://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/maneater/home", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AMOCgKtoDz4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AMOCgKtoDz4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AMOCgKtoDz4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AMOCgKtoDz4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AMOCgKtoDz4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Maneater - Official Game Announcement Trailer", "description": "Maneater is an open world single player Action RPG, developed by Tripwire Interactive.
