When enough is collect a new island appears. When the spiral is formed a weird portal appears and a new world will be generated.\n\nThis game is a turn-based explorative game. Each new world is bigger than the one before, the game is endless and you will eventually get bored and quit.\n\nThe content of the island is randomly generated and this game is a bit of a dungeon crawler but linear. The later islands will contain ghost that follows you and when you collide with them you get spawned. Some of the ghosts leave a trail of spikes what can it a bit harder to maneuver.", "summary": "A weird art game where you collect artifacts, walk around, avoid ghosts with randomly generated islands until you get bored.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eridu"}
