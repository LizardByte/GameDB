Your mission is to trace a path through a set of matching tiles, but watch out \u2013 you may be attacked by enemies who improve as fast as you do.\n\nAs you go, the object is to collect as many resources as you can, like gold and experience. Get enough points and you can buy or upgrade equipment and level up. All the while, remember to avoid those nasty enemy skull tiles and fight them off for as long as you possibly can. And don't get too greedy, or you risk being overwhelmed!\n\nThe higher you go in a Dungeon Raid game, the more strategy you\u2019re going to need to match a greater number of tiles, grab bonuses and stay ahead of those evil adversaries. Never forget that they improve as the game continues.\n\nKeep your wits about you as you play Dungeon Raid. As you level up, there are many trade offs to consider and complimentary combinations of skills to be chosen. If you\u2019re not used to the tense pace of the higher levels, go ahead and start on easy difficulty. That gives you the chance to play the game in a more relaxed way, and watch how powerful your avatar can become.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-raid", "videos": [{"id": 9366, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "eumnCTG0AE8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumnCTG0AE8", "title": "Dungeon Raid Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eumnCTG0AE8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
