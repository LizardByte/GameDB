Many sought exodus to Alpha, one of Gaia\u2019s satellite planets - unwittingly (or for some, perhaps intentionally) bringing the dark forces along with them. As a result, Alpha\u2019s atmosphere has been adversely affected, causing some strange occurrences on the planet during the night. During the day, Alpha\u2019s landscape is peaceful, but once the sun sets, the planet immediately plunges into chaos. Occasionally, the remnants of Gaia will block out the sun, causing an eclipse on Alpha, resulting in a violent, bloodthirsty frenzy among the Alpha\u2019s native creature. Eclipses also provide an opportunity to obtain incredibly rare magical resources, so players must learn to survive during eclipses if they want to thrive.", "summary": "Dark and Light is a vast sandbox RPG set in a world dominated by powerful elemental forces.
