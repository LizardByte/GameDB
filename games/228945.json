The hero of the Nintendo game is a carpenter named Mario. The goal is to rescue Mario\u2019s girlfriend Pauline from the marauding Donkey Kong. Mario needs to reach Pauline at the top of the screen, all the while dodging barrels thrown by Donkey Kong. Other obstacles include conveyor belts, elevators, and fireballs.\n\nIt was being developed by game designers Wayne Westmoreland and Terry Gilman. The port was eventually finished, but never received an official release as the duo could not get permission from Nintendo.\n\nLater, in 1995, Westmoreland released all of their TRS-80 titles to the public domain, including the unreleased port of Donkey Kong.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/donkey-kong--20"}
