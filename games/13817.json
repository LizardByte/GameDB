In 1984 it was ported to the ZX Spectrum by U.S. Gold. in 1987 Atari Corp. published it in cartridge form for the then-new Atari XEGS.\n\nThe player controls a Sopwith Camel biplane during World War I, attempting to shoot down enemy planes and bomb targets on the diagonally scrolling terrain. It has strong similarities to the arcade game Zaxxon. The game is named after the medal Pour le M\u00e9rite, informally known as Blue Max. Its theme song is \"Rule, Britannia!\".\n\nIn 1984, Synapse released a sequel called Blue Max 2001 with a futuristic sci-fi setting, but otherwise similar in style to the original game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blue-max", "videos": [{"id": 109136, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NKX5s5Gb-pk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKX5s5Gb-pk", "title": "Blue Max for the Atari 8-bit family", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NKX5s5Gb-pk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
