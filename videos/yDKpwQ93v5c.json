Jane's ATF is based of another flight sim by the same company, Jane's Combat Simulations, from two years prior called Jane's U.S. Navy Fighters which borrowed the same game engine with some modifications. Since Navy fighters was released, Jane's Combat Simulations, a branch of Jane's Information Group, released a bunch of expansion packs and newer games based on Navy fighters which included new aircraft, new campaigns, and other improvements including being ported to the Windows line of operating systems which became popular at the time. \n\nAdvanced Tactical Fighters introduced next-generation fighter aircraft including the F-22 (which the aircraft's prototype had appeared but not the debut aircraft itself which was shown until a year later,) the X-32 (a contestant of the Joint Strike Fighter program which was later beaten by the X-35 now known as the F-35,) two non-stealth aircraft which were used as technology demonstrators which are the X-29 and X-31, the Rafale which is a French multirole fighter being developed at the time, and various other aircraft including the B-2 Stealth Bomber, the F-117 Nighthawk, the AC-130 Gunship, and two previous aircraft from Navy Fighters which are the F-14 Tomcat and F/A-18 Hornet.\n\nThe last Jane's flight sim to run on the Navy Fighters engine was Jane's Fighters Anthology, a mix of all Navy Fighters based games put into one for Windows in 1998. By that time, Jane's was moving on to released graphically up-to-date flight sims including Jane's F-15 which was released around the same year, Jane's F/A-18 which used a modified version of the Jane's F-15 engine released a year later, and Jane's USAF which was released around the same year and used an independent game engine and featured the ability to fly multiple aircraft since Fighters Anthology.\n\nIn the turn of the new millennium, Electronic Arts, who was the publisher of the Jane's simulators throughout the 90s, no longer published new games for Jane's Combat Simulations. The developers made two new games as of today since then which received mediocre reviews, Jane's Attack Squadron and Jane's Advanced Strike Fighter (JASF.)\n\nYou can read more about Jane's Combat Simulations and their games: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane%27s_Combat_Simulations, http://www.ign.com/companies/janes-combat-simulations\n\nHappy 2015!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yDKpwQ93v5c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yDKpwQ93v5c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yDKpwQ93v5c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yDKpwQ93v5c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Jane's Advanced Tactical Fighters: Guardian Angel (F-22A) (Original)", "description": "After another little hiatus, I decided to show videos of me playing missions from a 19 year-old flight sim released for MS-DOS called Jane's Advanced Tactical Fighters or Jane's ATF.
