Your plans go awry and you\u2019re now stuck inside \u2013 you don\u2019t know it yet, but the only way out is through. You find a barely running station wagon deep in the woods, miraculously unlocked and able to make the trip down the hill into the valley. Here you come across an abandoned auto shop which becomes your base of operations, where you safely repair and improve your car between runs. Do your best to survive, solve mysteries, and search for a way out \u2014 or become part of the ongoing legends of the Zone.", "summary": "Pacific Drive is a run-based, first-person driving survival game.
