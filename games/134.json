Deep within Dante's blood lies the power of ancient demons and as his power builds he transforms into a demon state where he can use his power against evil he encounters.\n\nCommencing his battle against the demonic legions with just a sword and his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory, Dante will soon come across more powerful weapons, such as a shotgun to aid him in his mission. However, to defeat the devil Dante must also discover special weapons possessing various elemental powers. When channelled correctly these weapons will allow Dante to call upon demonic energy and launch powerful attacks against a range of enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 273, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VlfHI4YNWwk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlfHI4YNWwk", "title": "Devil May Cry 1 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VlfHI4YNWwk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35665, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "qTAabYS1-0U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTAabYS1-0U", "title": "Devil May Cry - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTAabYS1-0U/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1899, "name": "Vergil"}, {"id": 1901, "name": "Mundus"}, {"id": 1898, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3649, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e1du3dmaitikgdrxail0.jpg"}, "name": "Dante", "species": 5}, {"id": 4965, "name": "Trish"}, {"id": 4969, "name": "Young Vergil"}, {"id": 4967, "name": "Griffon"}, {"id": 4968, "name": "Young Dante"}, {"id": 556, "name": "Mother"}, {"id": 4966, "name": "Phantom"}]}
