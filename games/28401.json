Heavily story driven, this strategy RPG takes place in a time when mechs known as TS are the weapon of choice for combat. Gameplay revolves around the battles and customising your TS between those battles.\n\nBattles are part turn based and part real-time. The player inputs their actions at the beginning of the turn. The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in real-time for the duration of the turn. This makes thinking about what your opponents and allies will do in advance essential before taking your turn.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/faselei"}
