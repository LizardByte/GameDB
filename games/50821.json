Attach explosives to make them deadly. Attach a rifle because - well, why not?\nCraft your own shelter, bridges and walls. Build traps to snare animals.\n\nTravel through beaches, caves and jungles. Swim through lakes and raft over oceans.\nSearch for exotic crafting materials in hidden and deadly locations.\nFind your way home.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/under-the-ocean", "videos": [{"id": 17490, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LfS_iX-xCPA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfS_iX-xCPA", "title": "Under the Ocean - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LfS_iX-xCPA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
