Along the way he meets Raspberyl who introduces herself as an old friend of Mao and the Academy's Number 1 Delinquent (as she does all her homework, has perfect attendance and volunteers in her spare time). Soon after, the pair meets Almaz who has come to protect the Princess from the Overlord. Mao, seeing Almaz's title as \"Hero\", kidnaps him while Beryl tries to rescue him. Eventually Mao gets away with Almaz as class starts and Beryl cannot be late. Mao then takes Almaz into his heart where they can switch titles thus giving Mao the power he needs to defeat the Overlord (he then comments how economical the game is as the final boss will be defeated in the first chapter). Mao and his slaves, including Almaz who is now a \"Demon-in-training\", then go face the Overlord who is much bigger than they expect. The fight actually occurs without the Overlord's knowledge on the palm of his own hand and the party is thus defeated.", "summary": "Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice is the third video game in the Disgaea series by Nippon Ichi. The game takes place in a Netherworld school called the Evil Academy. In this demon school, a good student is one who engages in evil activities such as truancy, never showing up to class, and getting in fights with others. Disgaea 3 is a tactical RPG; most of the game involves battles on isometric maps upon which the player controls a group of characters. Maps often feature \"geo blocks\" with statistical effects on the battlefield, that, unlike in previous games, can be stacked or stood upon. Many objects in the environment, including these blocks, and characters themselves, can be lifted, thrown, or destroyed.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disgaea-3-absence-of-justice", "videos": [{"id": 39439, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ntHRAueqm3E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntHRAueqm3E", "title": "Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice PlayStation 3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ntHRAueqm3E/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47006, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wrP9IqkeEls", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrP9IqkeEls", "title": "Disgaea\u00ae3: Absence of Detention Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wrP9IqkeEls/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
