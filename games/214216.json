Rather than a huge adventure through the Pokemon world, VR Missions instead offers a series of specific scenarios in which you must make it to the goal of the level, using only what the level gives you in each stage. There are 30 stages and all, each with a unique gimmick of some kind. If you are familiar with the Battle Sim from Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, the idea is similar to that, just with some overworld puzzles in addition to battles.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-firered-vr-missions"}
