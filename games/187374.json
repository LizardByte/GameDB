Aim your shot correctly in front of the incoming missiles to stop them until you defeat them all or run out of missiles. Use your left, center, and right mouse buttons to fire your shot closest to the missile you want to stop for the best results. It's a straightforward game, but an excellent retro experience.\n\nF4 will switch from full screen to windowed mode. Space will release you from the mothership and shoot upwards at enemies. Left and right arrow keys to maneuver, and down arrow for thrust. Like all Crozza Games, the game is portable, so no installation is needed", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/missile-command--2"}
