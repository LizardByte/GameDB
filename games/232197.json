You can also create and share your own games for a truly endless experience.\nCreate enough words to fill the board from the letter tiles you are given before running out of time to advance through the levels and up the leaderboards. Play without time limits in laid-back mode or create a globe of words in word matrix games.\nEach level is generated dynamically, so there are an almost limitless amount of levels to play. The words you have to find are not predefined either, so as long as you enter a real word that fits on the game board, you can play it.\nCreate your own custom games by defining a set of letters and words to find. Add a time limit, or not, and share it for any of your Wurds friends to play.\nOptional, plural and singular word checking and automatic entry. Say goodbye to the tedious process of entering slightly altered words over and over again.\nYou can play the standard game, free forever. You never have to buy anything.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wurds"}
