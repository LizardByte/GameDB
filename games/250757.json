Only the church saves people from extermination. In return, the ruling Cardinals demand only unquestioning obedience. Ancient texts that question the structure of the world are destroyed, the recalcitrant rot in church cellars by the hundreds, those who are too submissive, on the contrary, become Saints and suffer martyrdom. From their bodies, the churchmen kindle a special flame \u2014 the Holy Fire, which the khemrids hate and fear. But the main weapon of the Church is the immortal Hunters, people able to fight the khemrids on equal terms.\n\nA girl fleeing from the khemrids pursuing her loses the most precious thing in the fight; a self-propelled carriage powered by the power of the Holy Fire, a ridiculous old man who knows more than he says... The city destroyed by the invasion becomes a home and a battlefield where completely different battles will unfold: the ambitions and lust for power of the church will collide with the will of a brave heretic, the lies of the Cardinals will crumble, because ancient books will tell the truth... Find love, lose your father, detect an immortal god where you never thought you would find him \u2014 Immortal Hunters is building its history out of the chaos of the coming end of the world, it's time to find your place in it!", "summary": "Co-op RPG beat 'em up.
