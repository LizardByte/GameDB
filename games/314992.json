Your first real romance, starring me!\u201d\n\nThen my classmate Ena drops this bombshell on me. I tried to warn her, but she suggested we test the curse out and see how far we can go... and I found myself hopeful for the first time in a while. When word got out, however, my childhood friend Hinano and even Ayane, who\u2019s like a second sister to me, confessed they had a thing for me, too, turning my life around overnight!\n\nI might be new to all things romance, but these babes are keen to go to war with each other... in a battle for my heart!
