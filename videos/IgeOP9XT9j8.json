Designed to deliver the definitive VR stealth experience, Espire 1: VR Operative drafts players as drone operators of the future. Players become \u201cEspire Agents\u201d and use cutting edge Virtual Reality hardware to remote-operate the Espire model 1 from the safety of their \u201cControl Theatre.\u201d \n\nThe technology behind the \u201cControl Theatre\u201d and the game\u2019s movement system lies at the heart of Espire 1: VR Operative\u2019s gameplay and intuitive VR control system. Any time a player performs any artificial locomotion, the game world shrinks down to the size of a floating tablet, with the Control Theatre visible in the player\u2019s peripheral vision. This \u201cVR within VR\u201d system allows for precise full freedom of movement, maintains immersion, and also eliminates \u201cVR motion sickness\u201d for almost everyone. The Control Theatre is fully customizable to suit the player\u2019s level of comfort, up to fully disabled for those already comfortable moving in VR. Check out this developer diary from Michael Wentworth-Bell, Founder of Digital Lode and Game Director for Espire 1: VR Operative for a closer look at the game\u2019s Control Theatre locomotion system. \n\nTripwire\u2019s support of Espire 1: VR Operative goes far beyond publishing. Months before there was a publishing deal for the title, Tripwire\u2019s Producers, Marketing, Tech, Art and Audio leads assisted on Espire\u2019s development.  It is this level of development support, which goes beyond funding and distribution, that has allowed the project to become a reality.\n\n\u201cWe were blown away when Digital Lode first showed us Espire 1: VR Operative,\u201d said Tripwire CEO and Co-Founder John Gibson. \u201cNot only is the game amazing, but their Control Theatre movement system finally enables the dream we\u2019ve all had of VR to become reality \u2013 full freedom of movement in VR that the masses can enjoy without motion sickness. We\u2019re blown away to be able to work with Digital Lode to bring this game to the players.\u201d \n\n\u201cTripwire is a publisher that has understood the challenges a fledgling independent development team faces and have been able to catapult our team forward,\u201d said Digital Lode Founder Michael Wentworth-Bell.  \u201cTripwire\u2019s experience in VR development with Killing Floor: Incursion has helped save the Espire team countless hours of R&D. Espire 1: VR Operative has been a dream opportunity to establish a new stealth IP, while re-imagining stealth game mechanics in the unique medium of VR. Without Tripwire\u2019s oversight, this dream would have remained out of reach.\u201d\n\nKey features planned include: \n\u2022 The definitive VR stealth experience: Espire 1 brings the stealth genre to the exciting medium of Virtual Reality, delivering gameplay mechanics for the stealth and action genres that have yet to be explored.\n\u2022 Full freedom of movement: Espire 1 allows players the freedom to move anywhere within their virtual environment, moving, climbing, and falling with full comfort and no motion sickness for almost all players.\n\u2022 Complete single-player story, rich in detail: Espire 1 is being developed as a dedicated single player VR experience with individual story missions and scenario missions that use the story mission environments for short challenges.\n\u2022 Voice control: Using the VR headset\u2019s onboard microphone, you can make commands and perform actions simply by speaking. The noises you make could draw the enemy to your location \u2013 use this to your advantage.\n\u2022 Arsenal of weapons and gadgets: As an Espire 1 VR Operative you will have access to dozens of unique gadgets and weapons such as a tranquilizer pistol and deployable spy cameras in order to complete your mission objectives.\n\u2022 Global Leaderboard: A worldwide tally awards players a competitive score based on mission time, movement, stealth, ammo conservation, takedowns and other factors.\n\u2022 Intuitive controls that mimic real life: Interaction in this game aims to be natural and intuitive. Instead of memorizing dozens of button combinations for every action, you perform them as you would in real life. You can crouch and enter cover by physically using your body.\n\u2022 Smart AI: Enemy combatants in this game actively hunt the player. The AI responds to sight, sound, and other stimuli and will react to with varying levels of suspicion based on your physical stance, movement speed, cover and relative location.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgeOP9XT9j8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgeOP9XT9j8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgeOP9XT9j8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgeOP9XT9j8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgeOP9XT9j8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Espire 1: VR Operative - Official Announcement Teaser Trailer", "description": "Espire 1: VR Operative Aims to Deliver Definitive \nVR Stealth Experience in 2019 - Tripwire Interactive Partners with Digital Lode to Publish New VR Game with \u201cVR within VR\u201d Movement System that Kills Motion Sickness.\n\nTripwire Interactive, developers of the award-winning Killing Floor and Red Orchestra franchises and publishers of Road Redemption for consoles and Maneater for PC, is proud to announce a partnership with independent developer Digital Lode  to publish the studio\u2019s first title, Espire 1: VR Operative.
