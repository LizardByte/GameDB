Now is the time to prove the reason for his existence: get the crown for his people. To do this, he must maintain a tough fight against his gods, who force him to carry out his mission in a very limited time. Erik will travel on the \"Drakkar\" through time, and will return to Roman times where his adventures will take place.\n\nOnce there, the gods will decide the fate of Erik, our brave warrior, who will tirelessly seek the throne for his people. You must fight against all kinds of enemies, from rats that inhabit the catacombs and dangerous beasts, to archers who try to skewer you with one of their arrows.\n\nDeadly guardians guard the palace rooms where Caesar is. Dense forests with a great variety of shrubs and plants will make more than one falter before reaching the city. Angels playing sweet melodies of lethal effect. Swampy lagoons with piranhas hungry for a good bite.\n\nBe careful! The bronze chandeliers will fall on your head when you least expect it. Other mysteries await Erik in old Rome, but if he is guided by the Valkyrie goddesses, he can achieve his goal.", "summary": "The map consists of 150 screens with a labyrinthine structure. There are two well differentiated areas: the forest and the city. In the first one are the gods whom you must find to find out the order of the tests to be carried out. In the second the main development of the adventure will take place. There will be the objects treasured by Erik, guarded by innumerable dangers.\n\nIn your mission you will spend a lot of strength, so there are some food, shields and axes so that you can move forward without falling in the attempt.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/drakkar", "videos": [{"id": 44151, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yvwy6n-Prgc"}]}
