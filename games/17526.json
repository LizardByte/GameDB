This will prove to be an extremely powerful tool to progress in the game providing the players with a personalized army depending on their style of play.\n\n30 battle scenarios: all inspired by historical missions which took place between the summer of 1941 to late 1944\n\nLand, naval and aerial combat: all units have strengths and weaknesses encouraging different uses, adding an extra strategic layer to the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/frontline-road-to-moscow--1"}
