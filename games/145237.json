It's model number is UD-202. In the game, crabs are moving towards your character. You must push them away and not let them pinch you. If three crabs pinch you, then it'll result in a game over, and you'll have to start over. There are four columns, each a different color (from left to right: purple, green, orange, and blue). The crabs will start to come from the top, and you'll have to move your character from left to right to push them away, though more and more will always come. The game was one of two Super Color games, the other being Spitball Sparky.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crab-grab", "videos": [{"id": 71210, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zFXst_JOXsk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFXst_JOXsk", "title": "Game & Watch - Crab Grab (c)1984 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zFXst_JOXsk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
