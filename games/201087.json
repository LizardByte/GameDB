The way the story is told is very unique. It uses trans-media storytelling. The developer doesn't want to spoil too much about the story since the way it is told is an integral part of the game. Telling too much about the story will ruin the experience.", "summary": "Dreams of Pain is a highly experimental first-person mystery horror game with elements of horror in its atmosphere. The structure of the game is mostly linear. The game incorporates ARG-like elements into its storytelling. The game's art style was inspired by retro games from the late '90s. It doesn't hold your hand and there are no traditional tutorials for the player. Some of the puzzles in the game are types of puzzles not seen in any game before.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dreams-of-pain"}
