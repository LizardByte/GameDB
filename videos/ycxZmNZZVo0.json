The player has a throttle to control the plane's speed (for Expert mode only), a yoke to control the plane's movement, and two triggers to fire machine guns and homing missiles. Wing War has 2 game modes: Dogfight & Expert. Dogfight is a shoot 'em up battle style mode, where two aircraft are in battle across the sky while flying towards the finish line at the end of the stage with the most power left unharmed. Expert mode is where the simulation part comes to play. In this mode, you have full control when flying with your plane, and now the controls handle like a real aircraft.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InsertCoinArcad", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ycxZmNZZVo0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ycxZmNZZVo0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ycxZmNZZVo0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ycxZmNZZVo0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ycxZmNZZVo0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wing War Arcade", "description": "Like Virtua Racing, the game has 4 view mode buttons: a cockpit view, rear view, top view, and finally, an automatic view.
