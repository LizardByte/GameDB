After a global apocalypse, you take on the role of protecting four family members living in a deserted underground shelter. Their well-being and survival are your responsibility. One bad decision and a loved one is gone, forever.\n \nCombat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramped, cold underground shelter. You\u2019ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you\u2019re forced to venture outside into the dangerous, desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your family\u2019s survival for just one more day. Also, pets! Choose between a dog, cat, fish, snake or horse as your loyal companion.\n\nKey Features: \n \nFirst time on Nintendo Switch: Sheltered is available on Nintendo Switch for the first time! Enjoy the apocalypse on the go in handheld mode or at home in TV mode or table top mode.\n\nExtra content: Additional scenarios Surrounded and Stasis are included.\n\nFamily comes first: Keep your family alive and protect them from the ravages of the harsh post-apocalyptic world. \n\nMake the shelter a home: Maintain your shelter - keep it secure, habitable and make sure that the family have enough resources to survive. Protect your shelter from hazards and infiltration! \n \nCustomisation: Your family is unique to you; you decide their gender, names and their appearance. \n \nRPG mechanics: As your family develop, their stats will adapt with an evolving experience and trauma system. Attributes, strengths and weaknesses will dynamically change based on your choices. \n \nCrafting system: Create comforts for your family\u2019s shelter and equipment for aiding exploration. \n \nExploration: Send out your family to explore and gather resources for everyday living and crafting. \n \nRecruitment system: Recruit outsiders with different personalities, integrate them into your shelter life and earn their loyalty. \n \nDynamic encounter system: Your family will encounter various threats including roaming factions and feral beasts. \n \nTurn-based combat: For those that cannot be reasoned with, violence can be used as a last resort. Your family may depend on it. \n \nVehicles: Make exploration quicker and safer.\n\nAbout Team17 Digital Ltd\nFounded in 1990, Team17 Digital Limited is a leading international games label that hosts the Worms franchise, Aven Colony, The Escapists, Genesis Alpha One, Overcooked, Sword Legacy: Omen, Yoku\u2019s Island Express, Yooka-Laylee and many more from developers around the world.
