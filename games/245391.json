Like in Pac-Man, all the dots from a board need to be eaten in order to pass to the next board. If the characters bumps into a monster, he loses a life. There are special pills in every stage allowing the character to eat the monsters for a short period of time.\n\nThe game contains three game modes: Classic: this is the original style of Pac-Man*, the player is the yellow dot muncher, and the enemies are the four ghosts.\n\n- Advanced: in this type the player's character is a pair of big lips and the enemies are skeletons.\n- CarMania: in this type the player is bulldozer and the enemies are little cars. Objects turn into fuel tanks, screwdrivers and hearts. This third mode was added in an updated version.\n\nIn every game type there are also bonuses. Most of them offer points and hearts provide extra lives. For every five completed levels a password is provided to continue from there.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pacmania-ii", "collections": [{"id": 8726, "name": "PacMania"}]}
