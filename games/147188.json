Set in a 3D airspace, the game features fast-paced, tactical combat with dynamic flight physics.\nLuftwaffe and RAF fighter squadrons go head to head over The English Channel. Competing players simultaneously issue control inputs for multiple aircraft while time is paused.\nThe planned orders are then played out simultaneously: shots are fired, loops are looped, colliding planes collide."}
