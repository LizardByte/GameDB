There are lots of levels to go through, and you need to test your prowess as you try to complete every level. The game is very immersive, and you always need to remove all the monsters, even if it feels hard to do. There are lots of dynamic elements that move in the game, so you can use those to your advantage. In the end, you must use the limited number of bombs to kill enemies and it will be well worth it every time.
