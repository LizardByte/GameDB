The later sets were not released in America. When connected with the game, the player could receive extras such as new berries, and new trainers to battle.\n\nOddly, the Pok\u00e9mon you battled through the trainer cards would not give your Pok\u00e9mon any experience points or items after they were completed. When the player scans a berry card, you'll receive a berry from a character."}
