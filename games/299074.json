This localization removed all plot-related elements including cutscenes and endings, took the in-game's fan art gallery and renamed some characters with names taken from XS Games employees. The game's cover art and title screen also feature a completely unrelated artwork featuring characters resembling the main trio from Charlie's Angels. This realistic artwork is the complete opposite of the anime-styled aesthetics of Gunbird, and the characters displayed don't appear anywhere in the actual game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mobile-light-force"}
