The game looks really nice for being made in 48 hours, the goal is simple (get to the end!) and the satisfaction of completing it was nice. It takes place on Mars (obviously) and was inspired by the xkcd comic #695 \"Spirit\". I think I did pretty well with only that many commands! Can you do any better?
