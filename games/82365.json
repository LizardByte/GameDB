Played in rounds that reset the station every time, the game features an assortment of jobs, including doctors, chemists, scientists, janitors, engineers, atmospheric technicians, security guards, bartenders and the all-important clown.\n\nEach round\u2019s randomly selected antagonists will try and execute plans to fight the station\u2019s crew. Despite some unintuitive graphics and mechanics, the game can be incredibly addictive! Endless possibilities await you on the barely airtight deathtrap that is Unitystation...", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/unitystation", "videos": [{"id": 82746, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cL227GYlWII", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL227GYlWII", "title": "Unitystation trailer 0 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cL227GYlWII/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
