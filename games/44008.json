Players use the Nintendo 3DS camera to snap their own picture and then map it onto their avatar, the landscape or even a turbo boost so they can pick up their very own power-ups as they race. Each avatar offers up to one hundred choices in hair, clothing and eyewear, plus cars can also be customized by tuning and tweaking to create the ultimate personalized racer.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/face-racers-photo-finish"}
