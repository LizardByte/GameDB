{"id": "dmTdUJSZd1k", "snippet": {"title": "Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition Longplay (Arcade) [60 FPS]", "description": "Developed and published by Capcom in 2003\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nGame 01 (Ryu): 00:00\nGame 02 (Akuma): 21:52\n\nStreet Fighter II was one of the best-loved arcade games of the early 90's and it's success led to the development of several follow-up titles. Rather than actual sequels, Capcom developed and released these games as logical extensions to the base game, although they're all standalone titles in their own right.\n\nThe game was originally released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox home consoles with an arcade version (still based on CPS-2 hardware) not arriving until later.\n\nHyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition is, essentially, a \"greatest hits\" mix of all the Street Fighter II games in a single package. The game includes the extended character roster from Super Street Fighter II and various rule-sets and game settings from Street Fighter II Turbo and Championship Edition.\n\nDepending on preference, players can choose which rule-set they want to play before the fighting commences. The selected game mode dictates which fighters can be selected, the overall game speed (turbo level) and which fighting moves are available to each character. For example, players choosing to play \"Normal\" mode will be restricted to fighters, moves and rules from the original game, whereas \"Super T\" gives access to all the new characters and updates. For players who take their Street Fighter gaming experience seriously, this level of control is a great addition since it allows combatants to play with settings that they feel most comfortable.\n\nFor this video, I opted for \"Super T\" mode with all the bells and whistles switched on, including level 2 turbo. Even though I'm not a big fan of the increased speed, I do like the new characters and super moves and the great thing about this game is that I can choose to lower the game speed should I want to. The features in each of the various revisions of the game can be pretty divisive, so having this level of control is a great feature.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's very much the same Street Fighter II that you've always known (and hopefully loved). I found the AI in the \"Super T\" mode to flip-flop between murderous invincibility and sheer stupidity depending on the character it was playing, but the game's difficulty can be tweaked if you're having a rough time of things.\n\nApart from looking a tad pixellated, the game's visuals still hold up really well. The graphics in later versions of the game were overhauled and retouched with more vibrant colours, finer detail and more dynamic backgrounds. The fact that the ocean in the background of Ken's stage is static still looks odd (especially when compared next to highly detailed an animated backgrounds from some of SNK's fighting games), but it's still a big improvement over the original SF II.\n\nAs for audio, everything is crisp, clear and still sounds great. The sound effects haven't really changed, but the music in later revisions of the game (e.g. Super Street Fighter II Turbo) were rearranged and sound better with each iteration. In short, the game sounds as good as it can do without moving to a full CD audio soundtrack.\n\nWith it's extensive customisation options, Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition is the swan-song for the venerable Street Fighter II series of arcade games and undoubtedly one of the best.\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmTdUJSZd1k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmTdUJSZd1k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmTdUJSZd1k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmTdUJSZd1k/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmTdUJSZd1k/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hyper Street Fighter II: Anniversary Edition Longplay (Arcade) [60 FPS]", "description": "Developed and published by Capcom in 2003\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nAdd me on Google+: http://bit.ly/1tPwL1u\n\nGame 01 (Ryu): 00:00\nGame 02 (Akuma): 21:52\n\nStreet Fighter II was one of the best-loved arcade games of the early 90's and it's success led to the development of several follow-up titles.
