Though the game is limited to simulating runway landings only. After a successful touchdown you can progress to other airports around the country, each with increasing difficulty in the way of wind interference. The graphics and controls are quite basic, but the game still aims to provide immersion during each short landing sequence. The later versions on X68000 and PC-98 feature control tower speech and higher resolutions which add further realism to the simulation.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 22870, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "XmzQ9NCwVtA"}]}
