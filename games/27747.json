They lived on a \u201cnormal\u201d terrestrial world with several large continents, oceans, and the like. But that all changed...with the Worldbreak.\nA catastrophic event occurred. The world shattered, creating the geography we live with today. Humanity survived, but most all technology was lost and the old ways of life forgotten. Tribes formed, separated across the different islands. Eventually, air travel was (re)discovered, and a world culture was born again.\n\nThe Weaver Wars - A period of prolonged warfare occurred between the different weaver-aligned cultures of the world. Eventually, the Convokers were able to strike a decisive enough victory to establish the Imperium and usher in the modern era.\n\nFor many generations, the Imperium has ruled successfully and mankind has flourished. While the world has seen peace in the sense that there haven\u2019t been military clashes spanning the entire world, conflicts between ideologically misaligned Houses are not uncommon. When these do escalate to open conflict, however, they have generally been reigned in by Imperium peacekeeping forces before engulfing the world in warfare.\n\nSuddenly, Queen Aurelia dies under mysterious circumstances. Shards begin falling from the sky.\n\nAnd this is where your story begins, Rangers.", "summary": "Shardbound is an immersive, multiplayer collectible tactics game packed with rich lore, deep strategy, and cutthroat competition.
