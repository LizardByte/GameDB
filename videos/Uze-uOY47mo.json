The next two games after the 3DO was discontinued were on the PlayStation in 1999 and 2002 respectively. The games were SuperLite 1500: Shinsei Toire no Hanako-san and Mobile Tomodachi.\n\nDespite the fact Future Pirates barely has any information about the company itself, the website is still up and running... though you can't actually interact with it nowadays, as the site used Flash, which has since been discontinued. When the company closed down (or even are alive) is still a mystery.\n\nDeveloped and published by Future Pirates\nWacky Races (C) Warner Bros.
