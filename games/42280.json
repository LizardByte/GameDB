Starship Hector).\n\nAll three of these games were the subjects of the Hudson All-Japan Caravan Festival, which for a long time hosted a new Hudson shoot 'em up every year and traveled around Japan with competitors in different prefectures attempting to earn the highest scores. The game would then be available for sale shortly before or after the competition, which helped raise its profile.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/caravan-shooting-collection"}
