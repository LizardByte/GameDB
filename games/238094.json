This leads to a universe with hundreds of planets, each with their own economy, government, and opinion of the player.\n\nThe game is not limited by borders and allows players an opportunity to influence the branching storyline. At the same time, the larger and more expansive game world lives and develops by itself. In Starsim players will have an opportunity to test their skills not only in outer space, but in turn-based tactics as well.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starsim", "videos": [{"id": 84397, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "UTOoVWHmOFY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTOoVWHmOFY", "title": "StarSim - Early WIP trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UTOoVWHmOFY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
