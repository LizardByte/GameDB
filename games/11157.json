As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill \u2013 it is all up to you.\n\nHitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we\u2019ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You\u2019ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that\u2019s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You\u2019ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It\u2019s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you\u2019ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hitman", "videos": [{"id": 4417, "name": "Announcement E3 Trailer", "video_id": "hCwVQF2r7fo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCwVQF2r7fo", "title": "Hitman - Announcement E3 Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hCwVQF2r7fo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 4454, "name": "E3 Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "zHRcKErn7zw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHRcKErn7zw", "title": "Hitman - E3 Gameplay Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zHRcKErn7zw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6149, "name": "Sapienza Trailer", "video_id": "hqVBJ-YpYng", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqVBJ-YpYng", "title": "Hitman - Sapienza Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hqVBJ-YpYng/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6944, "name": "World of Assassination Trailer", "video_id": "KujFaw3Ndzk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KujFaw3Ndzk", "title": "Hitman - World of Assassination Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KujFaw3Ndzk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6978, "name": "Beta Trailer 2", "video_id": "DFzS9gbvM5A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFzS9gbvM5A", "title": "Hitman - Beta Trailer 2 (Official Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DFzS9gbvM5A/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7154, "name": "Legacy Opening Cinematic", "video_id": "ALMy9KY7tTk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALMy9KY7tTk", "title": "Hitman - Legacy Opening Cinematic (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALMy9KY7tTk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7261, "name": "Season Premiere Trailer", "video_id": "PFZe4XYCcOo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFZe4XYCcOo", "title": "Hitman - Season Premiere Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PFZe4XYCcOo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7504, "name": "The Sarajevo Six Trailer", "video_id": "9EEusfuMiOI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EEusfuMiOI", "title": "Hitman - The Sarajevo Six Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9EEusfuMiOI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7967, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HIC3TweImA8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIC3TweImA8", "title": "Hitman - Sapienza Launch Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HIC3TweImA8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9608, "name": "The Sarajevo Six: The Veteran Trailer", "video_id": "LvjaBl5owNE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvjaBl5owNE", "title": "Hitman - The Sarajevo Six: The Veteran Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LvjaBl5owNE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 10888, "name": "The Season Finale Trailer", "video_id": "bSDZyoLJ9kI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSDZyoLJ9kI", "title": "Hitman - The Season Finale Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bSDZyoLJ9kI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11777, "name": "101 Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "DT6isFaPbK4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT6isFaPbK4", "title": "Hitman - 101 Gameplay Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DT6isFaPbK4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
