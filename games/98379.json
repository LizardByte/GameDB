Dungeons are laid out in a 3x3 grid, and you'll need to use your items wisely to survive. You'll build your deck and earn perks as you fight your way to the Uberlich. Do you have what it takes to defeat the Uberlich? \n \nBattle the likes of sozzled bearbearians and nuke-addled snotwolves to protect our glowing green world from the sweaty hands of the Uberlich! Krumit's Tale involves the same core deck building mechanics as Meteorfall: Journeys and the same cast of overly optimistic heroes, but expands the \u2018swipe\u2019 mechanic into a dynamic grid based system. This means more depth and longevity \u2013 our heroes will have to choose perks to complement their deck-building strategy and carefully manage the board if they wish to triumph.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 28412, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "baCJBZsYEYE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baCJBZsYEYE", "title": "Meteorfall: Krumit's Tale", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/baCJBZsYEYE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
