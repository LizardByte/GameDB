Vilkacis had some degree of experience with hacking Fire Emblem games and would make changes to the game such as making Noah a dark mage with the portrait of a Phantasy Star character, giving Ogier a speed growth that's over 100%, and making Zephiel one of the most overtuned boss fights in the series. Roy's Bizarre Adventure is the final version of this hack that was released in the thread's final update.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/roys-bizarre-adventure"}
