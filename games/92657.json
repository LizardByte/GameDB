Even though every challenge needs to be played, players take turns choosing a category by rolling a die and they receive bonuses to their scores for their category. A challenge consists of a question with four possible answers; Players choose the right one by pressing the A, B, C or D button on their remotes. Entered answers cannot be changed. The title refers to the four clues that are provided as time counts down. Clues make it easier to choose the right answer, but less time on the clock leads to less points. Choosing an incorrect answer has the player lose that amount of points. This is where the die roll comes into play. If a player rolled a 100, the amount of points earned or lost is doubled. A 150 triples that, and 50 for instance halves it. Only the player who chose the category can get a high amount (even though 25 is also available for instance). Other players always have the standard value of 50. When the time is up, the answer is shown and a scoreboard appears.\n\nAfter six challenges (halfway through the game), the Arc of Time game is played. Players can add as many as 200 points to their score by placing the dates of six events in the correct chronological order. For each event a year appears. Players select whether it happened before or after the year that is shown. When all players have made their choice, the year drops in the correct chronological position. During the Arc of Time it is possible to retire and keep the accumulated points. When a player goes bust, all points are lost. Each event is worth ten points more than the last, up to a maximum of 200 points.", "summary": "4 Degrees: The Arc of Trivia is a trivia game published by ZAPiT Games in 2005 as a pack-in game with the Game Wave Family Entertainment System.
