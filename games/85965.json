The survivors of the catastrophe live in floating harbours built of flotsam and jetsam, or on ships powered by old engines.\n\nGigantic marine monsters have suddenly appeared in the seas, roaming free and threatening the very existence of the survivors. In this society, some men have become Monster Hunters, big game bounty hunters who pursue the monsters of the deep for prize money.\n\nThese men sail the seas alone, sometimes never to be seen again, while others return to the harbours victorious, bearing the remains of the slain giants. In this new world, a young Monster Hunter is just embarking on his voyage to yet uncharted waters.", "summary": "Deep Water is a single player action shooter game set in a post-apocalyptic world where the atmosphere has changed after an unspecified disaster. You now take on the role of a young man named El Shipak who hunts sea monster for a living. Six months ago Shipak has sighted a special monster and he is now obsessed with hunting it down.\n\nGameplay includes sailing around the oceans with El Shipaks boat. In the Oceans are floating harbors where supplies like fuel and ammo can be bought to hunt down the monster. Here the player can also buy better guns and upgrade his ship. At the harbor the player can also take on missions. Missions usually involve sailing to a certain area and gunning down enemies from the deck of your ship. Maneuvering the ship and fighting off the enemies can\u2019t be done at the same time. If fighting enemies the player can move freely across the deck of the ship.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deep-water--1"}
