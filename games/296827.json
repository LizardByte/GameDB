This is because the Unova Pokedex was designed to stand alone without any Pokemon from additional regions, much like the original Pokedex. The plot is effectively identical to the Generation 1 games, the only major change is in the Pokemon available. There is also a challenge mode patch which provides a more difficult version of the same hack.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-unova-red"}
