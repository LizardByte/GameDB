It was centered in the Shadowkeep, the home of the powerful wizard Nacomedon. The demon Dal'Brad had imprisoned Nacomedon in a crystal and held his captive deep in the tower while he wrought the evil madness.\n\nThis evil spread until it reached the four races of the Earth. Roos, Thalidars, Zhis'ta and Humans alike were threatened by the wretched evil that was spreading from the tower. A few brave adventurers were sent forth from each civilization, determined to put a stop to the evil and perhaps acquire a small fortune at the same time.\n\nRoos, hardy explorers of great physical endurance; Thalidars, masters of the ancient art often known as magic; Zhis'ta, agile and shrewd warriors from birth; and Humans, intelligent leaders with a knack for getting into trouble \u2013 all joined together to fight the demons in the Shadowkeep.\n\nAlas, it was not enough. Each was defeated in turn. There was time for just one more group of brave adventurers. One more party of heroes was needed to topple the cruel and hertless obelisk that was the Shadowkeep. We call on you, our last and most noble chance to accept the challenge \u2013 to assemble your party, approach the keep, and, if your spirit is able, rid the tower of its malicious tenent.", "summary": "You are Practer Fime, an apprentice blacksmith, who sets out to free the good wizard Nacomedon who has been turned into crystal by the evil Dal'brad.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadowkeep", "videos": [{"id": 118774, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "igXOcweWz_M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igXOcweWz_M", "title": "Shadowkeep for the Apple II", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/igXOcweWz_M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
