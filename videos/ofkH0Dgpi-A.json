In Blockage, you follow the story of a guy who, on a certain day at work, began to notice that he was having difficulty concentrating, in addition to not feeling the taste of food anymore and suffering a certain numbness in his face. He feels that there is something in his head that is bothering him, but he doesn't know what it is. From there, you are taken inside his mind, where you, now a strange acorn, must explore it and thus find the source of the strange symptoms that person is experiencing.\n\n\nNEW - 5mg Magazine #7 - Demons of Asteborg:  https://www.5mgsite.com/magazine\nSubscribe and get access to news and our Discord server: https://mailchi.mp/1d6e93f3d1cb/5mg\n\n#indiegames #indiegame\n\n******************************************\nSupport us here:\n- Buy a 5MG Channel a coffee for support: https://ko-fi.com/5mgchannel\n- Become a Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/5mg\n- Become a member: https://bit.ly/3uDuQ5A\n\n******************************************\nOur website: http://www.5mgsite.com\n\n******************************************\nOur Social Medias\nInstagram: @5mgofficial\n\n\nSubscrite to our channel, thumbs up the video, share it with your friends and visit our website.\n\nNote\u00b9: This is not a guide, but my experience playing games, sometimes, for the first time.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofkH0Dgpi-A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofkH0Dgpi-A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofkH0Dgpi-A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofkH0Dgpi-A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofkH0Dgpi-A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "BLOCKAGE: Find the Source of Your Strange Symptoms in this Psychological Horror Game", "description": "Support our project on: http://www.patreon.com/5mg\nDownload FREE and more: https://www.5mgsite.com/post/blockage-find-the-source-of-your-strange-symptoms-in-this-psychological-horror-game\nDon't click here: https://bit.ly/35L4LXh \n\nGame Description\nBlockage is a short (and weird) indie Action, Interactive Fiction and Visual Novel game that was produced by dis0rder and Ankea for this year's Ludum Dare and published on April 5th on the itch.io platform.
