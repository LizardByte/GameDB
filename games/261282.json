The playing area is mostly built within a 1024x1024 scale and the majority of the level is set outdoors. I've tried my hardest to make the gameplay good and challenging. Plenty of teleporting surprises so watch your back. The exit is located in the middle of the map around a nukage moat, you must raise a bridge to get out of this level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fortress-1024"}
