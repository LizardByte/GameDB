The only hope for the city lies through the use of Primordial Fluid, the blood flowing through The Shell.\n\nWith most of the accessible fluid within the first several layers being extracted, homunculi must travel deeper using The Great Elevator. This elevator of unknown origin stretches to an undetermined depth and can only be powered through an immense output of energy, such as the death of an Angel.\n\nUpon entering a new layer, a homunculi's main goal is to hunt the Angel, following its various tracks and using context clues to determine its location.\n\nEach layer of The Shell is expansive and open. This allows homunculi to navigate freely using large structures and various navigation tools. While hunting Angels, you\u2019ll need to explore for items, food, weapons, clothing, and equipment in order to survive.\n\nThe journey is long and it\u2019s important to rest. Set up camp anywhere at any time in order to cook, sleep, trade items, sit around the fire, or play a bit of guitar with friends.\n\nTravel alone or with fellow Husks.\n\nThroughout The Shell are Primordial Fountains. Homunculi can use these fountains to travel the void and enter other\u2019s reality. Join friends and strangers on their travels and hunts, whether it be for a brief moment or the entire journey.", "summary": "We Kill Monsters is a solo or co-op adventure set in a mysterious and massive pit.
