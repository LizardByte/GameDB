While KX has kept a considerable amount of pre-existing KR lore, much of which has changed by now, it has also introduced a lot of new elements and additions going beyond the scope of the timeline created back in the days of Kaiserreich for Darkest Hour.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kaiserredux"}
