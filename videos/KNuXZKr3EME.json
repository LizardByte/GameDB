Experience arcadey action with speedy attacking and dodging, while attempting to control the massive weight of a 10 storey mobile pizzeria - just try not to make too much of a mess! \n\nPizza Titan Ultra is a big little indie game wearing a rad 90s aesthetic and a colour palette that gives a loud shoutout to the sweet Saturday morning cartoons that inspired it. You can even build your own mech with parts taking cues from the best the mecha genre has to offer. \n\nWith equal parts city-stomping giant robot action and completely insane visual novel, Breakfall has lovingly crafted hilarious characters, but with heart. Your crew will evoke a sense of madcap camaraderie while you action roll through giant robot battles to serve hot and fresh pizza pie. Your pizzeria's customers are wacky mashups of 80s and 90s pop culture. They never seem to JUST order pizza, bringing special requests that range from hunting noisy helicopters to collecting giant floating pizza ingredients. Some deliveries, the crew learn about team work and friendship. Other pizzas will be delivered to save the world from a psychic apocalypse. Ultimately unravel the mystery of your archnemesis, Cheezborg. How exactly did the former pizzeria mascot beloved by kids turn into a deranged robot overlord? Find out while crushing the cheezbot army along the way!\n\nMore info at: http://www.pizzatitanultra.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KNuXZKr3EME/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KNuXZKr3EME/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KNuXZKr3EME/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KNuXZKr3EME/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KNuXZKr3EME/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pizza Titan Ultra Action Trailer", "description": "Pizza Titan Ultra is a fast paced 3rd-person action platformer focused on fighting and smashing through a futuristic city, in a giant mech, to deliver pizza.
