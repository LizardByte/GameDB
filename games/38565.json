The game gives you the unfortunate task of controlling a submarine that is under fire by a host of helicopters and even marine wildlife. As the submarine, you must dodge the bombs that the helicopters drop as well as the sea creatures and shoot upwards at the oncoming onslaught of enemies, delivering your fire a little ahead of the helicopter so that it connects in time. Interestingly, a version of the game was planned for the Nintendo Entertainment System, though was for whatever reason canceled by Nintendo. The game was presented in both a standard cabinet form and as a tabletop title."}
