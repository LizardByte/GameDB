Their evil thoughts pulsate across time and space corrupting even the strongest minds. Players assume the role of Agent Cain, a powerful Psionic working for an elite government agency. As Cain, you strive for mastery of innate psychic \u201cTalents\u201d such as the ability to shoot fireballs or the power to summon hideous creatures.
