This is where the new protagonist Lena makes her appearance.\n\nJust like in Valis III before it, players can swap between 3 playable characters at any time. With increased difficulty compared to the previous entries in the series, players have more ways than ever to enjoy clearing stages. The visuals in Valis IV, which includes animated cutscenes with Japanese voice acting that are an absolute must-see, are the best in the series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/valis-iv--1"}
