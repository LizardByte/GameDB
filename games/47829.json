The user holds the DS vertically like a book, and Winx Club Secret Diary 2009 uses a simple but effective menu system which allows the user to store key dates, send/receive text messages, speak with friends via Wi-Fi and play Winx-themed sub-games together. The diary is completely customisable, allowing users to personalise it to their individual taste, with different colour schemes, avatars and backdrops available."}
