Mankind has spread out to the farthest reaches of the known galaxy. Thing is, those far reaches are dangerous, filled with space pirates, deadly asteroids, hostile aliens, random anomalies, and maybe even a strange space monster. But that doesn\u2019t mean the people living out there still don\u2019t want stuff. That\u2019s where you come in.\n\nYou are captain Buck Mann (kind of an ironic since you don\u2019t have a buck to your name).\n\nYou\u2019re a \"thirtysomething\" year old pilot, but truthfully you don\u2019t really care about age. Age is just a number and you\u2019ve never been all that good with numbers. The only number that matters to you is being number one. You pride yourself in being the best fraking pilot in the galaxy, if not the universe. You once flew for Earth Force. Later you became a hot item on the space racing tour. You are a rugged individualist, your own man, a man\u2019s man.\nProblem is, you do have a bit of a gambling \"habit\". That gets you in trouble time and again. For your latest incidents, you were holding Aces over Kings a full house, a sure winner. Hard to believe you lost everything to some mutant who had four threes. Then you failed to cover the spread on the humans vs androids rugby game. You had the androids, but never anticipated that EMP blast. Long story short, you now owe the mob a LOT of credits. Being out of money and in debt over your head, you are forced to accept jobs piloting big bulky cargo ships. Much to your chagrin you are now a \"Space Runner\" making Space Run after Space Run.\nStill, you have the courage, knowhow and mojo to get the job done! You have two mottos you use depending on the customer. \"Fast safe delivery!\" - \"When you need it there yesterday!\".\nIf somebody has a package they need delivered, you\u2019re the man to do it, no questions asked. Well there is one question asked: how much does it pay?\nYour crew\n\nAdaam-12: an android who is one of a kind (well more likely 12 of a kind) he is your co-pilot, your second in command, your right hand man, eh machine.\n\nHe is constantly by your side. You won him in a black jack game. He knows pretty much everything and he is programmed to be ever helpful and full of ideas.\n\nYet this somehow doesn\u2019t stop him from being snarky. Sometimes you think he thinks you work for him.", "summary": "Space Run is a PC game that mixes strategy and space ship construction in real time, borrowing certain mechanics from the \u201ctower defense\u201d system with numerous twists and hyper dynamic gameplay. Space Run is a nod to \u201880s science fiction and pays homage to many of its tropes and references.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-run-fast-and-safe-delivery", "videos": [{"id": 2689, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "gPfrVOLU-Xk"}, {"id": 2690, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "NXob0jrfvQs"}]}
