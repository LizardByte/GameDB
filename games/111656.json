As Ali, you'll meet a variety of foes and can choose how to fight them - either by casting one of 4 magic spells, using over 30 hand-to-hand maneuvers with your feet and hands, slashing them with your scimitar, or throwing knives and other weapons. In addition, you can walk, run, sprint, jump, climb ladders and ropes, walk a tightrope, read parchments and inscriptions, fly on a magic carpet, push and pull objects, play the flute, as well as pick up and use inventory objects. Interact with over 60 non-player characters in various locations including towns and neighborhoods, the Palace, a burial ground, crypts, and gardens.", "summary": "Arabian Nights is a 3-D action-adventure arcade video game published in 2001 for Microsoft Windows.
