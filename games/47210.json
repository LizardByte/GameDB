Players compete in a series of five-lap Grand Prix races across global circuits, each beginning with a qualifying lap. The game features a unique vertical scrolling perspective with a horizontally stretched viewport, creating a challenging visual experience that demands quick reactions to upcoming turns and rival cars. While not officially licensed, the game offers a selection of thinly veiled fictional teams and drivers. Key to success is the strategic use of pit stops for refueling and repairs, as well as purchasing upgrades between races with prize money. This combination of fast-paced racing action, limited visibility, and resource management creates an engaging and demanding Formula 1 experience that balances arcade thrills with strategic depth.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-gp-circuits"}
