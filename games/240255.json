Like its predecessor, it is a first-person space exploration game rendered in 3D. As you pilot your spacecraft around the planets and stars, engaging in space combat and conversation with other characters, you unravel the Conquer the Universe plot. The game is similar to Elite in that you are relatively free to travel to wherever you please.\n\nThe MS-DOS version has a bit of a different intro due to graphical differences, different sounds, and some parts of the main HUD for your spacecraft have different colors. You can also select what mode the game will run in at the beginning at start-up.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/age", "videos": [{"id": 85355, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "t14CqSZp4ok", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t14CqSZp4ok", "title": "A.G.E gameplay (PC Game, 1991)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t14CqSZp4ok/sddefault.jpg"}]}
