Two versions were created - a handheld version, and a large tabletop unit, although the game itself is presumed to be identical.\n\nOutRun is similar to several other LCD games on the market - you simply drive forward and try to avoid traffic. There is both a high and low gear, much like the arcade version.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/outrun--2"}
