You play the protagonist in his endeavour to make some coffee to survive yet another night of overworking, while trying to handle his complaining ex-wife as well as to cope with his bad conscience regarding his neglected daughter. For players familiar with adventure games it shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes to complete the game, while for players unfamiliar with the genre it will probably take a bit longer.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-place-in-the-sun"}
