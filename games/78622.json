Besides the requisite minor graphical upgrade, there were various changes to increase the difficulty. Monsters are stronger and there are generally more of them throughout the game, but the most significant addition is green soul energy. Some foes release this when they die and the player must capture it before other monsters do. The player can gain temporary invulnerability, but the monsters become faster and stronger. Additionally, there is a new area, several new costumes, enemies limbs can be cut off by your weapon on certain conditions, some new cut scenes and a new super attack.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/genma-onimusha", "videos": [{"id": 78866, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RJylPWhOz4Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJylPWhOz4Q", "title": "Genma Onimusha Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJylPWhOz4Q/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
