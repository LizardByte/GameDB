The Music Machine moves back and forth at the top of the screen, dropping symbols that represent good qualities (Fruits of the Spirit). You have to catch these in you basket. Once you have caught one of each of the other symbols, then the heart (representing love) comes down. You MUST catch the heart to end the round and go to the next round. If you miss the heart, you lose a life. Just under the Music Machine is Mr. Pims. He tries to mess you up by dropping down his assistants, the Pudgeons. If you catch a Pudgeon, you lose a life.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-music-machine--2"}
