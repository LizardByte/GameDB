The creature cornered me anyway.\n\nThat's when SHE appeared, as if from nowhere \u2014 the beautiful, mysterious girl who saved my life.\n\nShe told me her name was Kuon.

However, he's rescued by a beautiful girl named Kuon, who sports both adorable animal ears and a beastlike tail. Finding that the hapless man has no memory of anything, Kuon decides to take the amnesiac into her care, naming him Haku. As their journey takes them across the land, Haku will (reluctantly) encounter colorful characters (yes, that means more animal people), build deep relationships, battle ruthless enemies, and find himself inexorably dragged into the political machinations of the mighty nation of Yamato.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 11749, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "6kkm1GI03Ss"}, {"id": 15706, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BL7zNEGyqCY"}, {"id": 15707, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3pX4WPWYIyE"}]}
