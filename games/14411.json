On August 3, 1976, an underwater cable was cut, and all power to the island was lost. During the subsequent blackout, all of the islanders disappeared and the island became deserted. Twenty-nine years later, in 2005, a magazine editor called Mamoru Itsuki is visiting the island to conduct research for an article when the ferry he and a small group of other passengers are on capsizes, after it is hit by a red tidal wave. Shortly after his arrival, a group of soldiers crash land on the island after their helicopter has engine troubles. They must all find ways to survive the island's \"monsters\", the shibito.\n\nThe game is played through several character perspectives, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, through an overlapping timeline of the fateful night that alternates between the present and the past. The story can unfold in different ways with, in many cases, two or more different versions of a level, which will have slightly different objectives than the original. If the player is thorough and plays through these optional versions, the story and characters may develop even further than before", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/forbidden-siren-2", "videos": [{"id": 6184, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FVq9gxxYKbw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVq9gxxYKbw", "title": "Forbidden Siren 2 Trailer (PlayStation 2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVq9gxxYKbw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
