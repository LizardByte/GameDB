{"id": "y7IWPawyp94", "snippet": {"title": "Bit Blaster XL (gameplay)", "description": "Bit Blaster XL is an 80's style shoot em up with lots of power ups and things to dodge and shoot, the main difference between this game and most others like it is there is no shoot button. You shoot constantly and the shots change depending on the power ups you grab. The only controls you have are turn, boost and brake and there appears to only be one level. These may sound like bad things but the game is surprisingly fun and quite addictive. Just like those coin op machines at the store back in the day. Worked fine with my controller.\nThanks for watching and remember to sub for more great indie games: http://www.youtube.com/c/BiscuitDog\n twitter: https://twitter.com/_BiscuitDog_\nGame: http://store.steampowered.com/app/433950/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y7IWPawyp94/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y7IWPawyp94/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y7IWPawyp94/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y7IWPawyp94/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y7IWPawyp94/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bit Blaster XL (gameplay)", "description": "Bit Blaster XL is an 80's style shoot em up with lots of power ups and things to dodge and shoot, the main difference between this game and most others like it is there is no shoot button.
