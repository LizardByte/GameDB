Humanity is done for. The surviving fraction is ruled by Despot, a cruel AI eager for hideous experiments. A blob of goo created by Despot to engineer artificial human beings has become sentient and risen up against its creator. This blob of goo goes by the name of Slime and desires one thing only: \u0441haotic violence. Build your deck of ability cards, grow weapons from your \"body,\" survive relentless onslaughts of enemies across multiple challenging levels, and take on the terrifying Despot himself!\n\nVersion 1.0 will bring ten new levels, fresh abilities, a total rebalance of the old ones, and other content. And yeah, an old \"friend\" will be waiting for you at the end as the final boss.
