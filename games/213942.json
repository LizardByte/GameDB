This Saturn game combines the typical arcade racing of the time with a career mode consisting of the player attempting to woo women by driving fast and safe. FMV's would play depending on how the player did, and being successful eventually leads to (supposedly) the women stripping their clothes, hence the 18 age rating.\nThis Version includes a bonus disk jammed with more FMV's lewd enough to warrant a yellow label warning. Unfortunately, the quality of the FMV footage on the bonus disk is poor without the Saturn MPEG card being installed, but it still runs without one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 73560, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IpxT0ef_glk"}]}
