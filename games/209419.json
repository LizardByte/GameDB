They became... the Ninzas!\n\nTo ensure that its champions will never cease to fight against each other and keep the entertainment at its best, the Mo0n promised to fulfill the dearest wish of the Ninzas who could earn its respect.", "summary": "Ninza is a multiplayer fighting game like no other! Instead of directly attacking your opponents, you crush them by pushing pieces of the level. Embrace chaos and dive into an entirely new level of frenzied and creative gameplay, where the environment itself becomes both your weapon and your ennemy.\n\nEach character has a unique moveset and abilities, guaranteeing unexpected outcomes and thrilling comebacks in every battle. The game offers ample room for crafting creative strategies, tricks, and traps. But be warned, becoming a true Ninza master demands great determination. Only the boldest players can rise through the fierce competition and aspire to earn Mo0n's respect.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ninza", "videos": [{"id": 98732, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "usSbzmpJuZU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usSbzmpJuZU", "title": "Ninza - Demo trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/usSbzmpJuZU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
