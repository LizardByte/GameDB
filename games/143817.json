Its animal friends have been captured and hidden by cute kawaii wildlife. You must explore through various nature environments, discover hidden pathways and rescue animals. As you explore and discover new locations, an auto-map will keep track of all previously discovered locations and pathways.\n\nExplore through different colorful nature environments. Each environment has unique enemies and obstacles that you can either avoid or destroy. Be careful though. Some enemies are better avoided!\n\nTo aid you in your quest, you can either use your paw to bounce your ball into the direction you want, or use rotation keys to rotate and steer the ball in any direction. This will give you a greater amount of control over the ball.\n\nThe game features 21 themed open levels, progressing from smaller safer environments to larger more dangerous and surprising environments. The game creates unique levels every time you play. No play-through is ever the same twice. Whenever you retry a level, the game will present a new unique level that might be slightly easier or more difficult.", "summary": "You're a fox in this cute, funny, nature-themed brick-breaker game with a twist!
