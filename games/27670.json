Your task is to move the circle and make the ball hit every segment of it while holding the ball inside the screen. Every time a segment is hit it disappears and the ball gets reflected. The ball gets faster with every hit and so should you! With each of the 15 levels the circle will be divided into more and smaller pieces. Don't let the ball escape the screen, otherwise you'll have to start all over again.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/circles-end", "videos": [{"id": 12520, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zqxKxDvPAWc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqxKxDvPAWc", "title": "Circle's End - Casual Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zqxKxDvPAWc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
