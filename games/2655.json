On the train, Rover sits across from them and drums up a conversation. During the exchange, the cat finds out about the child\u2019s situation. Rover contacts Tom Nook and arranges for his old friend to help out the boy or girl upon their arrival.", "summary": "Occasionally strange but completely addictive, Nintendo's Animal Crossing for the GameCube is not so much a game as a simulation of life on a small town. Players begin the game by setting out to live life on their own in a colorful town, where they are greeted by a seemingly endless supply of things to do and characters to meet.\n\nTime passes in Animal Crossing in real-time, as the month, day, season, and time of day matches that of the player's. Holiday seasons come and go in Animal Crossing, just as they would in the real world. Experience the freedom to fish, decorate your house, go bug catching, garden, write letters, and even play original Nintendo NES games in this imaginative, and addictive game.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/animal-crossing", "videos": [{"id": 3161, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fNxjGDGBYlg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNxjGDGBYlg", "title": "Animal Crossing Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fNxjGDGBYlg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 37151, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "EwwW4Rk1wMU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwwW4Rk1wMU", "title": "Animal Crossing [57] GameCube Longplay pt.1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EwwW4Rk1wMU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
