A variety of levels which pick your brain and offer more fun as the game progresses.\nThe goal of the game is to outmaneuver and outsmart the super-clever characters that are trying to escape the game board by placing obstacles around them. Easy, you'd think, but the characters are clever and your task gets harder as the more demanding levels host different bonuses, just waiting to be picked up by the escaping characters.\nCollect an average of 2 artifacts per level to unlock the next world.\nCarefully designed and developed AI resulted in a highly intelligent and sneaky opponent creation which introduced a definite innovation in the board games community.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smart-way"}
