Every level contains a pristine red door, only usable for exiting purposes after one or more red keys have been collected. Sounds straightforward enough, but it's funny just how much this game will twist your perceptions of both straight AND forward. All levels are composed of a number of squares, shiftable in a manner akin to a sliding tile puzzle. Each square contains a finite fraction of the overall level itself, and the key to victory lies in prudent transfigurations of the landscape.", "videos": [{"id": 34068, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "0c2geDqtNtM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c2geDqtNtM", "title": "Continuity Walkthrough - Levels 1-15", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0c2geDqtNtM/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 34069, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "vMFzJap-dT4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMFzJap-dT4", "title": "Continuity Walkthrough - Levels 16-32", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vMFzJap-dT4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
