PNG monsters wander with mysterious intentions\u2026\n\n\n~~~ extra info ~~~\nInspired by The Backrooms, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, and Nextbots, PNG Mall is an indie horror game set in a liminal mall, where you must explore, run and hide in order to escape. Unlike Roblox Evade which also has nextbots, the PNG monsters in this game all have unique AI and abilities that make the survival experience more interesting. Also apparently this game gives similar vibes to Kane Pixel's The Oldest View which has the Rolling Giant monster, but it's not inspired by or related to that. Kane Pixels is the creator of the original The Backrooms (Found Footage).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/43wFMNjCqc0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/43wFMNjCqc0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/43wFMNjCqc0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/43wFMNjCqc0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/43wFMNjCqc0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "PNG Mall Announcement Trailer | Indie Horror Game", "description": "\u27a4 Coming soon to Steam!
