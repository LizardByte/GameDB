Within await the native anomalis, hostile stalkers, and the many mutated by the miasma.\n\nAmong those that venture into the exclusion zone are members of the Thistlemine Excavation Corps; a military faction with the sole responsibility of securing and preventing the growth of exclusion zones.\n\nAs Noa, a young member of the Excavation Corps, you will venture in this hostile environment. Inside you will navigate a dreamlike garden, fight the anomalis, find artifacts, and try to survive until a chance to escape presents itself.", "summary": "Thistlemine is a puzzle RPG that tells a story about the work that takes place within an Anomalis Exclusion Zone \u2013 a hostile environment where space and time are warped, and the thick miasma suffocates those trapped within.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thistlemine"}
