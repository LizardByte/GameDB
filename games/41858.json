Resident Evil favorites Leon S. Kennedy and Chris Redfield are joined by new characters, including Jake Muller, to face a bioterrorist threat on a global scale, as the narrative moves between North America, the war-torn Eastern European state of Edonia, and the Chinese city of Lanshiang. Resident Evil 6 features three distinct, yet interwoven story threads, each with its own pair of protagonists for either solo or co-op play, both offline and online. Leon S. Kennedy is paired with US government agent Helena Harper, while Chris Redfield teams up with fellow BSAA member Piers Nivans. Finally, gun for hire and son of the infamous Albert Wesker, Jake Muller, is joined by Sherry Birkin, the daughter of former key Umbrella scientists, William and Annette. All six must face a new horror - the highly virulent C-virus that has been unleashed on an unsuspecting and unprepared world, creating new and deadly transformations.", "summary": "Blending action and survival horror, Resident Evil 6 is a dramatic horror experience that cannot be forgotten. Now in high definition, the game offers multiple characters, including fan favorites and new faces, along with solo and co-op modes and new challenges for players, different from any other in the Resident Evil franchise. This edition includes all DLC, along with two costumes per main character, originally exclusively unlockable through Residentevil.net, that are now unlockable through the game itself.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 59849, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sS_bGpe9qE8"}]}
