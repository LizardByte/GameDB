The project was originally headed by Scotty but seen to completion by Insane_Gazebo. Initially, the maps were meant to be short and more accessible challenge maps that could be beaten by lower-skilled players on the Ultra-Violence difficulty setting, but the style shifted to longer and more challenging maps after Insane_Gazebo took over the project. The WAD was released on the Doomworld forums on September 22nd, 2021 and was awarded a Cacoward at the end of that year.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/haste--1"}
