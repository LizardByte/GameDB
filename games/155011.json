The game can also be played stand-alone with limited options and a downsized playworld.\n\nLike the previous games in the series, in Docking Station you breed Norns and raise them. You can teach them to talk, play, eat, avoid hazards and reproduce. Each Norn has its own set of genes which is passed on to its children. With this online version you can easily pass on your genes to Norns from all over the world and chat with other players."}
