The mines are closed now. The yield became to meager and the cost too great, or so they said.\n\nMany men believe otherwise, and rumors abound of mysterious and terrifying creatures of the dark caverns which chased prince Julien's company from beneath the earth and now jealously guard their riches. Many courageous adventurers have ventured back into the deep seeking the fortune they believe to be there, but none has returned. They learned too late the terrifying secret of the Labyrinth which ensures the doom of even the best-prepared explorer - the walls of the mine are in constant motion, exposing entryways and sealing off exits, as its ghastly guardians render useless both map and compass with their evil engineering.\n\nYou are no foolish treasure hunter, and would not consider assuming the risk of entering the Labyrinth for any material gain. But among those missing in the mines is one who holds the key to peace, prosperity and good seats at the Super Bowl, and you are determined to find out what happened to him and the others, and return alive and tell about it.", "summary": "A maze game shooter", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/labyrinth--15", "videos": [{"id": 105151, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Lmij7qvw7wk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lmij7qvw7wk", "title": "Labyrinth (Br\u00f8derbund) for the Atari 8-bit family", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lmij7qvw7wk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
