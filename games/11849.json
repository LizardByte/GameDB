The main gameplay is influenced by Dungeon Master, but features sections in the open air battling bears as well as the dungeons. \n \nIn the real-time combat sections you must choose weapons and spells instantaneously, using the mouse-based interface. You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from the first game to load in.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/abandoned-places-2", "collections": [{"id": 1794, "name": "Abandoned Places"}]}
