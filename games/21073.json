It is a re-release of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The game was released on February, 21, 2012 in North America and on March 8, 2012 in Japan and Europe. It is also the first Metal Gear game to be released on a Nintendo-developed portable system since Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, back in 2000. A digital download version was released in Japan via the Nintendo eShop function on the Nintendo 3DS on December 16, 2014, exactly a decade after the initial release of the original title. The download includes a Snake Eater theme, which included a FOX logo wallpaper, the theme song for the game, cursor sound effects from the Metal Gear series, and folders modeled after the cardboard boxes from the series. Both the digital download for the game itself as well as the 3DS theme were later released in both Europe and North America on December 18, with the game itself costing $19.99. A patch was released a day later to fix a glitch occurring in the WIG area that freezes the game and corrupts save data when using the Circle Pad Pro", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "videos": [{"id": 33256, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nWDhcu6Jems", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWDhcu6Jems", "title": "Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D | [EXTENDED] trailer Nintendo 3DS (2011)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWDhcu6Jems/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
