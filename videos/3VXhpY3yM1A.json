In total, the game has 64 stars to collect, and some of them are really insane, so... I dare you to try completing the hack. How far will you get?\n\nThis version is completely different from the first one, I did my best to make it even more interesting, creative, fun and challenging!\n\n-There are now lots of new comet missions!\n-There are more galaxies with more changes, so new and creative stars!\n-All the comet medals have been moved from their original position, some of them are placed in the second mission of the galaxy.\n-A lot of layout and text have been changed, including characters with their own lines. Please talk with some of the NPCs!\n-There is a completely new, long and epic world map!\n-There are now more crazy boss battles with a bunch of cosmic clones behind you!\n-Some checkpoints and Life Mushrooms have been removed.\n-Now you can sometimes play as Luigi.\n-Custom cosmic clones music!

I fixed, added and balanced a bunch of stuff.\n-The version 2.1.4 is out, it's not a big deal, but I recomend it because it adds more NPCs dialogue.\n-The version 2.1.5 is out, I changed some little things and fixed some stuff, so I recomend it\n\nP.D. You need the cloudsuit for the small clouds section, it's not a cloudless challenge lol\n\n*\nIf you play the hack and upload a gameplay in youtube please give me credits and put this trailer in the description of your video, thanks :)\n*\n\n*********\nInformation and DOWNLOAD:\nhttps://gamebanana.com/mods/150988\n*********\n\nIso Builder by Uupo03: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ag_TlPIXqEhfGlT5TOJJJgl4y0D69VAC/view?usp=sharing\n\nJoin to my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/JYxJqXr\nIf you join, you will be able to find out about the updates that the hack will have, and about the different projects that I will carry out.
