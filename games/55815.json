Every type has a different playability. There are also weapons with special effects such as slowness, critical damage, and a weapon with a unique mechanic.\nEvery arena has loops on the sides (goes in through one side and comes out through the other).\nEvery arena spawns a box that generates random events for the match. These events can be good, bad or neutral.\nThere's a team mode to play 2x2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/square-x-square"}
