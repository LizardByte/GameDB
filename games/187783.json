These endless expanses are home to the continent\u2019s largest land animals and present the visitor with breathtaking views. You are rangers, each running your own wildlife park in this beautiful part of the world. Help your animals to gather with others of their kind in the largest herds possible by moving them to new spaces. Secure precious watering holes that increase your park\u2019s value and protect against bush fires. The more shady trees and lush grass in your park the better, too. Once all animals have been moved, the game ends with a scoring round. The ranger with the most points wins.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/savannah-park"}
