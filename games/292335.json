However, after multiple generations had been tested in combat with great success, one generation found a way to surpass all other generations by multitudes by altering the genetic composition of the subjects. The subjects started experiencing mutations in their bodies, and over time were found to have experienced a rapid evolution into completely different beings.\n\nThis generation was found to be much more aggressive and hostile even to the creators than previous generations, and quickly the specimen, viewing themself as a completely different and superhuman race, started to revolt against humanity and create clones of themselves to achieve superiority and control of the Earth.\n\nIn the year 2325, you as part of mercenaries from Armorion, a private military contractor, were tasked to infiltrate the main research facility of CyTech, to eliminate the rebelling specimens and end the production of new clones. The defense systems of the facility were dismantled and stripped down by the specimens, but the defense network is still connected and you are able to rearm the defenses by building turrets and traps into the existing defense pods. You will need to clear out the facility's sectors one by one and ensure the defenses are able to hold out any hostile specimens.", "summary": "In Neural Shock, you must cleanse the world of horrid and bloodthirsty creatures by utilizing turrets, traps, wits and weapons.
