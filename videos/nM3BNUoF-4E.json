No gameplay involved -- just sit back, relax, and enjoy the music while you drive through a retro low poly world. Nostalgic fans of the 80's will not be disappointed with some smooth DX7 chords, melancholic synth work and pulsating bass lines. \n\nThe EP features 3 tracks, and each track comes with its own scenery, tailor made to fit its mood. You can start each track separately from the main menu. \n\n\u201cTogether\u201d (duration 3m20)\n\u201cInnervisions\u201d (duration 3m00)\n\u201cPoint Break\u201d (duration 2m00)\n\nOUT NOW ON \nSTEAM: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1072530/Sheaf__Together_EP/\nOCULUS: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1621604147940095/\nSOUNDCLOUD: https://soundcloud.com/sheafnl/sets/together-ep\nSPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/album/2QKGEfJNA2SDpqe6e0PzTy?si=rozrcCQCTUuziPhkx1knrQ\nBANDCAMP: https://sheaf.bandcamp.com/album/together\n\n\nLinks\nSPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Mxi9cImdVD7vmGotzmAW9?si=ISC017jFTiqyczcwoqGnmQ\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/sheaf_nl\nSOUNDCLOUD: https://soundcloud.com/sheafnl\nAUDIUS: https://audius.co/sheaf\nBANDCAMP: https://sheaf.bandcamp.com/releases\nWEB: https://www.strydegames.nl/sheaf", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM3BNUoF-4E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM3BNUoF-4E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM3BNUoF-4E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM3BNUoF-4E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM3BNUoF-4E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sheaf - Together EP: VR Music Experience (Trailer)", "description": "Enter virtual reality to listen to the debut EP \u201cTogether\u201d of synthwave producer Sheaf.
