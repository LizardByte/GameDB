It was developed by Rare and released on the same month as their NES Jeopardy! adaptation. Rare would follow it up with two more NES adaptations of the show: Wheel of Fortune: Junior Edition and Wheel of Fortune: Family Edition.\n\nIt follows the rules of the show, where people spin a wheel and then try to solve a hangman puzzle, either guessing a consonant or spending their reward money to buy a vowel. Up to three human players can play via a pass-and-play system. Players must input their answers within a time limit using the in-game text parser.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wheel-of-fortune--5"}
