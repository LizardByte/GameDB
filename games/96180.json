If you love a challenge and want the freedom of playing a game your own way you will love \"Splat the Fruit\". Think marble run with lots of extras. The aim of Splat the Fruit! is to splat all your oranges using a variety of implements including bombs, cannons and magnets. Place girders and trampolines to allow the metal crushing balls to splat the oranges lying around each level. Each level has multiple solutions, can you find the solution that requires the least building? How many ways can you find to get the same result? Have fun, as we have while designing and developing the game."}
