A port of the game would be released through Xbox Live Arcade from Xbox 360 on June 23, 2010 by 3D Realms directly.\n\nManhattan Project features the humorously chauvinistic action hero Duke Nukem, this time fighting Mech Morphix, a mad scientist who is using a radioactive slime dubbed G.L.O.P.P. (Gluon Liquid Omega-Phased Plasma) to metamorphosize creatures into deadly monsters in order to take over Manhattan island, New York City. These enemies include metamorphic alligators, giant cockroaches, and even the Pig cops from Duke Nukem 3D. Duke also faces a few enemies who are not mutants, such as Fem-Mechs, lethal whip-wielding gynoids. Levels in the game contain recognizable parts of New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 PC Hardware \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7 3770K @ 4.20 Ghz\nRAM: 16 GB\nGPU: ASUS GTX760-DC2OC-2GD5\nOS:  Windows 7 64bit\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 Recording HW \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nAvermedia live Gamer HD", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NF_3OsIO1AA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NF_3OsIO1AA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NF_3OsIO1AA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NF_3OsIO1AA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NF_3OsIO1AA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project (2002) - PC Gameplay Windows 7 / Win 7 HD", "description": "Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project (2002) - PC Gameplay Windows 7 / Win 7 HD\n\nSubscribe here \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FirstPlaysHD\nAlso SHARE, COMMENT, LIKE \u263a\n\nDuke Nukem: Manhattan Project is a platform game developed by Sunstorm Interactive, produced by 3D Realms, and published by Arush Entertainment.It was released on Microsoft Windows on May 14, 2002 in North America and on June 14, 2002 in Europe.
