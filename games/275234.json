Check the ticket and if he has something he didn't buy you handcuff him and put him in the dungeon.\nCheck the security cameras, which will alert you if they detect someone stealing. They are shitty and sometimes fail, you will have to hit them with the broom to fix them...\nWatch out for the trolleys, the old ladies are trying to take them home.\nKids are bastards... Some of them come to eat whatever they want and then they leave the packages empty.\nThey often come to rob the supermarket, so be alert and when you see a robber you neutralize him with a punch.\nYou will also have to work at night so don't be afraid and if some robbers come you can shoot them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/supermarket-security-simulator"}
