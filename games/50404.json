It harkens back to the days of Ultima 4 or 5, or similar tile based games of the mid to late 1980s. The game took quite a long time to finish so there is a lot to see and explore in 9th Dawn. 9th Dawn II is in the works and I for one look forward to that.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/9th-dawn"}
