While it keeps the same background and general information about the time period as in Sengoku BASARA 3, some of the eight new stories only marginally reference the plot that was introduced in the previous game. \n \nSengoku BASARA 3 save data can be synced with Sengoku BASARA 3 Utage. If they are unlocked, alternate costumes and personal items will be brought over.
