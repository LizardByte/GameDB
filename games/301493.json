Everyone, whether by incompetence or by darker reasonings, is content in believing her death was an accident, that she was taken from this world by mere chance.\n\nBut I know it was not what her fate was meant to be. Her death was not random chance nor divine act. It was murder. It was through the festering of cruelty and evny within the darkness of humankind that her death was allowed to take place.\n\nSomeone is at fault for this and I will find out who. I will find the one responsible and realise vengeance upon them.
