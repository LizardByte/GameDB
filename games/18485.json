You and your opponents start the game with precisely equal resources. Quick reflexes will get you nowhere. The only path to victory is through clever strategy. Auralux features a slow, floating feel and vibrant minimalistic graphics. The entire game pulses to the rhythm of ambient music, and the player's actions evoke sounds that smoothly coalesce into melody. This game is designed to provide a relaxing, cerebral experience. Every choice matters, and only the best strategies will succeed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/auralux"}
