As a nameless protagonist, you begin in an ordinary office, but what seems like a normal day quickly turns into a nightmare full of decisions, secrets, and deadly challenges.\n\nAfter leaving the office, you suddenly find yourself in a dark room. A light flickers on, illuminating a table with an old keyboard. Shortly after, a PC screen comes to life, and a strange force the possessed Protocol begins testing you. Every decision you make can mean the difference between life and death. Find useful (or deceptive) items, solve tricky dilemmas, and try to escape the game alive.\n\nBut nothing is as it seems. The deeper you venture into the world of the Protocol, the more reality and dream begin to blur. Is this just a cruel experiment, or are you trapped in a nightmare? Can you unravel the truth before it\u2019s too late?\n\nAre you ready to face the ultimate test? Choose wisely your fate is in your hands.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-protocol-directive", "videos": [{"id": 134227, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CvzzEIB156A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvzzEIB156A", "title": "The Protocol Directive [Official Video Trailer] (Itch.Io)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CvzzEIB156A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
