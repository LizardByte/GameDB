As soon as he learnt about it, he decided to go and inspect his new property. It turned out that the farm is not very large and if you want to get a rich harvest and earn lots of money you have to work hard there. Do you want to become an experienced farmer and help Beetle Bug get lots of money?\n\nThis was the final game in the Beetle Ju / Beetle Bug series and unlike the past three games (including the DS port of the second game known as Beetle Bug Junior), this is a match-3 game where you clear fruits and vegetables to fill baskets. Ju carries off the baskets so he can sell the harvest for money, which is what he will need to expand and improve the farm. Sometimes you will also get different tasks and even encounter a sheep shearing minigame where you click on the running sheep to shave their wool... but be careful not to click on a black ram by mistake!\n\nBeetle Bug / Beetle Ju, Green Valley: Fun on the Farm (C) gamigo AG\n\n#beelteju #beetlebug #beetleju #beetlebug #intenum #windows #casualgames #greenvalley #green_valley #greenvalleyfunonthefarm #bigfish #bigfishgames \n\nFUN FACT: Unlike the past three games, this game is not on iWin.com.
