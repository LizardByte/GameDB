Now there\u2019s an incoming message from\u2026 your ex?\n\nAll in all, a quieter day than most.\n\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End is a narrative focused Space Opera that\u2019ll have you flying around the universe assembling an unruly crew from an eclectic cast of characters and taking any job you can to keep one step ahead of your abusive Ex. The twist: you\u2019re not just piloting a ship\u2026 you are the ship.\n\nSupplies don\u2019t come for free in the verse, doubly so for outlawed sentient spaceships. Every planet, moon and space station is a valuable source of jobs and their precious rewards. Assign crew tasks based on their skills, and help their decisions along the way.
