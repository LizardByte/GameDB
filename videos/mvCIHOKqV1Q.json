{"id": "mvCIHOKqV1Q", "snippet": {"title": "Soft Body - Gameplay Demo", "description": "Soft Body is a free-roaming bullet hell set in a meditative, musical world. The player leads two snake-like avatars through continuously morphing action puzzles. Instead of shooting projectiles, players interact with the environment by touching enemies and obstacles to paint them, push them, or pop them. In a departure from the locked environments and rigid controls of most shooters, all of the game's mechanics and audio systems have been designed and tuned to feature the fluid control and look of the player's avatars, the Soft Body and the Ghost Body. On a dual-analog stick controller, players can control these two similar characters at the same time. Though each avatar share some attributes, players must learn to use each abilities to master the game.\n\nSoft Body's design is built around a number of opposing aesthetic goals and mechanical decisions. The game boasts challenging levels, but it is intended to be accessible and easy to control. The moment-to-moment interactions are often tense, but the visual and musical aesthetic is relaxing and meditative. I wanted to create a safe space for people to challenge themselves and fail. In a game one hit restarts the level, I felt the need to create a more welcoming bullet hell: the kind of game where you can become detached from the frustration of failure and find the space to challenge yourself. Soft Body is a 'bullet heaven' game.\n\nOne of my goals as a game designer is to highlight the beauty of non-harmonic, musical systems: to create transformative, musical experiences without the use of formal tuning systems and to build elastic musical relationships out of all characteristics of sound. Soft Body hugs the boundary between tonal music and non-harmonic sounds; it gives a sense of an underlying musical order but also tries to obscure the prominent qualities of its tonal base. The music provides a static but unequivocal musical order, reinforcing the juxtaposition of inner peace and anxiety that the game mechanics serve to enforce.\n\nHow can I make movement feel great? This question has driven the game's development and informs every aspect of the design. From the shape of the bullet patterns, to the sound of painting a wall, Soft Body's mechanics encourage movement and give personality to the game's tense and joyful fiction. I want people to take tons of small risks and push their luck by skirting fields of projectiles, and I want them find fun and choices in their characters' flowing animation and to push themselves to master controlling two characters at the same time.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mvCIHOKqV1Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mvCIHOKqV1Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mvCIHOKqV1Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mvCIHOKqV1Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mvCIHOKqV1Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Soft Body - Gameplay Demo", "description": "Soft Body is a free-roaming bullet hell set in a meditative, musical world.
