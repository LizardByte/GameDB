Choose one of 14 athletes or make your own, and grow your character's stats over the course of a year. Playing well during the game will increase the mentality meter, giving your player a better chance of making tough shots. The mentality meter can also be expended to make a shot that will be difficult to hit back. Whichever player has won the most money from tournaments by the end of the year is crowned champion.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hard-hitter-tennis"}
