With each passing day the walls of this once great empire are torn down one by one.\n\nBut the noble souls of the Empire are resilient. Taking up arms in a battlefield once ravaged by a prehistoric war, a lone Frogeian citizen readies to stain the now overgrown ruins once again. In a cruel twist of fate, the true history of these hallowed grounds are revealed. With each snake bested, a soldier from eras past joins the lone frog warrior's final stand. With nearly nothing to call home anymore and the bright flame of one's will to live on, the true nature of the world is revealed in their final moments. This battle has occurred before and will occur again. All that was will be sundered so it may be reborn in a new age. Can this frog make its own fate? Or will the truth once again be missing in another great civilizations annals of history?", "summary": "Fight hordes of the evil snake army as one, several, dozens, hundreds of frogs, each with unique abilities and quirks.
