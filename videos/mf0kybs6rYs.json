It stars Lei-Lei (some know her as Hsien-Ko from Night Warriors/Darkstalkers) in a simple, yet relatively enjoyable game. The game features a few recurring characters like Felicia, Huitzil, Q-Bee and Anakaris as you run across the stages in the alloted time. There are five stages broken up into three segments and a bonus segment for a total of twenty dashes. The game has a few minor unlockables upon completion.
