Deluxe is a \"port\" of this game to the Saturn, which adds features such as a time attack and track editor, and was not sold in stores, but rather given away at the show (either to winners or to audience members, exactly what is unknown).", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 73488, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "scb-gsjDC8I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scb-gsjDC8I", "title": "610-6803 - Delisoba Deluxe JPN Sega Saturn - Satakore.com \u30c7\u30ea\u30bd\u30d0\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/scb-gsjDC8I/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
