The rogue machine is named Big Birtha for her ability to make copies of herself and install them on autonomous bots, giving them artificial life. Her objective originally was to help mankind create a sustainable future moving forward, but she somehow comes to the conclusion that all life must be destroyed to achieve sustainability. During this take down of humanity, most digital systems are hacked and rendered inoperable by Big Birtha, so the military is reduced to using old systems and to reestablish communications with allies all while fighting autonomous bots that are doing the will of Big Birtha.", "summary": "Artificial intelligence has plotted a path to a sustainable future, but humans aren't included. Defend humanity against the A.I. in this instant action tower defense, real-time strategy hybrid.\n\nDeterrence is a tower defense, real-time strategy hybrid that offers a midcore single-player experience. Play as the human race in the not-too-distant future and fight malfunctioning artificial intelligence. Choose your own conflicts in the nonlinear campaign that's complete with mission rewards and research tree.\n\nEach level is a puzzle to solve using strategy. Depending on your skill level, you will have to play an active role in helping your troops withstand the enemy onslaught whether that be repairing defenses, reallocating troops to another front, designating artillery strike zones, or destroying bridges.\n\nCommand your troops to victory by taking advantage of everything the battlefield has to offer. Garrison troops in civilian structures for quick defense. Build artillery batteries to pound enemy advances. Jam the enemy signals to gain an advantage. Call in air strikes, artillery strikes, and warheads to turn the tide of battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deterrence", "videos": [{"id": 103459, "name": "Teaser Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "qiWSlrBPw2A"}]}
