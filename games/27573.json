You can combine a soda can with a drumstick to unlock hi-hat sounds or search the hidden corners of the world and you might run across a character who will share a bassline with you.\n\nYou\u2019re equipped with a Sound Scanner to help you track down sounds. Rapidly hunt the desert for hidden objects by remote controlled \u201cRoboball\u201d with its first person camera.\n\nYou create new combinations of sounds with your portable holographic music mixer complete with volume faders and effects. After collecting all the sounds, you will perform a live show. If the audience likes it enough, you can advance to the next level.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
