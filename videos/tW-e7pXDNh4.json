The main plot asks questions about the consequences of life choices, of pursuing either career or true love, maneuvering between now and the past. You play Peter, a Cambridge academic who crashlands in Cold War Antarctica. As he searches for help, his past unwinds before him, revealing how the pressures of power and his own aspirations have led him into this crisis he must somehow escape. A love story between him and fellow academic Clara develops, and Peter learns the weight of all the things he has promised. Like memories from childhood, some promises stay with us forever.\n\nFollow us on:\nWeb: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3rpVmMh\nTwitch: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3vVI6CJ\nTwitter: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/3fdOUFK\nFacebook: \ud83d\udc49  https://bit.ly/2NWKVCw", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tW-e7pXDNh4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tW-e7pXDNh4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tW-e7pXDNh4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tW-e7pXDNh4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tW-e7pXDNh4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "South of the Circle | Release Trailer [GOG]", "description": "\u2705 Link to the game \ud83d\udc49 https://bit.ly/3vB9A1M\n\nSouth of the Circle is an emotional narrative experience with a deep multi-layered cinematic story.
