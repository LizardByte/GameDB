Then lay siege to your neighbors' castles and fight out land battles in tactical detail.", "summary": "The year is 1268, the English throne lies empty, and power-hungry lords are ready to wage war for newfound power. Your people now look to you to lead them to glory and prosperity.

Unify the land under your rule, and prove you have what it takes to be King.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lords-of-the-realm"}
