Waking up in a forest next to the wrecked bus, Murphy has a clear shot at freedom. He makes his way into the sleepy town of Silent Hill where mysterious locals welcome him into a slowly developing personal hell.", "summary": "Silent Hill: Downpour is the eighth Silent Hill video game installment and the last fully-released video game in the series. Just like its predecessors, Downpour combines exploring abandoned surroundings, talking to characters, and solving puzzles, set against a slow, psychological horror theme. Different from the previous game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is the return of combat. The player often has to fight off monsters using a variety of weapons, but he can carry only one melee and one ranged weapon who can deteriorate over time. Entirely new to the series is the introduction of a weather system: there is a full day and night cycle and rain often warns the player of danger that is approaching. It is possible to hide until the weather becomes better again.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/silent-hill-downpour", "videos": [{"id": 36240, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Mp0gm9rDLrI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp0gm9rDLrI", "title": "Silent Hill Downpour Gameplay Walkthrough Part 9 (No Commentary) HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mp0gm9rDLrI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119545, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zj1xwO6lBGY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj1xwO6lBGY", "title": "Silent Hill Downpour | E3 trailer (2011)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zj1xwO6lBGY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119528, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5LRNRkuDw20", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LRNRkuDw20", "title": "Silent Hill 8 E3 2010 Trailer (HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5LRNRkuDw20/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 63, "name": "Silent Hill"}]}
