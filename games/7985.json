There are also parts of this level in which you will control the spacecraft that involves side scrolling shoot em up gameplay.\n\nOut West pits Three-Fingered Hoek and Stimpy the Kid, in the role of horse thieves. You must guide the buckeroos through the outskirts of town, past the corrals, through the rusty frontier town and to the stables, where you'll find the sheriff's horse to steal.\n\nDuring Robin Hoek, Ren is the finest archer in all of Logwood Forest. Armed with trusty bow and turkey baster, you must make your way through the village and rescue the fair Maid Moron from the clutches of the evil sheriff, who is holding the maiden captive in his castle.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ren-and-stimpy-show-fire-dogs"}
