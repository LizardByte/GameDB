It would be a 2D platformer with 3D graphics, and one of the features announced would be a 4 player co-op. Even though the game was never released, many of its features would later be used in new games in the series, like the graphic style in the Return to Dreamland and the co-op in Star Allies.\n\nThis is one of three different iterations of Kirby games that were cancelled around the same time. The other ones are an isometric-view platformer and a pop-up style 2D platformer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 62525, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yy2l5BSBSL0"}]}
