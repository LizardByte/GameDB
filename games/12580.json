Your true love, Elisa, has been abducted by Necrilous the Not Very Nice, and imprisoned in his dark and formidable castle. To reach her, you must traverse enchanted woods, underground mines, jungle swamps, and snow-capped peaks, where bizarre, villainous creatures and devious puzzles will test your mettle every step of the way! \n \nFortunately, your magic ring can cast many spells, increasing in power as you tread deeper into the mystical lands of goons, goblins, and demons. You can even control some of the background game features, helping you get to where you think you should be. Numerous secret areas lie deep within the forest, where vital clues can aid your quest, but beware ... you own ghost may materialize to haunt you!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elf--1"}
