All controls were easy to reach and identify. Combined with the tricycle landing gear, this plane was truly a \"pilot's aircraft\" and was very easy to fly. It was stable and predictable, exactly what one would expect from a night fighter. The earlier versions were adequately powered by the Daimler-Benz DB 603A, and had good rates of climb and acceptable top speeds approaching 400 mph. Later versions of the He 219, however, were much heavier, and because the more advanced, powerful engines were in short supply, these variants suffered in performance.\n\nGround-based stations would direct the night fighter to the bomber stream, and when in range, the Uhu's radar operator would then take over and guide the pilot to within 100 meters of the target. The bristling antennae were ugly and added a lot of drag, substantially reducing the aircraft's ultimate top speed. Without the radar, however, the aircraft would have been useless at night, and since the Uhu was still about 150 mph faster than the enemy four-engine bombers, this wasn\u2019t much of a problem.", "summary": "Heinkel's He 219 Uhu, recreated for Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition, is undoubtedly one of the most advanced aircraft to emerge from World War II. Conceived solely as a gun platform to serve as a defensive night fighter, the Uhu featured a bubble-top cockpit that was placed well forward, affording the pilot superb visibility.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-steam-edition-heinkel-he219-uhu-owl"}
