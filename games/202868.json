The console itself is built into a very small joystick that can be carried on a keychain or keyring using the strap attached to it. The entire console is powered by only one AAA battery (sometimes included), and it comes in an assortment of eight different variations, each with its own color scheme and game selection. Each package contains only the console (which doubles as the controller) and a mini-USB mono A/V output cable.
