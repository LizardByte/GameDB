Without falsely advertising what the game is/looks like.\nThank you!!!\n\nBTW\nThis was made for a game jam, which means I had a month to make the game and also advertise it :)))))\nWhich of course, would have been easier if I had a larger team working on it haha, but I can't manage that many people.\nSo, if you also have any advice on how to uh.. OPTIMIZE video editing, let me know.\n(I use a free open source software called kdenlive because I don't edit enough to warrant paid software, but if I go down the path of editing more, I'll probably buy a license.)\n\n---\n\nGame and Trailer Music:\nFelidaeMelody\nhttps://www.felidaemelodyscampfire.com/\n\n---\n\nVoices:\nAnon ...............................
