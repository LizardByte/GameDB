Not so much the PS1 versions, but the PC series.\r\n\r\nThe Decent games are an interesting mixture of 3D space flight games, and first person shooters. You're enclosed in 3D maze levels, but are in a space craft that controls like it's in a space flight game. You've got 360 degree movement.

The original didn't give you the option, so it was easier to get lost. \r\n\r\nThis is another one that those who are prone to motion sickness from 3D games should avoid. Especially since it was an early PS1 3D game. Mix in the 360 degree movement with, early 3D visuals, and a framerate dips at times, and I can imagine this game can be quite disorienting at times.

It doesn't support the dual shock, but if you remember their old dual analog flight stick, it is supported in this game. Even without it, the game still controls very good using the face buttons to move, and the d-pad to aim.
