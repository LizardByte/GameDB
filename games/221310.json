Designed and programmed by Masatoshi Imaizumi and Masaki Ukyo, its systems are loosely similar to the Asuka 120% Burning Fest series, whose first entry was released later in 1994. There are three main versions: the X68000 and FM Towns games, developed by Fill-In Cafe themselves (the X68000 version has the subtitle Full Metal Forth, which was corrected to Full Metal Force in the FM Towns and later entries); the PC Engine CD port developed by Kogado; and the PlayStation version, again by Fill-In Cafe, which is more of a complete remake than a port.\n\nA conversion for the Mega Drive was in development and previewed, however it did not receive an official release to the public until Columbus Circle published it in September 2020.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mad-stalker-full-metal-forth", "videos": [{"id": 76164, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "U07mHfNtXD4"}]}
