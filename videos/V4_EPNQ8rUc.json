It makes far better use of the NES hardware with huge character sprites and better animations, fun and familiar music, and the controls are much easier to come to grips with.

It looks great, the sound is a big improvement over SF2's, and who can deny the appeal of beating a friend to a pulp with their favorite Mario characters, all in strangely charming 8-bit graphics?
