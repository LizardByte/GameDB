It's a story as old as time itself, which pops up occasionally even today (speaking of which, has anybody seen or talked to Mel Gibson lately?). A solid, decent fella starts conducting experiments on himself with less than desirable results - a violent inner monster is released; certain horrendous crimes are committed and so on and so forth. Jekyll's loyal friend Gabriel John Utterson finds himself in the unenviable position of having to prove the honorable Jekyll and despicable Hyde are one and the same.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde-the-strange-case"}
