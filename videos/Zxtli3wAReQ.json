The Dreamcast version is similar to the previous game NBA 2K1. The PS2 version had a different version from Dreamcast. On the PlayStation 2, the intro featured R.O.C. the Hip-Hop group on the intro, where Hip-Hop soloist LUNATIC was featured on the Dreamcast version. On the Dreamcast version, choosing a team on Exhibition, they show \"Home\" and \"Away\" on the screen. The PlayStation 2 version did not show these on the screen. The loading screen on the game shows a little Background music showing the title and the basketball on the PS2 version, but with the Dreamcast however, the loading had it very similar to NBA 2K1 with the background music with a crowd cheering in the ending. The starting of the game with the Dreamcast version shows \"Today's Game\" (like in the previous 2K games) whatever team you chose shows it there but with PS2 it not show this feature. The PS2 version only shows just the team and the logo. While playing Street courses (on PlayStation 2 version) shows a background music on the game while playing. On the Dreamcast version did not have BGM's but have SFX sounds on the background. On PS2 version, playing the practice mode shows a stadium like in \"Exhibition\" mode.
