This is similar to the console versions of the game, but different in many ways. The game is controlled with your feet for running in sports like 100m, and swimming in 100m Freestyle Swimming. The rotating sticks are used for throwing in Hammer Throw and Javelin Throw. It can also be used for tricks on the trampoline. Some games require you to jump on the machine, but primarily for Long Jump and Hurdles. Buttons are found on the joysticks for firing for precision sports like Archery and Rhythmic Gymnastics. You can play as every single character found in the console version, but there are no guest characters. You can only play one event at a time, or you have to put in more credits. There are also no Dream Events, and the three main sports from the console game are missing due to their complex control: Soccer/Football, Volleyball, and Rugby.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-and-sonic-at-the-rio-2016-olympic-games-arcade-edition", "videos": [{"id": 35077, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "y05gLkd9Ueg"}]}
