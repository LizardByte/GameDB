In this case, however, the battlefields are not 2D landscapes, but completely 3D mini-planets. The main idea is simple: 2-4 teams of animals (controlled by either human players or the computer) take it in turns as they try to destroy the enemy teams. The game is laden with well-know arcade elements (moving platforms, sinking blocks etc.) that further increase the challenge and fun factor of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/creature-conflict-the-clan-wars"}
