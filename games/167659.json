They specialize in the use of Stratagems and supportive fire. They are specially trained to receive enhanced air support.\nThe Specialist Pack contains:\n- The Specialist Uniform (Helmet, Armor, and Cape)\n- LAS-12 'Tanto': An ultra compact laser SMG with extremely limited range. The short focused beam is very powerful to compensate for the short engagement envelope.\n- Close Air Support: An 'Eagle' delivers a powerful strafing run followed by a pair of anti tank missiles. Effective at damaging almost all targets it does however have the drawback of being slightly unpredictable.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
