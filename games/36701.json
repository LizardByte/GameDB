But on a routine delivery to the remote floating continent of Ilvard, he finds himself ambushed by two dragon-riding ne\u2019er-do-wells who send his plane spiraling to the ground.\n\nFortunately for Ragna, his crash was witnessed by someone in a position to do something about it: vampire princess Alwen du Moonbria. Pulling the dying Ragna from the wreckage of his plane, Alwen forms a blood contract with him, saving his life in exchange for his services as her vassal.\n\nHer request is far from simple \u2013 Alwen needs Ragna\u2019s help both to recover her stolen magic, and to retake her castle, wrested from her mere weeks ago by villains unknown. Ragna\u2019s ready to ante up, but on one condition: instead of acting as Alwen\u2019s servant, he wants to undertake their adventure as equal partners...even though it could very well make the going tougher!\n\nSo begins the unlikely duo\u2019s trek across Ilvard. Along the way they\u2019ll meet the isle\u2019s strange and colorful residents, battle the minions of darkness, train pets, learn potent skills from a macho masked luchador, and discover the meaning of (slightly dysfunctional) friendship. Sure, the bad guys might have the upper hand, but luckily for Ragna and Alwen, they never saw a tag-team this weird coming!", "summary": "In a world where magic and technology exist side by side, vampire princess Alwen must reclaim her ancestral castle and her magic alongside her unlikely ally, treasure hunter Ragna Valentine.
