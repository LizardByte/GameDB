I'm really bad at playing this - even though I really tried I couldn't beat any opponent. At least it looks great for a Game that made it to the stores in 1988.\n\n\n\n\nabout \"Yet unreleased Gameplay Videos\":\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThere are still a few Games which didn`t make it to YouTube - hard to believe, but true. I just...DIG THEM OUT ! :) This is only Gameplayfootage to give you an overview of the Game (no longplay). It's simple and it's short - but if you're tired of the 50th Videoupload of \"Turrican\", \"The Last Ninja\" or \"R-Type\" in the Retro-Community on YouTube...maybe you'll find some Games you've never seen before...just over here.\n\nPlease keep in mind that YT-Videos are only shown in 25 frames per second. And there's always a massive re-encode done (double-trouble-mode: Videoeditor AND YouTube after the upload). So some of these unbelievable smooth running & good looking & awesome sounding Games - with 50 fps or more on NTSC - can`t be shown over here like if you're playing them for real. No matter if you're playing them on a real Hardware or an Emulator: the experience with gfx/sound/scrolling will be MUCH better than any YouTube-Video will ever be able to capture.\n\nRate & Subscribe & Whatever (yeah, you know the stuff :)) to keep them coming.
