It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters.\n\nThis game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/parodius-da-shinwa-kara-owarai-he--1", "videos": [{"id": 103413, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ub3ihFS5raI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3ihFS5raI", "title": "PC Engine Longplay [280] Parodius Da! ~Shinwa kara Owarai e~ (JP)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ub3ihFS5raI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
