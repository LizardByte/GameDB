Not only has the Archdruid disappeared, a darkness in the form of purple cysts has fallen upon the forest. It is up to Aava, the daughter of the Archdruid and her new-found companions Leonhard, a mysterious man with no past, and Oiko the mage, a dropout from the guild of Red Priests, to rescue the Archdruid and find out the truth behind the sinister events. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, a murderous maniac impersonating Leonhard is at loose in the forest\u2026.\n\nDruidstone: The Secret of the Menhir Forest is a labor of love from the makers of the critically acclaimed Legend of Grimrock series. Druidstone is a tactical, single-player, turn-based roleplaying game, which combines the best qualities of modern RPGs with the elegance of tactical boardgames. Every action, every turn counts as you control your party of heroes through handcrafted, challenging missions with varying objectives.\n\nDruidstone is set in a unique fantasy world, Elo Sphaera, filled with ancient, lush forests, standing stones, snow-topped mountains, deadly creatures and puzzle-ridden ruins. The epic story about love and death is centered around the main characters Leonhard, Aava and Oiko, who will along the way meet up with unexpected companions and villains, each with their unique personalities and abilities.\n\nGet ready to venture forth and uncover the secrets of the Menhir Forest!", "summary": "\"Druidstone: The Secret of the Menhir Forest is a fantasy roleplaying game, in which you play the role of a druid who has just been reincarnated. Who are you? How did you die? Your mind is foggy. You only know you are here for a reason. The forest called you here because it needs you.\n\nThe world of Druidstone is a vast procedurally generated forest where you explore ancient ruins, battle monsters with spells and swords, and meet interesting friends and foes. Battles will be fought on a two-dimensional grid using a tactical, turn-based battle system. Using your limited resources wisely is important for surviving in this dangerous world. You start the game barehanded, only clad in a simple cloak but as you discover the secrets of the Menhir Forest you will get more powerful and learn new abilities and battle tactics. At the heart of Druidstone is a gripping story which is told through the encounters and characters you will meet. Perhaps you will team up with an ally or two along the way?\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/druidstone-the-secret-of-the-menhir-forest", "videos": [{"id": 26861, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AS1iPHruPkE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS1iPHruPkE", "title": "Druidstone: The Secret of the Menhir Forest - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AS1iPHruPkE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 33102, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "kwD3FNP8NxI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwD3FNP8NxI", "title": "Druidstone: 15 Minutes of Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kwD3FNP8NxI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
