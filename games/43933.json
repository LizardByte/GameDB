Players are greeted with two options -- a friendly match and the tournament. The former is simply a single game against a friend or the computer. In both modes, players have the option to choose from 70 actual international teams complete with real rosters. \n \nThe real meat and potatoes lies within the tournament aspect. Once a team has been selected, the objective is to guide them to the World Cup -- the supreme objective in soccer. After a team plays three matches, the knock-out tournament begins. Weaker teams that are prone to losing are then dropped from the tournament as the quarterfinals begin.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alexi-lalas-international-soccer"}
