Cargo transportation will be carried out on one of the 4 cars to choose from, but in order for this choice to appear, you need to earn game coins to purchase new cars. The cars in the game are different: a pickup truck, a narrow truck, a mullion truck, and a large truck. Depending on the level, the player decides which car is more convenient for him to transport the cargo. \nThe player can improve the characteristics of the car: \n- power; \n- maximum speed; \n- controllability. \nAlso, the player can repaint the car in a different color! The game has 24 different levels to complete. Try to deliver all the cargo quickly and in complete safety.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cargo-transportation-low-poly"}
