However, when she arrives, she learns that her grandfather has already passed on, and the family manor converted to a museum. There she meets Sakuma, a middle school girl who tends to get herself in trouble; Officer Mochizuki, the cop who usually busts Sakuma; and Suga, the strange manager of the museum who only communicates in written memos. Suga grudgingly allows her to stay there for a while and research her family.", "summary": "Forest of Drizzling Rain is an exploration-based horror adventure game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
