I will never forget the state in which I arrived home, without three molars and eight teeth, without my engagement ring, without my leather jacket, of course without my money and thanks to the bologna sandwich I had in my shirt pocket, which miraculously lodged the bullet of someone I had never seen in my life.\n\nI didn't wait any longer, the next day I signed up for an ELITE SHOOTING course by correspondence, and three months later I went to a friend's store to buy a pistol, and since he was a friend he gave me a 15% discount. So, today, I feel safer walking around CRAZY PARK.\n\nThis is my case, if I were you I would think about going for a walk or walking the dog in such a place without an automatic pistol, but you know, everyone can do what they want.", "summary": "Light Gun shooter game released on 1989 by Opera Soft. This game was meant to be played with the Gunstick! light gun that was sold when the game was released.\n\nIn this Operativon Wolf-like game, the game runs through CRAZY PARK, where you must aim and shoot the criminals, being careful, not to shoot innocent people. If you eliminate them they will take away valuable points.\n\nDuring the game some machine guns will appear that will give you more ammunition and a few moments of free bullets.\n\nThere is a multiplayer game option, where you compete with your partner to get more points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trigger", "videos": [{"id": 96581, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "unNdycOi83Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unNdycOi83Q", "title": "Trigger (1989) PC FPS Rail Side Scrolling Shooter", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/unNdycOi83Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
