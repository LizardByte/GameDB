Every nation has their own planet in the galaxy, except America. The United States is a banned entity and it is a galactic felony to ever mention the U.S.\n\nA Christian Empire rules the galaxy with an iron fist, lead by \"God\" who is emperor of the galaxy.\n\nA disgraced admiral of this empire, Lyle, who is responsible for the deaths of millions, is exiled to the ruins of Earth as eternal punishment.\n\nThe admiral, along with Queen Phala and the emperor, are \"Crutarchs\", immensely powerful psionic beings that also happen to be immortal. Other crutarchs in the galaxy are unsure if they exhibit this \"gift\" or curse.\n\nThe conflict of this story begins when Lyle discovers that the United States was in fact a real nation at one point in history and decides to start a \"Nationalist\" rebellion. In doing so, he and those in the galaxy who are foolish enough to follow him must confront the truth of what faith, Christianity, empathy, and freedom truly mean.", "summary": "A multifaceted PVP multiplayer arena shooter using traditional dedicated servers for massive 30+ vs. 30+ pvp battles.
