A week later, Dr. Tina Byers, a scientist at Disch Corp, receives an alarming transmission from a long-abandoned place known as Fortress Il'Akab (nicknamed the Fortress of Peril).

Dr. Byers calls in Timmy to infiltrate the fortress and put a stop to the group's plans. Armed with a prototype battle suit and magic gloves, Timmy flies off in his ship and heads into the action.", "summary": "Battle Kid: Fortress Of Peril is a homebrew 2D platform video game, released in February 2010 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, created by Sivak Games, and published through Retrozone with the cover art designed by Larry Bundy Jr. Unlike most games in the modern era, Battle Kid is available for purchase only on a physical NES cartridge. While there has been a demand for a downloadable version, the developer has stated that the game is currently not planned to be released on any other formats due to a contract with Retrozone.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
