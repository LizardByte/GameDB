For fans of Deus Vult and Alien Vendetta. There are only two difficulty settings: Normal (easy and medium) and hard.The most noticable areas of difficulty change is in key areas, such as replacing an archville with a baron of hell (for example). Normal difficulty is a toned down version while Ultra Violence is what makes VV fun. My advice is to play it on UV, and if it proves too much, play it on normal. However, Map06 in particular is quite hard on UV.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vae-victus"}
