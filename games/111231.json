In addition, it is probable that you will encounter a number of UNKNOWN HAZARDS that will challenge your determination. Remember that you WILL NOT have access to WEAPONS, so be prepared to FLEE if necessary. It is important that you manage to HACK the electronic devices you find to determine what happened to the crew. In addition, you may need to extract the security PASSWORDS for each level. \n \nWe look forward to your report. Good luck, detective.
