Ann lives through this terrible accident and wakes up with amnesia in a prince\u2019s palace. That is how her extraordinary journey begins. The numerous puzzles and mind-teasers throughout the game have been completely reworked and now offer an original and intuitive gameplay that takes advantage of the Nintendo DS functions.
