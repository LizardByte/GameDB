It includes elements and characters from planned but now-cancelled projects like Sinners and Slaves and The Siege of Firebase Zulu. It is a lean project that I produced in a few weeks, so it is free of side quests and the usual array of dialogue options. It is tight and relatively brief, but it should provide a greater sense of closure for several characters and the series as a whole.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-better-angels", "videos": [{"id": 104048, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "S20FouAWn7Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S20FouAWn7Q", "title": "Fallout: New Vegas - The Better Angels", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S20FouAWn7Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
