Most of the action is depicted NBA Jam style, with a horizontal view of the court and large sprites for the athletes. Upon scoring a field goal from up close (slam dunks or otherwise), the camera briefly changes to a dynamic shot of the basket.\n\nThe game was developed by C-Lab and published by Sammy Studios exclusively in Japan.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-dunk-star"}
