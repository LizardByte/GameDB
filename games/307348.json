However, their great pride remained unshaken.\n\nWith the capital Edhegland besieged, the dark elves struck a deal with the orcs. Nevertheless, they soon learned that no treaty holds when pure hatred is involved. Many elves fell, but some fled south to survive the relentless war.\n\nThe conflict finally ended when a human named Gery Elles, the fire sage, burned down the great Lothelye forest, creating a desert in its place, though it consumed hundreds of innocent lives. A curse had been cast.\n\nFor seven years, peace reigned. The annual celebrations were in full swing when, suddenly, orcs, goblins, and trolls, driven by bloodlust and even more hatred, appeared in the South to resume the war.", "summary": "Frond Online will be a game in the acclaimed MMORPG style, developed in Unreal Engine 5. It will feature a 3D view. Players will need to evolve their characters to explore increasingly challenging areas. Player characters must enhance their attributes and skills as they gain experience and levels, as well as acquire new equipment and relics scattered throughout the world. Each player can join groups and/or guilds, meeting new people or playing with friends, to develop and explore the world together.
