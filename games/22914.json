Basically controlling a cutting edge U.S. Aviation based armed forces stream through ten levels, players must take out adversary jet fighters while withstanding enemy ships.\n\nAirplanes that can be picked include the F-14 Tomcat, the F-117A Nighthawk covertness contender, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the Soviet-made MiG-29 Fulcrum. Players can either commit themselves to a long career mode, take part in a snappy air battle meeting, or go on a bombarding run. Passwords help store the player's advancement in career mode.\n\nBecause of different constraints found on the first Game Boy framework, the player can just observe and battle against two enemy airplanes at once.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/top-gun-guts-and-glory", "videos": [{"id": 48992, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IvhSBm1ram4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvhSBm1ram4", "title": "Top Gun: Guts and Glory [GB] - Real Time Longplay (No death)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IvhSBm1ram4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
