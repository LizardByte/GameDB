Slightly confused and disoriented, Simon escapes the temple with the help of his new fairy godmother.\n\nOnce again explore with Simon a vast fantastical world and help him find a way back home by uncovering the secrets of 'The Nexus'. Do this before your arch nemesis, Sordid, can use its power for more evil means.\n\nMeet up with favorite characters once more such as The Swampling, Calypso and the Woodworm! Enjoy over 40 hours of gameplay filled with ribald jokes, sly humour and 'off the cuff' quips.\n\nThis is full \"talkie\" version of the game. You can turn the subtitles on if you prefer subtitled version.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simon-the-sorcerer-3d", "collections": [{"id": 53, "name": "Simon the Sorcerer"}]}
