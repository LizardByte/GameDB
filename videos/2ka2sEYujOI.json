Second - I have a baby on the way :O So, yeah, this year is going to be very special for me!\n\nThis trailer is done in preparation for my very first GDC I'm going to attend in March, so if you plan to go there, try to find me in the crowd - I'll have exclusive Cold Hearts fridge magnets with me!\n\nHope you're all doing okay, fam, miss ya! Remember you can always catch me on Twitch, where I stream very often, and I'll eventually be back to YouTube - especially after the devil spawn is born, as recording will be way easier than streaming then (at least... I think so?) :) \n\nCheers!\n\nTRAILER CREDITS\nArt & animation - Outstar\n\nMusic - \u3075\u3046\u304b \u307e\u308a\u3092 - A wandering minstrel \nWords: Fuuka Mariwo \nMusic: Souichi Sakagami \nVocal: Fuuka Mariwo\nhttps://www.tandess.com\n\nCredits for external assets used:\nAllDesignCreative.Com\nGreen Screen Alpha\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCycpldDu5UIesTdj_IO0D3A\nDuck Duck TV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpF2HT3G_A1LMQfZfvdXWeQ", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ka2sEYujOI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ka2sEYujOI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ka2sEYujOI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ka2sEYujOI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "COLD HEARTS (GDC Trailer) - Visual Novel About Romancing Refrigerators", "description": "ADD TO YOUR WISHLIST: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1035840/Cold_Hearts\nPLAY DEMO NOW: https://outstar.itch.io/cold-hearts-demo \nIt's free to stream/record/share with others! :) \n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm sorry for being silent for a while, but as you can see, I was quite busy! :) It seems like I'm not releasing one, but TWO things this year - first, this game, our passion project, a visual novel I've been working on for years now with my best friend Memoriesin8bit (Tower of Guns, Mothergunship).
