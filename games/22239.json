The game introduced two new characters and adjusted every other character as well. The two new characters were the Judoka-assassin, Goh Hinogami and the Muay Thai boxer Brad Burns. With the addition of Brad Burns, Vanessa Lewis's alternate Muay Thai style from Virtua Fighter 4 was removed and replaced with a Vale Tudo \"Offensive\" style; making her a solely Vale Tudo brawler.\n\nAll of the stages were adjusted. For example, Lei-Fei's stage in Virtua Fighter 4 previously took place during sunset, in Evolution it takes place during the morning.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/virtua-fighter-4-evolution", "videos": [{"id": 37651, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZqN4vnhwoxc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqN4vnhwoxc", "title": "Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution playthrough (PS2) (1CC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZqN4vnhwoxc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
