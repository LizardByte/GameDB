With a revolution from the Boozooks looming, the government steps in and sends BigWig to kidnap the professor. Azimuth hides his adopted son, Woodruff just before. Dragged away, Woodruff is left alone in a world he doesn't understand and on a quest to find the professor and solve the mystery of the Schnibble and save the Boozook civilization from complete annihilation.\n\nIn classic Coktel Vision style, this is a pixel-hunting puzzle adventure game with bizarre characters and even weirder riddles.
