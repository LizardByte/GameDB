The game also uses a password system to track your progress. The game also shifts to an overhead map so you can wander to whichever level you wish, and return to completed levels to earn more money or power-ups.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/joe-and-mac-2-lost-in-the-tropics", "videos": [{"id": 55133, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "S6FELqeX5UM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6FELqeX5UM", "title": "Joe & Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S6FELqeX5UM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
