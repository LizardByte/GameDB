The character you control \u2013 Frank \u2013 is about to change that.\n\nAs Frank you can freely roam the city in search of nude pictures of women. Certain women are more than willing to repay you with one naked picture of theirs if necessary conditions are met (like for example giving them a certain item) but chances are that some pictures can be found in the most unlikely places as well. Frank starts with a medium health bar and a sum of money. Health points which are lost if hit by a car can be replenished by eating food. Money are needed to bribe women so as to get a picture of them or for buying items that the women may request to trade for one of their pictures. More money can be gained by either playing games in the casino or by selling the pictures you have already acquired to the boss of the Boobs Illustrated magazine.", "summary": "Frank's Adventure is an adult top-down indie Flash game by Mausland Entertainment from 2003.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/franks-adventure"}
