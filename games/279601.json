Its main game mechanics are body motion and interactive storytelling as well as conscious moments of intention setting and stillness.\n\nThe players are guided through the wastelands of human civilization, ventured into the Unknown and rewarded with a sense of one-ness and community. A mindful Onboarding and Offboarding leading in and out of the journey can be downloaded for free on the website as well as a variety of educational content for teachers and workshop hosts in the fields of VR and climate psychology: \n\nOur intention is to nurture a healthy relationship between humans, non-humans and technology, to foster synergies between art, education, game design and embodied practices (such as Gestalt Therapy or Somatic Experiencing), and ultimately to inspire the players to (re)connect and listen to their inner wisdom.", "summary": "A VR journey that brings you closer to Nature.
