Things are going well for the development but it is taking slightly longer to do things as we're finding new ways to give you the best experience possible for the eventual release.\n\nWe've mostly been working on other things other than Operation Blackout however, we don't want to show too much too keep you surprised on what the campaign entails so here is an uncut gameplay of Operation Blackout in VR.\n\nIt's currently running in UE4 Editor itself so the performance and framerate is slightly lower than intended compared to the packaged version. Currently it is running on medium settings.\n\nHopefully in the future, we can show you a few more things with the game overall improvements which some you may be able to observe in this video, and show more of Conquest mode once we've focused development on that aspect.\n\nPlay the current alpha here! https://rb-d2.itch.io/wingman\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/RB_Dev2\nKickstarter Page (Goal Met!
