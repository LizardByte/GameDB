Despite being easy to learn it is complex and includes deep strategy. Each player has to plan and conform to every situation and control a team that they assemble, while their goal is to kill the enemy forces and enemy hero. Every player has an attack and movement right for a turn. We have 4 different heroes with unique ultimate skills but the same minions with the same abilities. Every minion has a different attack and movement range.\n\nPlayers need to create their own deck according to their own playing strategy and use created decks depending upon turn and mana system.\n\nNote : We have only worked on the game mechanics and we are still working on the animation, models and effects. According to our Kickstarter campaign, we will excel in this area as well.\n\nSteam Page: https://kumkuat.net/trailer", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nXtxTeN2kE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nXtxTeN2kE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nXtxTeN2kE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nXtxTeN2kE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nXtxTeN2kE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Age Of Cards - First Trailer", "description": "Are you looking for a card game without a pay-to-win structure, not tied to a META, where you can strategize without limits?\n\nRa\u2019s Chess is a strategic chess card game for online multiplayer between two players.
