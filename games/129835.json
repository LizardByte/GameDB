The animals respond with movement and their corresponding animal sound as the controllers vibrate.\n\nIn addition, you can walk into a sunflower field and atop a hill overlooking the entire farm. Also, there are butterflies all over, some which land in the palm of your hand! Current updates are underway which will make it even more interactive including the ability to feed the animals.
