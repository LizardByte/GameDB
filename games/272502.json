The workers have been transformed into strange mutants, and the machines, possessed by wild energy, harass any intruder who dares to invade the reactor.\n\nIn this video-adventure you will have to control Bowls and, immersed in your anti-radiation armor, you will have to use the objects distributed around the plant to rebuild the reactor, feed it with fuel, and start it up from the control room. To do this, you must first perform a series of tasks related to the achievement of your goal; all within a time limit, in anticipation of the final destruction of the plant because of its excessively prolonged exposure to radiation.\n\nIn your Bowls backpack you can carry up to three objects, and a limited amount of heavy water, which will serve to provide you with energy for your defensive weapon.\n\nNow relax, forget your nerves and gather all the cold blood you can, because you are about to dive into the fascinating universe of NUCLEAR BOWLS.
