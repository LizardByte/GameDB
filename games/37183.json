Furthermore, if there is more than one consonant in the puzzle, your $1000 will be multiplied (e.g. four R's in a puzzle awards you with $4000). Each vowel you buy will cost you $250, however, you will not lose more than $250 even if there is more than one single vowel in a puzzle (e.g. if there are three A's in a puzzle you will not lose $750). But you will still lose $250 if you guess a vowel incorrectly. If the wheel lands on \"Bankrupt\" you will lose all your money (however, the money you carried over from round 1 will not be lost). If the wheel lands on \"Lose a Turn,\" the turn goes to the other contestant. If the wheel lands on \"Free Spin,\" you can spin again. This option is one way to keep you in the lead.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wheel-of-fortune--13"}
