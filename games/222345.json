Additionally, all ways to get new humanoid party members have been disabled, the player needs to make do with only monsters and the two starting humanoid party members.\n\nA new system to learn abilities is implemented, similarly to the original Final Fantasy Tactics the units will earn JP which they can spend directly on purchasing abilities. This is the only way the player has to teach new abilities to the monsters.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-advanced-battle"}
