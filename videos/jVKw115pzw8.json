It was published by DreamCatcher Interactive and developed by Polish game studio People Can Fly. It attempts to replicate the \"old-school FPS\" gameplay of Doom and Quake. It has 24 levels of seemingly unconnected designs that include medieval castles, factories and lunatic asylums. Five of the levels are \"boss levels\" with some of the largest FPS bosses to date. The game takes place in Purgatory and Hell. It is notable for using the Havok 2.0 physics engine extensively. The main character, Daniel Garner, is voiced by Cam Clarke.The game is inspired by such classic titles as Quake and Doom, with the emphasis on killing big amounts of monsters. The game is divided into five chapters, each about eight levels long. The player's objective is to get through each level, from start to finish, by slaughtering hundreds of monsters. One of the game's most important aspects was its diversity. Each level presented a new location with various themes and art styles. The levels included castles, monasteries, an opera house, Venice, graveyards, and more. Monsters were also very different, with a new ones almost every level. There were special five levels where player had to combat a boss. The game presented an option to complete a special task each level, which will result in player getting a \"tarot card\", a rare, hard-to-obtain bonus. The tarot card menu was available from level select screen, and each equipped card provided different bonuses for a small amount of time, like powered-up weapons or slow motion. The game featured multiplayer, which included classic modes like Deathmatch or capture-the-flag.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jVKw115pzw8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jVKw115pzw8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jVKw115pzw8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Painkiller Redemption - Trailer", "description": "Painkiller is a first-person shooter video game released on April 12, 2004.
