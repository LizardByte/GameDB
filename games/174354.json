Pretty to look at but difficult to master. Flying in space is not like flying a plane. A small wrong movement can send you in a collision path and the stress of how to quickly recover while keeping the valuable electricity and fuel resources. Challenge yourself to master Inertial Flight in space where there is no up or down and there is nowhere to hang on to if you loose control. The difference between life and death is the oxygen in your suit and the nitrogen in your jetpack. It might be beautiful but who said that floating in space was easy?", "summary": "Astronaut Spacewalk is a highly realistic astronaut jetpack simulator. Fly the Manned Manouvering Unit from the Space Shuttle cargo bay to several satellites, align into position to make repairs and dock back into the Shuttle. Fly the jetpack in 20 daring missions where you have to rendezvous with different satellites from the smaller TDRS and Solar Maximum, medium sized like the Magellan and Galileo probes, to the big Skylab, Hubble telescope and Russian MIR station.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/astronaut-spacewalk"}
