This mod sets out to solve that problem. Instead of a few skeletal tribes, \"Reborn\" is full of factions, including an all-new elite centuria of Caesar's Legion on the hunt for Graham, a camp full of New Canaanites, drugged fanatics who worship Graham, and fascinating new tribes.\n\nWritten and created by award-winning playwright Ted S. Bushman, Honest Hearts Reborn will feature over two dozen completely voiced characters, three new companions, and more than a dozen gripping new quests where the Courier will decide the fate of Zion--and Joshua Graham's soul.\n\nmusic: \"Indian Summer\", Jonsi & Alex", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pqFmoX53hyw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pqFmoX53hyw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pqFmoX53hyw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Honest Hearts Reborn - Official Trailer 2", "description": "\"Honest Hearts Reborn\" is an upcoming Fallout: New Vegas mod inspired by the story of Joshua Graham.\n\nDid you ever feel that the story of the Honest Hearts DLC didn't live up to the potential of its gorgeous setting and fascinating main character?
