Rise up through the ranks and win prestigious awards or just focus on making it home in one piece; it's up to you. \n\nThis is a unique single-player game with RPG elements, extensive usage of attribute and skill checks, a turn-based combat system involving many variables (including morale, reach, confined space and high ground) and a touch of roguelike features. Among them, permadeath. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it means you'll have to start over if your character dies; but don't worry: the game is designed to be replayable and you'll see only a fraction of it in each run. Also, you'll be able to spend points on your next legionary based on how well your most successful characters performed.\n\nLearn more: https://legionaryslife.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MHlQeNGVA9M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MHlQeNGVA9M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MHlQeNGVA9M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MHlQeNGVA9M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MHlQeNGVA9M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "A Legionary's Life - Trailer", "description": "Available on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1058430/A_Legionarys_Life/\n\nA Legionary's Life lets you play as a Roman soldier during the years of the Second Punic War and beyond.
