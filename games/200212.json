Many suffer from the Failing Sickness, brought on by an unusually wet and cold summer. Loch Linmore is swollen to twice its size. Some monks at Bidewell Abbey in the north suffer collective possession and are confined, raving, to their cells. The path to Bidewell is filled with mist. Village children have disappeared. Some, like his Court Astrologer, blame the Abbess of Bidewell Abbey. They claim she is a witch. Some say it's the devilish Olc Mhor's work. You have come with great recommendations and are tasked to remove the curse so his people can be free.", "summary": "The Quest: Curse of Linmore is an expansion to The Quest, a beautifully hand-drawn open world role playing game with old school grid-based movement and turn based combat.\n\nAfter enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and adventures.
