They were offered as a part of Happy Meals for a limited time in 2003. There are two main buttons on the game which control left and right movement.\n\nSonic controls a F-1 racecar and must navigate through a race course filled with other drivers. There are three lanes that can be moved about with one lane always left open. The other lanes are occupied by other vehicles. For each row of vehicles avoided a point is added to the score. For every 30 points the level and speed increase with 4 levels total. If the player crashes 5 times in a single level the game ends.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-speedway"}
