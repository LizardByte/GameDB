The game features a cast of unusual characters including Dr. Muto's sidekick, Janky, and his nemesis, Professor Burnital. By simply sampling some DNA, the doctor can morph into a spider, mouse, gorilla, or whatever creature he sees fit to become. Now he must use his fiendish gadgets and morphing ability to steal organic matter from the neighboring planets in order to rebuild his world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dr-muto", "videos": [{"id": 87988, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vSju9QaahHs"}, {"id": 87989, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rpPFf_DVJH4"}]}
