The game is a high speed auto-runner with a satisfying double-jump mechanic played in landscape mode with both hands. \n \nThe game features minimal, yet colourful aesthetics, with upbeat music and nice sound effects. There are no virtual controls visible on screen, instead the player taps on either side of the display to control the avatar. \n \nThe goal of the game is to pick up items while traversing the track to reach the finish line. The items picked up are used to unlock more tracks. Reaching the goal will require the avatar to jump over obstacles while at all times ensuring that the colour of the avatar matches the colour of the running surface. The latter mechanic is what makes this runner somewhat unique. Many of the tracks feature two or more paths to the goal, which increases the longevity of the game. \n \nFirst launch opens directly on the first track, which is used to teach how to switch colour mid-air while jumping to prevent the avatar from exploding. After the tutorial is completed, you are taken to the menu where the first track is unlocked. \n \nThe game consists of a series of grouped tracks which have to be unlocked by collecting enough chameleons - found along the tracks. The number of chameleons required to progress is shown on screen while in the menu. \n \nAs of writing the game is available to iOS, Android and Windows mobile phones, as well as tvOS (Apple TV).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 18139, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DrIAedC-wJY"}]}
