This game introduces innovative block physics. The mechanics are as simple and pure as it can get for their purpose. The game introduces all of its main mechanics early on instead of accumulating new systems you have to learn. So the challenge is to get better in what you are already using, like in chess.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trapthem"}
