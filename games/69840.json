It offers a blend of action, infiltration and adventure in a medieval universe. Sneaking between homes and past sleeping guards, players will need to keep themselves from being spotted, hopping from ledge to ledge and from roof to roof, picking locks, striking the enemy, gleaning and stealing information without the enemy knowing : these are the kind of actions that will bring players closer to discovering the hiding place of the Templar knights\u2019 treasure. Players are also given different means of exploring and moving around in total secrecy: creeping silently and hiding in shadows. There are riddles closely linked to the scenario which they will need to solve over the course of their adventure: finding and opening passageways, gathering objects and using them wisely.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/inquisition"}
