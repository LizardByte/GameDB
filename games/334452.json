Keep track of the timebar at the bottom of the screen, time your moves right.\nThere are multiple routes to the pool, keep exploring if you get stuck or frustrated at a section of the map.\nTrampolines are a tricky, patience pays off. Try not to rush out of the first explosion after touching one. After the first explosion, the bounce rhythm balances out.\nThere are 3 bomb \"keys\" (red, green, blue). These allow you to destroy colored bricks.\nYellow Coins: $1, Platinum Coins: $5, Green Coins: $20\nThe only purpose of crouching is to move the camera down (and to look cute, actually).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boomby--1", "videos": [{"id": 142349, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "6lre8IHuk_c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lre8IHuk_c", "title": "Pico Playtime: Boomby", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6lre8IHuk_c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
