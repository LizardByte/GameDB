It is based on a British comic magazine VIZ which, like the game, features lots of crude humour and fart jokes. The player controls one of the 3 Viz characters - Johnny Fartpants, Buster Gonad, or Biffa Bacon. The race takes place in five different scrolling environments; country, town, building site, beach and a disco. During the race you have to dodge traps and other characters from the VIZ comics.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/viz-the-game"}
