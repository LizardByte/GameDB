Our goal is to take him safely to different parts of the city while avoiding the hordes of fans who will try to capture him on the hunt of a selfie or a formal wedding request (or more explicit requests). \n\nInspired by games like Overcooked or Untitled Goose Game and parodying Left 4 Dead 2 and other zombie and survivals classic games, Hell of Fame is a casual and humorous action game where the most important thing is to make right decisions as soon as possible and, above all, never stay still. William will have different skills to get rid of his fans and move around the city. He will be able to make selfies, push fans and even throw his clothes until he is in his underwear.\n\nDeveloped by Broken Frame for PC.
