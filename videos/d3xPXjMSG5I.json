Guess this is the game I came up with within a development time of 72 hours. So AGDQ 2019 just concluded, and during that time, my world record for Pringles speedruns has been taken over. Realizing that the power cord for my Sega Genesis is busted, I decided to create a game similar to Pringles to show my love for Pringles. I love Pringles so much. It's way better than Lays potato chips. Once you pop, you just can't stop. And that's why in this game, once you stomp, you just can't stop. Bounce on cockroaches without touching the ground. It's a life or death situation! Are you ready, or are you gonna keep sitting there staring at that Sumireko roach doujin by Harasaki? Or are you just going to keep playing Mafia City? I wish I could be making more Mafia City memes rather than doing these dumb indie game development projects.\n\nIt\u2019s the Nutshack! (Yo!) (Yee, yee)\n\nIt\u2019s the Nutshack!
