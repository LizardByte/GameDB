A 25th anniversary Edition, limited to 2000 copies, has been released for SNES.\n\nJim wasn't always a studly super-worm. He was once just a spineless, dirt-eater with no real mission in his life...\n\nBut then something unexpected happened. The evil Psy-Crow was transporting a super suit, built by the genius Professor Monkey-For-A-Head, to Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed, Slug-For-A-Butt, but along the way it was stolen by a rebel. Although Psy-Crow killed the rebel, the suit fell down to Earth, landing on an Earth Worm. That cosmic twist of fate placed Jim in control of an ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit.\n\nAnyway, Earthworm Jim found out that Princess What's-Her-Name had been captured and set out to save her. Meanwhile, there's a bounty on Jimmy and plenty of people are in line to take Queen Slug-For-A-Butt up on her offer.\n\nNow Jim must make it to the princess and stay clear of Psy-Crow, the intergalactic bounty hunter, until the final battle with Queen Slug-For-A-Butt. To accomplish this, you'll have to use every weapon and ability at your disposal to wriggle your way through dozens of original and just plain weird levels.\nDiverse levels and gameplay modes that provide an unmatched platforming experience\nGreat music and amusing sound effects\nLoads of good humor and fun, often bordering on the disturbing", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/earthworm-jim-1-and-2-the-whole-can-o-worms", "videos": [{"id": 41910, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-s3-FYVh6dM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s3-FYVh6dM", "title": "Earth Worm Jim 1 & 2 | Gameplay [PC]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-s3-FYVh6dM/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 604, "name": "Earthworm Jim"}]}
