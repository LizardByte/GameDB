But obviously you will have to save your strength to avoid being unarmed in front of the players who decide to confront you.\nYou will also have the extra help of the \"Scavengers\" that you can summon at certain points of the map and that will keep the survivors \"busy\" while you carry out your evil plans.\n\nWill you accept the challenge to become a true legend?", "summary": "Equip yourself with the best weapons and get ready to face your worst fears...
