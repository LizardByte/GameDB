But be careful about how much you press your client and how you word your accusations, or you might not see the next day.\n\nWhen the client is nervous, your hound instincts will kick in. Will you press forward and try to get the truth, or will you direct the conversation in more subtle ways? Discover who, how, and why, and give the right answers when the time comes.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/old-hound-of-baker-street"}
