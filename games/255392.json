The Spell must be kept energized for the duration of the stage, when a Portal is opened to save the aliens on that Planet. The player will visit different planets, each with their own mechanics and peculiar inhabitants.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wizavior", "videos": [{"id": 93031, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "iGOUS0az-54", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGOUS0az-54", "title": "Wizavior - Teaser trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iGOUS0az-54/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
