Each snake can have own color, programmed AI, and it is password-protected. Training is concluded in pre-defining the nine schemes of possible snake behaviours on the battlefield. The player does not control the snake directly. Each match requires up to four snakes on the battlefield, and the goal of each snake is to eat the tail of another snake. With each eaten tail the snake is increased, and the snake without tail is reduced. The winner of the match is a snake with a greater length.\n\nThe game was released only in Russia.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snake-battle"}
