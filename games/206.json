Trials of Obi-Wan includes more than 50 new quests, from rescue missions to the exploration of a crashed Republic cruiser. Many quests also revolve around the return of HK-47 from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, whom players can kill for a quest.\n\nThe expansion also allows players to interact with the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi to help him \"correct an imbalance in the Force\" present on Mustafar. High-level quest rewards include the ability to find a fiery red crystal found only on the volcanic planet that creates a lava-like lightsaber.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-galaxies-trials-of-obi-wan", "videos": [{"id": 477, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "QW3lxg2mgnI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW3lxg2mgnI", "title": "2005 - Star Wars Galaxies Trials of Obi-Wan: Tr\u00e1iler 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QW3lxg2mgnI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
