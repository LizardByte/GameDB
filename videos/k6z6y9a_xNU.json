Without a firm to provide sponsorship, you must strike out as a solo contractor for the NCR. As such, you are no longer obligated to follow a linear questline, but may pursue dozens of bounties in any order. \n\nYour targets will include terrorists, duelists, fiends, traitors, rapists, and more! As in episode I, most of the named adversaries are boss-caliber, and make use of perks, powerful weapons, and countless cronies to thwart your efforts. \n\nLike its predecessor, NVB II contains a healthy dose of profanity and violence. Nonetheless, it includes substantially more dialogue options, as well as choices that should accommodate players at both ends of the karma spectrum.\n\nRelease Date: April 1, 2011\nGenre: Action role-playing\nPlatforms: Windows\nPublisher: Someguy2000\nDeveloper: Someguy2000\n\nMy Xbox360 gamertag: Shad0wx54x\n\nWanna see more of my fantastic walkthroughs?
