Somewhere, a bald man robot may or may not be involved.\n\nThis is a compilation of Mega Man X to X4.  In my opinion, this is the stronger of the Legacy Collection games, with X3 being the weakest of the games (only because I'm not too fond of it due to difficulty and useless weapons and buster upgrade.)  Oh, and this collection uses the SNES version of X3, not the CD version (aka PS1, PC, and Saturn).  Other goodies added to the compilation are a 2-on-1 boss rush called X Challenge, an option to toggle either the English or Japanese version of X games, and Rookie Hunter mode for when the game gets tough.\n\nThis series of longplays go for 100% in X to X4 while wasting time trying to do speedrun tech, like despawning robot birds in Armadillo.  There are deaths aplenty and weakness abuse.  I also switch up presentations for the games, like having X with smooth graphics filling up the window and X3 with CRT scanlines. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHZEH5WFRY0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHZEH5WFRY0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHZEH5WFRY0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHZEH5WFRY0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cHZEH5WFRY0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "PC Longplay [1106] Mega Man X: Legacy Collection (Part 1 of 5)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Tsunao\n\nPlatformer by Capcom.\n\nFollow a blue robot as he commits robot-on-robot violence.
