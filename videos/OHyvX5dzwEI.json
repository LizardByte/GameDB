Raku Raku (Breezy) ends after 3 seals.\r\n\r\nThis is, without doubt, THE rarest TurboChip/HuCard available, next to Sapphire and Darius Alpha!\r\nI used the Japanese version of the game, and yes, there are some changes, like a few graphical changes. That, and I can't find a good dump of the (U) version.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are incredibly colorful and vibrant, with a whole jug of cuteness added for taste!\r\n\r\nThe music in the game is freaking epic, so much so, I decided to record all of them, almost all of them from the hidden Sound Test (Left, Down, Right, Up, Select x3, Left, Right, II), except for the Waku Waku/Doki Doki (Rough) ending, which I recorded from the HES. Here, have a listen! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRc8sLvstY\r\n\r\nThe controls are smooth, but the control of the twin stars takes some time. You press I when not shooting to set the position of the stars, I while shooting locks the stars in the direction they are facing.\r\n\r\nYou can buy spells, extra heart containers, elixirs (Replenishes all health when depleted), power-ups and brooms for speed with all the crystals you find from enemies and cleared stages.\r\n\r\nThere are spells in the game, one that restores 2 hearts, one that eliminates all enemies, and one that destroys all bullets. How to use it? Tap II twice.\r\n\r\nIt was later ported to Game Boy Color as Magical Chase GB in 2000.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the longplay, despite how much I suck at cute-em-ups.
