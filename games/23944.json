They poisoned our food supplies and made the waters toxic. We escaped to the mountains but the damage had been done Having ingested the poisonous fruits we now suffer from explosive flatulence ... But our weakness will become our greatest weapon!Overflowing with humor and flatulent rebellion, Orc Attack is a third-person cooperative beat-em-up. Hilarious enemies and highly-tuned combat highlight this gross but charming game following four brutish and bloated orcs as they unleash their nasty killer moves in four-player battles. Move up through the ranks and advance your skills -- use solo combo attacks to outflank and harm your enemies, or work together to deal out even more damage! With every attack, you become more powerful, and as you add power to your rank class, your stronger weapons let you break wood, metal and stone. Use Dirty Mode\\'s fart and burp attack to shoot flames, acid or ice at enemies. Ignite the air around you in mass explosions or heal your comrades with a fart of healing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orc-attack", "videos": [{"id": 109676, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hZc4MR9BmPo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZc4MR9BmPo", "title": "C64 - Orc attack", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hZc4MR9BmPo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
