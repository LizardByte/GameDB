{"id": "ZKYA0qrSmq0", "snippet": {"title": "L.O.L.: Lack of Love Sega Dreamcast Full Game", "description": "The weirdest game I've ever played for the Sega Dreamcast, L.O.L. Lack of Love is an evolutionary life-sim designed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Oscar, BAFTA, Grammy and Golden Globe winning musician and composer who scored the film The Revenant, among many other works. \n\nRyuichi Sakamoto created the concept and philosophy of the game, composed and performed the music, and came up with the game's title. Sakamoto died just a week ago (at the time of this writing) after a years-long battle with multiple forms of cancer. \n\nThe object of L.O.L. Lack of Love is to guide a creature through evolutionary process, from an egg to a complex large animal. Throughout the process the player, as the creature, must form symbiotic relationships with other creatures, fight for survival, eat, sleep, and excrete. \n\nThe organism must also often flee from an invading robotic entity which seeks to terraform the planet for habitation by humans fleeing an overpopulated and dying Earth. Eventually the animal in our control is captured by the robot, and what follows is strange indeed. \n\nThe game has virtually no HUD, no words, and very little direction. The music is sparse and lonely, almost devastating at times. \n\nThe game is opaque and frustrating, cryptic and very difficult. It made me want to give up dozens of times within the first two hours. By the end of the game I had tears in my eyes, but not from frustration. I was moved by the game's deftly delivered message about the struggle for survival and about the environmental harm that comes with human involvement in a place. \n\nIt's a sneaky, beautiful game with a lovely heart. Hope you enjoy.\n\nBuy LOL Lack of Love on eBay here - https://ebay.us/x1U6gW\n\n[Some of the links in this description will direct users to our affiliates at Amazon or eBay.
