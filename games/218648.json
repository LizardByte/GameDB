An evil intelligence has once again assembled a deadly army of warriors, bent on conquering the universe. Total destruction of the planets Ailoprobe and Semaj by the evil force has convinced other alien races to fight against them. This has created a chain reaction of events, resulting in the unification of the Rodex, Mechanoid and Human race in an attempt to fight the evil force.\n\nCorridor 8: Galactic Wars takes you there! Which side will you choose?", "summary": "Corridor 8: Galactic Wars was the planned sequel to Corridor 7, a first-person shooter by Capstone Software. The sequel used the Build engine and was supposed to be released in early 1997. However, Capstone and its parent company Intracorp Entertainment went bankrupt in 1996. One of the former developers published an early prototype including the source code and a design document of this game.\n\nAccording to the document, Corridor 8 was planned to have 6 episodes with 10 maps each. The episodes were broken up into two sides: the human \"Allied\" and the alien \"Axis\", three episodes for each side. This game was also supposed to feature 18 characters plus 6 aliens redone from Corridor 7, 20 weapons to choose from and a secret weapon, and multi-player network gaming for up to 8 players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 75327, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "h33mbbgyt60", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h33mbbgyt60", "title": "Corridor 8: Galactic Wars \u2b50 Unreleased PC Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h33mbbgyt60/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
