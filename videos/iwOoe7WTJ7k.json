{"id": "iwOoe7WTJ7k", "snippet": {"title": "Escape Tales: The Awakening - Demo Trailer", "description": "Demo of Escape Tales: The Awakening is Available Now on Steam!\n\nEscape Tales: The Awakening is a digital adaptation of the bestselling escape room card game by LockMe and Board&Dice. The game is coming to Steam in late 2024.\n\nIn Escape Tales: The Awakening, you take on the role of Sam, a man whose wife died a few years ago and whose daughter has unexpectedly collapsed into a coma for unknown reasons. Between the doctors claiming that there was no chance for her to fall ill and the man who gives him \"The Book of Rituals\" (which has the power to wake his child), Sam has to stay sane and fight forces he has never encountered before.\n\nIn addition to immersing the player in a mysterious and dark world, Escape Tales: The Awakening tells a compelling story about loss, redemption, and the ghosts of the past. Open exploration, multiple endings, an unforgettable puzzle experience, and an engaging narrative are just a few of the key features this title provides. The player\u2019s moral compass will be questioned, and their problem-solving skills pushed to the limit. The game's puzzles and decisions can be challenging, so no time restrictions are placed; players can take as much time as they need.\n\nIn the demo of Escape Tales: The Awakening, you can experience the first location available in the game. The beautiful artwork invites you into the story and presents the narrative as if you are in the game. From the very first moment of gameplay, you get a glimpse of what the full version of the game will be like. Want to check it out yourself?
