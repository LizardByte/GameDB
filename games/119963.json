The new rock radio station takes the mute out of your commute with everything from grunge and classic rock to sleaze rock and metal. Rock Radio is the perfect soundtrack to build your own Detroit Rock City - just try not to trash your hotel rooms too much! \n \nWith Rock City you're not only getting new songs, but also DJ Lars.
