Only when the four mystic pieces are in your possession will you be able to render the Warlock powerless by using his own \"Spell of Destruction\" against him. \n \nAs you fight your way relentlessly onward, every evil creature and force at the Warlocks disposal is unleashed against you.; you hurl lightning bolt after lightning bolt against these powers of darkness, your energy becomes depleted, you must find food to rekindle your ebbing power. As the obstacles become more and more awesome will you have the energy at your command to perform the transformation spell which will turn you into a mighty Golden Eagle and enable you to overcome many of the diabolical traps set for by the Warlock. \n \nYour objectives are clear, assemble the magic scroll and banish evil into oblivion for eternity.", "summary": "The player controls an alchemist who has been summoned to defeat an evil warlock. The game is set inside the warlock's castle, with the game's primary objective being finding four pieces of a magic scroll. This allows the alchemist to use the \"Spell of Destruction\" to defeat the warlock. \n \nThe alchemist can transform into a golden eagle, requiring the use of spell energy. Transforming between the two is essential to completing the game. The alchemist can hurl lightning bolts and other spells, but the eagle form is required to negotiate steep hills or drops. The alchemist can only carry one item at a time and must consume food to keep stamina levels up. Movement, bumping into objects, or transforming depletes the character's stamina. Fighting monsters also reduces the character's stamina, although this can be mitigated by carrying an axe or sword.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alchemist"}
