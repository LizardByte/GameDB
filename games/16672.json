Bizarre and dangerous creatures are flooding into our dimension, intent on destruction. Behind their actions is a controlling intelligence known as 'Darkness', who intends to drag New York back into the warp - destroying it utterly!\n\nAir strikes, ground assaults and WMDs have all failed to stop the swarming forces from beyond. All that remains is a single hope: a shadowy ex-special forces soldier, enhanced for combat and known only as 'Chainsaw Warrior'. Equipped with all the latest high-tech armaments, he must battle his way through to the trans-dimensional ground-zero and defeat Darkness. Not only are there swarms of zombies, mutants, traps, Chaos Agents and other twisted denizens between him and Darkness, time is the enemy too! Only an hour remains to save New York before it is torn from our world forever.", "summary": "Chainsaw Warrior is a classic nail-biting game for one strong-nerved player, based off the single-player board game of the same name. The player has sixty minutes to navigate a labyrinth composed of an abandoned urban slum in New York, represented by two decks of cards, locate the entity Darkness attempting to destroy the city and kill it.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chainsaw-warrior", "videos": [{"id": 13938, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ef8NEL37uIc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8NEL37uIc", "title": "Chainsaw Warrior Extended Trailer (plus Making Of & Developer Walk-though)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ef8NEL37uIc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
