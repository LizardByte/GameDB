AI Limit's Sync-Rate system allows for a powerful mix of spells and attacks in intense and dynamic offensive and defensive combat scenarios. The game's post-apocalyptic setting, factions and mechanical monsters are based on completely original AI lore. Ai Limit players will feel the presence of \"Sphere Gods\" throughout their journey. Sphere Gods will communicate with Arrisa throughout the story as it gradually unfolds to multiple endings.", "summary": "AI Limit is an action-RPG published by CE-Asia and developed by SENSE GAMES studio.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ai-limit", "videos": [{"id": 25303, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3yr_80woJns", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yr_80woJns", "title": "AI-LIMIT - PlayStation China  Hero Project Spring Showcase Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3yr_80woJns/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 29121, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vtUa4xYZcpc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtUa4xYZcpc", "title": "AI-LIMIT - ChinaJoy 2019 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtUa4xYZcpc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
