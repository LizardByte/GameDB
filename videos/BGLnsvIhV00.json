{"id": "BGLnsvIhV00", "snippet": {"title": "MARISA MATRIX - Normal Mode ALL Clear - 3,37 Million", "description": "Turn on captions for some extra comments. \n\nVery cool free doujin shmup from 2010 that mixes Touhou with Mars Matrix. \nThe music is even a mix of Touhou and Mars Matrix music it's great. \n\nGo play Marisa Matrix.\n\n-Mechanics-\nThe game uses the reflect shield from Mars Matrix but it doesn't work quite the same. \nThe time it takes to recharge the shield takes -much- longer than in Mars Matrix, so you can't quite do the thing where you do constant short reflects. \nWith the shield you can absorb bullets and then reflect them back for massive damage. If you hold the button until the meter fully depletes, you do a screen-wide bomb. You can only use the reflect when your power is at 100%, this recharges naturally over time. \nAiming the reflect is actually pretty hard. You kinda have to move in the opposite direction you want to aim and then release the button. \nAlso worth mentioning that your shot power is tied to your current reflect meter. \n\nGo play Marisa Matrix.\n\n-Shots-\nYou can select between two main shots and two focused shots. \n- For main shots you have a wide shot and a forward-focus shot. I found the wide shot really hard to use since your movement speed is really slow with it. \n- For secondary shots you have Laser and Napalm. Laser is very powerful while Napalm pierces and also does splash damage. \nFrom stage 2 onwards Reimu follows you around like an option and her shot actually changes based on which main shot you chose. For wide shot she uses a forward focus shot and for forward focus she uses a homing attack. \n\nGo play Marisa Matrix.\n\n-Extends-\nBosses drop an extend if you're at 2 lives or less.\nBesides that there are also a bunch of secret extends. \n- In stage 1 there are sections with big fairies from the left and right that shoot aimed clusters of bullets. They drop an extend if you destroy both sides with the same reflect. You don't have to kill them, they just need to get hit with the reflect. You can get two extends from these. \n- In stage 3 there is a section with crazy deathfairies. If you speedkill them fast enough to spawn a third deathfairy, then it drops an extend. The manual implies it's maybe possible to spawn a fourth for another extend. \n\nGo play Marisa Matrix.\n\n-Scoring-\nScoring is basically using your reflect as much as possible to spawn lots of point items. \nYou also want to increase your Rate so point items are worth more. Your rate increases by 10 for every 10 point items you pick up, though this only works in stages, not bosses. Rate resets after every stage. \nBosses also drop big point items if you have exactly 3 lives in stock but not more or less. So for scoring you kinda want to stay at 3 lives for the whole game. I could have suicided twice at the end there to get them but eh. \n\nGo play Marisa Matrix.\n\nUnfortunately it seems like the game was never quite finished. \nThe main game itself was finished, but there were plans to include cutscenes at the start and end of the game and also to include an Extra stage. \nIf you look at the game files you can actually see portraits for Cirno and Flandre that were never implemented. \n\nThe game even has options for Tate and scan lines. The dude who made this is pretty legit.\n\nGetting this game to run was really hard since it doesn't work very well on Windows 10.\nI couldn't get the music to run, so I did the run without music, then transferred the replay file to a Windows XP virtual machine and recorded the run from there. It's pretty jank but it works. \n\nI'm not sure if Hard mode is actually possible to beat, it's really silly. \n\nDownload the game here:\nhttps://ykkb.hatenadiary.org/entries/0000/00/05\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:46 - Stage 1\n05:23 - Stage 2\n09:43 - Stage 3\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BGLnsvIhV00/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BGLnsvIhV00/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BGLnsvIhV00/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BGLnsvIhV00/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BGLnsvIhV00/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "MARISA MATRIX - Normal Mode ALL Clear - 3,37 Million", "description": "Turn on captions for some extra comments. \n\nVery cool free doujin shmup from 2010 that mixes Touhou with Mars Matrix. \nThe music is even a mix of Touhou and Mars Matrix music it's great. \n\nGo play Marisa Matrix.\n\n-Mechanics-\nThe game uses the reflect shield from Mars Matrix but it doesn't work quite the same. \nThe time it takes to recharge the shield takes -much- longer than in Mars Matrix, so you can't quite do the thing where you do constant short reflects. \nWith the shield you can absorb bullets and then reflect them back for massive damage.
