Having crossed into a strange land of fantasy without realising it, she finally meets someone who doesn't try to avoid her - Keine, a half-youkai historian. With her ability to supernaturally learn the past, she takes Mokou on a journey to rediscover it.\n\nBut although Mokou can never die, her body still has mortal fragility, and is often consumed by her own fiery power. Not to matter; able to regenerate from nothing, she can always keep trying until she gets it right.", "summary": "Undying Memoir is a platforming game with unlockable lore.\nThis is a fangame based on Touhou Project.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/undying-memoir"}
