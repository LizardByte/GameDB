The golf course can be placed on any flat surface and resized from as small as an envelope to as large as a basketball court. Players move around to get the best angle, set direction, adjust power and putt for glory - while being careful to avoid crazy mammoths, dino-birds and cavemen trying to stop the ball from reaching its home.\nThere are seven courses, each with global leaderboards and trophies. Players can share photos of themselves with their trophies, or hanging out in the game world.\nIf you are ready to experience the cutting edge of augmented reality technology download Mammoth Mini Golf AR today."}
