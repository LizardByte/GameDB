Past conferences mostly focused on the immediate energy crisis represented by the distant but fast approaching Heat Death, with Dyson spheres being the main source of energy at the time, but the 455th was the first to discuss how to survive the heat death, and come through the other side unscathed. \n \nA near-functional prototype lies at the centre of a anti-surveillance array (which may cause interference, apologies) within the Nebuloan Nine space station. While only intermittently phasing into a neighbouring dimension, and only able to carry a small payload of a single human being, the technologies developed form the basis of what is used by the current ships housing the Walking Simulator A Month Club, as well as the Walking Simulator Pods that take you to and from these archived universes."}
