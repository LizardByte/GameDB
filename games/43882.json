When confronted by a ghost the player must turn on the lights in the room by means of a light switch. The player is often transported into the past via the passengers or certain objects. Once the player fulfills a task important to a spirit they will vanish and drop an \"Astral Piece\" which can be used to get a different ending scene.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 47852, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "siSU959tL04"}]}
