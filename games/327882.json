Who gets to decide? And why does everyone follow so blindly? Welcome to the Telius region, only months removed from a bloody civil war sparked by the actions of the tyrannical King, Tobias II. A once benevolent man who ushered in an era of prosperity and industry, he eventually plunged the region into division and violence. In the end, he was overthrown by his own people. Amidst the ensuing chaos and turmoil, a new council of representatives has taken power, supported by the revolutionaries that overthrew the king's regime. This 'grand council' is now in charge of overseeing the reconstruction of the region and establishing a new Pokemon league. But even under this supposed new stability, old fissures remain. Many Telius citizens detest the new government and how it operates and remain loyal to the longstanding traditions of supporting the nobility. This nobility and their soldiers, now on the outside looking in, has adopted the moniker 'Team Royale'. Operating from the shadows, they are a group intent on restoring the region to its former glory days under a new king. So with the region war-torn and divided, how will Telius move into the future? Enter YOU the player: the child of a noble family, you were sent away before the war began. Now that the war has ended, you, along with your best friend Alanah, return to Telius to fulfill a promise to conquer the Pokemon league and to bring the entire region of Telius into harmony once more. Can you solve the mysteries of the war, work your way through the shadows of the past, and become champion of the Telius League? Will you support the grand council, fight for the Royale loyalists, or take matters into your own hands? How will you define your legacy in Pokemon Empire?\n\nRPG Maker Pokemon fangame with Pokemon up through Generation 9 with several rebalances to both individual Pokemon and the general systems.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-empire"}
