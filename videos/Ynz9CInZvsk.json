Just like the title says it's pretty much a Touhou parody game based on Suguri. \n\nJust like always, people who have never played any of the Suguri games will probably have absolutely no idea what is going on. \nBut in a nutshell you have a dash that lets you fly through beam-based attacks while you can't dash through ballistic weapons and solid objects.\nBesides going through bullets dashing also lets you cancel attack animations and the more you dash the more your heat increases. Basically the more heat you have the more damage you take when you get hit so it's a risk-reward kind of thing, at 300% heat you take like three times as much damage as on 0%. \nKilling enemies and grazing things with the dash increases your hyper gauge which is basically a short bomb. You can stack up to three at a time.\n\nHowever how hypers and the hyper gauge system works is a bit different from Suguri. Enemies drop power and point items when killed, power increases your hyper gauge and point items restore some health. You get much less gauge for dashing through bullets in this game so you have to rely a bit more on the power items. \nBesides that you also barely get any invulnerability frames when hypering compared to Suguri so strats are a lot different between the games. At certain times a screen cancel turns all bullets into star items and these also refill your health. \n\nAlso unlike Suguri a lot of the time it's not very clear what you can and can't dash through but generally the Hime rule of red is good and blue is bad applies. \n\nThe game has like 30 different weapons. Besides the entire Suguri arsenal it also has a lot of really silly new weapons. \n\nLusus is the highest difficulty in the game and I guess it can be compared to the Special difficulty in Suguri. The game also has no Arcade mode for some reason so these are all individual stage replays edited together. \n\nDownload: \nhttp://www.geocities.jp/akatuki_twilight/soft/soft.html\nHe also made an Acceleration of Patchouli amusingly.\n\nUpdate: \nNew link: http://www.mediafire.com/file/cu9cx33bcl6yrpu/patchouli+ver1.3.rar", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ynz9CInZvsk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ynz9CInZvsk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ynz9CInZvsk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ynz9CInZvsk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ynz9CInZvsk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\u30d1\u30c1\u30e5\u30ea ~ Patchouli (Touhou Suguri) - Lusus ALL Clear", "description": "Full name: \u30d1\u30c1\u30e5\u30ea \"Patchouli\" a little war in bland-old library.\nTurn on captions for extra commentary. \n\nSo here is something interesting that I stumbled upon, it's apparently been around for 8 years but not a single video of this game exists on Youtube.
