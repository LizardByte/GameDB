The rest of the characters included in the game are based on other real promotions and wrestlers, but due to copyright have fake names and appearances. This is common among other Japanese wrestling games. You can identify who the other wrestler's are by their unique moves and taunts, and the edit mode contains each piece of ring attire you would need to recreate their actual likeness.\n\nIn total, there are 98 wrestlers in the game, 23 of which have to be unlocked. There is also 16 original character slots you can use to edit and create your own wrestlers, bringing the potential total of wrestlers in the game to 114. This game has the largest roster of all of AKI's wrestling games.
