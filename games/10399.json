Can your enemies guess your secret agenda?\n*HQs under AI control now have separate aggressiveness stances for Land, Air and Naval operations\n*Countries can request specific actions from their allies for unprecedented cooperation\n*Technological progress can now be shared with your allies\n*Brigades can now be upgraded to more advanced types (e.g. Infantry to Motorized, or Artillery to Self Propelled Artillery)\n*New 1940 scenario fills a gap in the game's timeline\n*Hundreds of new events added to immerse players in their own versions of World War II, comparing the unfolding alternate timeline to real history\n*Mighty warships can be designated the Pride of the Fleet, which is both an opportunity and a risk\n*The AI has been improved in all areas, at all levels. It will defend in depth, marshal big naval taskforces and launch multi-stage invasions. It will perform more historical diplomacy and pursue a strategic production strategy", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
