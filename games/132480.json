You play as Russell, Linda, and Joan \u2014 son, mother, and grandmother \u2014 switching between them to help the family cope with a series of traumatic events. Based on a true story. \n \nThe main game is scheduled for release in 2022. It will be part two of the Linda & Joan story. Part one is Prologue: \u201cFour Months Earlier\u201d which was released in July 2020. \n \nPlayers experience the events from the perspectives of Russell, Linda, and Joan through exploration, conversation, and tasks designed to give emotional insight into the themes of caregiving, dying, bereavement, and homeland. \n \nWhat sets Linda & Joan apart from other branching-narrative experiences is that while the player has many choices to make, nothing can change the core events that follow \u2014 there is only one ending. \n \nHowever, actions, dialogue choices, and task completion, do affect the characters\u2019 perception of events. By spending time with happier memories, taking care of themselves, and choosing the right things to say to each other, the characters \u2014 and therefore the player \u2014 will find themselves able to deal with the impossible. \n \nThe characters\u2019 emotional states will be graphically represented in the game. The player will have to carefully balance the needs of the characters to progress, sometimes requiring difficult zero-sum tradeoffs. \n \nThese mechanisms attempt to mirror the real-life feeling of being powerless in the face of looming trauma, when you realize that no decision can affect the outcome, but you can affect how you and others feel about it. \n \nEven when life\u2019s story feels like it\u2019s on rails, we still have some power over our own realities. There is still room for dignity, compassion, honesty. For fear and for love. There is a time for self-care. There is a time for duty. The choices we make will define the memories we hold for the rest of our lives.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 38606, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "Rueg47pFnWM"}]}
