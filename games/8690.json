You can order them to follow you or to roam the floor killing all they find. The player can also freely jump between their bodies in the games take on a lives system; as long as the team member they are in isn't killed there is no limit on this.\n\nOBC also features a near fully destructible environment; the Flame Thrower can set bad guys, scenery and the level itself on fire, which could make movement extremely hazardous for the player, especially as the fire randomly spreads. The Grenade launcher meanwhile can destroy any wall (with some hard coded exceptions).\n\nLike Blake Stone OBC also features textured floors and ceilings. Though unlike Blake, OBC could have several different floor textures on the same map. However OBC's floor/ceiling graphics were partially parallax meaning they appeared to \"warp\" as the player moves around.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/operation-body-count", "videos": [{"id": 79719, "video_id": "Ho6WgJaiBAQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho6WgJaiBAQ", "title": "OPERATION BODY COUNT TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ho6WgJaiBAQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
