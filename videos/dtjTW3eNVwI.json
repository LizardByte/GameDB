Emerald Isle lies in the Bermuda Triangle, hidden by fogs and treacherous waters and peopled by the remnants of a strange civilisation.

Fierce winds seize the plane over the Bermuda Triangle and hurl it to destruction; you escape by parachute at the last moment.\n\nAs you float down towards an island below, you recognise the coastline from an old map. It is the lonely atoll, \"Emerald Isle\", which few people visit and from which none return.\n\nIt is said that only one person may leave - the ruler of the land - and that each visitor is tested. Success promotes you to King or Queen, failure promotes you to the next life.\n\nThe location number shown at the top-right corresponds with the number on the game map at http://maps.speccy.cz/map.php?id=EmeraldIsle .
