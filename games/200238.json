It puts a lot of emphasis on atmosphere and immersion with lots of written text, carefully picked music, and fitting visuals that paint a colorful world of an exotic tropical archipelago. Some roguelike elements are thrown in for good measure. Reminiscent of pen and paper DnD.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grim-quest-origins"}
