But now he changes sides because Medtech, a government facility which conducts medical experiments on humans, kidnapped his fiance. You take his role and fly an advanced fighter craft to destroy Medtech.\n\nTo survive, you must master an arsenal of weapons including the Molnia Arc, Vortex Shield, and Micro Missiles. But be warned, your opposition is armed to the teeth and will attack without mercy. Regarding gameplay the game is similar to Descent: Flying a ship in first person perspective while shooting enemies. The 24 levels are mostly not the typical narrow mazes but relatively open and offer varied mission goals like protecting convoys, performing covert extractions or executing strikers on strategic targets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adrenix"}
