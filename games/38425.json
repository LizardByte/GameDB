After they are attacked by an unknown group of enemies on both land and air, the player is tasked to root out these enemies and stop any further attacks on Coalition forces. \n \nMuch like its predecessor, the gameplay is a first-person tank simulation, using radar to scout out enemy tanks and using the main turret gun to disable and kill any opposing tanks, jeeps, APCs and various other heavy weapons including SCUD missiles. If the player encounters and air resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine gun to cut down enemy choppers. \n \nPlayers also have smoke screens that can temporarily make them unseen to any enemy forces, plus they can call in supply drops to replenish their armor and ammo as well as air support that can level any opposing force in their wake.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-battletank-2"}
