She has the ability to make her gunshots stronger by shooting to the beat of the background music. She also can absorb enemy bullets and use as her own. All this just so she can reunite with her big bro and eat cheesesteaks with him.\n\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/787070/Super_Ledgehop_Double_Laser/\nAltermative store page: https://chairgtables.itch.io/superledgehop\nDevelopment updates: https://twitter.com/ChairGTables\n\nOkay, so remember that girl I was just talking about? Yeah, that's Chizuru. I actually don't even like my own protagonist of my own game lol. I'm all about Yuuto Ichika. She's best girl in this game. She's the reason why No Nut November is still going strong. I'm making myself pure for her. She's best girl in this game. Chizuru sucks, dude. Like, what can Chizuru even do? Absorb bullets, shoot to music, and eat cheesesteaks? Well Yuuto can use magic. Well, she sucks at it, but you know that people who suck put 10x more effort than their peers. So I'm totally rooting for her.\n\nAlso yes, Some of your melee techs are here. You can waveshine and shine your opponents. But, oops.
