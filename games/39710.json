Strange and fearsome creatures will attack at every turn, but weapons can be found along the way: a ball and chain, a bow and arrow, and a mighty sword. Put on wings and take to the sky, or become a mermaid to explore the ocean depths.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/athena-in-wonderland"}
