Lucky for you, these dudes have a lot of problems. Eat all you can! He only has so many organs though as somebody cut him apart. Probably from not paying his movie rental bills on time. When you have had your fill, make your way out through the mouth... Or eyeball. As a new alien, present him with a massive bill and that if he doesn't pay it, he gets the other half of him cut off.
