There are eight levels of evolution, each having three phases:\n\nPhase 1: Freeze all organisms into energy clusters. To freeze them you have to arrive at an intersection of web strands before an organism gets there. As it approaches hold down the fire button. Do not touch a painted path the organism leaves behind or touch an organism before it reaches the intersection or you will be sent back to the start of this phase.\n\nPhase 2: Stabilize all energy clusters. Go over them with the fire button. You don't have to be at an intersection for this. Their don't leave a painted path but you do. Touching this sends you back to the start of this phase.\n\nPhase 3: The transitional phase that moves you to the next level with a musical reward. Music, lights and color. A new epoch is about to begin.\n\nThe game is viewed in a 3D perspective with the web stretching into the back of the screen. You appear as a note starting right at the front of the screen. You use the joystick to move about the web and use the fire button to enlarge. There are no lives to the game and no end. You finish when you switch it off.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 55007, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "G7tBQomaTCA"}]}
