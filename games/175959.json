The game was revealed in an article by Eurogamer detailing Argonaut Games' involvement in the development of Star Fox where the game was described as a 3D platformer and left unnamed, while a message board post by an Argonaut employee named the game \"Yoshi Racing\" and described it as a character racing game.\n\nFollowing their successful collaboration with Nintendo on Star Fox, British game developer Argonaut Games pitched a 3D game starring Yoshi and made a prototype for it. However, Nintendo did not follow on the offer, with one Argonaut employee speculating this was because the company did not want to let third-parties use its characters. Following this setback, Argonaut decided to retool the prototype as an original IP, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yoshi-racing"}
