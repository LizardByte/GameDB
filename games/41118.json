The knight meets different moving (as snakes, dragons, birds, water drops) and rigid enemies (as gargoyles) and obstacles (as spears or moving pillars), that can be fought and destroyed. Some enemies spit e.g fire. Destroyed enemies leave behind coins which can be collected. The enemies can harm the knight, which at first costs energy and then leads to death. If rooms that have already been visited are reentered the enemies also reappear!\n\nFurthermore there are door opener in the shape of flashing steles which open different doors in the castle and objects (e.g.in the shape of jugs), that contain energy, water or weapons and can be collected. At the beginning, the energy supply only consists of three energy points, but in the course of the game the energy supply can be raised. If the knight passes a rune stone, there is an important hint to be read.\n\nFurthermore there is a map of the castle's labyrinth, which shows an overview of the rooms that you have already visited. In the lower right of the screen the name of the currently entered room or area is displayed. The energy and coin display is at the lower left of the screen", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knight-n-grail"}
