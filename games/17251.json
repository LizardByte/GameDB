The game resembles a combination of Breakout and Quadrapong (an early Atari arcade game) in the sense that not only can up to 4 players play the game at the same time, but also the \"forts\" in the four corners of the screen are brick walls that could be broken with a flaming ball. Warlords uses spinner controllers for player control, and came in both an upright 2 player version and a 4 player cocktail version. The upright version uses a black and white monitor, and reflects the game image onto a mirror, with a backdrop of castles, giving the game a 3D feel. The upright version only supports up to two simultaneous players, which move through the levels as a team. The cocktail version is in color, and supports 1-4 players. 3-4 player games are free-for-all's where the game ends as soon as one player wins. 1-2 player games play identical to the upright version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warlords", "videos": [{"id": 104586, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7Y2xYX6h380", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y2xYX6h380", "title": "Arcade Longplay - Warlords (1980) Atari", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Y2xYX6h380/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
