He reminds the overbearing and stubborn crime lord that the Tastan tombs have little by way of treasure in the conventional sense and few easily removable artifacts. The amazing technology of the ancient Tastans is simply beyond the best minds of Beni's day, completely inaccessible to modern scientists and souvenir hunters. He also reminds the insensitive Doba that even the great Ramirez was barely able to make it out of Tomb 35 with his life.", "summary": "SENTINEL Descendants in Time is a gripping science fiction adventure set more than 1900 years from the present day in a rich pastoral region of our own future Earth.\n\nIn this quest for riches and knowledge, you can uncover the mystery behind the Tastan Caverns. As you begin your dangerous journey, you'll encounter a female sentinel programmed to guard the sacred caverns. Her dark purpose, however, may impede your progress through more than 20 puzzles. A built-in hint system may come in especially handy as the puzzles become more challenging.\n\nEach of the game's eight worlds features diverse environments, ranging from snowcapped mountains to active volcanoes.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sentinel-descendants-in-time", "videos": [{"id": 29900, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WdGug6c7uvk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdGug6c7uvk", "title": "Sentinel: Descendants in Time PC Trailer - Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WdGug6c7uvk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134341, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "R2mfIVCxqds", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2mfIVCxqds", "title": "SENTINEL: DESCENDANTS IN TIME   /   REALMS OF ILLUSION  -  Debut Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R2mfIVCxqds/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
