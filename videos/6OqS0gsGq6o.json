They are among the most diverse group of animals on the planet and include more than a million described species and represent more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing metazoan life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species occur in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, the crustaceans. \n\nDevice:\nPlaystation Classic\nBleemsync 1.2\nOTG\nSandisk Cruzer Blade 128 GB\n\nCapture:\nEzcap 284 hd video capture", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6OqS0gsGq6o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6OqS0gsGq6o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6OqS0gsGq6o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6OqS0gsGq6o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6OqS0gsGq6o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mushi no Idokoro [Psx] - Intro", "description": "Mushi no Idokoro is a puzzle game using insects in a fantasy world as the main character.
