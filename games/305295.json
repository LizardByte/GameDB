Virtually every NPC's text has been changed, so be sure to talk to townspeople and explore side paths to understand the whole picture. The game takes place in Post-War Johto (the war alluded to by Lt. Surge in Red/Blue/Yellow). No one knows why the war started, or how it ended. That is, except for a few people in power.\n\nYou will team up with time travellers Grovyle and Celebi from Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky to uncover these mysteries.", "summary": "To begin, Garbage Gold is a trashmon hack, meaning the player will only be able to obtain and use weak Pokemon. In most cases, these Pokemon will be less than 425 BST (combined base stat total). There are some exceptions, but this is the general rule. A wide variety of encounters are available, and are significantly different from vanilla Heart Gold. Evolution levels are changed, and some Pokemon wont evolve at all if the evolutions are too good.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-garbage-gold", "videos": [{"id": 116345, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NUn1f4AEA_g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUn1f4AEA_g", "title": "Pokemon Garbage Gold -- Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NUn1f4AEA_g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
