I didn't get to before because I did not have a PC game capture recorder but now I do. So I can record PC games now. Some of you probably know about this game, some of you probably know the movies Heavy Metal from 1981 and the one based on this game called Heavy Metal 2000 from the year 2000. If you don't, imagine a combination of both Lara Croft and Xena. This game is actually the sequel to the Heavy Metal 2000 movie. This was one of my favourite games on PC. It's set in a sci fi world, the main character Julie is incredibly gorgeous, you get an arsenal of murderous weapons and it's got a badass heavy metal soundtrack. Some of the developers of this game also had hand in developing SiN. If this series does well, I might also consider doing a playthrough of SiN and SiN: Episodes Emergence after this. I wish they remade this game but for some reason they never did. There is also another Heavy Metal game coming soon to Steam and consoles called Metal Fury 3000. So I'll be keeping an eye out for that. Now because I'm playing on this PC and still new to recording videos on there, it'll take a little longer to edit and upload them than I do on consoles.\n\nIf you've enjoyed the gameplay, hit that LIKE button, SHARE with your friends or SUBSCRIBE for more anime and other related gameplay.
