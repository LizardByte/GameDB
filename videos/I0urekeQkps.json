It works on iPad 2, iPhone 4S, and iPod touch 5 or above.)\n\nDroidscape: Basilica is a unique puzzle-arcade game set in the grim electropunk future. A power-hungry Ecclesiarchy has plunged humanity into a new Dark Ages. The last remaining Chronomancer has been taken hostage on the gargantuan Basilica space station, and if he dies, an already dark world will get a lot darker. Only a small, unarmed droid named Bishop 7 can save him\u2014and only with your help.\n\nDroidscape: Basilica has been approached like an interactive work of art. We have hand-modeled the characters in clay and painstakingly animated them using stop-motion technology.\n\nIn each of Droidscape: Basilica's 60 levels, players must navigate around patrolling enemy droids, grabbing gems and keys needed to proceed. First, use strategy to plot Bishop 7's course across a room. Then, transport the droid safely across the room with a mix of reflexes and problem solving skills.\n\n\"Look Ma, no hands!\" On iPad 2, iPhone 4S, iPod touch 5, and newer, Droidscape: Basilica supports Kyttaro Games' experimental yet groundbreaking \"HeadTwister\" technology, using the front-facing camera to turn the game into a hands-free, head-tracking, gesture-based experience. For players with earlier devices or who prefer hands-on play, Droidscape: Basilica also has tactile touch controls.\n\nBe part of the \"HeadTwister\" experiment!
