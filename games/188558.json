The mage starts out with a wand that can do a water attack. No damage shows any blood, only smokepuffs.\n\nThe orbs power source is taken from colored diamonds found in the caves: Green for Earth, Red for Fire, Blue for Water and White for Air.\nThere are also some diamonds with combined orb energy effects: Light Blue for Air & Water and Purple for Fire & Earth.\n\nThe underground Kingdom is divided into 50 platform levels, to finish a level three larger Key-diamonds must be found; one each of Green, Red and White color - these will open the door to the next level. In the unregistered version, only five levels are available, and there are some other limitations - the demo has no bosses for instance.\n\nIn the caves are monsters (of course) but also treasure laying around, which is gathered by walking over them, and added to the player score. Touching a monster loses health. Beakers with blue liquid and large red hearts restore health\nA highscore list is available in the registered version, as are passwords & savegames letting a player continue from the last saved location.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 63748, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "OGH646qmVlU"}]}
