There appear to have been many other chapters cut from the final game as well, suggesting that Silicon Knights intended the game to have further sequels. Unfortunately, these also failed to appear.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eternal-darkness", "videos": [{"id": 62288, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "koBEIdTuaIQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koBEIdTuaIQ", "title": "Eternal Darkness Opening [Nintendo 64 Beta Version]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/koBEIdTuaIQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62289, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "WVh_yJvsQKs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVh_yJvsQKs", "title": "Eternal Darkness [Nintendo 64 version - CANCELLED!]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WVh_yJvsQKs/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62290, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LSD9iG7hdUQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSD9iG7hdUQ", "title": "Eternal Darkness [Nintendo 64 Beta UNRELEASED!]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LSD9iG7hdUQ/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62292, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7WIDWoefpAc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WIDWoefpAc", "title": "E3 99 Eternal Darkness Beta Nintendo 64", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7WIDWoefpAc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
