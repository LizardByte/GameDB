Players once again pilot the RAH-66 Comanche attack helicopter through various combat missions. The game retains NovaLogic's Voxel engine, likely with improvements to terrain rendering and object detail. Comanche 2 probably introduces new mission types, environments, and enemy challenges while refining the flight model and combat mechanics. The game likely maintains the series' focus on accessible gameplay and intense action, balancing simulation elements with engaging combat scenarios. As a sequel, Comanche 2 aims to expand and enhance the helicopter combat experience, offering both new and returning players an improved version of the Comanche series' signature blend of advanced graphics and action-oriented helicopter warfare.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/comanche-2"}
