Former legionnaire Kurtis Trent now operates as a freelance mercenary. His specialism: the supernatural.\n\nFollowing a series of mysterious deaths after the discovery of a medieval shrine deep beneath a Welsh mine, Kurtis has been hired to find whatever otherworldly force is wreaking havoc, and take care of it. Little does he know that what he is about to stumble upon will lead him down a dangerous path, one of ancient cults and arcane knowledge, that will bring him face-to-face with demons from his own past, and ultimately, into a battle for the very survival of mankind...\n\nIt's so fresh to play as Kurtis Trent. For those who don't know Kurtis Trent, he is one of the main character and playable in TR Angel of Darkness. He is after Eckhart just to take the revenge for his father's death. Then He meets Lara. Anyway, this is a great adventure in England section. Also it's the first time I see someone who implement the subway work in TR4 engine! I can't wait to play as him in the next chapter :D  \n\nSeeking List :\n\nExcavation Site - 0:28\n1:30 Machine Battery\n4:17 Power Room Key 1\n9:24 Secret #1 - Golden Cross & Shotgun\n11:00 Power Room Key 2\n14:54 Activator Plug \n17:12 Diablo Key\n\nLondon Docklands - 19:42 \n24:05 Sewer Access Key\n28:50 Crane Control Key\n29:48 Quad Bike Keys\n30:21 Secret #2 - Golden Cross\n32:30 Shotgun\n35:08 Sewer Access Key\n\nSecrets of the Underground - 41:03\n53:22 Storeroom Key\n58:13 Maintenance Access Key\n1:00:20 Train Relay Box\n1:03:13 Secret #3 - Golden Cross\n1:03:22 Uzis\n\nThe Guardian of Diablo - 1:05:07\n1:08:01 Rusty Key\n1:21:14 Secret #4 - Golden Cross\n\nTomb of the Templars 1:22:47\n1:27:19 Secret Scroll (Code 5486) \n1:33:24 Templar Seal\n\nBattle With the Beast - 1:36:36\n1:36:50 Telescopic Scope \n\nThis is definitely a worthwhile adventure!
