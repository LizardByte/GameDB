Use your Wii Remote controller like a handlebar to control your shopping cart as you race through different types of stores. Vex your competitors by stunning them with plungers and stealing groceries out of their carts. Outrun them by using your drifting and aisle-jumping skills. Keep away from the security guards who want to stop the mall melee. The first player with a completed shopping list at the cash register wins. A simple and fun game that's suitable for all ages, Mart Racer pits you against the computer or up to four players. Play with your friends and family on a split screen or compete online.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
