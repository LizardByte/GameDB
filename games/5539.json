Fights can also result in double-kills, where each piece involved in the battle is killed.\nOther additions to the game include special abilities held by certain pieces, as well as a Spellcaster piece, which acts as the leader of each side.", "summary": "Archon: The Light and the Dark was a game developed by Free Fall Associates which loosely modeled the game of Chess, with a number of additions to the gameplay. It was programmed by Anne Westfall, and released originally for Atari 8-bit computers in 1983.
