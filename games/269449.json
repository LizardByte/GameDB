I've aimed for a difficulty curve similar to Scythe, where the first couple of maps are pretty easy but it ramps up near the end. The maps generally take between 5-10 minutes to complete, and are very gameplay-focused. The maps are of various themes - techbases, outdoor valleys, small cities, floating hell fortresses - to name four.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jaws-of-destruction"}
