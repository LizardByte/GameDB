{"id": "WKXeK1XcVow", "snippet": {"title": "BEACON - Reveal Trailer", "description": "Beacon is a Sci-Fi Action Roguelike that asks you to fight, die and mutate yourself to overcome a randomly generated hostile planet. Coming soon for Windows, Mac, and Xbox One.\n\n---------------------\n\nYou step out of the confined pod, disorientated and blinking. As your vision clears, a desolate view forms to greet you. The burning wreckage of your ship - your home - lies scattered cruelly across the surface of an alien landscape.\n\nYou must have come down hard. Picking your way through the remains of the ship, you look for answers, a weapon, a radio. Instead, you find a body. Your body.\n\nWell, you think, at least the cloning bay still works.\n\n-------------------\n\nPlayed as a top-down shooter, you must fight your way through a randomly generated hostile world, all the while trying to locate your emergency distress beacon and escape the planet into which your ship has crashed.\n\nMore information can be found at:\nhttp://beacon.monothetic.com\nhttps://twitter.com/MONOTHETIC\nhttps://www.facebook.com/monothetic\n\nMusic from the trailer can be found at:\nhttps://monothetic.bandcamp.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKXeK1XcVow/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKXeK1XcVow/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKXeK1XcVow/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKXeK1XcVow/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKXeK1XcVow/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "BEACON - Reveal Trailer", "description": "Beacon is a Sci-Fi Action Roguelike that asks you to fight, die and mutate yourself to overcome a randomly generated hostile planet.
