Later enemies also have projectile weapons that the player must dodge. They are defeated by throwing a found object at them or hitting them with an always-equipped pipe. Jumping on the enemies' heads will push them down a level or off the screen entirely. Levels feature either boss battles or a pile of gold bars at the end, worth various points depending on the level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mr-goemon"}
