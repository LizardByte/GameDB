The player first commands only one knight, with several others fighting on his side. During the course of the game, the player will control up to four parties of warriors simultaneously. The RTS element with sending troops to battle enemies or protect important locations co-exists with rather simple \"hack-and-slash\" combat mechanics that apply to the characters which are controlled directly by the player.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legion-legend-of-excalibur"}
