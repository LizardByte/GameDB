This follows pioneering ideas in the Sim-series such as Building a city, using a helicopter to keep them running smoothly and guiding an entire planet from birth to death.\n\nThe MouseSwing control mode sees your player deliver his shot, complete with back-swing and follow-through, based on your precise mouse movements, with the aim of reflecting golf mechanics more authentically. A more conventional three-click mode is also offered.\n\nA complete course designer is included. It can generate randomized terrain layouts for you to fill in with hazards, such as water hazards, bunkers and trees, as well as lava and other unrealistic novelties.\n\nInternet and LAN options to take on up to 3 others exist. There are six different views on shot replays.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/simgolf", "collections": [{"id": 4628, "name": "Sim"}]}
