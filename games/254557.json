With the flick of a finger, jump as high as you can without plummeting to the bottom, then brag to your Twitter and Facebook friends or envious onlookers.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/springfling", "videos": [{"id": 92570, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "csBDxHygN_0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csBDxHygN_0", "title": "SpringFling iPhone game trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/csBDxHygN_0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
