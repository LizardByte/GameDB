The turtles then have to fight Shredder's army through multiple eras of time to defeat him.", "summary": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled is an enhanced remake of the 1991 arcade game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, which itself is a sequel to the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.
