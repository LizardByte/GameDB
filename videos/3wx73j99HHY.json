Battle Santa 64 is a special 2023 Christmas single player version of Battle Kart 64 (https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5618/) that follows the tradition of the OverKart 64 Christmas Mod (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM-kXa55EdE).\n\nIn Battle Santa 64, you play as Santa Claus trying to take back the presents stolen by Bowser, Wario, and Donkey Kong.  You have five minutes to collect as many as you can.  They will run away so you will need to chase them down, hit them, and pick up the presents they drop.  After five minutes you will see how many you have collected, what your high score is, and can restart by holding A and B simultaneously to try again.\n\nSpecial thanks to DeadHamster and MtZuul for making this possible.\n\nDownload link: \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Tte5cmnsm8fpYeQy4njAaerU-LwJngt/view?usp=sharing\n\nPatch using a clean Mario Kart 64 (USA) rom using this online patcher: https://www.romhacking.net/patch/\n\n=====================================================\n\nCredits:\n\nTriclon - Programming, game mode, bots, cutscene, testing, and debugging.\n\nDeadHamster - Santa Claus model, present models and programming, Christmas Kimura logo, and bot AI paths.\n\nMtZuul - Modifying Luigi's voice to be Santa and importing Up on a Housetop music.\n\nIndividual title screen assets created by Triclon using Bing image creator, assembled in Photoshop by DeadHamster.\n\nUp on a Housetop Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n=====================================================\n\n\nCheck out my website: https://triclon.neocities.org\n\nI usually hang out in the Overkart 64 discord: https://discord.gg/WgvAdFZ8N7\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nYou can checkout the #battlekart64\u200b\u200b channel there for the latest info on Battle Kart 64 and download the latest beta versions.\n\nCheck out the Overkart 64 channel for more Mario Kart 64 hacking and custom courses:   https://www.youtube.com/c/OverKart64%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3wx73j99HHY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3wx73j99HHY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3wx73j99HHY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Battle Santa 64 (Special Christmas Mario Kart 64 battle mode rom hack)", "description": "(Download link below)\n\nMerry Christmas!
