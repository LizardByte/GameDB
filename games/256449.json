We've massively expanded the technology tree, extended the timeline to 1956, and developed some truly awesome alternate-history paths for nearly every country. Road to 56 is all about alternate history and giving you lots of options to make a new world. If you want to run a purely historical game, this is not the mod for you. New units, troop experience system, expanded difficulty modifiers, new releasable nations, more lovely laws, and a whole bunch of other things that will make you more popular at parties.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-road-to-56"}
