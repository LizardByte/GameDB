In 1996-1997, Nintendo and St. Giga distributed F-Zero to their Super Famicom Satellaview subscribers with 2 multi-week, timed events. BS F-Zero Grand Prix contained 4 new machines and 19 courses, including 4 new courses across 4 remixed leagues. BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 used only the 4 new machines and 4 new courses from BS F-Zero Grand Prix, along with 6 more new courses, for a total of 2 leagues. A downloadable companion game, BS F-Zero 2 Practice, allowed players to race on 5 of the new courses, and has been preserved. Sadly, no known copies of the 5 Forest and Metal Fort courses have ever been found.\nBS F-Zero Deluxe combines all 3 games into a single package, with the 5 lost courses meticulously restored from recorded footage. Two new leagues have been named BS-1 and BS-2, and present the 10 new courses as they were in BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2. Choose from any of the 8 machines, and race on 25 courses across 5 leagues", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-f-zero-deluxe", "videos": [{"id": 107021, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "sDcrM706gws", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDcrM706gws", "title": "The Lost F-Zero Games Are Restored & Playable", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sDcrM706gws/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
