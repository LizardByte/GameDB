You can do almost anything ranging from recreating your favourite battles to purely beating each other up. \n \nFeatures include: Melee and Energy attacks, Flying, Powering up, Running, Swimming, Jumping and even Transforming! \n \nThere will be three game mods: \n \n- Deathmatch: For all on all mayhem \n- Team Deathmatch: For some Good vs Evil fun \n- Capture the Dragonballs (CTDB): Because who doesn't want a magical dragon to grant them wishes. \n \nEach character will be unique. They will have their own signature moves and have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example one may be be better at melee but have a lower ki reserve, while another will be their opposite. \n \nESF is a difficult game to master so newbies beware (And pro's be helpful), because you will be in for the time of your life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
