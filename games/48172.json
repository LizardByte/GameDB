Though very beautiful, the strangely quivering bubbles are part of a sinister plan, concocted by the evil Emperor O-Dinten. With the patented Dura-Bubble, he plans to profit from fun itself by controlling all the games under the sea. Can you stop him and restore \"The Freedom to Have Fun\" to the undersea world of Atlantis? It's a brain-bursting bubble battle to pop thousands of beautiful bubbles before they overflow to the open sea!"}
