The player can also reach different endings depending on how many Augers and Martin family members are captured.", "summary": "You'll get caught in the night - NIGHT TRAP!\n\nOriginally developed by Digital Pictures in 1987 and released in 1992, Night Trap has been completely rebuilt, bringing it to a level of video quality never before seen.\n\nNight Trap tells the story of five teenage girls spending the weekend at the Martin home.
