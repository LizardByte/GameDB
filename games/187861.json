Just a quick blurb in the back of some magazines saying it was for sale. It was never released. This is a sequel to that mythical game.\n\nAs Kyonshi Hui and Jiangshi Bo, it is your quest to banish all evil in all 100 levels - 10 original stages, including the boss -- a mutated mass of pure evil. Hui prefers zapping foes while Bo prefers absorbing their life force.\n\nFight your way through various platforming arcade levels and avoid obstacles such as spikes and enemies on the ground below. Use the platforms to avoid being hit and use your zap ability to defeat the enemies and raise your high score! You'll eventually face off against bosses and never ending waves of enemies as you try to defeat one.\n\nYou can team up via local co-op and get through the levels with a little help from a friend! With controller support, you both can play in various styles of setup.", "summary": "Yeah Yeah Beebiss II is the sequel to a game considered as lost media.
