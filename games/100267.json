Playing as Kenshiro, you will travel trough deserts, cities, and the other anime's places facing hordes of baddies with the deadly Hokuto martial arts. Sometimes against some enemies the action freezes and the player is required to press a certain combination of buttons in order to perform a special technique and kill the antagonist. The action is divided in levels, divided in many sub-chapters. At the end of each level the player is allowed to save the progresses achieved on the memory card. The game is pretty gory and fast paced. It also follows very closely the anime's storyline and uses long cutscenes (done with the game engine) to describe the plot developments. A 2 player versus mode with all the main anime characters is available after beating the single player game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hokuto-no-ken--3"}
