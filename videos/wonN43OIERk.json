I don't know, but it doesn't seem to be RPG Maker.\nI do NOT own anything on this video, all credit to their respective creators.\n\nIf the creator wants me to take this down, please tell me.\n\u3082\u3057\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3053\u308c\u3092\u524a\u9664\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u671b\u3080\u306a\u3089\u3001\u79c1\u306b\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\u3002 (DeepL)\n\nThis video could also be called \"Absolute Dumbass plays a game with puzzles without a walkthrough and suffers\". \n\nApologies for the choppy footage. I didn't know what settings I should use for this and I paid the consequences for it I guess. I also paused the recording a lot since I had to look up answers which is why the audio might cut sometimes.\n\nAlso no subtitles sorry. Although I suppose that's the norm now for me. Whoops.\n\nVideo only shows the Normal Ending.\n\n...I have never actually played Ao Oni. *gets booed off the stage or something*\n\n...I do know of it, obviously but never had a chance to play it. It just doesn't seem like it's for me. I prefer RPG Horror with deeper stories as some may be able to tell. Ones with characters deeper than \"smart\", \"scared\", \"some guy i guess\" and \"girl\". I can see the appeal but it's not for me. (I have watched videos of it and know how it goes)\n\nBut since I had this suggested to me, I thought why the hell not. I hadn't actually seen much gameplay of this so why not go in blind! Except for many regrets since I have a very small brain and puzzles make me feel stupid. (since I am)\n\nIt doesn't help this game doesn't have a proper walkthrough online. At least a full one. (I didn't want to use video playthroughs as those are slow but I did do so sometimes) Which is why I just went for the normal ending. I would've gone for the best ending possible if... there was a proper text walkthrough. But it seems this game's kind of forgotten in the public zeitgeist so that will probably not happen unless some really dedicated fan decides to do so.\n\nThe main theme's a banger though. \n\nArt is nice. Could've used more expression but I guess the original Ao Oni didn't do that so it's not a big deal.\n\nAm I now a sham for covering a game that isn't made in RPG Maker? It's very RPG Maker-like and I think it could be made with RPG Maker if they tried so... I guess so? Like... If people can call Project Kat RPG Maker (it's Godot) then you can give me some slack here.\n\nAlso, Hiroshi carrying that glass of water the entire game like a champ. It makes for a... very funny mental image. At least for me.\n\nIt's hard for me to talk about a fangame to something I have no deep attachment to haha. I do have to give slack to certain things since they're like the original (like random chases). \n\nMaybe the other endings give more context I dunno. I won't try for the apparent perfect ending though. This was fully blind as one might expect. I did use videos to assist me with things which is why I solved some puzzles really fast.\n\nI just assume the ending was quite barebones because of it being the normal ending and feeling kind of shallow I guess.\n\nIf there was a better walkthrough for the whole game (text, not video) I might try for the better ending(s) but not in a while.\n\nThis just leads me wondering if the story's explained more if you do better. Probably. Endings can be like that. Although I do suppose it's good the story makes you want to know more especially if you didn't do everything right. Like... there must be something deeper right?\n\nI did like this well enough. I just want to know what the whole thing's deal was and because I just got a normal ending I will never know unless I replay and I tend to replay games after I haven't played them in a long time. And I do have a backlog so that might mess things up for that.\n\nBut that's it. Thank you for the suggestion and I hope this was fine enough.
