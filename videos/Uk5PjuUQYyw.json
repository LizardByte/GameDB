What do you expect?\n- One of my ambitious side-projects besides my usual Just Shapes and Beats fanstories.\n- VARIOUS extended tilesets and decorations based on the Super Cat Tales and Neutronized Universe Games (Drop Wizard Tower, Slime Pizza, etc.)\n- Old and new backgrounds, featuring afternoon/night variants for almost each background\n- Featuring 10 playable cats! (Alex, Brutus, Shinji, Kuro, Amy, Olli, Sergeant McMeow, Luna, Pascal, and... a new cat from the Brutus reveal trailer?)\n- And Neutronized crossovers! (Teo from Drop Wizard, Slime from Slime Laboratory/Slime Pizza, etc.)\n- 100 playable maps... I guess? I mean, you can make more with the level editor.\n- 3 worlds will be bundled with the game! There's already a built-in world editor for creating more worlds!\n- Take bells to kittens!\n- Made with love and care!\n- Dedicated to Florian Hufsky and Gionathan Pesaresi.\n\n\nRELEASE DATE: When it's finished!
