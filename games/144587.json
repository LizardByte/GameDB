A state-of-art space ship equipped with the most powerful A.I. ever created, Vassago, ventured out of our solar system towards one of the closest, habitable exoplanets humans were able to find. Communication with Vassago proved to be more difficult than anticipated. By the time the spaceship reached its destination, the connection was completely lost. After a few years of no response, the mission was declared a failure and soon everyone either forgot about it or, in some cases, denied to even admit it ever happened. Humanity decided that it is too soon to venture outside Kuiper belt yet and the resource would be better spent elsewhere.\n\nAround 200 years later, as every 150 years, a comet came to visit our sky. While a pretty sight, it was commonly regarded that it is nothing more than a once-in-a-while occurrence with no real, material value attached to it. Nonetheless, one small and promising european space company, Sagittarius, decided to check its surface. By that time, after many dangerous incidents, heavy restrictions were put to the whole field of Artificial Intelligence. A Sagittarius spaceship, controlled by a toned-down A.I. called Jurij landed on the comet. Surprisingly, the measurements sent by Jurij indicated that the comet is astonishingly rich with resources. Unfortunately, there was something else. Before the connection with Jurij was severed, Sagittarius received disturbing data seemingly regarding the forgotten exoplanet mission. Unfortunately, due to political uneasiness and bureaucracy, the company was disbanded and their findings never came out to the public. The comet passed the Earth as the usual and for the next 150 years everything seemed to get back to normal.\n\nIn the current year of 2437, the comet once again comes close to the Earth. The player character is a part of a drone expedition sent out to investigate the comet once more. The knowledge that Sagittarius scientists once possessed about the subject is long gone. The player and his fellow drones, accompanied by friendly A.I. operator, enter the comet\u2019s atmosphere and discover a disturbing sight. It appears as if it was in some way inhabited by something. Before they even got time to send their findings back to the Earth, an attack unleashes. Almost all of the crew gets destroyed, while the player character is struck by EMP charge. After they come back to their senses, it becomes clear that now only they and their faithful operator stand in the way of something very ominous.", "summary": "Elusive Verge is a third-person sci-fi exploration game set on a Comet on its way around the Earth. You take control over a drone, one of the two survivors of an attack on your expedition party. Alongside the other survivor, Artificial Intelligence residing inside a space station, you have no other choice than to find out who tried to destroy you, what was their motivation and how to stop them. You face your enemies head-on, in a fast and spectacular space combat. The enemy is dangerous and violent but thankfully, you have a range of various weapons and combat gadgets at your disposal. As a true survivor, you craft your own tools and to do so, you need resources. With the possibility of digging into the vast extent of destructible terrain, Elusive Verge lets you unleash your inner miner. And who knows, maybe you will find something more than ore? On top of that, you should never forget about your space-station. Not only it allows you to upgrade and research equipment, it is also an essential piece to overcoming your foe. Without it, you wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nFight off the enemy hordes, protect and improve your station, and literally dig into the secret of the Comet.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elusive-verge", "videos": [{"id": 46530, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lc8xLoa3vek", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc8xLoa3vek", "title": "Elusive Verge - Dev In Progress [March 2021]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lc8xLoa3vek/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
