Develop dream dwellings down to the last brick and construct cityscapes crawling as far as the eye can see in this stimulating simulation game! Compete with other towns in the rankings, or take it easy and go at your own pace.\n\nBuild houses to have people move into your town, then add shops and lots of other facilities, making it a vibrant, lovely place to live. Stores like the bike shop or car dealer will sell vehicles to your residents, allowing them to travel further and visit more places. Acquire more areas as your town grows, discover new facilities to build, help the residents find new jobs, plan the town down to the last detail to make sure it's convenient for everyone...
