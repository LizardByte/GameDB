I've never been big on making techbases, but I had fun exploring some ideas with this one. Fingers crossed that it's bug-free and some kind of entertaining!\n\nIn terms of difficulty, I tried to aim for that Plutonia/Scythe/Valiant range (with varying degrees of success). It's not a complete pushover, but not overly punishing.\n\nHurt Me Plenty was what the map was built for (\"\"intended experience\"\"). It has some kick to it here and there, but most players shouldn't feel too out of their element. Ultra-Violence is just HMP with a few extra cheeky monsters/encounters, intended to catch the player off guard a bit more.\nHNTR is now Hunted! Taking inspiration from Mutabor's \"Onslaught!\", this is an alternate version of the map for anyone who prefers their Doom extra spicy. Gets into slaughter territory, and I probably wouldn't recommend it as a first impression.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nensha"}
