The game thrusts players into a world of freelance space hunters in the XXI-XXII century A.D. during a time of political crisis for the all-powerful Empire and the three mega-corporations that control all the known worlds. Corruption prospers planet-side and only space can give a man his freedom, but not without a cost: space is not a safe place anymore. Human space pirates, rogue AI computers that rebelled against humanity and empire patrol ships roam space in search of easy prey.\n\nPlayers begin the game as a bounty hunter with little more than an old, run-down space fighter and a dream, but as they advance in the game and prosper, their piloting and battle skills improve, allowing access to more advance spacecraft. Players can control a party of up to six bounty hunters, each possessing different skills, abilities and personality.\n\nTeam tactics give players vast opportunities in battles when shear fire power isn't enough. Tactical ruses, planning and executing ambushes or deploying spaceships' special abilities provide cunning commanders the ability to crush enemies according to their style of play.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wolves", "videos": [{"id": 5352, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZZcT8pl1iJU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZcT8pl1iJU", "title": "Star Wolves Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZZcT8pl1iJU/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1320, "name": "Star Wolves"}]}
