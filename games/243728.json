The boy is awakened by his brother who tells him what has happened and instructs him along the way. The game is played on static screens with platforms, enemies, hazards, etc. In the beginning the boy has no weapons, so he must avoid all enemies or attack them stealthy with a punch. Later on he acquires a weapon and magical spells. Along the way the boy can collect coins which allow him to buy spells and potions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/forgotten-warrior"}
