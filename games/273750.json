The three preliminary rounds are blackjack, slot machines, and video poker; with the final confrontation being five-card draw poker. The player is provided with ten thousand dollars in his bank account at the start of each round. Each preliminary round awards the winner with a bonus of ten thousand dollars and five draw poker points to be used in the final round; the loser receives no money and two points.\n\nThe game's practice mode also includes craps, though it never appears in the game's missions.\n\nFor a price, players can buy a variety of special cheating tools in the hopes of making a profit off the gangsters, who often use cheating methods of their own.[3][4] When running low on cash, the gangsters increase the frequency of their cheating in an attempt to regain their cash from the player.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/high-stakes-gambling", "videos": [{"id": 100364, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dqDxXfwxmEQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqDxXfwxmEQ", "title": "Game Boy - High Stakes Gambling \u00a9 1992 Sculptured Software - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dqDxXfwxmEQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 100365, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JI8js2F51Yo"}]}
