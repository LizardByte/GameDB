Fight also against different kinds of bosses, that can be more ranged or melee oriented, all with their own special moves and abilities. Players, if they survive a number of rounds/waves, will be able to choose from a wide range of different perks or abilities and upgrade them later on to give them an edge as the waves get harder and harder the longer they survive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/were-all-going-to-die"}
