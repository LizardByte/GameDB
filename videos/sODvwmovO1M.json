This trailer, the first in the \"Tactical-Action-Racing\" series focuses on the racing and driving components of the game. Fuel Overdose is scheduled for release on PlayStation\u00aeNetwork and PC.\n\n\nAs great fans of the top-down/isometric view racers of the 80's and 90's, we wanted to bring the driving experience of these games back to life. From the very beginning our ambition has been to reconnect with a racing experience that would be fun and easy to learn, and at the same time deep and challenging. \n\nBut we also wanted to introduce innovative game features such as the grappling hooks that you can use to grab other vehicles, to get back on track, or to perform perfect turns. Hardcore racers will also have the opportunity to test their driving skills and improve their performance with very advanced techniques such as skidding, drifting and spins.\n\nAnd because Fuel Overdose has always been about playing the game the way you want to play it (more details in the coming \"Tactical\" trailer), our ambition was also to give racers the freedom to choose. So depending on your race strategy and on your driving style, Fuel Overdose proposes several types of vehicles and customization options so you can improve the performances and modify the handling of your ride.\n\nLast, even though Fuel Overdose is an action racer, the game offers a series of challenges and game modes both offline and online, that focus on the racing aspect, such as drift, weapon-free and time attack modes.\n\n\nTo sum up, Fuel Overdose racing, it's:\n\u2022 The good old feeling of top-down/isometric racing \n\u2022 Grappling hooks to grab your enemies and perform perfect turns \n\u2022 A wide variety of vehicles, driving styles and customization options\n\u2022 An array of advanced techniques: skidding, drifting and spins\n\u2022 For the race purists, offline and online weapon-free and drift challenges and game modes\n\n\n\nComing soon\nWhat we revealed here is only a small portion of the Fuel Overdose experience, so stay tuned for the coming trailer that will reveal the other aspects of the game: Action (as hinted in the short teaser at the end of the\" Racing\" trailer) and Tactical.\n\n\n\n\"PlayStation\" is a registered trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. \n\"Fuel Overdose\", and \"I-FRIQIYA\" and are registered trademarks in the US and/or other countries.
