Except this young lady just so happens to turn to ash in the sunlight. So you'd better be careful where you're pointing those rays!\n\nControl the direction of the sun's rays to drive off monsters who approach the girl. The sun will rotate right while the screen is being touched, and rotate left when you release your finger. Be careful not to shine light on the girl while her parasol is down, or she'll take damage. Her damage will heal over time, but if you continue to shine light on her, she'll turn to ash and you'll get a Game Over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/terasene-the-light-of-her-life", "videos": [{"id": 100194, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Mpf3qwd_QpY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpf3qwd_QpY", "title": "Terasene - English New Version", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mpf3qwd_QpY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
