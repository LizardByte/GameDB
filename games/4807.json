It was released on October 28, 2008 across multiple platforms. The game's product description refers to additional downloadable song packs being available. However, as of 28 April 2009, Disney Interactive Support has replied (to a query): \"Thank you for contacting us.In some circumstances we need to make some business decisions and drop certain projects that might have been planned or even announced previously. This case falls in one of those situations and currently we don't have any plans on adding any downloadable contents for either Disney Sing It title.\" \n \nThe game has received mixed reviews, with both 1UP.com and IGN praising its accessibility towards kids but finding serious fault with the gameplay, with Official Xbox Magazine ultimately calling it a \"gateway game\" at best. \n \nTrack List \n \nAly & AJ - Like Whoa \nAly & AJ - Potential Break-Up song \nAly & AJ - Chemicals React \nBilly Ray Cyrus - Ready, Set, Don't Go \nCamp Rock - We Rock \nCamp Rock - Start the Party \nCamp Rock - This is Me \nCamp Rock - Gotta Find You \nCamp Rock - Play My Music \nCamp Rock - Hasta La Vista \nCamp Rock - Here I Am \nCheetah Girls 3 - One World \nCheetah Girls 2 - Dance with Me \nCheetah Girls 2 - The Party's Just Begun \nCorbin Bleu - Push It To The Limit \nEverlife - Find Yourself In You \nEverlife - Real Wild Child \nHannah Montana - Best of Both Worlds \nHannah Montana - Life is What You Make It \nHannah Montana - Nobody's Perfect \nHannah Montana - Rock Star \nHigh School Musical - Breaking Free \nHigh School Musical - Get'cha Head in the Game \nHigh School Musical - Start of Something New \nHigh School Musical 2 - Bet On It \nHigh School Musical 2 - Fabulous \nHigh School Musical 2 - What Time Is It \nHigh School Musical 2 - You Are the Music in Me \nJesse McCartney - She's No You \nJordan Pruitt - Jump to the Rhythm \nJordan Pruitt - Outside Looking In \nMiley Cyrus - Girls Night Out \nMiley Cyrus - See You Again \nMiley Cyrus - Start All Over \nVanessa Hudgens - Say OK", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disney-sing-it", "videos": [{"id": 31235, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OkpgJNrspjs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkpgJNrspjs", "title": "Disney Sing it  Trailer - Riker Lynch - PS3 - PS2 - Wii - Xbox 360", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OkpgJNrspjs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
