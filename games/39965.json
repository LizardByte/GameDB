The opposing two-man teams face off for a match played in four quarters (2 to 5 minutes each), on improvised courts in 3 different locations: the alley, the park, and the harbor.\n\nNaturally, it ain't just about being cool and shooting some b-ball outside of the school: on each side you have a couple of guys who are up to no good, with a constant enthusiasm for making trouble in the neighborhood. As such, Punk Shot joyfully turns basketball into a full-contact sport - heads will be bashed, noses punched, and private parts kicked. To top it off, each court features an assortment of environmental hazards, from slippery banana peels and having your butt set on fire, to the park dogs and their special taste for pants.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/punk-shot"}
