Kuukiyomi is a social puzzle game in which players try out different responses to social situations. These range from everyday moments, like making room for others on the bus or standing to one side on the escalator, to wilder and silly choices like performing in sync as a backup dancer or joining a Japanese superhero team. Each situation is presented as a fast minigame, similar to the WarioWare series, with no real explanation; players are left to themselves to judge what it is they need to do. There are 100 minigames in all, and after finishing every game players are given a personality reading based on their performance in various categories such as \"social appropriateness\" or \"reaction speed\". After finishing the game once, players unlock the ability to replay any of the stages individually and an endurance competition with three of the different minigames where players have to see how many times they can complete it in a row.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kuukiyomi"}
