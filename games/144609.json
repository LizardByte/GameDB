Encounter dangerous foes and meet friendly souls. Loot hidden treasure chests and items from legendary creatures. Gather resources to build a shack, a mansion or even a castle. Craft your own weapons and tools to prepare for an unforgettable and epic adventure. \n \nMeor is a fantasy-themed sandbox game in early development. The engine of the game is developed with custom voxel GPU technology. The world is one big grid and each element in the grid is called a voxel. Voxels have many different properties like material, density and sun light. \n \nThe game runs almost exclusively on your graphics card. This allows all the voxels near you to be controlled at the same time! The physics, the AI and all other simulations run on the graphics card as well, enabling many objects to interact with you and each other. \n \nhttps://twitter.com/nelstuff is where you can find the latest development updates!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/meor", "videos": [{"id": 46590, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "y-rseyQSGAA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-rseyQSGAA", "title": "Voxel Game in Development: Meor Pre-Alpha, A Sandbox Game on GPU", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y-rseyQSGAA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
