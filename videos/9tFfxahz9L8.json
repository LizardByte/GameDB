It is a single-player side-scrolling action game where the player controls Ariel on a quest to defeat the evil Ursula, the sea witch.\n\nThe game begins underwater, where Ariel can shoot bubbles to trap her foes and throw them. She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to break open treasure chests. Treasure chests contain power-ups to increase her bubbles' power and range. Ariel can collect icons scattered throughout the levels to restore health, gain extra lives, or increase the range/power of her bubbles. There are six stages that Ariel must traverse to find Ursula. The stages are The Coral Sea, Sunken Ship, Sea of Ice, Undersea Volcano, and finally two battles at Ursula's Castle.\n\n#nes #nintendo #playthrough #gaming #retro #walkthrough #longplay #gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9tFfxahz9L8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9tFfxahz9L8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9tFfxahz9L8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9tFfxahz9L8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9tFfxahz9L8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Disney's The Little Mermaid (1991) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "description": "Playthrough of The Little Mermaid, developed by Capcom.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Subscribe for more videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCCmsDPICSz4MfC07fhoNAw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dangermeat\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/danger_meat\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/danger_meat\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dangermeat\n\nAbout the game:\nThe Little Mermaid is a licensed action game by Capcom for the NES and Game Boy, based on the 1989 Disney film of the same name.
