After confessing about his former life as a Ciro soldier, Dominic volunteers to travel back to Ciro\u2019s lands to ask the military council not to hurt the Leeble Village. Achaius and Aero also agree to go. \n \nTogether, Achaius, Aero, and Dominic begin their journey to the continent of Ciro with the purpose of saving the village. All the while, Achaius\u2019 desire to find his twin and understand the meaning behind their separation has been growing stronger.
