You are a soldier of Tech Com--a ragged team of human-resistance fighters intent upon stopping the cybernetic onslaught in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles.\n\nThis prequel to The Terminator film lets you play as three characters--each with specialized skills and abilities. Your ultimate goal is to travel back in time to 1984, with the hope of preventing a relentless Terminator model T-800 from murdering Sarah Connor--mother of resistance leader John Connor. Armies of cyborgs stand in your way, but you'll have plenty of new weapons and melee moves to clear the path.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
