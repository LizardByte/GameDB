In this game for children of ages 4 to 8 they explore a haunted house that's filled with strange creatures and fun-filled games. There is no real horror to be found, but strange ghosts and monsters from both Earth and beyond do hide out in the house. Each room features original art from the pop-up book and can be explored at will. Clicking on hotspots in the room activates funny animations that will appeal to children. These are accompanied by sometimes ominous music but mostly funny sound effects. Using a map of the house the player can quickly travel to any part of the house. There's no real objectives rather than to have fun and explore.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jan-pienkowski-haunted-house", "videos": [{"id": 62713, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LLCPWRSG5vw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCPWRSG5vw", "title": "Jan Pienkowski's Haunted House playthrough [Part 1]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LLCPWRSG5vw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
