There he awaited the arrival of Roach, an eight legged man-like creature with a crooked nose and an eyeless pink face. That moment never came. Startled, again, he leaped over the mounds and met his maker, a man who had once been a king and whose rule was unquestioned.\n\nThe world fell silent after he became a god.

And the perpetrators were punished with a fate much worse than death. With each breath their lungs grew in size, until they became as fat as Zeppelins.\n\nTheir ribs were shattered. Inhaling the poisonous and colorless gas that surrounded them made them grow infected stingers. Purple patches appeared on their fingers. They were paralyzed with fear as their bodies contorted into bridges. The weaker ones fell, while the strongest survived. The great god Agrippa had seen them rise and drop bombs upon his lands. But, instead of exploding, they released weird appendages that squirmed.", "summary": "Just a weird survival horror game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mongol-corpses-of-the-divine", "videos": [{"id": 113782, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "fHGcGdUAKPs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHGcGdUAKPs", "title": "Mongol - Corpses of the divine - gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fHGcGdUAKPs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
