Although Morbus, the leader of the Dark Tribe, has been finally defeated, his tribe is not completely eradicated. Some survivors still pose a threat and wreak destruction. We can enjoy three more campaigns offering over 50 missions in total. The players can assume the role of the leader of the Romans, Mayans or Vikings. Each nation has different tasks to perform: the Romans must defeat the Dark Tribe once and for all, the Mayans must stop the Roman offensive, and the Vikings must discover an ancient world.
