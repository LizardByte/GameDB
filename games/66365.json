During the missions the scope is limited because all missions have a time limit. Only the final bonus mission, where the player is awarded luxury cars, can be played without any restrictions. The player can move around on foot or in cars that can be stolen. The game is controlled from a third-person perspective with an optional inside view while driving a car. Movement is done through the keyboard while the mouse is used to steer, zoom and rotate the camera.\n\nBy performing missions or beating up people the player earns cash. This can be used to repair a car or get gas as all cars only have a limited supply. This is shown in the bottom right corner of the screen while the bottom left corner shows a mini-map of the city to view gas stations, targets or police cars when a tracker has been installed. In the different missions the player will need to steal cars, install trackers on police cars, race another character, kill an entire opposing gang or escort the boss. While moving around on foot, the protagonist can beat up other character or use any of the three available weapons: a pistol, a uzi gun or a wrench. The wrench can also be used to remove the wheels from stationary cars to immobilize them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
