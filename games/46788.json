Up to five crystals can be collected per player to power up the Senshi's special attacks. During the most difficult moments in battle, Tuxedo Mask will appear and throw a rose, which is a bonus to pick up and depart.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 40805, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "U7QIYJN-xBM"}]}
