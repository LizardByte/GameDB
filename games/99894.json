Players compete for the highest score, by picking sushi from a conveyor belt, and scoring the sushi they took at the end of each round. Each type of sushi earns points in different ways, and players must max their combos and prevent opponents from doing the same. \n \nPlay a pair of Tempuras for 5 points, but play one on its own and you'll get none! Nigiris can be dipped in Wasabi to triple their points! Pudding doesn't score until the end of the game, but it can clinch a victory or cause a defeat! \n \nSushi Go is simple enough to play with the family, but thousands of sushi combinations will keep even diehard strategy fans playing. Do you take a Tempura to get points for a pair? Or take Sashimi to stop your opponent from completing his triplet? Pudding doesn't earn points in the round, but you'll lose points at the end of the game if you have the fewest!", "videos": [{"id": 24145, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "j1XUX2V0DVE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1XUX2V0DVE", "title": "Sushi Go for iOS trailer!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1XUX2V0DVE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
