Tsunage! Itadaki no Keshiki!! is a volleyball game based on the anime and manga series Haikyu!!. Rather than an action sports game, it is a tactical strategy game with turn-based gameplay to manage the squad with the individual players to beat opponents in matches.\n\nThe game can be played in a Game or Adventure mode. Players must converse in the adventure mode and communicate with other characters. The tale can vary from the original series based on the role the player wants to manage, as new plot lines activate. In the game mode, the players can compete against opposing teams in volleyball matches.\n\nAlso included is a Final Haikyu Quest mode, which takes the players and places them in a traditional RPG itself (similar to Dragon Quest). Instead of their team uniform, characters assume looks identical to RPG classes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/haikyu-tsunage-itadaki-no-keshiki", "videos": [{"id": 134112, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sOylaY2Srcw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOylaY2Srcw", "title": "Haikyuu!!
