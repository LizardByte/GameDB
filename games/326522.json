Those were the words that once described you, and you would\u2019ve shrugged your shoulders in agreement. Your day was a never-ending cycle of the same thing. Wake up, go to class and study, work, visit your uncle, go to sleep, have traumatic nightmares, and repeat for another day. So, it would be an understatement to say that you didn\u2019t sign up for this.\n\nYou didn\u2019t sign up for the supernatural, to learn that werewolves, shapeshifters, witches, demons, and angels all exist. You didn\u2019t sign up for the target that now resides on your back, and the list of names that have you to blame for their untimely demise. And now, to add on to everything else, an old friend is re-appearing. Everyone has a secret, and you have no idea who you can trust.\n\nFight and hunt that which goes bump in the night. And avoid those that hunt you for their own purposes. Meet others with their own agenda. The world has shown its true colors, it\u2019s up to you how to deal with it.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/superstition"}
