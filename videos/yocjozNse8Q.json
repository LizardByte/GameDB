My only flaw with it was the control style having you press Up to move. It sometimes became troublesome, but all in all it was a fun game to play. \n\n\nPlease leave a comment down below if youd like to see more, and please dont forget to subscribe if you havent already. \n\nThanks for watching, check out all my other videos here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SHLIMPOLE", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yocjozNse8Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yocjozNse8Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yocjozNse8Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yocjozNse8Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yocjozNse8Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Skate Attack PS2 Gameplay (Midas/Zeroscale)", "description": "Skate Attack on the PS2 is a budget skateboarding game by Midas Interactive that not many people really took notice of at the time it was released  due to it being shadowed over by higher developed games like Tony Hawks.\nLooking at the game now though it has quite a few nice elements to it, and the graphics are quite nice and colourful and theres a lot to keep you entertained! \nThe game itself plays out more like a mission mode type game and has you transporting yourself over the city maps fullfilling objectives in a set ammount of time. \nIts quite a fun game and has a great soundtrack, its a game Midas and Zeroscale should be proud of to be honest.
