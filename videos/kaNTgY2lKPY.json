It's a favorite of mine from way back in my youth. It's all but forgotten, but still a great retro game nonetheless. I remember enjoying this one at a hotel in Florida that had it's own arcade. At 12 years old, having a pool and an arcade right next to each other was the greatest thing ever. There are some rather loud sound effects in this game.
