To slow down or completely stop moving, the player has to rotate the ship to face the direction it came from, and generate the right amount of thrust to nullify its momentum. The ship has a limited amount of fuel to generate thrust with. This fuel comes in the form of \"Energy\" that is also used for the ship's Shields which protect it against collisions and enemy fire. Once all Energy is gone, the player's ship is destroyed. The ship can shoot to destroy asteroids and enemy ships. The ship can also be transformed at will into 3 different versions, namely the \"Speeder\", the fastest version, the \"Fighter\", which has the most firepower, and the \"Warrior\", which has extra armour.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blasteroids", "videos": [{"id": 99399, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BEINjz0Uzuw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEINjz0Uzuw", "title": "Blasteroids (rev 4) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEINjz0Uzuw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
