Not long after settling in he has an encounter with a strange girl with some unusual quirks. He wants to get to know her, partly out of boredom and partly because she was cute, but how does he approach a girl who seemingly has no interest in him, or anything else around her, for that matter?", "summary": "We've all heard the stories on the news about Old Man Nakai and his crazy creations in that dank lab by the beach. But I wonder have you heard about the one that escaped? Play as Haru Takamoto in this short visual novel about a young robot-girl and her journey in becoming 'human'."}
