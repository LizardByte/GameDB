This video was recorded as internal development material, but it was so much fun and so satisfying that we thought it was worth sharing it with you all. \nIn it you can see many of the things we are working on for the next version, like June Ravenmoon's ( @racingheart59 ) amazing work with our LS-GT1 category, work covering the physics of the tyre model (Simu 4.1), the refinement of the USR robots, which are now competing head to head with us, lots of new skins...\nWe can also take a look at our rear at the touch of a button thanks to the work of @madbad-82 (in this case, the rear wing has played a trick on us, but it will be fixed), and finally a track that will surely be familiar to you, Ardennen-Spa, created from scratch by leillo ( @leillo1975 ) and that for the moment you can find in our discussion forum:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/speed-dreams/discussion/tracks/thread/3025779840/\n\nThe car we drove in the video is a Zentek Z7-R, based on the amazing Saleen S7 GT1.
