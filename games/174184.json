There are high-speed descents, scattered obstacles requiring thread the needle maneuverability, daredevil jumps and unseen dangers ready to throw you off course at every turn. Miscalculate the speed and momentum or be too slow slamming on the brakes and your ball winds up in the purple abyss.", "summary": "Fancy a tightrope walk at 10,000 feet? How about snowboarding off an infinity-edge mountain? These are just a few of the death-defying feats required in the rolling ball platformer that is Iron Ball Ride. Don't let the peaceful mountain top setting fool you. This obstacle course in the clouds is black diamond rated in difficulty. The game requires precision timing and serious gaming chops to master the 40 levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-ball-ride"}
