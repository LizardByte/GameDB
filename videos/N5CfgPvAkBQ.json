Blagger and Son Of Blagger were platformers, whereas is an isometric action adventure.\n\nThe game takes place in a Hollywood movie studio. Steven Speilbun, revered for films including Close Encounters Of The Nasty Kind, and Teeth, is about to release his latest blockbuster.\n\nPlaying Blagger, you have broken into Hollywood (literally), and are attempting to steal the only copy of Speilbun's film.\n\n12 rooms are accessible, each with their own movie theme. You must defeat each character by throwing the appropriate prop(s) at them. Throwing the wrong prop has no effect, and they will continue chasing you down.\n\nOnce a character is defeated they will leave behind either 1 or 2 props which must be used against the remaining characters. Once all 12 rooms are conquered the 13th room - Speilbun's office - becomes accessible, and all characters reappear and require defeating one final time.\n\nBlagger can hold a maximum of 3 props. Also worth noting is that rooms cannot contain more than 3 props. If 3 props are already present then Blagger cannot throw anything.\n\nThe biggest challenge is determining which props defeat which characters, and planning the required route. The game has questionable logic - for example, Laurel & Hardy are defeated by the Ice-Cream and Red Bullet (was there a red bullet reference in a L&H episode?).\n\nThe title screen picture is nicely drawn. In-game graphics and gameplay are solid if unspectacular. The score/lives window occupies the entire bottom half which impacts visibility in the action window. A larger playing area would have improved the gameplay. The melodies are very good, many of them are instantly recognisable.\n\nAfter reching the end a 2nd loop was played. The only difference appeared to be that touching the lasers now kill Blagger rather than temporarily freezing him.\n\nInterestingly the game's cover includes E.T. who doesn't feature. Perhaps he went home before they could get his approval.\n\nThe below might provide better context to the gameplay:\n\n1) Tarzan defeated by any prop - White Disk already in room\n2) James Bond defeated by any prop - POW already in room\n3) Incredible Hulk defeated by White Disk - leaves behind Grey Bullet\n4) Batman defeated by POW - leaves behind Money + Red Bullet\n5) Kojak defeated by Money - leaves behind Arrow + Gun\n6) Midnight Express defeated by Grey Bullet + Gun - leaves behind Bow\n7) Robin Hood defeated by Arrow + Bow - leaves behind Ice-Cream\n8) Laurel & Hardy defeated by Ice-Cream + Red Bullet - leaves behind Grenade + Yellow Bullet\n9) Jaws defeated by Grenade + Gun + Yellow Bullet - leaves behind Kryptonite\n10) Superman defeated by Kryptonite - leaves behind Spray\n11) Mystery Man defeated by Gun + Spray + Yellow Bullet - leaves behind Lightsaber\n12) Darth Vader defeated by Lightsaber\n\n\n00:00  Title Screen\n01:50  Gameplay (Loop 1)\n09:35  Ending (Loop 1)\n10:08  Gameplay (Loop 2)\n17:44  Ending (Loop 2)\n18:17  Gameplay (Loop 3)\n18:25  Game Over", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5CfgPvAkBQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5CfgPvAkBQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5CfgPvAkBQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5CfgPvAkBQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N5CfgPvAkBQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Blagger Goes To Hollywood (C64 Longplay)", "description": "Publisher:  Alligata Software\nCoder:  Marcus Altman\nGraphics:  Marcus Altman\nMusic / SFX:  Tony Crowther\nYear:  1985\nPrice:  \u00a39.95 (tape) / \u00a310.95 (disk)\n\nBlagger Goes To Hollywood is the third and final instalment in the Blagger trilogy.
