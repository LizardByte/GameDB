It includes all twelve characters from the original game, plus three additional: the Builder, the Dragon Slayer, and the Merchant. Each AI has their own tactics and strategies created by Jimmy Sanders, game designer of the original physical board game released in 2016.\nLegends of Draxia is a victory point, resource management, indirect competition fantasy game with a 35-45 minute play time. Players can adjust the difficulty by selecting Easy or Normal mode. There are multiple paths to victory. Whether you\u2019d like to carve a path to glory by slaying monsters, gather resources to build cathedrals, or focus on casting powerful spells, there\u2019s a character optimized for that. With so many characters and so many paths, a winning strategy in one match does not guarantee a victory in future playthroughs.
