Up to four managers can join in, to lead their chosen team through the World Cup, from qualifying to the actual tournament. Tactics and training are hugely important due to the game's short time frame. \n \nThe players each have individual personalities, and these have been factored in during the game. Sometimes players will drink too much, fall in love, or have personality clashes with their team-mates or with you, all of which have to be factored in. The press will ask you loaded questions, so be careful how you answer.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/on-the-ball-world-cup-edition", "collections": [{"id": 1499, "name": "Anstoss"}]}
