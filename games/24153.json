It has two playing modes: time trial (single races against four to seven AI racers) and the championship which are 16 successive races on the 16 courses. At first there are only two motorbikes available, but successes in time trial mode unlock better ones to use in the championship. Also restricted is the number of available time trial courses; the rest also has to be unlocked first. The player can perform a wheelie which causes a considerate, temporary acceleration.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/suzuki-alstare-extreme-racing", "videos": [{"id": 50540, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "4jmJPrUujcA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jmJPrUujcA", "title": "Playthrough [DC] Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4jmJPrUujcA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
