The number shows the length of the line which will connect them.\n\nLink-a-Pix can always be solved using logic and deduction. You don't ever have to guess!\n\nThis game contains 120 brand new full-colour puzzles and 120 unique mono puzzles, designed by Conceptis Ltd. Puzzles range in difficulty and size from small introductory pictures to huge scrollable grids.\n\nContent previously available in Link-a-Pix Colour on Nintendo 3DS family systems can be downloaded as DLC and extra add-on packs will be released regularly.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/link-a-pix-deluxe"}
