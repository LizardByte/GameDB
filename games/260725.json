The player controls a trio of adventurers exploring a mysterious dungeon in order to gather funds to revitalize their town. The loot in the dungeon is randomized, with battles being turn-based affairs heavily dependent on the use of status and buffs/debuffs, as well as the right equipment.\n\nThe story is mostly humorous and unapologetically yuri, and is presented in a somewhat non-linear manner, with story scenes being unlocked by achieving certain conditions (for example, finding a random weapon in the dungeon, raising your affinity level with a certain character, or using a facility in the town a certain number of times). While the game uses a traditional leveling system, smart use of strategy is rewarded in the form of additional loot and bonus EXP awarded for beating the bosses below a recommended level.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/random-dungeon--1"}
