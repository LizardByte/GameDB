It is a danmaku game with shields and is perhaps Amusement Makers' most well-known work in the West. It is the first game of Project Blank and since it's part of that series, it's neither a Touhou Project nor a Seihou Project game. However, it pays homage to both with elements such as the in-game history, the Extra Stage and its music.\n\nSamidare takes place on and around Earth in the 30th century.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samidare"}
