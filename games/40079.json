{"id": 40079, "name": "Macho Mouse", "summary": "Macho Mouse is an arcade game which was released by Techstar in 1982; it runs on the hardware first used by Amenip and Centuri for Round-Up (two Zilog Z80s, running at 3.072 and 2.5 MHz, with two General Instrument AY-3-8910s running at 1.536 MHz for audio). The player must use the four-way joystick, to direct the eponymous \"Macho Mouse\" around a maze, leaving a trail of dots behind him as he goes (like Pac-Man in reverse), and causing images of his head to appear while avoiding cats that will kill him on contact - but as in Konami's Amidar, Macho Mouse can jump by means of a button and stun the cats for a short period of time. Between rounds, there is a \"slot machine\" similar to that of Chuo Co., Ltd.'s Funny Mouse (later re-released by Taito Corporation, as \"Super Mouse\")."}
