The game is presented in 3D and uses a battle system similar to Tales of Rebirth. Enemies and allies are all on 3 lines, with the player switching between them at will. The Touch Screen may be used for special attacks never before seen in the Tales series, allowing lots more variety in battle. The big feature of this game is the ability for certain characters to transform into werewolves, gaining extra power and speed at the cost of techniques.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 36030, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vakX42IEb3c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vakX42IEb3c", "title": "Tales of the Tempest TGS Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vakX42IEb3c/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
