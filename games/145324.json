It transforms the entire earth into one giant Pikmin game. There is not much known about the gameplay so far. Players discover Pikmin Seedlings which grow by absorbing Step Energy generated by walking. Also, their Pikmin Squad may pick up items along the way, like fruit. The fruit converts into Nectar, which players can give to Pikmin so that they can bloom flowers whose petals can be collected."}
