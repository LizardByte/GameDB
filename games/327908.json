Feeling out of sync with the rest of the world, you yearn for freedom and life beyond the bounds of your prison.\n\nYou find it in the form of a ravishing stranger and a long lost city, calling out to you across space and time. Something is beckoning underneath the ancient city's glimmering white tiles, something old and powerful. Someone.\n\nWill you resist the call beyond the veil and the promise of belonging it brings, or will you let yourself go and embrace the path destiny has set before you?\n\nThe choice is yours. Magnustor is waiting for you.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beyond-the-mist-beginnings", "collections": [{"id": 10985, "name": "The Soul Stone War"}]}
