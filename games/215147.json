They themed every level in it around comic books they like (Tebeo means comic in spanish).\n\nThe difficulty of this hack scales up a bit at the end of the game, and also at the last level of each overworld. Overall the game is easy/medium Kaizo difficulty.\n\nAll the mechanics and sprites are vanilla and almost all the graphics, except some stuff edited on yychr. It has custom palettes and music.\n\nAbout asm, it has some life quality patches, like instant retry and NoMoreSpriteTileLimits."}
