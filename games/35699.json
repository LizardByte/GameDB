Games are fast as you battle your opponents, turn them into scrap, and return them to your base, recycling them for parts before the other team can stop you. Your base uses the robot parts to create a giant robot super weapon that is unleashed to destroy the enemy\u2019s base!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rustbucket-rumble"}
