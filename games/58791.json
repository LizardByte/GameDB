After the man disappears in a flash of light, Mizoguchi is somehow provoked enough to search the globe's octopus dishes and to prove that Osaka has the best takoyaki in the world. He does this by awkwardly interrogating the series's characters although he usually misinterprets their explanations as insults or puns.", "summary": "Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! is a Super Famicom sequel to Data East's arcade fighting game series, featuring a story mode where Mizoguchi travels throughout the world to battle a mysterious masked figure (who Data East fans probably already know).
