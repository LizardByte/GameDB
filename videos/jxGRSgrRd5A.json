The game combines elements from the many games within the Ridge/Rage universe as well as adds quite a bit of exclusive new content and rewarding features. Of course, the game also looks and sounds phenomenal for a PSP game, especially one so early, and is one of the few 3D PSP games to move at a blistering 60FPS.

The game also incorporates nitro boosts and easier drifting than in past RR games and is easier for racing novices to pick up and play. This is a simple video showing the game in action.
