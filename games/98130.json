It is your task to deliver the planet.\n\nThe goal in Alien Breaker is to destroy all battalions, represented by blocks on the screen, by bouncing a ball off of a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom of the screen. The blocks are colored and may change colors when hit until they disappear. Levels are won by clearing all blocks from the screen and lost by letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the screen.\n\nAs some blocks are hit, 23 different bonus items can be released and fall down the screen. If the player catches them with the paddle, gameplay changes occur.\n\nThe game is comprised of 50 levels with 4 different enemy types and 2 bosses.
