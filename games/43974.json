The events of the game take place three years before those of the previous game, when the protagonist Tomoya Mikami was still attending middle school. The game primarily revolves around his relationships with his childhood friend Yue Imasaka and Ayaka Hizuki, whose tragic fate is mentioned in the first game.\n\nGameplay-wise, the prequel is identical to the preceding game, with the gameplay being reduced to occasional decision-making that influences the course of the story and ultimately leads it to different endings.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/memories-off-pure"}
