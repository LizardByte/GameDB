Find secrets, take down bosses, and if you die? Start from the bottom and reignite the fight.\n\nYou\u2019re what\u2019s left after a botched experiment in an abandoned castle made you a pile of undead sludge. All you need to escape is someone else\u2019s less-than-alive body and the sheer will to battle your way through a constantly changing, pixel art castle full of rogue enemies and terrifying bosses. Learn the ropes of action-packed 2D combat and platform exploration, master a variety of weapons and develop your strengths as you unravel the secrets of the dungeon, the castle and whatever lies beyond.\n\nAlso: don\u2019t worry about dying. That\u2019s what the giant pile of corpses in the dungeon is for. Fight, learn, die, start over and keep getting better.\n\nThe Netflix edition includes all of the free and paid downloadable content created for the original game, so members can experience the full scope of their escape from the first awakening.
