Each of the Vikings has a unique set of abilities:\n\nErik can run faster than the other two, can jump, and can bash through some walls (and enemies) with his helmet.\nBaleog can kill enemies with his sword, or from a distance with his bow (and a \"life-time supply of arrows\"). The bow can also be used to hit switches from a distance.\nOlaf can block enemies and their projectiles with his shield, and use his shield as a hang glider. Olaf's shield can also be used as a stepping stone for Erik to enable him to reach higher ground, which would not be possible without the shield.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 516, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "ZItppVpUwwc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItppVpUwwc", "title": "SNES The Lost Vikings", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZItppVpUwwc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
