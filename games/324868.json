The true power behind the clandestine research is a multi-national anarchistic group called Schwarzgeist.\n\nDuring the construction of the Black Mesa compound they began to secretly infiltrate the organization. By the time of the first successful retrieval of biologic matter from Xen, Schwarzgeist personnel were in key scientific positions. They managed to keep their identity secret until an inadvertent exposure during the resonance cascade disaster and ensuing containment revealed their existence.\n\nAlthough top Black Mesa management and the NSA are now aware of their presence, their true objectives remain a mystery. Intelligence gathering efforts have been hampered by Schwarzgeist's efficient and airtight organization. In fact, Dr. Newell was not a known member of the group until his attempt on Gordon Freeman's life. His human/Xen DNA decoding project and \"molecular transmutator\" equipment were skillfully disguised as pharmaceutical research. As the story of T2DEF unfolds, Gordon will soon discover just how deep their influence and control of Black Mesa personnel has gone . . . .", "summary": "Sequel to the original Todesangst, Todesangst 2 is a single player Half-Life modification, made by a team of 10 people taken for 15 months to develop and released in December 2002.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/todesangst-2-der-echte-feind", "videos": [{"id": 134917, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5BCAjfefloA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BCAjfefloA", "title": "[Half Life - Todesangst 2: Der Echte Feind] MOD Full Walkthrough.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BCAjfefloA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 134920, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "cvFYw1vV6so", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvFYw1vV6so", "title": "Edited T2DEF Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvFYw1vV6so/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
