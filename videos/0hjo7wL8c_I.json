Give me a break.\n\nSure, somebody suggested we try something different for our next video. Instead of a Chuhou Joutai trailer or other related video, we decided to take the very first game of the franchise that influenced Chuhou Joutai's gameplay, and see how Touhou 1: The Highly Responsive to Prayers might have looked like if it was made for the Famicom/NES.\n\nYes, this is a real game, made in GMS2, and is not an animation. I was originally going to submit it to the fifth Touhou Project fangame jam on itch.io, but complicated circumstances with the backgrounds prevented me from doing so. Want to play it?
