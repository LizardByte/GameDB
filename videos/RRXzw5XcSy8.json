Too bad no console so using emulator won't hurt eh?\n\nI'm gonna start recording and uploading but first let's talk about what I'm gonna do and don't on my gameplay. \n\n- I will cover most if not all everything in the game. This will include items, recruits, tricks,and scenes. Some of them will be done off screen like getting double beat rune and such. Some that I won't get like Valeria, color screen intro, missing animals (no octopus family, sorry) and/or bad ending. (Ridley is one of my fave char, I hate him die XD)\n- I won't finish Clive Quest, but at least the ending or end game ones. It still possible to gain everything earlier below 15 hours on Radat but the 20 hours on end game make me lazy lol. Besides, I hate the ending anyway. While Clive is one of few my powerhouse, so he will be mostly on my party.\n- I'm gonna using matilda leveling but before you're gonna call me using cheap trick, I will use different way as you can leveling there without Humprey and Futch, I'll let you know when I get there. And with other cheap trick, I think only Matilda and Inn trick that I'll use. It still not too much breaking game unlike stone-KO trick and lv 99 trick. Even with my emulator, I'm not using save-load state. I only use it when practise and planning on each section before true run and recording.\n- Pardon me if somehow the video got messed up or I'm a bit rushing most scenes (mashing X to advance story). check my channel and I'm just testing uploading video here, so this is very 1st time for me lol. My purpose is to help gameplay than entertain or story. Also since I'm doing this on my free time, don't expect much video uploaded so often. But I'll try to make this gameplay completed.\n- Another excuse, I'm only focusing few characters, so don't feel bored if I'm using him and him again on my party lol (because most of my powerhouse are male and two of them are not human o__o)\n\nhope you will enjoy this XD\n\nSuikoden 2 - Exvee lv 2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRXzw5XcSy8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRXzw5XcSy8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRXzw5XcSy8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRXzw5XcSy8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRXzw5XcSy8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Suikoden 2 - Opening/Intro", "description": "my suikoden 2 gameplay begins ^__^ SPOILER ALERT !!\n\nReally love this game when I'm still childhood and guess what my copy still there !!
