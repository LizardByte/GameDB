We\u2019ve also included a concept art browser, and recorded a commentary track with the game\u2019s original creators Tim Schafer, Dave Grossman, Larry Ahern, Peter Chan, Peter McConnell and Clint Bajakian.\n\nDay of the Tentacle was Tim Schafer\u2019s first game as co-project lead, and a much beloved cult classic! This special edition has been lovingly restored and remade with the care and attention that can only come from involving the game's original creators. It\u2019s coming to Windows, OSX, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita early next year!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/day-of-the-tentacle-remastered", "videos": [{"id": 17855, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2tlMJ3EtA44", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tlMJ3EtA44", "title": "Day of the Tentacle Remastered - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2tlMJ3EtA44/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
