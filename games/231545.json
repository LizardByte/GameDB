Other types of tiles will lock any movable tiles that come in contact with them.\n\nThe Megadrive version includes five different sound & graphics sets, dozens of puzzles to solve, and a \"special puzzle\" mode where the rules of the game are changed dramatically. There is also a puzzle construction mode where custom puzzles can be created.
