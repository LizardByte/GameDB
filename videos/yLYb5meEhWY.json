It\u2019s a procedurally generated, couch co-op, twin-stick shooter that straps a vacuum pack to your back, and puts a plasma blaster in your hand. For you, it\u2019s just another day in the office.\n\nFAMILIAR HAUNTS\nYou take on the role of Hector Plasm, a worker at Ghoul-B-Gone \u2013 \u2018the Number One experts in paranormal pest control\u2019 \u2013 as you\u2019re tasked with heading to haunted offices, restaurants, and other everyday buildings before freeing them of unwanted guests. One minute you're sucking up specters, the next you're sucking up to your bosses, chasing that promotion. \nHave you got what it takes to be the best at putting pests to rest?\n\nDON'T SUCK... WELL, ACTUALLY DO\nExercise that fighting spirit, since every specter you snag and every resident you rescue is added to your client\u2019s bill at the end of the job. Haunted by the ghost of your mentor, quite literally, you must learn the ropes and to save her soul before she\u2019s forced to spend eternity as a spook (voted \u201cLeast Preferred Fate\u201d in Ghost Hunter Monthly).\n\nKINDRED SPIRITS\nPlay alone or bust ghosts with a buddy in drop in / drop out co-op that works seamlessly within the main adventure. Plus you can play to an audience with Twitch and Mixer interactivity that allows viewers to help or hinder your assault on the afterlife.\n\nGHOST WRITER\nDo you love 90's cartoons? Yeah, so do we, and we grew up on their stretchy squishy gross-out laughs. Our love for them spills over into the game like so much ectoplasm. See every nose hair in wacky, vibrant art that brings everyday items to life as screwball spooks to suck up. To top it off, the entire adventure is backed by music from the award-winning Will Morton (Grand Theft Auto series).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLYb5meEhWY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLYb5meEhWY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLYb5meEhWY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLYb5meEhWY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yLYb5meEhWY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dead End Job - Apple Arcade Trailer", "description": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dead-end-job/id1461747354\nhttps://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dead-end-job-switch\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dead-end-job/9nq2cb7z7j0w\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/827610/Dead_End_Job\n\nDead End Job sends you into a madcap, Ren & Stimpy-esque world to bust up ghosts.
