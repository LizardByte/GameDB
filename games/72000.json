There are many kinds of trains that you can drive, from express trains to monorails. Some trains are locked until you finish a mission, for example you can only drive monorails until you've finished the commuter and express train missions. All of the game parts, except the menu and station names, are in Japanese.\n\nIn addition or the Meitetsu Nagoya Line, coverage includes Meitetsu Inuyama Line, Meitetsu Minomachi Line and Meitetsu Monkey Park Monorail Line. This was the first version to feature a monorail, and also featured a Meitetsu hybrid light rail route which ran both on regular train lines and as a sort of urban tram on special lanes in city streets. Part of the gameplay of this required the user to stop for regular traffic signals and avoid car traffic. This was the Densha de Go player's first opportunity to drive a vehicle much lighter (and thus shorter stopping distance) than standard trains.\n\nIn this version, the driver must sound the horn before beginning to accelerate out of a station. This is unique to this title. The gameplay, physics, and strictness of this version were all somewhat relaxed compared to previous versions.\n\nThe game was published by Taito for the Sony PlayStation in Japan on January 27, 2000. It was later ported to the PC by Unbalance on December 1, 2000. The PS1 version later received a re-release as part of D3Publisher's Simple 1500 series of budget games, as Simple 1500 Series Vol. 102: The Densha Utenshi - Densha de Go! Nagoyatetsudou-hen, on August 29, 2002.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/densha-de-go-nagoya-railroad", "videos": [{"id": 48737, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hqWQ9VW_ivk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqWQ9VW_ivk", "title": "Densha De GO!
