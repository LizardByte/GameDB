The board is simply a 5\u00d78 grid. All five white and black dice begin the game on their respective sides. You can win the game one of two ways:\n\nMove one die of your color to the opponents goal (This area is behind the starting line)\nHave all five of your dice on top of the other opponents.\nOn your turn you must move one of your dice to any orthagonal or diagonal space adjacent to this die. You may move your die on top of one or two (stacked dice). This means you will then create a stack of two or three, unless the space was empty. You may not create a stack of four. You can also move your cube on top of any stack to an adjacent space.\n\nIt takes 5-10 minutes per game, but the moves demand much attention and cleverness.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-chess-nocca-nocca", "videos": [{"id": 50520, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mWptRbTPXu0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWptRbTPXu0", "title": "\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 \u30ce\u30c3\u30ab\u30ce\u30c3\u30ab\u306e\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u7248, NOCCA x NOCCA for App", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mWptRbTPXu0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
