The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\".\n\nElite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game Star Trader. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elite", "videos": [{"id": 42598, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "47HzgWqv_kk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47HzgWqv_kk", "title": "Acornsoft Elite - Promo Video 1984 - VHS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/47HzgWqv_kk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
