There, you settle into your average college life with your average college problems: awful professors, a roommate who keeps flaking out on you to hit on girls, and the question of who you're going to take to your first fall formal dance.  While there are plenty of cute girls in your circle of friends, do any of them, y'know, actually like you that way?  And even if they do, the dance is just one date.  Who knows what will come next...\n  \nIn Don't Take It Personally, I Just Don't Like You romance isn't simple.  It's messy and complicated.  The people you care about will hurt you.  You will hurt the people you care about, even if you try your best not to. The people you have feelings for might not always feel the same way about you, and if they do, it won't always last forever.
