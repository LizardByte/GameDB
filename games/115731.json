I made this because I love the Pokemon series and wanted to make something that would pay tribute and put a smile on the face of other fans.\n\nI designed it for the HTC Vive and that's what I also tested it on but I also went ahead and mapped the Oculus Touch key as well. Since I do not have an Oculus Touch I can't 100% guarantee that it will work as intended. I've had a few people test it out on theirs and said it was playable.
