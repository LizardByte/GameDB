Jill (of the Jungle) must make her way through the jungle, defeating various monsters and collecting keys to open up new areas. Unusually, the game does not contain any boss fights, but focuses instead on puzzle games.", "summary": "Jill of the Jungle 3 is part of the Jill of the Jungle trilogy released by Epic MegaGames. The entire trilogy was released in 1992 exclusively for PC DOS, each sold separately. A year later, the three games were combined into Jill of the Jungle: The Complete Trilogy. Although none of the games were particularly well received, the revenue and attention was enough to enable MegaGames to continue to produce larger titles, most notably their successful Unreal series of games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 3940, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "jX9USWHjC34", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX9USWHjC34", "title": "DOS - Jill of the Jungle 3: Jill Saves the Prince", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jX9USWHjC34/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
