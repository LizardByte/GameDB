Our loveable caveman is back and has brought his huge head with him. A doomsday comet, surrounded by smaller chunks of debris, is on a collision course with Earth. A strange magnetic field around the comet seems to be driving most of the planet's weak-willed creatures crazy, and smaller bits of debris are smashing into the jungle near Bonk's home.
