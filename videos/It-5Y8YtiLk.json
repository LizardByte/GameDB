{"id": "It-5Y8YtiLk", "snippet": {"title": "Shadow Hawk One (Apple II - Horizon Simulations)", "description": "Shadow Hawk One (http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=38123&type=Software) was an action and strategy game published by Horizon Simulations in 1981 for the Apple ][. I think this was one of the first games using Bill Budge's 3D graphics system (http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/BUDGE.HTM). See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwPywh5RF2Y for a demo of the 3D engine.\n\nThe opening screen shows the prowess of the 3D system, with wireframe animation that is both fast and fluid on the 1Mhz Apple ][.\n\nThe game starts in the strategic mode, in which you move your spaceship to different sector on the map to attack enemies and merchants, unload your loot, and enhance your ship. Once your ship jumps into a sector, the action begins and you can fly around the sector, engaging in dogfights with other spaceships.\n\nThe game feels like a basic version of Elite (1985), not bad for a game released in 1981!\n\nCredits:\nCover art - www.pcmuseum.ca", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/It-5Y8YtiLk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/It-5Y8YtiLk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/It-5Y8YtiLk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Shadow Hawk One (Apple II - Horizon Simulations)", "description": "Shadow Hawk One (http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=38123&type=Software) was an action and strategy game published by Horizon Simulations in 1981 for the Apple ][.
