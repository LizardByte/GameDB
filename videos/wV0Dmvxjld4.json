Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened will release on April 11 on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, Xbox One & Switch. Preorders on the Nintendo Switch will launch at a later date.\n\nSherlock Holmes The Awakened is a Cthulhu meets Sherlock Holmes detective horror adventure. The game acts as a continuation of young Sherlock\u2019s story with Holmes and Watson undertaking their first major case together. \n\nAn Eldritch god-obsessed cult is making moves in the shadows to bring about a world-altering prophecy and it\u2019s up to the young detective duo to thwart their plans. This is a creative take on what horror-filled and reality-breaking events could have met our heroes at such a crucial point in their lives to go on and shape them into the characters we all know they become. Delve into the trauma and fear that cements their friendship for good and the revelations that break Sherlock\u2019s mind to create the flawed and haunted genius he is destined to be. \n\nOriginally released in 2006, The Awakened is a full remake and substantial rewrite being rebuilt and redesigned from the ground up to run in Unreal Engine 4.\n\nFollow us on social media for more updates:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SherlockHolmesGames\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SHolmes_Games\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frogwares/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/frogwares\u200b\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/frogwares", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wV0Dmvxjld4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wV0Dmvxjld4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wV0Dmvxjld4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wV0Dmvxjld4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wV0Dmvxjld4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sherlock Holmes The Awakened Finally Gets a Release Date!
