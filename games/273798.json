The long struggle between people and corporations left the megacorps as overlords, ruling over the broken remnants of humanity huddled together in vast urban sprawls. But with no law or government beyond corporate boards, the underworld thrives. You are a Shell Runner using lifelike Shells to carry out wet work for anyone willing to pay.\n\nShell Runner is a top-down tactical shooter hybridized with looter shooter and extraction games. Every run can make you rich - but lose your Shell and you lose all that. Experience high-risk runs as a solo merc - or find allies and face the seedy underbelly of a dystopian future in cooperative mode.\n\nShells are remotely controlled bodies that blur the line between man and machine. Take control of one of over 20 Shells, from disposable everyman models for low-tier mercs to specialized high-tech Shells for corporate assassins and shock troops. But be careful: Lose a Shell on a mission and it's gone - together with all the gear, loot, and Silicon credits you managed to pilfer from other unfortunates living in the shadows of the corps.\n\nLife's cheap and brutal in the sprawl. You're always outnumbered and outgunned and even a lowly thug can flatline your Shell in seconds if you don't play it smart. Plan ahead and outfit your Shell with an arsenal of melee weapons, firearms, and explosives. Fine-tune stats thanks to a multitude of modifiers. Then head in to complete your contract. Stay on your toes, plan your attack, and hit your targets where they least expect it.\n\nNo two runs are the same. Every mission is a procedurally-generated map, combining hand-crafted boss encounters with unpredictable randomness, ensuring no two runs are the same. Every Shell and item comes with random modifiers, meaning every contract is a risk - but also an opportunity. One job in the slums might leave you barely breaking even - the next one might make you break the bank. So get to work, Shell Runner, Silicon won\u2019t earn itself!", "summary": "Shell Runner - Prelude is a PvE Extraction Top-Down Looter-Shooter set in a cyberpunk dystopian future.
