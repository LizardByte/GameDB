{"id": "xwrqhsTFTVU", "snippet": {"title": "Amiga Longplay [216] Deja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!!", "description": "You wake up in a bathroom stall with no recollection of who you are or how you got there. A little exploring reveals that you're in a bar called Joe's, there's a dead man upstairs in the office, and it looks like you're about to be framed for a murder you didn't commit (or at least, don't remember you committed).\n\nRan it with A500 speed as older games usually get GFX/SFX problems if it runs too fast, and man does it run slow, yikes! Should have gone with a faster Amiga.\n\nThis was just a quick and dirty run-through, for once. Usually I play through a game first, looking/examining everything and decide what's worth showing, then longplay it and show all those things. Found no Amiga longplay of it, just someone who did a 2 parter with commentary and speedran it not giving the viewer time to read the dialogues. Props to him though as I followed most of his steps instead of reading the text walkthrough I had prepared :). A bunch of stuff picked up is probably not even needed.\n\nI didn't wanna upload this longplay as I rather felt like redoing it on a faster Amiga + show more of the game. It's a well known and highly rated game, so it deserved better. Usually include all the deaths too, but meh, just went with one to show the game over part.\n\nAt 33:00 I operate the dead woman on myself, as a joke of being a necrophile, then showing the credits menu and select any of the names, which would normally play a sound of a crowd cheering, but for some reason the game crash at this point when doing it. They cheered in the beginning of the game when I first tried it (but didn't record, as I decided to show it later instead right before the end, so the dead woman was a good moment).\n\nSometimes some games have weird cursor acceleration. If I move it slooowly, it's steady and at a constant pace. If I move it too fast, like just half an inch, the cursor shoots across the screen. Lowering the mouse speed in the emulator doesn't help much. So you will see the mouse cursor acting weird from time to time. Might be acting like this due to various reasons. Will troubleshoot sometime. Easy to fix I'm sure, as I think it ran better from floppy.\n\nI used the WHDLoad version so in case the game had some loading between the scenes, it would be faster, but for some reason it ran even slower than when I tried it from floppy. Same settings, yet running it from floppy was both faster for loading and game speed. Maybe something in my very basic WB startup-sequence that slowed it down? Or it's WHDLoad's doing? Dunno, weird anyway.\n\nCouldn't get the WHDLoad version to run at first, it exited with an error. I noticed the executable was named wrong: \"DTja Vu\". I checked floppy version and it had \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" so I thought maybe unzipping the file caused it to happen, as I've experience before that PC can't use some character the Amiga can, so when unzipping Amiga archives on PC, some characters gets auto-renamed. Well, this was a normal zip, not an Amiga .lha or anything, and inside the zip it still has the wrong name. So, they fucked up. I renamed the file and the WHDLoad version then worked. The date of the WHDLoad game archive is \"2008-05-19\", maybe they will rename the file and upload a corrected version someday (guess they have to see this text first, as I can't be bothered to contact the proper people. Easiest place would be EAB, but I'm banned :P).\n\nWill run on a faster Amiga when I do Deja Vu II.
