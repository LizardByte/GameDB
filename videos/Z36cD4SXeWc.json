{"id": "Z36cD4SXeWc", "snippet": {"title": "NES Lagrange Point", "description": "No, I will not start making NES/Famicom videos at this time because if I did, I would not be able to do anything else with my life considering the amount of titles I love on the system. But this game is far too important for me not to call up to your attention. This is the latest game to be fan translated into English by AGTP, a project that took over ten years to complete. So why am I so excited about Konamis 1991 Sci-Fi RPG \"Lagrange Point\"? The music.\n\nYou will notice as soon as the game intro begin to play, the sound is nothing like you have probably ever heard from a NES / Famicom game. There is a good reason for this: Inside every cartridge Konami snuck in a VRC7 sound generator integrated circuit. You can consider it a full FM synthesiser, capable of producing  FM synthesis up to 6 channels, a major step up from the native Famicom sound hardware. And that is the reason why the music sounds a lot more Megadrive than Nes / Famicom (plus, the game also reminds me of \"Phantasy Star\"). Just imagine hearing that coming from your tube TV set back in 1991! Truly, this was Konami at it's finest.\n\nI will surely have fun completing this game, now that I can properly understand what I am supposed to do. Many thanks to everyone at Aeon Genesis who made this possible, an important part of Famicom history that is now finally available to the English speaking audience outside of Japan.\n\n\"Lagrange Point\" @ Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_Point_%28video_game%29\nAGTP project page: http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=lagrange\n\nRomhacking.net project page: http://www.romhacking.net/translations/2294/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z36cD4SXeWc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z36cD4SXeWc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z36cD4SXeWc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "NES Lagrange Point", "description": "No, I will not start making NES/Famicom videos at this time because if I did, I would not be able to do anything else with my life considering the amount of titles I love on the system.
