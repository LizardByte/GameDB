Any player clicking the prominent \"click to keep alive\" button would result in the countdown being reset: by working together, by ensuring that the button was pressed at least once every ten seconds, players could attempt to keep her alive.\n\nThe game was victim of its success: after almost 12 hours of runtime, the traffic to the site reached such levels that it became inaccessible for more than ten seconds, resulting in the death of the character. The site remains accessible, but the game is no longer playable and only displays the end screen.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/impetus", "videos": [{"id": 97903, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tgdcQO6ZIbI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgdcQO6ZIbI", "title": "IMPETUS - Ludum Dare 27", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tgdcQO6ZIbI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
