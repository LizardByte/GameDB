Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent.\n\nThe first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wars-jedi-arena", "videos": [{"id": 107224, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lQu3ZaJD_qc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQu3ZaJD_qc", "title": "Atari 2600 Game:  Star Wars - Jedi Arena (1983 Parker Bros.)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lQu3ZaJD_qc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
