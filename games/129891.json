The planet Mota has been transformed from a desert planet into a lush, fertile world. Mota's climate and biology is now controlled by several facilities, which are managed by the central computer system called Mother Brain. However, recently something is amiss. The central lake has dried up, and vicious creatures roam the countryside. What has gone wrong?\n\nThe game's hero and protagonist, Rolf, is an Agent with the central government in Paseo, the capital city of the planet Mota. He has recurring dreams in which he sees a young girl battling for her life against a giant demon. After one such dream, he goes into work and is given the task of retrieving the data recorder from the Biosystems Lab, in order to learn why the lab has created such dangerous creatures. Analysis of the data recorder shows that the Biosystems Lab has been receiving excess energy from Climatrol, and that this energy is responsible for the mutations.", "summary": "This game is much like Phantasy Star Generation: 1, except that it stands as a remake of Phantasy Star II.
