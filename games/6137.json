It was built with the Othello Multivision in mind, but like all Multivision games, is also compatible with the SG-1000. Space Armor was not released outside of Japan. \n \nThe game is built similarly to Namco's Xevious, in that it is a vertical shooter where one button fires at flying targets and the other at ground targets.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-armor"}
