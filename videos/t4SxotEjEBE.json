The entire project is open source, and is hosted on github:\nhttps://github.com/TurtleMan64/Sonic3DGamev3\n\nThere are 22 different levels (plus a boss fight), with a total of 60 different missions to collect A ranks. There are also hidden NPC's hidden throughout the levels to collect. You can unlock different skins to play as by finding these hidden NPC's and getting A ranks.\n\nA large amount of levels are from Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2, but there are also plenty of levels from other games as well. Delfino Plaza and Noki Bay have been made into treasure hunting levels, where Knuckles searches for randomized emerald pieces. In Kingdom Valley, you play as Tails, who can use his fly ability to reach the many cliff ledges and structures in the level.\n\nThere are four different types of missions - Normal Mode, Ring Attack, Lost Chao, and Hard Mode. Ring Attack has you collect a certain amount of rings, which vary per level. In Lost Chao, you have to search for a chao hidden somewhere in the level. Hard Mode is for treasure hunting levels, and the pieces are not randomized, but you don't have a radar, so look closely!\n\nThere is also an Arcade mode, where you play through all of the levels in order, starting with only four extra lives. Once you finish the last level, you fight the Boss. If you game over, you must restart from the beginning, so be very careful!\n\nKeyboard Controls:   \nWASD to control sonic + menu   \nSpacebar to jump + accept on menu  \nCtrl/Shift to spindash  \nCtrl to bounce  \nShift to dropdash\nQ to stomp\nF to light dash  \nTab to grab/release mouse  \nEnter to pause/unpause \n0/9 to change time of day \n\nYou can change the game resolution and fullscreen mode in the DisplaySettings.ini located in the Settings folder.\n\nTroubleshooting FAQ:\n\nWhen I launch the game, it gives me the error \"The program can't start because MSVCP140.dll is missing from your computer\"\nYou will need to install Microsoft C++ Redistributable, which you can find the 32 bit version here: \nhttps://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe\n\nMy camera is spinning! Sonic's controls are inverted! What do?\nYour controller will need to be configured. Go into the Settings folder and edit ControllerConfig.ini - this is the file that the game reads to map controller buttons/axis. You will also see some other example controller config files for some popular controllers. You can copy+paste the contents from whichever file you want into ControllerConfig.ini. So for example, if you use a Logitech F310 controller, copy the contents of ControllerConfigLogitechF310.ini and paste that into ControllerConfig.ini.\n\nThe game is running way too fast!\nThis is a common issue for 144 Hz monitors. This game is designed to run at 60 Hz, so you will need to put your monitor in 60 Hz mode.\n\nThe game is lagging! It's unplayable this slow...\nThere are a couple of graphics settings you can turn down to really improve performance. Open up to Settings/GraphicsSettings.ini, and turn down some of the high impact settings. Render_Bloom, HQ_Water, and Render_Shadows are all good ones to disable to see if they help the game not lag.\n\nWant to try speedrunning levels?
