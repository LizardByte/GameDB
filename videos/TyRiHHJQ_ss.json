The PS2 version, like the PS1 version, also uses voice overs instead of the gibberish used in other versions of the game. The gibberish talk was actually implemented, if  I remember correctly, due to the close release of the game in multiple countries.

The gameplay may not be anything revolutionary, but it is solid in all departments. The atmosphere is great, and really helps give it a unique feel. \n\nSome people may not like the more colorful look to the PS2 version. The other versions had a more dark look to them. However, I think the art style of the game actually helps the graphics hold up quite well considering how early it was released in the PS2's life.
