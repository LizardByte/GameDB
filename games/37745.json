With every Shinri Game, these questions are presented with a distinct framing device: in Zengoku Juudan's case, the game is presented as if it was a TV game show that pulls its questions from specific regions and prefectures of Japan.\n\nIt follows three previous Shinri Games for the system, but isn't a true sequel - The Shinri Game IV, released on PlayStation in 1998, is the \"true\" fourth The Shinri Game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zengoku-juudan-ultra-shinri-game"}
