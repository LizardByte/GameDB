Early screenshots suggested the game would feature cute characters and colorful settings. Rare had a long history of making games of this sort, such as Banjo-Kazooie and Diddy Kong Racing, and at first Conker did not appear to be any different. However, Rare started to fear that the game would simply get lost in the platforming crowd, and critical mockery of \"yet another cute platformer\" caused the original game to be drastically overhauled. When the announcement was made that Conker would be re-tooled into a \"controversial\" game with lots of scatological humor many did not initially believe it, and assumed the press release was an April Fools' Day joke. However, as the months went on, the change quickly was understood to be very real and permanent. Inspired by South Park, the game's producer, Chris Seavor, lobbied to revamp the graphics and attitude, and it transformed into Bad Fur Day. Seavor himself voiced Conker in this new version, along with all the male characters in the game except the Great Mighty Poo, who was voiced by Chris Marlow. Louise Ridgeway voiced all the female characters in the game. The game was also different from the Banjo series and (particularly, to the extreme) Donkey Kong 64 in relying far less on collecting a variety of items. When items were required they were usually to solve a puzzle in the immediate area, resulting in a cash reward, aiding access to other areas. Moves were also simplified by having 'context sensitive' buttons. Aside from this, their previous 3D platformers had not been completely dis-similar (apart from also being platformers). For instance, the cocky attitude of Conker and other characters is arguably reflected, albeit to a much less frequent extent and without swearing, in a few aspects of Donkey Kong 64 eg. the no-nonsense Cranky Kong and the DK Rap. Whereas the Banjo series has a fairytale nature eg. with an evil witch, the beginning of 'Conker's Bad Fur Day', is like the 20th century fairytale The Wizard of Oz with a scarecrow (however foul-mouthed) and a yellow brick road.\r\n\r\nThe promotional videos and pictures from Electronic Entertainment Expo (at the time when the game was still called \"Twelve Tales\") revealed objects and characters which have influenced the released game. Objects such as the flower and mushroom sprites were seen in the promotional video and a character closely resembling Buga the Nut was seen chasing Conker (who was wearing a knight's helmet) in a promotional picture. Conker's Bad Fur Day is considerably a far different game from the original plans despite the small influences it had on the release game.\r\n\r\ninfo from wikipedia", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEuFNl4s9yI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEuFNl4s9yI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bEuFNl4s9yI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Conker's Quest Beta Gameplay [BFD Prototype - UNRELASED!]", "description": "http://www.unseen64.net\r\nhttp://www.64dd.net\r\n\r\nConker's Bad Fur Day was originally going to be titled Conker's Quest and was later titled Twelve Tales: Conker 64.
