Dice is a mobile game on Android and iOS that feature's the world's first Deck of Cards on Dice. The gameplay is centered around 9 six-sided dice that feature all 54 playing cards from a traditional deck (including two WILDS).\n\nThe cards are distributed across the dice faces in a patented mathematical formula allowing players an incredibly fun and much easier way to play games that require making traditional playing card hands.\n\nThe mobile game has a familiar but fresh player experience of rolling all 9 dice a total of 3 times while getting to hold what you want to achieve a goal (like Two Pairs, Four of a Kind, Full House, etc). Players play head-to-head against friends, random opponents, and bots to achieve the most goals by filling out their scorecards and receiving bonus points for achieving a higher hand than their opponent. There is a classic 9-Hand Game mode as well as a 3 and 1-Hand game mode.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shake-it-up-dice"}
