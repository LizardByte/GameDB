By observing the repeating patterns, the entity intends to destroy all uncertainty and ultimately control reality.\n\nIn Circadian Dice, you control a group of heroes that have managed to step outside this unnatural cycle, and are now setting out to find and destroy its source. You will need to overcome a series of skirmishes by upgrading your dice to bend chance in your favor, and strategically using your limited resources to defeat your enemies.\n\nWhile the heroes and their dice are restored to normal after each scenario (whether they die or succeed), any upgrades, relics, abilities, and modifiers that you have unlocked persist - so your tools are constantly improving! The better you perform in battle, the quicker you will build your arsenal and progress through the game towards your ultimate goal to break the loop and save the universe.", "summary": "Circadian Dice is a game inspired by single-player deck-building games, but instead of upgrading a deck, you build up a set of dice!\n\nThe game has 26 different scenarios to fight through, each designed to allow for short game sessions. You can also play in different game modes, like playing through the game in a single-life Campaign Mode, as well as an endless randomized scenario.\n\nBetween every game, your dice are reset - but you unlock abilities, new characters, and powerful relics that become part of your permanent arsenal.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/circadian-dice", "videos": [{"id": 49735, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "spQBNo6lVdE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spQBNo6lVdE", "title": "Circadian Dice Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/spQBNo6lVdE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
