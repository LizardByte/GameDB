Team up through over 50 cooperative levels in what MMGN is calling \"The most addictive co-op game we've played since Portal 2.\" And if the over 100 levels aren't enough, you and your friends can destroy each other again and again in battle mode to determine just who is the supreme virus.\n\nIt was originally planned to get a PS3 and Xbox 360 version, but the plans were scrapped.
