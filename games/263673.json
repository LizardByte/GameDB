The young Darios swears that he will find the bad guys and make them pay! He and his best friend, the elf girl Eru, venture into the nearby cave, pursuing Nakachimaro. Little they know that this will be just the beginning of a long and perilous journey!", "summary": "Gensei F\u016bky\u014d Den is a Japanese RPG with a somewhat \"light\" approach, both in story-telling and gameplay. The gameplay mostly follows the standard procedure of Japanese-style RPGs, although some features are simplified: there is no \"world map\", and town navigation is menu-based. Most of the gameplay consists of navigating maze-like top-down dungeons, fighting random enemies in turn-based first-person perspective combat. Characters use special points (SP) for powerful attacks and magic points (MP) for spells.\n\nReleased through Disc Station Vol. 4 in 1994 for PC-9801.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gensei-fukyo-den", "videos": [{"id": 96675, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6JiD2QzpHrA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JiD2QzpHrA", "title": "\u5e7b\u4e16\u98a8\u72c2\u4f1d for PC-9801 (1994)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6JiD2QzpHrA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
