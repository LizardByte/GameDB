It further improves on the details and polish of the first's. The soundtrack sounds far less like a jazz club this time, being much more electronic in nature - though both styles are great, I have to say I love how this game blasts the orchestra hits!\n\nThe biggest change this time around, however, is in the level design.  The game finally moves beyond square arenas with far more intricate and organically flowing layouts. It sounds like a fairly minor change, but it really does feel like a renewal of the classic formula. The base gameplay is the same, but it's quite nicely refined here.\n\nOf course, battle mode is back for loads of 4-player multitap goodness, and it's just as good as ever.\n\nIf you like Bomberman or party games, this really is a must-own for SNES gamers - especially since, at least in North America, this was the final release of the Super Bomberman series. The third was released in Europe, and the fourth and fifth never left Japan.\n___\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EIDyyO8HP_k/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EIDyyO8HP_k/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EIDyyO8HP_k/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EIDyyO8HP_k/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Bomberman 2 (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Hudson Soft's 1994 action-puzzle game for the Super NES, Super Bomberman 2.\n\nThis video shows a full playthrough of the normal (story) game mode.\n\nFor as excellent as Super Bomberman was, this sequel improved upon it in just about every way imaginable.
