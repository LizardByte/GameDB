Danganronpa: Academy of Hope and High School Students of Despair) is a murder mystery visual novel developed and published by Spike Chunsoft (formerly Spike). The game was originally released in Japan for the PlayStation Portable on November 25, 2010 and was later ported to iOS and Android devices on August 20, 2012. Two manga adaptations and two spin-off novels have been published, and a television anime adaptation by Lerche aired between July and September 2013.\n\nA sequel, Super Dangan ronpa 2: Sayonara Zetsub\u014d Gakuen, was released for PlayStation Portable on July 26, 2012. A compilation of both games, titled Danganronpa 1\u30fb2 Reload, was released for PlayStation Vita in Japan on October 10, 2013. NIS America will release the Vita remake of the first game in North America on February 11, 2014, and in Europe and Australia on February 14, 2014. Another game, titled Zettai Zetsub\u014d Sh\u014djo: Danganronpa Another Episode, will be released for the PS Vita in 2014. The series' title, Dangan ronpa, is compounded from the Japanese words for \"bullet\" (\u5f3e\u4e38 dangan?) and \"refutation\" (\u8ad6\u7834 ronpa?).\n\nDanganronpa takes place at an elite high school called Hope's Peak Academy (\u5e0c\u671b\u30f6\u5cf0\u5b66\u5712 Kib\u014dgamine Gakuen), which accepts talented \"Ultimate\" students (\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b?, lit. Super High School Level) of the highest caliber in various fields each year. Makoto Naegi, a fairly optimistic but otherwise average student, is selected in a raffle and chosen to enroll into the academy as the \"Ultimate Lucky Student\". However, when Makoto arrives outside of the gates of the Academy, he loses consciousness and wakes up locked inside the school, where he meets fourteen other newly picked Ultimate students who are in the same situation as him. It is there that a sadistic, remote-controlled bear named Monokuma appears before them, telling them they will be imprisoned in the academy for the rest of their lives. He offers only one way for students to graduate from the academy: murder another student and not be identified as the culprit.\n\nWhen a murder occurs, a \"class trial\" (\u5b66\u7d1a\u88c1\u5224 gaky\u016b saiban) is held, in which the remaining students must determine amongst themselves who the killer is. If the students can successfully determine the true culprit, that person is put to a gruesome and ironic execution for disrupting school order. However, if the wrong accusation is made, then the true killer will be allowed to leave the academy whilst everyone else will be put to death. In a place where anyone could be a victim, everyone is a suspect and no one can be trusted, it is up to Makoto to survive these class trials and solve the true mysteries of Hope's Peak Academy.\n\nGameplay is similar in style to the Ace Attorney series, revolving around investigation and finding contradictions, albeit with an emphasis on faster gameplay. Each chapter of gameplay takes place in two types of gameplay; the Daily Life and Deadly Life sections, in which the player explores the academy and progresses through the story, and the Class Trials, where the player must deduce the culprit of a crime.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vI_sxaRqyE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vI_sxaRqyE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vI_sxaRqyE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vI_sxaRqyE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9vI_sxaRqyE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Danganronpa\u2122: Trigger Happy Havoc \u2014 Official Trailer #1", "description": "http://store.nisamerica.com/Games Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (\u30c0\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30ed\u30f3\u30d1 \u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u5b66\u5712\u3068\u7d76\u671b\u306e\u9ad8\u6821\u751f Danganronpa: Kib\u014d no Gakuen to Zetsub\u014d no K\u014dk\u014dsei?, lit.
