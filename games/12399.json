Barney Bear Goes To School is a colorful, musical game for children ages 3-8. Barney Bear begins on the morning of the first day of school. The player must help Barney wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast and make his way to school. Once through this short, interactive story, Barney enters the school room. Here, the room itself is a menu of activities and games for a child. There are the numbers and counting games, the alphabet and letter games, colors, shapes, toys, and objects all with accompanying sounds and descriptions. \n\nThere is also a painting easel that allows children to fill-in the colors over a dozen different pictures. This delightful game allows even very young children to play without any adult supervision.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barney-bear-goes-to-school"}
