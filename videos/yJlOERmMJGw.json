The grandfather to games like Forza 2 and Gran Turismo 5 GT5 Prologue, this is INDY 500 for the Atari 2600. Race in the Indianapolis 500 against 1 other Formula one 1 F1 race cars in this early driving simulator, racecar game from 1978.\n\nIndy 500 uses the driving controllers for the Atari 2600, not the paddle controllers. So make sure you have the right ones before you try to play it or it won't work. \n\nRace against a friend and have a great time in this excellent party game that had a variety of arcade style retro games, not just driving.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360.
