Whoever controls the rifts controls all FTL travel in the galaxy.\nFor four hundred years, the brutal X'taran Empire has ruled with an iron fist, controlling all trade routes and interstellar navigation.\nNow a small group of rebels has managed to sneak past X'taran blockades and deliver a prototype Gateship and a small fighter craft, the Manta, to Ixt'thus. Using the Gateship, they can harness the rifts to bring reinforcements through hyperspace directly to the surface, evading the X'taran forces guarding the planet.\nBattle over and under the oceans as you pilot the Manta: a combination fighter and submarine. Summon and command a fleet of battleships from hyperspace as you take on an enemy armada of carriers, submarines, dreadnoughts and more! Free the galaxy from the shackles of X'taran domination!", "summary": "Gameplay in Manta combines the thrill of a fast-action flight simulator, the suspense and cunning of a submarine simulation, and the tactics of an RTS. The overall objective is to destroy the enemy base which is defended not only by a fleet, but by installations of sentry cannons, shield generators and submarine torpedo bases. To do this, the player must deploy energy rigs to rifts on the ocean floor to power their Gateship and summon a Velnai\u2019i fleet to aid them in battle. In addition, the player may use their engineers to build new forward bases for battlefield repairs, or to take control of destroyed enemy installations.\nThe Manta itself is a fighter craft capable of \u201cflight\u201d underwater. When in the air, it uses a targeting system similar to modern fighter jets \u2013 using radar lock to target its missiles, and straight aiming for its twin plasma cannons. Battle in the air involves not only dogfights with enemy interceptors, but assaults on massive enemy capital ships.\nUnderwater, however, combat is more of a cat-and-mouse game. The player must use a combination of active and passive sonar to target their enemies. Active sonar gives a better view of the surroundings, but will also reveal the player\u2019s position to enemy submarines. Additionally, the player may use the cover of the oceans to sneak up on enemies above, but beware enemy torpedo bases, mines and attack subs!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/manta", "videos": [{"id": 27232, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "WZgSZXcV0oQ"}, {"id": 27233, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "SC960KKRfGU"}, {"id": 28446, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Pz9Mor_QRx8"}]}
