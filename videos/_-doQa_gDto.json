Anyway, this is a VN for the PSP that released back in 2011, and as you might suggest, it doesn't released in West. :( A translation project is in progress though along with Brilliant Blue, they said they could released the full patch for Passion Pink in summer, which is great. :D This game have Masaomi, Kaname, Tsubaki, Subaru, Yuusuke, Subaru, and Hikaru route while the other guys is included in Brilliant Blue. I already have tried the game, and I have to say, it's quite short and can get boring fast if you only focused on one guy(me? I stick with Subaru of course~ XD). The gameplay is sorta like Tokimemo games, if you ever played one, this should be a breeze. :D Also, it have a bug with the character's voice that doesn't match with the dialouge box(which is bad if you don't understand Japanese). Well, in the end, it's quite enjoyable despite how short it is. I hope they make another VN in the future. Whoops, I talk too much. Enjoy! :D\nSong: AFFECTIONS\nSingers:\nSuzumura Ken'ichi - Asahina Tsubaki's seiyuu\nToriumi Kousuke - Asahina Azusa's seiyuu\n\n\n\nCopyrights Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
