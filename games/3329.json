Play solo through the grand prix and compete against the AI enemy, or beat down your best time in the time trial mode.\n\nEach track features a number of twists and turns, whether it be racing upside down or vertically, with a number of obstacles in your path. There's no weapons, though, it's just you and the open road ahead.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aerogauge", "videos": [{"id": 62681, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "42HDgCgdf6c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42HDgCgdf6c", "title": "[N64] Aero Gauge Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/42HDgCgdf6c/sddefault.jpg"}]}
