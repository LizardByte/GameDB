{"id": "De0MTygV8Yk", "snippet": {"title": "Eaten By Darkness - First Look Announcement Trailer", "description": "Eaten by Darkness is a fast paced bloody action first person shooter focused on high levels of detail in a sensory filled immersive experience. The player feels the dread of fear lingering nearby and the exhilaration of being chased by monstrosities coupled with the satisfying feeling of literally blasting those fears away. Taking the proven formula of dark first person shooters and utilizing the powerful features now available in Unreal Engine 5, including Nanite, Niagara, and advanced AI, Eaten by Darkness takes the horror FPS predecessor concepts to the next level of immersion and brutality. Descending deeper into darkness increases the relentlessness of the monstrous horde and reveals their mysterious origin. Eaten by Darkness sets the player in a late 1800s mining operation with a mysterious occult driven agenda buried deep in the mines.\n\nThe game is a blend of older style fast paced action based first person shooters and modern horror with a focus on player immersive. Eaten by Darkness is being designed as a game the player feels they are actually experiencing themselves, not as a movie style cut scene heavy or quick time event handholding game the player passively watches; it is a fast paced high tension action shooter throughout which the player remains in control of their character at all times. \n\nThe immersion is reflected in an ultra streamlined user interfaces and interactive mechanics. Removal of health bars and onscreen survival micromanagement indicators allows the player to enjoy the game while the intuitive design of the game provides meaningful feedback to the player about their existing condition; feedback from in-game sounds design and visuals provide the player with a direct understanding of how they are performing and how imminent their own demise is. Additional streamlining removes the immersion breaking mechanics often seen in games today that require players to hold the \u201cF\u201d button to open doors; in Eaten by Darkness players just blast through the doors or monsters break through obstructions and barricades without creating a pause the action. The player doesn\u2019t need to stop to look for ammo, Eaten by Darkness lets the player have fun and run around in horror and mayhem without the tedium of searching for a few bullets scattered around, the silliness of health potions popping out of enemies, or the unnatural looking glowing/floating collectibles that serve no purpose in the core game mechanics. The development of the game is focused on player fun throughout all its gameplay mechanics.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/De0MTygV8Yk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/De0MTygV8Yk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/De0MTygV8Yk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/De0MTygV8Yk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/De0MTygV8Yk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Eaten By Darkness - First Look Announcement Trailer", "description": "Eaten by Darkness is a fast paced bloody action first person shooter focused on high levels of detail in a sensory filled immersive experience.
