John proceeds to go to the office building of the company but as soon as he enters he notices that not a single person is there. However he is not alone and is soon confronted by various monsters roaming the hallways. While this is already a strange occurance, he is later tasked by another mysterious man to bring him a even more mysterious book... A book written by Lucifer himself.", "summary": "Die B\u00fccher Luzifers is the second game of German RPG Maker developer Kelven and is yet another horror game. While influcenes of Silent Hill and Resident Evil do exist in this one, they're more subtile and the plotline and world do feel a lot more unique, then in the first game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/die-bucher-luzifers"}
