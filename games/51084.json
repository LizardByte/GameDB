While you have an impressive arsenal including the M2 BMG, 40mm M1, and of course your Thompson SMG, the Imperial Japanese Navy will throw everything they can muster at you: \u201cZeros,\u201d \u201cBettys,\u201d and even Takao-class battleships in their methodical and relentless push to recapture the Solomon Islands.
