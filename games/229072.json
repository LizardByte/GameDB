On each tour you will be presented with a number of Google Street View panoramas, and it's your job to pinpoint on the map where in the world you think each location is.\n\nThe closer you are, and the fewer guesses you take, the better your score. To find Worldo at his location you need to be within 200m of his location!\n\nIf you get stuck you can use one of the unique Powerups to help you, including Ask a Local, Radius and Laser.\n\nIf you guess correctly, there's a chance Worldo will bring you a memento of the country he visited, such as a wildlife photo, activity, or souvenir. There are over 1000 of these to collect!", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wheres-worldo", "videos": [{"id": 81111, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "udsz3me--Ew"}]}
