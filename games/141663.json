Many years ago the Borrius region fought a brutal war with the Kalos region. The people of the Borrius region summoned a dark force to help them defeat their enemies; however, the war ended in defeat when the king of the Kalos region unleashed the ultimate weapon. With the war over, the dark force was sealed away never to be used again. Many years later, an organization known simply as \u201cThe Shadows\u201d seems bent on releasing the dark force once again. It\u2019s up to you to stop them and save the Borrius region from ultimate destruction."}
