It was originally released for the WonderSwan, and has been ported to WonderSwan Color, Playstation, Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. The game was named as a tribute to the developer of the game, Gunpei Yokoi.[1] He is known for developing several handheld consoles such as Nintendo's Game Boy, Virtual Boy, and Bandai's Wonderswan system. In the series, players move line fragments vertically in a grid in order to make a single branching line connect horizontally from one end to the other. The objective of the game differs by what game mode players choose.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gunpey-ds"}
