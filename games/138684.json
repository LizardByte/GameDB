The story takes you to the peaceful town of Jaterus, about to become much less peaceful thanks to one Greymere. This evil archmage has taken up residence in a three-level dungeon, conveniently located just outside the city walls. More alarmingly, he has constructed the Shadowforge - a potent magical artifact that has enhanced both his power and ambition for conquest; Jaterus is first on his list. Your job is to quash his aspirations by finding and destroying the device.\n\nThe town of Jaterus is your base of operations, its main attractions being the weapon and armor shops, the inn (where you can recuperate after a sojourn to the dungeon), the temple (where health potions are sold), and the tavern (which, besides refreshments, offers conversation - some of it helpful). The various random NPCs do not communicate, though.\n\nThe dungeon is populated by Greymere's minions; some are randomly placed, others are not, and all must be bested in turn-based combat - the deeper you go, the tougher the bad guys. Fighting involves both melee and ranged attacks, and defeated monsters will bequeath both gold and experience. Leveling up will increase your maximum hit points, but no other stats are tracked. Some secrets await to be revealed along the way, too.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
