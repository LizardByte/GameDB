Pixel Puzzles Aardman brings you iconic scenes from the lovable Wallace & Gromit to the hilarious Shaun the Sheep and much more.

And we don't even get the puzzles based on neither of the two Shaun the Sheep movies or Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit, as the puzzles are mainly based on both the TV shows and shorts. I imagine Aardman and Pixel Puzzles would have to go through all the legal loops with both StudioCanal, Dreamworks, Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment... perhaps. Pirates in an Adventure with Scientists and Robin Robin are based on books, so that makes it a bit more complicated.\n\nWe only have five DLC packs so far: Variety Pack 1, Shaun The Sheep, The Farmers Llamas, Wallace & Gromit - Vacation and Wallace & Gromit - A Matter of Loaf & Death. And as is often the case with many licensed games being released on digital platforms, licensing agreements usually only last for a limited period of time. But luckily, the base game is free and the DLC packs aren't too pricey.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aJ0nkg-XP5A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aJ0nkg-XP5A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aJ0nkg-XP5A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aJ0nkg-XP5A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aJ0nkg-XP5A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pixel Puzzles Aardman Jigsaws - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "Immerse yourself in a whimsical world of creativity with our latest digital jigsaw puzzle game, featuring the beloved characters from Aardman!
