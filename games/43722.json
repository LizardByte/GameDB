Choose from 16 professional kickboxers including Andy Hug, Musashi, and Ernesto Hoost, and if you don't like any of the professional contenders, create your own. After choosing the right avatar, jump into the ring for some training. Once you are ready for some competition, you can try to win a Tournament, but those players looking for a real challenge should play the Career mode. This is where you try to work your way from the bottom of the rankings to the championship. Between each bout, spend time training; how well you perform each training task will reward you with points that can be spent on new moves and combinations. Do you have the grit and determination to become the best in K-1 Grand Prix?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/k-1-grand-prix"}
