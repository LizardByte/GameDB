You can direct the ball using the joystick, going left and right and pressing the fire button to make it jump. Please note, the number of jumps is limited (it is indicated at the top of the screen).\n\nEach color of the checkerboard has a function: blue tiles have no effect, light blue tiles make the ball jump, red tiles slow down the ball, yellow tiles accelerate your ball, green tiles block commands, purple tiles reverse the commands and black tiles are, well, holes.\n\nFalling into a hole wastes time.
