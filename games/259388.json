Our mission: get to the heart of the Facility and activate the self-destruct protocol. Hopefully Doomguy can make it out alive, or at least sink down to a watery grave with all the monsters.\n\nGreatly inspired by AD_79's map 05 from Tetanus by Squonker Team - the ingenious mechanics and visuals used in that map made me think of other potential ways in which to continue that narrative and visual thread.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deep-breath"}
