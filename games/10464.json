However he soon realises once again that nothing goes quite as smoothly as Jack had imagined.\n\nShanghai, 1899 - The mysterious Chinese city is the epicentre for adventurers of all kinds. Jack Keane, too, has been attracted to the place by rumours of a legendary treasure - or to be more precise, these tales have led him right inside the walls of the notorious Shanghai prison. It is within these walls that the guardian of the treasure, a secretive shaman, has been locked up for years. Unfortunately for our hero, Jack has completely disregarded the fact that it is a lot easier to get into prison than out of it\u2026\n\nAnd this is only the beginning of Jack Keane's newest bizarre adventure: mysterious treasures, ruthless villains, two distractingly beautiful women and tons of clever humour await the most lovable treasure hunter to have ever sailed the seven seas in a comical tour de force around the globe. During his travels, Jack will not only meet old friends, but also encounter new faces such as the elegant city-lady Eve and the brilliant German engineer Carl.", "summary": "Jack Keane 2 - The Fire Within is set to revolutionise the classic point & click adventure genre. Never has an adventure been as cinematic, fast-paced and humorous, without breaking any of the iconic point & click gameplay rules.\n\nState of the art 3D-graphics, gripping action-sequences and the typical bizarre Jack Keanesque humour will be an absolute delight to all adventure fans.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jack-keane-2-the-fire-within", "videos": [{"id": 79435, "video_id": "gg7pSOexLtM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7pSOexLtM", "title": "Jack Keane 2: The Fire Within trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gg7pSOexLtM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
