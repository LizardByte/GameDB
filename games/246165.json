Now only you remain. The aliens have the advantage of numbers, but you are on home territory. Your mission is to collect energy berries left on the tracks and complete all 12 levels.\n\nThe game was probably never released independently, only as part of a collection that came with the Commodore 16. The gameboy version does not follow the original game where you have to shoot. In this version you have to collect points, but the graphics solutions are very similar.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xzap"}
