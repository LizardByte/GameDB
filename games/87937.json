Most passenger services have tens of departures over the 14hr daytime timetables, running times varying between 15 and 120 minutes. You can choose to drive any train while the other trains run under computer control. \n \nGreat replayability. Your driving style and timekeeping are evaluated and scored upon completing a run. Try the same run again to reach a higher score by braking more accurately or by driving more economically. You'll still need to prepare for suprises as traffic and delays may change from run to run. \n \nFor beginners and experienced trainsimmers alike. Integrated tutorials are included to assist beginning drivers in learning the train controls and operation. An optional key assistant shows which keys to press, when and why. Enable simple controls to operate the train with up/down keys only, while the actual throttle, shifter and brake levers are computer-controlled. Experienced drivers can operate the levers and other controls directly from the keyboard. \n \n- BR railcar classes included: 112, 117, 122, 126 and 127. Locomotives: BR Class 03 and 37. Mk1 coaches: FK, TSO, BSK and RMB. Wagons: 16t mineral wagon and GWR brake van. \n- All parts of the vehicle drive train (engines, fluid couplings, gearboxes, torque converters) are simulated to ensure realistic behaviour \n- The suspension of each vehicle is made up of axle boxes, bogie frames, planks and bolsters, all individually simulated to make the vehicle bounce and sway over uneven trackwork \n- Three fictitious routes with different characteristics totalling over 150 miles: 4- and 2-track main lines, short urban and suburban lines, mountainous rural single track lines \n- Route features: semaphore signalling, trackwork with superelevated curves, clothoid transition curves and individual rail joints \n- Regular runs and special rescue runs where a train has broken down at one of the stations and you're dispatched from the depot to get it back", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diesel-railcar-simulator", "videos": [{"id": 35633, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "458HbWpnoH0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=458HbWpnoH0", "title": "Diesel Railcar Simulator trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/458HbWpnoH0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
