His spaceship was both his home and the manifestation of freedom to Jack. In the prologue of our story this most precious thing was taken from him by force. Delivering suspicious \"geologists\" with military implants (ha!) and their equipment to a smugglers landing on the remote planet was quite risky, but the call of \"easy money\" could not be easily resisted in Jack's financial situation. Once he had fulfilled his part of the deal, the treacherous employer shot Jack in the back and dumped him from the ramp of his \"Beth\" like a sack of trash. Now Jack is stranded on K'Tharsis and wants \u201chis flying baby\u201d back. Bullets will be shot, teeth cracked and God knows what will happen, because Jack has become angrier and greedier than ever.", "summary": "Exoplanet: First Contact is a single-player, story driven action-RPG set in a space western universe, where real and fictional technologies meet the cruel and unforgiving, yet romantic reality of the Wild West exploration and development.
