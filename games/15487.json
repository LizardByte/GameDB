You play both the Grinch and his faithful pooch, Max, in this creative adaptation. Much like the classic story, THE GRINCH takes place in the idyllic Whoville--where your aim is to cease the event called Christmas. You attempt to do so by wreaking havoc and solving challenging puzzles. The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format. Whether you're a genuine grouch or you're just in the mood for a great adventure, THE GRINCH is hilarious fun for everyone.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
