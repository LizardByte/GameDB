You use the mouse to swap two gems to create a group of three or more of the same item. What you are trying to do is remove pieces of the yellow brick road. In some gems are trapped Munchkins. Freeing five of these will allow you to move two gems in a diagonal direction. During the game, you will encounter obstacles like locks and vines. Locks prevent the gem from moving and are cleared by making a match with the trapped gem or using a bonus item. Vines do not stop the gems from moving but must be cleared before you can clear the bricks."}
