In SCSIcide you play the role of a hard drive read head. As the different colored bits scroll by on the hard drive platter, you need to quickly read them in the correct order before you suffer a buffer underflow. As you complete each level, the data scrolls by more and more quickly! How far can you go? If you're a fan of Activision's Kaboom!, then you'll love SCSIcide. \n \nJoe Grand has spent some time recently updating SCSIcide and has released a new version of the game titled Ultra SCSIcide. This latest version of the game contains many improvements over the original: \n \nAdded support for joystick controllers. Controller type is automatically detected when you press the paddle or joystick fire button to start the game. \nFixed the flicker that used to occur at the beginning of each level. \nChanged background and data bit color palette to make bits easier to distinguish. \nReduced track size from 10 to 8 bits, for a more appropriate one byte per level. \nChanged speed increase per level - only two random data bits increase in speed each level. \nModified the sound and scoring routines to account for longer gameplay and higher levels. \nChanged title screen text and added GIS and Pixels Past logos. \nAdded a PAL version of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultra-scsicide"}
