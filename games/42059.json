The game features the subtitle \"Neo Hardboiled Shooting\".\n\nThe goal of the game is to explore each stage, fight a boss and move onto the next. Some stages are comprised of several linear enclosed areas that require that the player clear the room of enemies before they can proceed, while others are more open and let the player scroll in multiple directions while seeking out their foes. The story is sparse, and concerns the player's testing out of a new Custom CS-05 tank through a series of simulations.\n\nThe game was released exclusively for the PC Engine. It has yet to be rereleased in any capacity.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-stoker", "videos": [{"id": 25567, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "VZWqpdKqFAA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZWqpdKqFAA", "title": "Metal Stoker - PC Engine", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZWqpdKqFAA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
