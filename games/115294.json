After being banished by your father (who is apparently quite sensitive about your fashion choices), your only chance to return home is by amassing a complete suit of armour in the dark corners you\u2019re forced to explore. \n \nThe one-of-a-kind battle system links dice rolls to the weapons and attacks you use in battle. But keep your wits about you \u2013 your opponents rely on the same rolls for their merciless counterattacks. Create your own unique hero to lead into battle, collect and upgrade a deadly armoury of weapons, and hone your skills in the fight to regain your Orc street cred. \n \nForge a team of kindred heroes to compete in daily live tournaments, join a guild, and explore the dungeons side by side in co-op missions. Only the guilds with the most fearless adventurers will climb to the top of the leaderboard, so build the band of heroes you\u2019ve always dreamed of. Conquering heroes get their pick of 4 weapons from a pool of 50, each with bone-crunching upgrades, plus you can travel with up to 30 minion creatures to boost your chances in battle. It\u2019s time to get your Orc on.
