Your goal is to shoot the circles that are bouncing around. You aim automatically and shoot at the current aim position. Hold a button to shoot. The circles break up into smaller ones and you have to shoot them until they can no longer be broken down. The game is over when you touch any circle.\n\nIn \"Cate P\" you score points by destroying the caterpillars crawling around you. When you press a button you will rotate clockwise and shoot in the direction you were looking at before. Try to hit the caterpillars and avoid being hit by them. You score points by shooting the segments of a caterpillar. The game is over when any caterpillar touches you.\n\nIn \"S Lanes\" You are constantly moving between the four lanes on the left side of the screen. Your goal is to shoot enemies that are coming from the right to keep them from reaching the lanes. Hold a button to shoot and to move forward towards the enemies. Collect the coins that enemies drop after you destroy them to score points. The game is over when any enemy reaches any of the lanes.\n\nIn \"Thunder\" you are running in the middle of a thunderstorm. Collect the stars that form when lightning strikes the ground to score points. But avoid getting hit by lightning. Reverse your direction by pressing a button or by hitting the sides of the screen. The game is over when you get struck.\n\nIn \"UD Cave\" your screen is split in halves with a cave in each half. You control two characters simultaneously going through the caves on each side. The cave on the right is upside down. Press a button to make both characters go right. Collect coins on the way to score points. The game is over when either of the two characters hits the sides of the cave.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-button-games-5-in-1"}
