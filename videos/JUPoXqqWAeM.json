The game board is used to hide the ten ring tokens with various monster tokens under the castle tokens by the Ringmaster. The keyboard overlay is used by the Ringmaster to interface with the computer when your heroes enter the castles choosing what type of labyrinth in which you will do battle. Combat is controlled by using the computer joysticks.\n\nThere are four heroes a warrior with a magic sword, a wizard with various spells, a changeling who can become invisible and a phantom who can walk through and hide in walls. The four labyrinths are dungeons, infernoes, crystal caverns and shifting halls. The four monsters are orcs, bloodthirsts (bats), tyrantulus (spiders) and dragons.\n\nGameplay pits the Ringmaster against up to four players. The Ringmaster controls the game by hiding the rings, choosing the dungeons and can even enter into combat. Before the game starts the hero players decide how many turns it will take to complete the quest for the ten rings either 50, 75 or 100 turns. Turns are based on castle visits and combat and if you don't complete your quest within the amount of turns you choose you lose. The hero players can start from any designated starting point on the game board and begin their quest for the rings.\n\n\nWhat I think:\n\nWhile the game is complex, I think it has a mediocre gameplay.\nBesides, the only good character is the Warrior.\n\nHowever, what makes the game good is the overall package. \nFrom the story to the other stuff you get with it.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JUPoXqqWAeM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JUPoXqqWAeM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JUPoXqqWAeM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JUPoXqqWAeM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JUPoXqqWAeM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Quest for the Rings for the Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2 / Philips Videopac", "description": "Alternate titles:\n\n\"Speurtocht naar de Ringen\" -- Dutch title\n\"Sormusten Etsint\u00e4\" -- Finnish title\n\"La Qu\u00eate des Anneux\" -- French title\n\"La b\u00fasqueda de los Anillos\" -- Spanish title\n\"Jakten P\u00e5 De Magiska Ringarna\" -- Swedish title\n\"Jagten p\u00e5 Ringene\" -- Danish title\n\"Em Busca dos An\u00e9is Perdidos\" -- Brazilian title\n\"Die Suche Nach Den Ringen\" -- German title\n\"Caccia al Tesoro\" -- Italian title\n\n\nCame also out for:\n\n---\n\n\nGame description:\n\nQuest for the Rings is a fantasy strategy game using the combination of a game board, tokens, keyboard overlay and the computer to play the game.
