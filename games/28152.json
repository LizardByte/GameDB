Napple World, known as the land of daydreams, lies between the Real World and the Deep Dream, where souls go to rest. The concept of time in Napple World is unlike the real world: the seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter exist separately from each other as distinct locations. When Poach arrives in Napple World, six fairy-like beings called Petals leave her body and escape into the seasons, and she must retrieve them in order to go home again. To make up for his mistake, Straynap becomes Poach's guide and instructs her throughout the game, explaining the often contradictory nature of Napple World to her.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/napple-tale-arsia-in-daydream", "videos": [{"id": 88302, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eiEtd4N6mWk"}]}
