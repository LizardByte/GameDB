The price is a free trailer pitch in Monaco. But of course the player has to work for it - in this case the task is to win six illegal street races in Aachen, Paris, Lyon, Marseilles, Monaco and Nice. There are five humorous exaggerated persons to choose, e.g. a hippie or a stressed family father.\n\nThe races are heavily action oriented and include power-ups which either increase the top speed, freeze other cars or repair the own vehicle. Between the races the player can invest earned points in better tires, engines or gearboxes; he also can gamble for other equipment. The available vehicles are no regular cars but jet ski trailers or jeeps. When beating the game with all vehicle types the player unlocks a special car.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/holiday-racer"}
