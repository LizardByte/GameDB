Each game is unique, as an ancient spell causes the maze to bend and swirl into a new challenge when you start a new game. Monsters and traps will hinder your journey, while treasures of steel and magic will allow you to grow in might. The goal of the game is to retrieve 11 lost crowns, which will require many journeys through the dungeon. Once you have all the crowns, find the white star and perform the ritual to honor the kings.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kings-of-edom"}
