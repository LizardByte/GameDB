Bringing back memories of her first partially complete solo mission, she decides to finish the job, taking you along with her - whether you like it or not.\n\nUnbeknownst to either of you, this sets in motion a series of events that has repercussions for your rivalry with Grendel and your organisation.", "summary": "Welcome To...
