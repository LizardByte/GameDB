The game also has hidden rooms which allows players to rack up bonus points and find items that are needed to see the best ending. The endings themselves have been changed to be a bit more cinematic.\n\nSuper Bubble Bobble is a mode in the original version that happened after the player beat the original set of levels and had to beat them again with the enemies being swapped around. Beating this would allow the player to see the true ending. This version of the game lacks this mode as the 200 levels are considered one playthrough.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bubble-bobble--9", "videos": [{"id": 140663, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NdbYy6uKeoY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdbYy6uKeoY", "title": "Bubble Bobble - Sega Master System playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NdbYy6uKeoY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 140664, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "YA5c3UHN8Z4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA5c3UHN8Z4", "title": "Master System Longplay [170] Final Bubble Bobble", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YA5c3UHN8Z4/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2813, "name": "Bubble Bobble"}]}
