It is rare for typing software, and the images from that time are used as they are. The original version of the opening theme \"Devilman's Song\" is also recorded, and the voice actors who are appearing are also members at that time.\nIn \"Story Mode\", the demons sent by Demon King Zenon appear in the order of broadcasting. Let's clear the stages one after another (by typing) while fighting as if you were the main character. In the \"database\", you can see character information, digested stories, and valuable setting materials. Of course, there is also a \"training mode\" for practice and dan certification to measure your current ability, so you can use it without getting tired of having fun or practicing seriously.\nNot only Go Nagai fans but also people of the age who were watching the broadcast at that time will be able to practice while feeling nostalgia. OS is compatible with Windows only. (translated from the amazon page)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/devilman-typing-soft-devil-strike"}
