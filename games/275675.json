Many have dared to enter its depths, but few have returned to tell the tale. It is said that those who do venture into the tunnel are approached by dark forces, spirits and strange cults who lurk in the shadows.\n\nIn 1915, a young girl named May and her family lived nearby, but tragedy struck when they were brutally murdered. May, along with her doll, managed to escape into the tunnels, but was never seen again. Some say her spirit still haunts the tunnel.\n\nOutside the tunnel rumors circulate of a powerful artifact, and cults vying for its possession. It is said that a dark force, an ancient demon, has been unleashed and now possesses the spirit of one of the victims. The fate of the artifact and the trapped spirit remains unknown.", "summary": "A first person horror game about ghost hunting.
