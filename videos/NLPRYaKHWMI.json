{"id": "NLPRYaKHWMI", "snippet": {"title": "NEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle - TRAILER", "description": "\u00c6theric Worlds is proud to present NEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle!\n\nThe first of several games that \u00c6theric Worlds has in its production pipeline, NEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle is a game with three distinct purposes - to entertain you, to relax you, and to challenge your strategic and critical thinking skills - based upon whatever your frame of mind desires it to be. Based in the world of Tyanaphos, NEXUS provides a glimpse into the larger world that is waiting to be brought forward, while also providing an engaging game of itself.\n\nA strategic solitaire card game inspired by Hanafuda (a traditional Japanese flower card game similar to mah jongg or rummy), NEXUS is entirely shaped by how you approach it. As with any solitaire game, you can choose to go after the highest points available in any hand -- but there are other options as well, and sometimes points aren't the final goal. In the end, it's all about the choices you make.\n\nNEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle is expected to launch soon on the Windows store, with other locations coming in the near future.\n\nEven while NEXUS' development continues, we've still got goodies coming out for you to enjoy! The game has nearly 1\u00bd hours of music, and we've released it for your listening pleasure. The NEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle Soundtrack is available on Bandcamp for download. We're looking into making it available via iTunes and Amazon, so check back at our site for updates, especially as the Amazon option may allow for physical CDs.\n\n\u00c6theric Worlds - http://www.aethericworlds.com\nNEXUS soundtrack available - http://aethericworlds.bandcamp.com\n\nNEXUS: The Zoraidian Oracle, as well as all related art and music, is owned entirely by \u00c6theric Worlds, LLC.
