I mean Privateer game\n\nLooking for Pirate games for VR?\nLook no further!!!\nSail is a pirate game coming soon to the oculus quest 2 and other VR platforms! \n\nDOWNLOAD LINK: https://sidequestvr.com/app/1339/sail\n\nCurrent version of SAIL allows you explore islands, sail a ship and look for loot. It's VR so feel free to walk around the deck, fire the cannon and adjust the sails. You will also find weapons hidden around the map, if you're having a hard time finding them try breaking those crates you see lying around.\n\nThe map keeps expanding and currently there are 4 areas to explore.\n\nShipwreck Island is home to the long dead captain still guarding his chest. His massive abandoned war ship lies broken on the rocks of this captain's final resting place.\n\nMonolith pass is a great place to test your sailing skills. With huge obstacles and another warship it gives new sailors an excellent chance to see what their vessel is capable of. You can also climb to the top of the highest peak to see the lowly prisoner that was hung out for his crimes.\n\nIsla Fortuna is a small port town where every sailor starts their quest. With it's grand docks and shops it will soon become the center of all things in the Sail economy.\n\nWhat's the plan with SAIL?\nCheckout G119's interview with AscendVR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hjJ0ClHNy0&t=937s\n\nSAIL is the start of a VR universe G119 (developer) has wanted to make for years.
