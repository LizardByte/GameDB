You drive around a track trying to get as far as you can in the time (err.. fuel) allotted.  This has the standard 4-gear setup, so shifting at the right time through the 4 gears is critical, and actually your car starts slowing down if you're going slow in too high a gear - a nice touch.  Now, when you hit top speed in 4th gear, it gets pretty squirrely to control the car - there isn't much reaction time, especially if you hit a car and go off in a random direction.  However, it is on the edge of controllability, so most of the time you can actually at least stay on the track... other than those random hits.  Tricky, but fun.  You get extended play at 340pts, so my goal was to get there and I finally did it right at the end of my timer.  Epic!  So, its a decent game but nothing special.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X6CteSFaqIw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X6CteSFaqIw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X6CteSFaqIw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X6CteSFaqIw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X6CteSFaqIw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Monte Carlo - (1980) - Arcade - gameplay", "description": "Atari \u00a9 1980\n[Coin-Op] Arcade Video Game\nEmulator: MAME 0.215\n\nSimilar to Super Bug and Long Beach and other games like it.
