On your way, there are a few obstacles that you need to get through. There\u2019s a small problem however, because you can only touch obstacles that are the same color as your ball. If you touch an obstacle with a different color, the game ends and you need to start from the beginning.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/color-bump-3d"}
