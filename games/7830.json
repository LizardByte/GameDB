This made it possible to create City of Heroes servers outside the direct purview of NCSoft and revived interest in the game, which by then had been out of development for more than six years.\n\nAs of January 2024, NCSoft has not moved to have servers based on this source code shut down. On January 4, 2024, NCSoft officially granted Homecoming Servers LLC who operated the rogue server Homecoming: City of Heroes an official license to host the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-of-heroes"}
