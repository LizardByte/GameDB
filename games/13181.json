Unfortunately, the starship is accidentally hit by the \"Croteam crate-bus\" and plummets down to Earth's surface. As the starship falls, Sam reads the coordinates and frets about crash-landing into Egypt again, but instead he crashes into Central America in the Mayan age, with the starship now heavily damaged upon impact. However, not all hope is lost, since the Sirians left a \"back-up starship\" on Earth, which was a fail-safe in case anything ever happened to the SSS Centerprice. However, since this back-up starship is located in a different time and age than where and when Sam currently is, he will have to uncover the locations of the Sirian portals that will help him reach his destination.", "summary": "Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter is a visually upgraded and fully Steam supported remake of the original high-adrenaline single-play and 16-player co-operative arcade-action FPS and Gamespot's Game of the Month!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/serious-sam-hd-the-second-encounter", "videos": [{"id": 5750, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "D6vaSJpx0D4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6vaSJpx0D4", "title": "[720p] Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter NEW House of Sam trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6vaSJpx0D4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
