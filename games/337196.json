You are a naval pilot of the F6F \"Hellcat\" in one of the best early 3D rendered open-world flight simulators. After this project, Graphic Simulations used the same base code to make the next generation flight simulator F/A-18 Hornet.\n\nThere are 8 new missions in the Leyte Gulf (Phillipines) theater. New added features included the use of rockets and torpedos. We encounter a brand new enemy aircraft, the Ki-84 \"Frank\" (first encountered in Mission X), a far superior adversary than the Mitsubishi Ay6M \"Zero\" in HotP. In addition, new allied aircraft make appearances, including the Lockheed P-38 \"Lightning.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hellcats-missions-at-leyte-gulf", "videos": [{"id": 144623, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zJhAd3TQ-tg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJhAd3TQ-tg", "title": "Hellcats: Missions at Leyte Gulf", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zJhAd3TQ-tg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
