When Youmu pointed out it to her, Yuyuko dodged the question and then set a condition that Youmu should defeat Reimu Hakurei, and then she would consider her demand.\n\nYoumu knew that she would hardly be able to defeat Reimu at her current level, and that Yuyuko probably just wanted to shirk the training, but she had no other ideas. Will she be able to defeat Reimu? With these thoughts she leaves Hakugyokurou to find the shrine maiden.", "summary": "Youyou Kengeki Musou is a 3D platformer Touhou fangame starring Youmu Konpaku.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
