Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new. This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paper-mario-dark-star-edition"}
