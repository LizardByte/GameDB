Based in Japan's chaotic Warring States period, this game portrays even greater battles for power than before. In addition, in foreign relations, different foreign strategies are introduced including encircling powerful enemies with multiple Forces, forming alliances between three Forces, and much more. Also with movement and battles progressing in real time, players experience more vividly the give and take of strategic battle. The power up kit adds 3 new scenarios, a database giving officer and castle introductions, and an editing function.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nobunagas-ambition-soutenroku-with-power-up-kit"}
