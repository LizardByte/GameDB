You play as The Batter once more, dropped into a world slowly falling apart from a mysterious force corrupting it. It is your job to decide whether to fight against this force, or let it consume the world around you. Follow either of the two voices guiding you, or choose to cut your own path to find out the truth of what happened.\n\nSincere Deceit is a horror game at heart, and thus deals with many heavy topics, such as violence/cruelty, gore/body horror, suicide, cult indoctrination, jumpscares (both visual and audio based) and some flashing on the screen. This is not a game for the faint of heart.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sincere-deceit--1"}
