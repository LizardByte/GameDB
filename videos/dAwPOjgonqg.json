This latest addition to our growing list of maps offers you a new \u2018green\u2019 terrain, covering one of the most spectacular peninsulas in the world. At the frontiers of northern Scandinavia and Russia, DCS: Kola offers impressive immersion and great new game play opportunities for WWII, Cold War and Modern combat scenarios. \n\nThe DCS: Kola map spans an extensive area that features the rugged terrain and dramatic coastlines that define the Kola Peninsula. It covers northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Russian Murmansk Oblast and parts of the Karelia region. The map also includes large areas of the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea to the north and west, ideal for aircraft carrier operations. The DCS: Kola map by Orbx is based on the current-day with some allowance for late-Cold War military features and functionality. \n\nWhilst in early access, DCS: Kola is available with -20% savings.
