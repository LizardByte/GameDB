Jim Hawkins, who fled with his share of Long John Silver's treasure as a small boy, has become the Captain of his own ship and is thrown into a race for a hoard of buried treasure. Set sail for the mysterious Emerald Isle with the aid of your parrot and a rhyming riddle, but beware: other pirates are after the treasure and the race is on to see who can reach it first!"}
