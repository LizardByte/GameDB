It's a solo campaign, but you'll never be alone - beware of the demons, they are everywhere and they want to see you dead. You\u2019ll have the chance to visit many unique locations, fight powerful monsters, avoid traps, and fight bosses! Investigate the source of the radio signal in an old castle on Neo Valkyria, discover the secrets of a suspicious-looking laboratory, explore Alien World with its intriguing wildlife and try not to die in flames while on a mission in Lava Cave. There are all sorts of beverages for you to acquire and every single one of them has its own unique power. Protect yourself, slow your enemies, become incredibly powerful and even visit other dimensions, but be careful... the drinks may be toxic! Some of them can make you feel a little fuzzy. Do you often feel nostalgic? Check out the \"old-school\" mode, which will take you on a journey through the pixelated version of the game! Get a taste of the good, old days! Spend hours tearing up any demon who stands in your way! Watch the blood spurt everywhere and leave the pile of corpses in your wake!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
