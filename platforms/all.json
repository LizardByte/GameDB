In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button, silver on the original controllers and red on the black controllers. The games, graphics and packaging were designed by Ron Bradford and Steve Lehner.\n\nOne other difference in these controllers is that the earliest releases of the silver joystick were removable. They could be plugged and unplugged from the back of the unit, while all later silver and all black controllers were hardwired into the rear of the unit itself (although the joysticks still can be easily replaced, but not without dismounting the cover deck).\n\nOne of the strongest points of the system was its speech synthesis unit, which was released as an add-on for speech, music, and sound effects enhancement.

It seemed only natural that developers would create advancements to the original AY-3-8500 chip to incorporate color and even more games.

This allowed Pong to have a longer success. Rather then creating a new machine for each new chip, developers took the General Instruments popular line of chips and slapped them into cartridges. These carts were not like ROM carts used in later systems. They simply housed a specific General Instruments processor chip with pin outs to interface with a console. These were the PC-50X line of cartridges. \n \nWith the PC-50X cartridges available, console manufacturers were able to produce a machine that could play several games and market them at a low cost. The units were made in various countries and were marketed by Creatronic, Hanimex, ITMC, Rollet, GrandStand, Soundic and lord knows how many other manufacturers. There are literally over two hundred console variations that utilized this technology. \n \nThe initial model SD-050 varied in terms of outward appearance (colors, etc), manufacturers names and slight modifications. However each unit had the same overall design with two detachable controllers with 10 buttons located on the top of the machine. These 10 buttons, which clearly identify a PC-50X based console, were used to select the different games available on each cart. The SD-050 model only produced black and white video. \n \nNew models such as the SD-070 and SD-090 appeared and sold well into the 80s since the units were far cheaper then the newer consoles making waves in the US and Japan.

Released in Japan to a subdued reception, the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign, but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2. Sales did not meet Sega's expectations despite several price cuts, and the company continued to incur significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher. In total, 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide. \n \nAlthough the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time.

Whether or not that is true will probably remain a secret as the system's (still existing) former distributor has scrapped any documentation of the product that nearly got the company into bankruptcy. Information on the internet about the console's development history, however, is often contradictionary, inaccurate and often blatantly false. \nFor instance, the most common and aggravating misconception is that the VC 4000 is \"based on\" the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System, which supposedly was released as early as 1976! That would mean, that the technology used in the VC 4000 predates Atari's VCS by about a year and competes with Fairchild's Channel F for the title \"first 2nd generation video game system\". However, it is actually enough to compare the graphic capabilites of the two systems to realise that such information must be rubbish. So, here are some clarifying facts: \nBoth, the VC 4000 and the 1292 APVS, are built around the Signetics 2650 microprocessor, which was released in late 1975. That was around the same time when Philips had bought the Signetics company and shipped the technology over to Europe. At that time Philips' subsidary Magnavox was developing a system based on the arguably more powerful Intel 8048 microprocessor - that system would later become known as the G7000 (or Odyssey\u00b2 in the USA). Having one hardware product already in development, Philips decided to treat the Signetics 2650 as commercial product, targeting small-sized electronic-manufacturers, who were already swarming the market with PONG-clones. \nConsidering that the VC 4000 is software-compatible (but not slot-compatible!) with the 1292 APVS, and considering that the two systems share the early half of their game library with identical game-titles implies the hypothesis that Philips sold both, the Signetics 2650 hardware and a certain number of developed ROM-software to two or three dozen companies, who developed, admittedly different, but ultimately compatible gaming systems, namely the VC 4000 and the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System. The misconception that the 1292 APVS was released already in 1976 is probably owed to the - by now viral - misinformation that Radofin (the most prominent 1292 APVS manufacturer) released its first cosoles in 1976. These, however, were no microprocessored early wonder-machines, but plain PONG-clones. \nMore evidence to support this hypothesis is provided by a Swedish TV broadcast from April 1979, when a team from SVT (Swedish broadcast company) visited the Philips-reasearch-centre in Eindhoven, Netherlands to talk about the future of video games.

It was released on November 15, 2001, in North America, followed by Australia and Europe in 2002. It was Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market. The sixth-generation console competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Sega's Dreamcast, and the Nintendo GameCube. It was the first console produced by an American company since the Atari Jaguar ceased production in 1996.\n\nIn November 2002, Microsoft launched Xbox Live, a fee-based online gaming service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a broadband connection. Unlike other online services from Sega and Sony, Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated Ethernet port. The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a relevant competitor to other sixth-generation consoles.\n\nXbox's successor, the Xbox 360, was launched in November 2005. The Xbox was soon discontinued beginning with Microsoft's worst-performing market, Japan, in 2005. Other countries would follow suit in 2006. The last Xbox game in Europe was Xiaolin Showdown released in June 2007, and the last game in North America was Madden NFL 09 released in August 2008. Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on March 2, 2009. Support for Xbox Live on the console ended on April 15, 2010.\n\nXbox launched in North America and quickly sold out. Its launch in that region was successful, selling 1.53 million units three months after launch, which is higher than its successor Xbox 360, as well as the GameCube, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and even the PlayStation 2 and Wii.\n\nThe Xbox has sold 24 million units worldwide as of May 10, 2006, according to Microsoft. This is divided out to 16 million units sold in North America, six million units in Europe, and just two million units sold in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe Xbox was almost always behind the PlayStation 2 in terms of sales, although in April 2004, the Xbox outsold the PS2 in the U.S. Despite lagging far behind the PlayStation 2's sales, the Xbox was overall a success (especially in North America), keeping a steady second place in the generation sales.\n\nThe popularity of the Xbox, as well as (in the United States) its comparatively short 90-day warranty, inspired efforts to circumvent the built-in hardware and software security mechanisms, a practice informally known as modding.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/xbox/version/initial-version-6ac4b90f-0745-458f-866d-3672aa6ed5eb"}]}, "108": {"id": 108, "abbreviation": "pdp11", "category": 6, "name": "PDP-11", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/pdp11", "versions": [{"id": 134, "name": "Initial version", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/pdp11/version/initial-version"}]}, "53": {"id": 53, "abbreviation": "MSX2", "category": 6, "name": "MSX2", "platform_logo": {"id": 308, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8k.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/msx2", "versions": [{"id": 48, "name": "Initial version", "platform_logo": {"id": 308, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8k.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 112, "date": 441676800, "human": "1983", "m": 12, "region": 8, "y": 1983}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/msx2/version/initial-version-1a53a258-c792-4df6-b5f6-e616f571b4b0"}]}, "60": {"id": 60, "abbreviation": "Atari7800", "alternative_name": "Atari 7800 ProSystem", "category": 1, "generation": 3, "name": "Atari 7800", "platform_logo": {"id": 303, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8f.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/atari7800", "versions": [{"id": 26, "cpu": "Atari SALLY 6502 @ 1,19-1,79 MHz", "media": "ROM cartridge", "memory": "4KB RAM", "name": "Initial version", "output": "S-Video", "platform_logo": {"id": 303, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8f.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 44, "date": 456019200, "human": "Jun 14, 1984", "m": 6, "region": 2, "y": 1984}], "resolutions": "160x240, 320x240", "storage": "4KB BIOS Rom, 48KB Cartridge ROM", "summary": "The Atari 7800 ProSystem was released a full two years after it was designed and tested. The console was Atari's attempt to compete with the NES and Sega Master System. Following a massive research project focused on determining exactly what consumers were demanding from a video game platform, Atari knew what it needed for its next generation system. They selected the General Computer Corporation to design new a graphics chip. \"Marie\" was what they named it. It provided a greater spectrum of colors and an endless number of sprites.\n\nThere was also one extra feature Atari added to the Marie chip. In an effort to combat third-party game manufacturers from taking a huge chunk out of their potential software profits, Atari installed an encryption algorithm (like a coded lock) into the Marie Chip. The 7800 would only allow cartridges containing a 960-bit encoded \"key\" to activate its state-of-the-art graphics and sound capabilities. If a cartridge did not include the proper coded authentication, the system remained in its default mode and could only run games made for the 2600.\n\nWith the 7800, Atari attempted to correct all of the shortcomings inherent to the 5200 platform. As stated above, the 7800 was compatible with 2600 cartridges. They had even designed an adapter (later discarded upon release) which would let the 7800 play 5200 cartridges, giving Atari across-the-board compatibility with all previous software. To make the system even more attractive to consumers considering purchasing a home computer, Atari promised an optional keyboard add-on.\n\nWhile size of the 7800 console is much smaller than the immense 5200, the major improvement was made in the joystick design. The 7800 controller was made more in the tradition of the 2600. It is sleek, simple and, most importantly, durable.\n\nIn 1983, the Marie project was a courageous attempt to bring Atari back as the preeminent name in video games. Atari poured their best available personnel into the project. The system was ready and waiting to ignite the stagnant video game market.\n\nUnfortunately timing was working against the proponents of the 7800. In 1984, Warner Communications sold Atari to Jack Tramiel. He wanted to focus on the company's computer line, and the Atari 7800 was shelved.\n\nThe video game market awoke with a roar in 1985. Nintendo had released the NES game system to American consumers. Videogame sales skyrocketed and soon Sega premiered its Sega Master System. Seeing there was money to be made, Atari scrambled to get onto the playing field and released the Atari 7800 in 1986 with only three games: Ms. Pac-Man, Joust and Asteroids.\n\nWith a paltry $300,000 advertising budget Atari gave the system a half-hearted release.

Critics praised the service for allowing users to demo games without the need to install them, along with its built-in spectator mode.\n\nOn April 2, 2015, it was announced that Sony Computer Entertainment had acquired OnLive's patents, and that all OnLive services would be discontinued on April 30, 2015.

By 1982, Atari game programmers realized that they were severely limited by the capabilities of the 2600 system.\n\nThe designers incorporated technology into the 5200 (called \"Pam\" in developmental stages) which they had just developed for their own 8-bit 400 and 800 series personal computer systems. The 5200 is basically a game console version of their home computer, substituting a controller in place of a keyboard.\n\nThe Intellivision system had raised the stakes in the gaming industry with its 16-position controller. Atari's own 2600 offered only 8 positions. In hopes of obliterating the competition, Atari designer, Craig Asher helped engineer the \"analog\" controller. It gives players full, 360\u00b0 control of the action on-screen.\n\nThe 5200 controller contains two other features which made Atari's unique to any other system built by 1982: First, It offers speed variability. When a joystick is held in a single direction long enough, a player can increase his or her rate of on-screen movement. Second, it contains an easy-access PAUSE button, enabling players to easily freeze their games indefinitely. This immediately became a normal feature on most every subsequent system controller.\n\nUnfortunately there turned out to be a major drawback to this groundbreaking technology. The analog controllers never caught on with consumers because they are \"non-centering,\" meaning they do not feature a neutral position. There is no way to come to an immediate stop. This factor will tend to inflict a high level of frustration on any 5200 player who tackles a game which requires precision stopping and starting movements like Frogger or Pac-Man. The controllers were also apparently not made with durability in mind and are quite easily broken.\n\nWhen Atari released the 5200 it was incompatible with 2600 cartridges. Consumers who had loaded up on games for the 2600 were understandably reluctant to invest in an entirely new platform. Its initial retail price of $330 didn't cause units to fly off of the shelves either.\n\nThe 5200 also improved on the 2600 in its switch box. The 2600 system requires players to walk behind the television and change the setting on the box setting from TV to GAME. The 5200 automatically switches to GAME after the power is turned on. Also, when changing cartridges, the 5200 shifts to a black screen instead of the annoying, white noisy static players get between games with the 2600.\n\nWhen the platform was launched in 1982, Atari chose not to support it with any \"must have\" new titles. Instead they decided to re-release improved versions of former best seller for the 2600 like Space Invaders or Galaxian. Later, they did offer more sought-after titles like Joust, Space Dungeon and Ms. Pac-Man, but by that time the gaming market was on the verge of collapse.\n\nIn 1983, between: Atari (with the 5200 and 2600), ColecoVision and Intellivision, the VCS (Video Computer System) market was stuck in a glut due to an oversaturation of product. Consumers were also demanding that their computers perform more functions than just play games. At that point the Commodore 64 and Atari 800XL home computers had just been released.\n\nEven after a slow start, 1983 sales for the 5200 plummeted. Warner Communications (Atari's former parent company) reported second quarter losses of $283.4 million. By the end of the year, Atari had posted losses of $536 million. They ended production of the 5200 in 1984.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/atari5200/version/initial-version-e61f84a7-2907-4d65-af7d-4edf75c34dd7"}]}, "67": {"id": 67, "abbreviation": "intellivision", "category": 1, "generation": 2, "name": "Intellivision", "platform_logo": {"id": 312, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8o.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/intellivision", "versions": [{"id": 42, "cpu": "GI CP1610", "media": "ROM cartridge", "name": "Initial version", "platform_logo": {"id": 312, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8o.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 99, "date": 347068800, "human": "1980", "m": 12, "region": 2, "y": 1980}, {"id": 100, "date": 410140800, "human": "1982", "m": 12, "region": 5, "y": 1982}, {"id": 101, "date": 410140800, "human": "1982", "m": 12, "region": 1, "y": 1982}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/intellivision/version/initial-version-c9a95eb1-f299-40fe-8ea5-38561de50c23"}]}, "73": {"id": 73, "abbreviation": "blackberry", "category": 4, "name": "BlackBerry OS", "platform_logo": {"id": 40, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bezbkk17hk0uobdkhjcv.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/blackberry", "versions": [{"id": 34, "name": "Initial version", "platform_logo": {"id": 40, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bezbkk17hk0uobdkhjcv.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 68, "date": 916358400, "human": "Jan 15, 1999", "m": 1, "region": 8, "y": 1999}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/blackberry/version/initial-version-d71a6afd-592a-42e8-8e07-1840a9f74687"}]}, "307": {"id": 307, "alternative_name": "Tricotronic, GW, G&W", "category": 5, "generation": 2, "name": "Game & Watch", "platform_logo": {"id": 531, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pler.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/game-and-watch", "versions": [{"id": 424, "cpu": "4-bit CPU Sharp SM5xx", "name": "Initial version", "output": "LCD screen", "platform_logo": {"id": 531, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pler.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 541, "date": 325728000, "human": "Apr 28, 1980", "m": 4, "region": 8, "y": 1980}], "summary": "The Game & Watch brand (called Tricotronic in West Germany and Austria, abbreviated as G&W) is a series of handheld electronic games developed, manufactured, released and marketed by Nintendo from 1980 to 1991.

The console was released to the general public on June 25, 2013, and features an exclusive Ouya store for applications and games designed specifically for the Ouya platform, of which the majority are casual games targeted at or used by a mass audience of casual gamers. Out of the box, Ouya supports media apps such as TwitchTV and XBMC media player. It runs a modified version of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, and is open to rooting without voiding the warranty (developer models ordered during the Kickstarter campaign for $699 or $1,337 come pre-rooted). The console's hardware design allows it to be easily opened up, requiring only a standard screwdriver for easy modding and possible hardware addons.\n\nAll systems can be used as development kits, allowing any Ouya owner to also be a developer, without the need for licensing fees. All games are required to have some kind of free-to-play aspect, whether that be completely free, has a free trial, or has purchasable upgrades, levels, or other in-game items. The Ouya is classified as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles and as such is a rival competing against the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U.\n\nAfter financial issues, Ouya's employees and software assets were sold to Razer Inc., who announced the discontinuation of the Ouya console on July 27, 2015.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/ouya/version/initial-version-729a252f-e870-487e-a893-c9a2f1139bbd"}]}, "95": {"id": 95, "abbreviation": "pdp1", "alternative_name": "Programmed Data Processor-1", "category": 6, "name": "PDP-1", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/pdp1", "versions": [{"id": 115, "name": "Initial version", "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 553, "date": -315705600, "human": "1959", "m": 12, "region": 2, "y": 1959}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/pdp1/version/initial-version"}]}, "151": {"id": 151, "alternative_name": "Tandy Color Computer", "category": 6, "name": "TRS-80 Color Computer", "platform_logo": {"id": 541, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plf1.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/trs-80-color-computer", "versions": [{"id": 216, "cpu": "Motorola 6809E @ 0.895 MHz / 1.79 MHz", "graphics": "MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG)", "memory": "4 KB / 16 KB / 32 KB / 64 KB / 128 KB / 512 KB", "name": "Initial version", "os": "Color BASIC 1.0 / 2.0 / OS-9", "platform_logo": {"id": 541, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plf1.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 550, "date": 336614400, "human": "Sep 1980", "m": 9, "region": 8, "y": 1980}], "summary": "The RadioShack TRS-80 Color Computer (later marketed as the Tandy Color Computer and sometimes nicknamed the CoCo) is a line of home computers based on the Motorola 6809 processor.

This technique results in more stable frame rates and higher resolution, with no impact on the final image quality. \n \n- Hardware-accelerated DirectX Raytracing: You can expect more dynamic and realistic environments powered by hardware-accelerated DirectX Raytracing \u2013 a first for console gaming. This means true-to-life lighting, accurate reflections and realistic acoustics in real time as you explore the game world.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/version/xbox-series-x"}, {"id": 489, "name": "Xbox Series S", "summary": "Xbox Series S delivers the same next generation speed and performance that define Xbox Series X.

Amiga incorporated a 16-bit 68000 chip as Lorraine's CPU. Lorraine featured two dedicated graphics and sound chips.\n\nBy the time Lorraine was introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show on January 4, 1984, the developmental costs that Amiga had devoted to it had exceeded its resources. After Atari showed interest in purchasing the company, Commodore stepped in to outbid the console giant and renamed the system the Amiga.\n\nCommodore made some slight modifications to the Amiga. The system's memory was upgraded to 256KB and the console was redesigned to accommodate keyboard storage underneath it. Commodore finally released the Amiga 1000 in July 1985 at a retail price of $1,295. It was compatible with home television sets and could be utilized for video editing. It featured a palette of 4,096 colors and was capable of 320 x 200 resolution. The system also featured a 3.5 inch floppy disk drive that could externally store up to 880KB.\n\nThe \"Paula\" sound chip enabled programs to be heard in stereo. The system featured two mouse/controller ports. Such peripherals as joysticks, light pens or game paddles could be used with the system. Even in its early stages of release, Commodore chose to promote the Amiga as a game machine.\n\nThe \"kickstart\" was a small part of the operating system that was contained in the ROM. The Amiga performed a kickstart or initiated the loading of the operating system itself every time the computer was activated. To fully load the operating system a 3.5 inch AmigaDos disk needed to be inserted into the external drive. Every time the computer was shut off, the operating system was lost from memory and needed to be reloaded.\n\nThe Amiga 1000 was capable of \"multitasking.\" A concept similar to Windows 95, multitasking allowed users to keep two or more programs open at one time and instantly switch between them. The \"Workbench\" was the Amiga's file manager. Workbench allowed users to open windows and run programs.\n\nIn 1987, Commodore released the Amiga 500 and the Amiga 2000. The Amiga 500 was a compact system that became the best selling computer in the Amiga line. Among the improvements Commodore incorporated into the Amiga 500 were an updated operating system (AmigaDOS 1.2), 512KB RAM and a bigger keyboard. The Amiga 2000 featured a new computer case design, expansion slots and a CPU slot for future processor upgrades. It was powered by a 68000 microprocessor.\n\nThe Amiga 3000 improved on the Amiga 2000 by offering new Zorro III expansion slots, an integrated SCSI interface and a built-in hard drive. It used a 68030 32-bit microprocessor and a new version of Workbench.\n\nIn 1992 Commodore released the Amiga 600. Commodore promoted the system as a video game console with a keyboard. It quickly vanished from store shelves. Later that year Commodore released the Amiga 4000 and the Amiga 1200. The 4000 featured the speedy 68040 processor. It could display up to 256,000 colors on-screen at once. The 1200 was a compact system that combined the CPU, keyboard and disk drive into a single unit. It was similar in design to the Amiga 500. It utilized the 68020 processor and could run at 14.28MHz.\n\nIn October 1993 Commodore introduced the Amiga CD 32. This 32-bit CD-ROM based add-on featured a palette of 17 million colors. It retailed for $400 and had a built-in catalog of software because it was compatible with game titles for the failed Commodore CDTV multimedia system. Timing for the CD 32's release was not perfect. Several other CD-ROM based gaming consoles, like the 3DO and Sega CD, were released at the same time and flooded the market. The Amiga CD 32 system never gained a following.\n\nUnfortunately, software developers rarely released programs that displayed the full potential of the Amiga's impressive graphics. The system was much more technologically advanced than its competitors. Ultimately the Amiga was viewed as an expensive gaming console, and as software support dwindled, so did sales. On April 29, 1994 Commodore announced that it was in the process of closing the company.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/amiga/version/amiga-a-500"}, {"id": 109, "cpu": "Motorola 68000", "memory": "1MB", "name": "Amiga A 600", "os": "AmigaOS 2.0", "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 238, "date": 699408000, "human": "Mar 01, 1992", "m": 3, "region": 8, "y": 1992}], "storage": "20MB 2.5\" Disk Drive", "summary": "Codenamed \"June Bug\" this was the successor to Amiga's A500 model.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/amiga/version/amiga-a-600"}, {"id": 110, "name": "Amiga A 1000", "platform_logo": {"id": 735, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plkf.jpg"}, "summary": "The Commodore Amiga 1000, also known as the A1000, is the first personal computer released by Commodore International in the Amiga line.

It used the .NET Compact Framework 1.0 SP3, an environment for programs based on .NET. Windows Mobile 5.0 included Microsoft Exchange Server \"push\" functionality improvements that worked with Exchange 2003 SP2. The \"push\" functionality also required vendor/device support[5] With AKU2 software upgrades all WM 5.0 devices supported DirectPush. This version featured increased battery life due to Persistent storage capability. Previously up to 50% (enough for 72 hours of storage) of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile RAM. This continued the trend of Windows-based devices moving from using RAM as their primary storage medium to the use of a combination of RAM and flash memory (in use, no distinction between the two is obvious to users). Programs and frequently accessed data run in RAM, while most storage is in the flash memory. The OS seamlessly moves data between the two as needed. Everything is backed up in the flash memory, so unlike prior devices, WM5 devices lose no data if power is lost. New to 5.0, OS updates were released as Adaptation kit upgrades, with AKU 3.5 being the final released.\n\nA new version of Office was bundled called \"Microsoft Office Mobile\" which includes PowerPoint Mobile, Excel Mobile with graphing capability and Word Mobile with the ability to insert tables and graphics. Media management and playback was enhanced with Picture and Video package, which converged the management of videos and pictures and Windows Media Player 10 Mobile. Among new hardware features were enhanced Bluetooth support, default QWERTY keyboard-support and a management interface for Global Positioning System (GPS). Improvements were made to ActiveSync 4.2 with 15% increased synchronization speed. Business customers benefited from a new error reporting facility similar to that present in desktop and server Windows systems. Caller ID now supports photos so a user can apply an image to each contact to show when a call is received. DirectShow was also natively added.

Released in September 1977, it popularized microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on swappable ROM cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge\u2014initially Combat and later Pac-Man.\n\nAtari was successful at creating arcade video games, but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped as codename Stella, by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976.\n\nThe Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KB cartridges. The system's first killer app was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980. The VCS became widely successful, leading to the founding of Activision and other third-party game developers and to competition from console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983\u201384, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the storage size of the launch games with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as Activision's Pitfall!.\n\nIn 1982, the Atari 2600 was the dominant game system. Amid competition from both new consoles and game developers, a number of poor decisions from Atari management affected the company and the industry as a whole. The most public was an extreme investment into licensed games for the 2600, including Pac-Man and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Pac-Man became the system's biggest selling game, but the conversion's poor quality eroded consumer confidence in the console. E.T. was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was critically panned and a commercial failure. Both games, and a glut of third-party shovelware, were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market. Atari's downfall reverberated through the industry resulting in the video game crash of 1983.\n\nWarner sold Atari's home division to former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel in 1984. In 1986, the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backward-compatible Atari 7800, but it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry with its 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Production of the Atari 2600 ended on January 1, 1992, with an estimated 30 million units sold across its lifetime.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/atari2600/version/initial-version-4d6e4123-07c6-4367-8d8a-f77760bebcc1"}, {"id": 673, "media": "Cartridge", "name": "Atari 2600+", "platform_logo": {"id": 832, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pln4.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 779, "date": 1701388800, "human": "Dec 2023", "m": 12, "region": 8, "y": 2023}], "summary": "The Atari 2600+ is an updated version of the iconic Atari 2600 and has been enhanced in the following ways:\n\n- Plays both Atari 2600 and 7800 game cartridges\n- HDMI output makes it easy to connect\n- Widescreen mode\n- Enlarged cartridge socket reduces sticking\n- Atari logo lights up when being played\n\nThe system comes with a CX40+ Joystick which has been lovingly recreated to the same specifications as the original, and a 10-in-1 game cartridge featuring some of Atari\u2019s most famous games: Adventure, Combat, Dodge 'Em, Haunted House, Maze Craze, Missile Command, RealSports Volleyball, Surround, Video Pinball, Yars' Revenge.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/atari2600/version/atari-2600-plus"}]}, "68": {"id": 68, "abbreviation": "colecovision", "alternative_name": "Coleco", "category": 1, "generation": 2, "name": "ColecoVision", "platform_logo": {"id": 311, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8n.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/colecovision", "versions": [{"id": 35, "cpu": "Zilog Z80A @ 3,58 MHz", "media": "Cartridge", "memory": "1 KB", "name": "Initial version", "platform_logo": {"id": 311, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl8n.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 93, "date": 397008000, "human": "Aug 1982", "m": 8, "region": 2, "y": 1982}], "sound": "Mono", "storage": "ROM Cartridge 8-32 KB", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/colecovision/version/initial-version-8b4019b7-7255-449e-9571-088151f6b335"}]}, "440": {"id": 440, "alternative_name": "VMU / VMS", "category": 5, "generation": 6, "name": "Visual Memory Unit / Visual Memory System", "platform_logo": {"id": 728, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plk8.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/visual-memory-unit-slash-visual-memory-system", "versions": [{"id": 590, "connectivity": "Multi-purpose connector for linking to Dreamcast controller and other VMUs", "cpu": "8-bit Sanyo LC8670", "memory": "28KB Flash Memory", "name": "Initial Version", "output": "1.46 in \u00d7 1.02 in LCD", "platform_logo": {"id": 728, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plk8.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 673, "date": 901756800, "human": "Jul 30, 1998", "m": 7, "region": 5, "y": 1998}, {"id": 674, "date": 936835200, "human": "Sep 09, 1999", "m": 9, "region": 2, "y": 1999}, {"id": 675, "date": 939859200, "human": "Oct 14, 1999", "m": 10, "region": 1, "y": 1999}, {"id": 676, "date": 943920000, "human": "Nov 30, 1999", "m": 11, "region": 3, "y": 1999}], "resolutions": "48x32 dots", "sound": "1-channel PWM sound source", "storage": "100KB Flash Memory", "summary": "The Visual Memory Unit is the primary memory card produced by Sega for the Dreamcast home video game console.

Nintendo aimed extensive research at a possible CD-ROM add-on for its Super NES console. They launched development projects with, ironically, Sony and Philips but were not impressed with the loading speed of the CD-ROM-based systems. Nintendo instead opted to explore the potential of combining the fastest data storage device available: the silicon-based game cartridge, with the fastest computer chip to be used in video games: the 64-bit processor.\n\nChairman of Nintendo of America, Howard Lincoln, teamed with Jim Clark, Chairman of Silicon Graphics, the company that had done the special effects for Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Jurassic Park. They sought to design a new game system capable of incredible graphics-rendering power. The new system was initially called, \"Project Reality.\" The term \"Project Reality\" was in reference to the \"real\" three-dimensional environments that they knew could be created with the new system. The new platform would run on the powerful 100 MHz MIPS RISC microprocessor. Foreseeing the finite future of the current television standard, Nintendo made sure that \"Project Reality\" would also be compatible with HDTV (high-definition television).\n\nOn July 18, 1994, Nintendo revealed that the new name for their system, the \"Ultra 64\" (later changed to Nintendo 64), would use 500MHz DRAM memory technology from Rambus, Inc. This fast access speed would provide the means for extremely fluid three-dimensional graphics.\n\nNintendo announced that it would release the Nintendo 64 system to American consumers on April 21, 1996. The price would be under $250. This date was soon pushed back five months in order to allow manufacturers enough time to produce enough systems to accommodate the projected consumer demand.\n\nWhen the Nintendo 64 system was finally launched on September 29, 1996, only two games were available to American consumers: Super Mario 64 and Pilot wings 64. In a move considered risky by Nintendo, no game cartridge was packaged with the Nintendo 64 system. Only the console, a single gray controller and an AC adapter were included in the original packaging. The Nintendo 64 debuted with a retail price of $199.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 system and the game Super Mario 64 opened to rave reviews from the critics. Next Generation magazine even called Super Mario 64, \"the greatest video game ever made.\"\n\nOn its first day of sale, the Nintendo 64 system sold 500,000 units in North America. It took the PlayStation three months to sell the same amount. By the end of March 1997, Nintendo had sold over 3.3 million units of its new system.\n\nBesides the obvious innovations in graphics, the Nintendo 64 featured a unique controller with fourteen buttons and an analog joystick at the center. The joystick provides complete 360\u00b0 control of on-screen action. On the bottom of the controller is a quick-action \"Z-trigger\" and a multi-directional control pad. Additional controllers (in designer colors) are available for $25 each.\n\nPlayers can attach an optional Controller Pak to the memory cart slot on the back of the Nintendo 64 controller. It stores a player's game statistics, preferred controller button configuration and built-up character strengths.\n\nNintendo introduced the Rumble Pak accessory in June 1997 along with the Star Fox 64 game cartridge. It attaches to the rear of the controller and vibrates according to various actions that occur on the screen (such as explosions or gunshots). The Rumble Pak is powered by two AAA batteries that can last up to 60 hours of play. Its retail price is $19.95.\n\nNintendo of America's President Minoru Arakawa announced a storage attachment for the system called the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive (64DD) in 1997. Also known as the \"bulky\" drive for its large or \"bulk\" storage capacity, the 64DD is designed to be a \"writable\" drive. Players would be able to customize existing games by introducing new characters or additional levels. This storage unit would sit beneath the Nintendo 64 console and plug into the \"EXT.\" expansion connector on the bottom of the system. The magnetic disk would be capable of holding 64 megabytes. It would be about the same size of a 3.5-inch floppy disk and twice as thick. When it is inserted into the 64DD, the disk would add four megabytes to the main memory, thereby upgrading the system's total to eight megabytes. Nintendo had originally announced that the first game to use this technology would be The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. While the 64DD was originally announced to be available in 1997, Nintendo cancelled its plans to debut the system upgrade in the United States.\n\nNintendo announced the release of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak on November 23, 1998. The Expansion Pak is a four-megabyte RAM cartridge that fits underneath a removable panel located on the top of the console. It will also increase the total RAM memory on the system to eight megabytes and allow select Nintendo 64 games to be played in a special high-resolution mode. The retail price for the Expansion Pak was $29.95. The first Expansion Pak compatible games to be announced were Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, NFL Quarterback Club 99 and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/n64/version/initial-version-4369dd46-1ced-49c7-85f2-7f5c28d72be5"}, {"id": 122, "media": "iQue Memory Card", "name": "iQue Player", "platform_logo": {"id": 260, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pl78.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 147, "date": 1069027200, "human": "Nov 17, 2003", "m": 11, "region": 8, "y": 2003}], "summary": "Miniaturized plug-n-play version of the N64 made for use in China", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/n64/version/ique-player"}]}, "475": {"id": 475, "category": 5, "generation": 5, "name": "R-Zone", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/platforms/r-zone", "versions": [{"id": 690, "name": "Initial version", "output": "Mirror projection of LCD screen present on game cartridges", "platform_logo": {"id": 850, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plnm.jpg"}, "platform_version_release_dates": [{"id": 849, "date": 820368000, "human": "1995", "m": 12, "region": 8, "y": 1995}], "sound": "Mono", "summary": "The R-Zone is a portable game console (originally head-worn, later handheld) developed and manufactured by Tiger Electronics.
