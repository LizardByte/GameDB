With its many iconic landmarks, cultural centers and Old Europe architecture, Paris draws more visitors than any other city in the world. Along with its population of over 12 million people, Paris requires a vast and efficient transportation network capable of serving one of Europe's largest urban environments.", "summary": "Cities in Motion: Paris is a new addition to the city-based mass transportation simulation game Cities in Motion. The Seine River cuts through Paris, offering opportunities for waterbus routes while presenting a challenge to those looking to cross its banks. Paris' many narrow streets and unique topography will put your urban-planning skills to test. Paris adds a large map with Parisian style architecture, a new campaign plus three scenarios, and four all-new vehicles for use in any Cities in Motion city."}
