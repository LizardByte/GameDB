First play covers all fought bosses minus defeated via time out (except for level 9 which doesn't have a normal time out method) and all bonus levels minus the one in Level 7. The second run features the rest of the bosses being beaten by time out and the ones I defeated already get shown no mercy this time around except for one of the bossathon bosses.\n\nSpeaking of which, successful completion of a bonus level will skip the boss. However, if you complete the bonus level in level 7, you will still skip the main boss but the bossathon will still happen. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ad20dvWE6A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ad20dvWE6A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ad20dvWE6A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [542] Gradius 3", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Kage Negra\n\nA 2 run play of Gradius 3.
