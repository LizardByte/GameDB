One massive one-man party later and you wake up to find you have gone through supplies quicker than intended, now you must brave a town full of killer robots and a deadly hangover. Should have maybe given the drinking a miss because this is a bad day for a hangover.", "summary": "You awaken with the worst of hangovers in a nuclear bunker with supplies running low, the only chance of survival is to scavenge for tinned goods in the robot infested nuclear wasteland above before the town is nuked again", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-bad-day-for-a-hangover"}
