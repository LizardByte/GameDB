Perhaps you, too, shall be Forged in the Barrens.", "summary": "Forged in the Barrens will launch worldwide with 135 new collectible cards!\n\nSet in the dusty savannah territory of the Barrens, a literal crossroads where tauren, troll, and orc adventurers gather to prove their worth. Mercenaries of old and newcomers alike train for an upcoming conflict with the Alliance. This set introduced the new keyword, Frenzy, which causes a minion to do something the first time it takes damage as long as it survived the attack. Additionally, it added seven Spell schools to the game; Arcane, Fel, Fire, Frost, Holy, Nature, and Shadow. This applies to new spells but also old ones, opening up many new synergies.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hearthstone-forged-in-the-barrens", "videos": [{"id": 45858, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "xco-KnAmdMU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xco-KnAmdMU", "title": "Forged in the Barrens Cinematic Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xco-KnAmdMU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
