Constant abuse of power, coupled with in-fighting between members, ultimately led to their downfall, leaving the continent in ruins. During this massive upheaval, nearly every member of the group perished, sparing only seven, including their leader, Faust.\n\nUsing his last remnants of power, Faust saw a glimpse of the future and in his vision, saw once again the near annihilation of Nevareth due to the misuse of power. Now, nearly a thousand years after the sundering, that same evil has renewed and the cycle of extinction has begun. It is up to you to face the wake of destruction that begins to envelop Nevareth, and bring about its salvation.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cabal-online", "videos": [{"id": 13609, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Y9f0E6teIAw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9f0E6teIAw", "title": "CABAL Online Episode XVI: Legends Unleashed", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9f0E6teIAw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
