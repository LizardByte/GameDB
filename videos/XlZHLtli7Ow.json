{"id": "XlZHLtli7Ow", "snippet": {"title": "MechWarrior 4: Vengeance (PC) longplay 1/2", "description": "Difficulty: Elite (max).\n\nMechwarrior 4 Vengeance was developed by FASA Interactive and released in November 2000 by Microsoft. MW4 Black Knight expansion with a new campaign was released in 2001 and stand-alone expansion MW4 Mercenaries in 2002. Two mech packs adding new mech types for multiplayer sessions were also released in between. In this longplay every mission was finished on Elite difficulty. Hardest mission for me was definitely the first mission of OP6. Playing the last mission of OP5 on easier difficulty rewards a Daishi as salvage. Not getting that edge increases handicap just enough to make the following mission a real challenge. This ofc makes the entire last OP harder, but remaining missions were not nearly as hard.\n\nI never played this original campaign before, only Mercenaries and it has been a long time since I last played MW4 at all. At the beginning I play like a noob giving commands individually to lancemates before remembering there's a key for ordering everyone at once. I'm also playing with mouse / keyboard, MW4 pros probably yell heresy. Early missions were played in 3rd person and cockpit view was selected for later missions. I did go through lots of different loadouts so every small adjustment is not shown in video, but I try to show final loadouts for the whole lance before launching each mission.\n\nThere are two alternative paths to reach two separate endings. It's possible to either save the sister or capture a supply depot before the last mission. Supply mission was played first in order to get Daishi. Getting Daishi as salvage does help finishing the last mission on elite. I then play the rescue sister mission on elite and switch to recruit difficulty before replaying the last mission. This was done to show how weak lancemate loadouts and rushing head-on with only close range weapons makes even the easiest difficulty mode challenging.\n\nMW4 Vengeance is an excellent game and with the expansions still the best Mech game IMO. Some might prefer arena shooter style gameplay of MW online, but I enjoy these tactical missions with different objectives and story. Missions are well designed and opponent AI aiming is brutal. Generally enemy mechs are a real challenge, but naturally there are some flaws to be exploited. Likewise, lancemates are sometimes very stupid. They might not follow orders and get stuck on buildings. Backtracking is sometimes necessary to revert lancemetes back into follow mode. MW5 might still be released one day, but it's better to remain stoic about it.\n\nBriefing / Loadout / Mission\n\nOP1 Mission 1 - 00:04:44 / 00:07:58 / 00:09:04 \nOP1 Mission 2 - 00:13:54 / 00:16:28 / 00:18:28 \nOP1 Mission 3 - 00:24:37 / 00:26:13 / 00:28:04\nOP1 Mission 4 - 00:33:58 / 00:37:25 / 00:37:40\n\nOP2 Mission 1 - 00:43:10 / 00:47:10 / 00:47:52\nOP2 Mission 2 - 00:55:33 / 00:58:58 / 01:00:52\nOP2 Mission 3 - 01:09:47 / 01:11:59 / 01:14:56\nOP2 Mission 4 - 01:30:10 / 01:32:49 / 01:33:36\n\nOP3 Mission 1 - 01:48:42 / 01:52:27 / 01:53:12\nOP3 Mission 2 - 02:03:32 / 02:04:19 / 02:05:34\nOP3 Mission 3 - 02:12:43 / 02:14:57 / 02:15:55\n\nOP4 Mission 1 - 02:20:17 / 02:22:09 / 02:23:43\nOP4 Mission 2 - 02:35:25 / 02:38:00 / 02:39:04\nOP4 Mission 3 - 02:51:52 / 02:54:33 / 02:56:21\nOP4 Mission 4 - 03:03:39 / 03:06:56 / 03:08:09\nOP4 Mission 5 - 03:17:26 / 03:19:53 / 03:21:07\nOP4 Mission 6 - 03:30:52 / 03:35:46 / 03:39:32", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XlZHLtli7Ow/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XlZHLtli7Ow/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XlZHLtli7Ow/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XlZHLtli7Ow/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "MechWarrior 4: Vengeance (PC) longplay 1/2", "description": "Difficulty: Elite (max).\n\nMechwarrior 4 Vengeance was developed by FASA Interactive and released in November 2000 by Microsoft.
