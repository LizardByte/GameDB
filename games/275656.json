Escape modern life to live alone in a mysterious land of forests, lakes, and caverns, inhabited only by strange animals.\n\nIn this place, miles away from any other human being, players are free to farm, hunt, build, craft, and scavenge while trying to survive. The game provides new experiences of wonder every time with a fresh new piece of land to explore.\n\nAbandoned buildings where uncanny experiments took place decades ago are scattered all around, and the player can discover what happened there by examining documents and other surviving evidence. A company called Genco used to have its headquarters in the area, what happened to them? there will be a new answer to the question every time a new game is started.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/emerald-woods"}
