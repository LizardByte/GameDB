It features recurring canon Touhou characters, 6 stages plus Extra and high quality voice acting.\n\nChaos of Black Loong reintroduces the partner mechanic. The game provides 4 playable teams with 2 characters each: Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame; Sakuya Izayoi and Hong Meiling; Koishi Komeiji and Satori Komeiji; Yukari Yakumo and Yuyuko Saigyouji\n\nThe player may freely switch between the two characters of the selected team by pressing C, along with their own shot type and Spell Card. By collecting items, grazing and defeating enemies, the Reward meter on the right side of the screen increases. Once it hits 1000, the player is awarded with a Life or a Spell piece. In addition, the game introduces a new type of item - Dragon spirits. Dragon spirits are a special item that disappear after a while onscreen. They increase the value of point items and lower the Point of Collection shown by the purple bar on the left side of the screen. The player can have at maximum 9 dragon spirits, and they can be released outside of a boss' Spell Card to cancel a radius of bullets around you. If you have at least 6, getting hit will consume 5 and give you an automatic deathbomb.\n\nAdditionally, the stage bosses in the game have secret Last Spells similar to Imperishable Night. When the halved sum of the current spells captured and dragon spirit count is higher or equal to the boss' total spell count, the boss' Last Spell will activate after the main battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-chaos-of-black-loong", "videos": [{"id": 133605, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Fz2zgNw7nC8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz2zgNw7nC8", "title": "Touhou \u6771\u65b9\u9f8d\u96b1\u8ac7 ~ Chaos of Black Loong - Lunatic 1cc (No-Miss)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fz2zgNw7nC8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
