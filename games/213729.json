Elementary Volume 6 soon became MECC\u2019s most popular product for the Apple II.\n\nThe 1980 version of Oregon was a much simpler game than the 1985 version, lacking many of the features that people now associate with the game. The 1980 version is very similar to the original text-only version that people played on teletype machines in the 1970s. The main feature that distinguishes the 1980 version from its text-only predecessors is that the shooting activities include simple graphics.
