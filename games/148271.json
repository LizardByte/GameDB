Within moments of their arrival, though, the Mihama gang are pulled into a manhunt for a SORD deserter, assisted by students Sylvia and Velvet of St. Aile's International School. Tohka's the star of the show this time around, but she's wrestling with her own issues? Old memories of her parents, and a promise to a friend that she wasn't able to keep...\n\n\u201cYou're right. There's a reason we need to get back... even if it means crawling home on our hands and knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's meet up again someday... if we're still alive.\u201d\n\nAnd introducing Sengoku Ayame - Sengoku Ichiru's brother, and a handler at St. Aile's:\n\n\u201cIf takin' her in alive's too much of a challenge, just get rid of her - I don't give a damn. I wanna see this mess cleaned up.\u201d\n\nWhat answers will Tohka find? She has the truth in her sight...\n\nGrisaia Phantom Trigger 04\nKumashiro Megumi (Gumi), recently transferred from St. Aile's International School, has been training hard together with Rena and Maki - now fully recovered from their injuries. With the help of her mentor, Tohka, she\u2019s shaping up to be a fine sniper.\n\nJust as one new student settles in, another has her sights set on joining the girls in Class A, Mihama\u2019s elite combat unit. Her name? Sengoku Taiga. Haruto, the team\u2019s handler, has one condition for Taiga\u2019s transfer: that Chris serves as her supervising officer.\nThe two seem an unlikely pair at first, but after spending some time with little Taiga, Chris soon finds a way to see things from her perspective.\n\nIt\u2019s at that moment that the nation is suddenly rocked by a terror attack on an unprecedented scale. Chris rushes to the scene, aware of what\u2019s at stake, but paying no heed to the dangers ahead.\n\nJust as she did, once before.\n\n\u201cThis is even worse than we could\u2019ve imagined...\u201d\n\u201cTwo of the guys are dead! What happened? What the hell happened!?\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know what it means to bring nukes into the country...?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary, shooting someone for the first time... My legs are shaking.\u201d\n\u201cThat fool... Is she trying to ruin everything!?\u201d\n\nThe death toll keeps on rising, but SORD are stuck watching helplessly from the sidelines. What destiny awaits Chris, Taiga... and Mihama Academy?\n\n\u201cOh, right... I must have died...\u201d\n\nClutching to memories of her long-dead mother, she too prepares for an eternity of slumber...", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grisaia-phantom-trigger-03-and-04", "videos": [{"id": 49532, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uu_uRClyVP8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu_uRClyVP8", "title": "PS Vita\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u300c\u30b0\u30ea\u30b6\u30a4\u30a2 \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30c8\u30ea\u30ac\u30fc \uff10\uff13\uff06\uff10\uff14\u300d\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uu_uRClyVP8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
