The great operations at Orel and the 4th Battle of Kharkov were accompanied by a strong assault on the German defensive positions at the Mius River, on the Black Sea. These heavily fortified positions had been held by the Germans since the previous winter and any advance would be into heavily prepared defenses.\n\nThis free game is designed to showcase the Panzer Campaigns system.
