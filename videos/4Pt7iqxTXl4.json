I think it was only ever a budget release, but it could easily have warranted \u00a310 because, although simple, it's very well made.\n\nYou must guide your bubble through 6 maze-like levels to rescue kidnapped baby bubbles. Before you can rescue a bubble, you must locate 6 pieces of a scroll in the correct order. When you have the scroll and found the bubble, you must return to the exit to complete the level.\n\nEach level is split across multiple teleporters, which adds to the puzzle element and can make things very challenging. Various enemies will attempt to get in your way, but you can kill them by blowing bubbles at them. You can also increase your bubble power by collecting mushrooms found within each level.\n\nThe game has some great graphics, design and some decent sound. I'm surprised Hewson sold this on budget and also gave it away for free, but who's complaining?\n\nI'm sure Cliff Richard might have something to say about the ending...\n\nEnjoy!\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Pt7iqxTXl4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Pt7iqxTXl4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Pt7iqxTXl4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Pt7iqxTXl4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Pt7iqxTXl4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mission Impossibubble Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed by Mat Sneap and published by Hewson in 1989.\n\nThis was another game given away on a Commodore Format Power Pack cover tape.
