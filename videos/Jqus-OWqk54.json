Instead of hitting and missing based on luck, you use timing to strike down the enemy! Your spells can change the battlefield in your favor, but beware... the enemies have plenty of tricks up their sleeves, too.\n\n-------\nThe beginning of our tale:\n\nWhen the new king sent princess Sahana to the far-flung hinterlands of the kingdom to marry a provincial governor, she didn't expect a warm welcome. And that's great, because she didn't get one!\n\nHer reluctant groom, Kadi, treats her well but mostly avoids her. He spends his days doing \"research\" in the woods. Vexingly, that research seems to involve a beautiful mercenary named Celestora\u2014who says she wants Kadi dead, but spends all her time with him anyway. Hana's \"exile\" isn't the worst, but she has had just about enough of this little situation...\n\nJoin this band of misfits as they journey into the wilds, both to quell monsters that trouble the province and for Kadi's... \"research.\"\n-------\n\nAll gameplay in this trailer is in an early state, with much polish and balancing to come. Your support is appreciated in making this game a reality!\n-------\n\nGame credits\nRay - programming\nLiz - illustrations\nIan - logo calligraphy\nMarcus - game design; writing; sprites, effects, and animations; music composition and production", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jqus-OWqk54/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jqus-OWqk54/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jqus-OWqk54/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jqus-OWqk54/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jqus-OWqk54/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Radix Chronicle \u2014 Kickstarter Trailer", "description": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/enb/radix-chronicle\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2430540/Radix_Chronicle/\n\nRadix Chronicle is a fast-paced tactical RPG inspired by classic from the SNES and early Playstation eras.
