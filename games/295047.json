To be blunt, that's a very extreme example.\n\nAlthough it is a popular genre most loved by Japan, it has evolved (?) to extend the play time. I can't do it anymore! This work, \"The Day the Demon King Falls,\" is the antithesis of an RPG that has come to the level of RPG, or rather, it is a counter-evolutionary form that has come to the answer.\n\nThe time to play one time until the ending is about 1~2 hours, even for those who are frequent adventurers. A person who doesn't venture at all and is a recluse... Well, the shortest is about 5 minutes (laughs).\n\nThere is also the peculiarity of this game that the final boss goes out of his way to defeat the main character, so the time to play one time is extremely short, but instead you can easily play it as many times as you want. It is a game that can be played for a long time, saying that there is a new discovery every time you play.\n\nBy all means, I would like you to clear this about 40 ~ 50 times (laughs).\n\nRPGs have evolved in a way that is quite biased (?) in response to general needs such as \"volume\" and \"can be played for a long time\". How about a game like this?\n\nSome of the characters are also irresistibly attractive! (laughs)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maou-ga-ochiru-hi"}
