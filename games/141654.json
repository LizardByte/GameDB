The streamer has to jump over obstacles and platforms - the twist is that all those obstacles and platforms are placed by the chat. They do this through chat commands, and in addition to that there's also a variety of 'surprises' that chat can trigger by working together on a specific surprise chat command.\n\nThe goal of the game for the streamer is to achieve the highest score, while for the chat it's to be the person that stops the streamer's run.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/running-vs-chat"}
