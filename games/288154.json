Players jump their way through 2D platforming levels, complete with bottomless pits and floating platforms, while collecting burgers. Instead of running through like in a traditional platformer, though, they skate their way through. Players can perform various tricks while flying through the air, racking up points by doing tricks and combos. Players compete for high scores on each level, balancing collecting burgers and performing complex series of tricks to maximize their score.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sukebooo-man"}
