When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards.

If Mr. Do. knocks out all of the key blocks, a large door opens at the top of the screen to reveal a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into 'Alphamonsters'. The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do. and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor block onto them from above. When Mr. Do. kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded.
