{"id": "rzZsQQIRJIA", "snippet": {"title": "Behind the Scenes - Mortal Kombat 3 [Rare Footage]", "description": "Footage of Mortal Kombat 3 development. Behind the scenes footage with que original actors.\n\nWikipedia: Mortal Kombat 3 was originally considered to be made using 3D graphics, before reverting to sprite graphics of the previous games. Its overall style was envisioned differently from in the previous Mortal Kombat games. Instead of the heavily-Oriental themes of Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II, the theme of MK3 is more Western-contemporary. The game's stages are set in modern locations (such as urban highways, churches, and bank rooftops), three of the characters are cyborgs, and traditional character designs (such as Sub-Zero's or Kano's) have been dropped or modified in favor of modern replacements. This change is also reflected in the soundtrack, in which all Oriental motifs have been dropped in favor of modern instrumentation.\n\nSome of the characters from previous Mortal Kombat games who returned in Mortal Kombat 3 were portrayed by new actors since their original portrayers left Midway due to royalty disputes over the use of their likenesses in console versions. Ho Sung Pak (Liu Kang in the first two games, as well as Shang Tsung in the first Mortal Kombat), Phillip Ahn (Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat II), Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Katalin Zamiar (Kitana/Mileena/Jade) and Daniel Pesina (Johnny Cage and Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile/Smoke/Noob Saibot) were not involved in the production of MK3. \n\nPrior to the release of Mortal Kombat 3, Daniel appeared in an advertisement for another fighting game, BloodStorm, which resulted in a false rumor that it got him fired by Midway. All this led to the use of new actors for Liu Kang (Eddie Wong), Sonya Blade (Kerri Hoskins), Shang Tsung and Sub-Zero (both played by John Turk) in MK3. Richard Divizio (Kano) also took over the role of Noob Saibot (as the character was a recolored Kano in this version). Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in the first two games, did not appear in MK3 as a penalty for his involvement in the rival game Tattoo Assassins, but was still employed by Midway and his character would return in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, although through the use of recycled sprites from MKII and new sprites performed by Sal Divita.\n\nThe game has a different tone overall than its predecessors and uses a noticeably more muted and less-vibrant color palette. Characters were heavily digitized, as opposed to the hybrid digitized/hand-drawn style of MKII. Many of the game's backgrounds were, for the first time, created using pre-rendered 3D graphics.\n\nHit the Streets (Version 1) de Kevin MacLeod \u00e9 licenciada de acordo com a licen\u00e7a Atribui\u00e7\u00e3o 4.0 da Creative Commons. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nFonte: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100881\n\nArtista: http://incompetech.com/\n\n\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\n\nHit the Streets (Version 2) de Kevin MacLeod \u00e9 licenciada de acordo com a licen\u00e7a Atribui\u00e7\u00e3o 4.0 da Creative Commons. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nFonte: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100882\n\nArtista: http://incompetech.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rzZsQQIRJIA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rzZsQQIRJIA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rzZsQQIRJIA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rzZsQQIRJIA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rzZsQQIRJIA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Behind the Scenes - Mortal Kombat 3 [Rare Footage]", "description": "Footage of Mortal Kombat 3 development.
