{"id": "oMEn6LzPA-U", "snippet": {"title": "Magic Knight Rayearth 2: Making of Magic Knight - Game Gear (Japanese)", "description": "Original Air Date: December 26th, 2009\n\nMagic Knight Rayearth 2: Making of Magic Knight [\u9b54\u6cd5\u9a0e\u58eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30b92], or Mahou Kishi Rayearth 2, is the second Rayearth game for the Game Gear. Despite the \"2\" in the title, it isn't a sequel to the first. Actually, it isn't even an RPG. MKR2 is a breeding/simulation game. In it, you \"train\" Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu to become magic knights.  On the surface, the game seems pretty pointless, but after playing the game through, they tried to incorporate a few neat events in the game.\n\nFor a small handheld sim game, it's actually pretty neat. The game has colorful graphics and the music is very nice...and it REALLY sounds like Royal Stone's music. You can choose eight different activities from weapon training, magic training and even going on an adventure...during the adventure mode, you can encounter enemies and you fight with sword and magic. You can't control the battles, but it isn't too important. You can find items too...both by finding them during adventures, or by doing special events. For instance, you can get a dress that boost a stat by 10 by choosing to dance with Caldina. Also, by going on adventures, you can go to different areas to train...and different events can occur at different training grounds.\n\nThis game deals more with the second season of the Rayearth anime, unlike the first Rayearth GG game, which dealt with the first season. This Game sample shows several activities in the game.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oMEn6LzPA-U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oMEn6LzPA-U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oMEn6LzPA-U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Magic Knight Rayearth 2: Making of Magic Knight - Game Gear (Japanese)", "description": "Original Air Date: December 26th, 2009\n\nMagic Knight Rayearth 2: Making of Magic Knight [\u9b54\u6cd5\u9a0e\u58eb\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30b92], or Mahou Kishi Rayearth 2, is the second Rayearth game for the Game Gear.
