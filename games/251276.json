A mysterious wind appeared out of nowhere and if someone listens to it, they start to change: some get holes and pimples all over their body, some become grotesque abominations. Henrietta became deaf after a car accident 9 years ago, so she isn't affected by the wind... but she can't stay home forever. What's going on out there? What is that wind? Is Henrietta's mother okay?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oddrietta"}
