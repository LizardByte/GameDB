Real-Time Deforming Terrain: The terrain literally gets torn up with each passing vehicle, causing each lap to be different. Advanced particle effects cause debris and muck to \"stick\" to each vehicle. Vehicular Combat and Damage: Destroy anything that gets in your way. Smash your opponents and view spectacular Hollywood-style crash sequences. Take the Race Online: Intense head-to-head off-road racing. Challenge the competition over voice chat. AI opponents simulate human traits, like showing off, attacking, taunting, and doing whatever it takes to win.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/motorstorm", "videos": [{"id": 6317, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_g22iiQurkY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g22iiQurkY", "title": "MotorStorm PlayStation 3 Trailer - Offical E3 2005 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_g22iiQurkY/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 6318, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "J-W1RuR-a4A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-W1RuR-a4A", "title": "Motorstorm Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J-W1RuR-a4A/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
