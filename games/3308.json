It was created specifically as an attempt to entice more girls to play video games, and was one of the very few Nintendo Entertainment System games with girl-oriented themes. It was not a particularly well-received game at the time, but has received some recognition for having some quality puzzles and gameplay style. Others have criticized it for being an example of \"pink\" software; which refers to software that was designed for male audiences that is re-skinned for female gamers, without taking into account true female gamer preferences.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-c0a904af-2b18-4847-9241-37287d151255", "videos": [{"id": 3931, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "6hDsVzIbBN4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hDsVzIbBN4", "title": "Barbie - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6hDsVzIbBN4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
