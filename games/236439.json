A paramilitary force composed of die-hard loyalists and brainwashed warriors, the KOPs carry out KAPITAL\u2019s bidding while keeping the street gangs and ethno-nationalist warbands tightly under their thumb. They call this violence THE LAW.\n\nIn KOP KILLER 22XX you are the KOP KILLER, a humble miner turned CYBORG KILLING MACHINE from the toxic pit-town called Acuaverde. A feud among KAPITAL houses renders the digital scrip you\u2019re paid in utterly worthless. To afford the anti-rad meds needed to survive Acuaverde, you and your fellow workers turn to a life of CRIME!\n\nArrested and sold to the highest bidder, you\u2019re sent to Homan Correction, a hellish prison known for human experimentation. The overseers select YOU for the WARRIOR program, where they intend to hack away at your mind and body to transform you into an obedient KAPITAL OPERATIVE. A mysterious accident interrupts the process before they take control of your mind, unleashing you on the Prison to dole out your own brand of JUSTICE.", "summary": "In the grim 23rd-century future of Kop Killer 22XX, vile oligarchs lord over the Americas from Kapital, a floating fortress-city.
