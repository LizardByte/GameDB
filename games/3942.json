It has a unique feel and gameplay with elements not present in any other game of the franchise, including a camera of a 3D environment that is not player-controlled and a system in which previous levels can be played again at will. Due to higher-quality graphics in comparison to previous Harry Potter video games, characters more closely resemble their movie counterparts. It was also the first Harry Potter game to feature a multiplayer mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire", "videos": [{"id": 17474, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mhvMEYukEBI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhvMEYukEBI", "title": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire PC Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mhvMEYukEBI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 17475, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "j1lqxO-ri0o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1lqxO-ri0o", "title": "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire (PC) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j1lqxO-ri0o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
