In addition, it does not have a Magic Point-based system for spell-casting. Instead, magic is collected, drawn, and created from items, and is used to power up the characters via the junction system.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 321, "name": "Commercial", "video_id": "u49xPK3QOl8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u49xPK3QOl8", "title": "Final Fantasy VIII / 8 official trailer 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u49xPK3QOl8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
