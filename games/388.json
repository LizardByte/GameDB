It is a Japanese-style role-playing game released in episodic format. The game uses mechanics, assets and graphics from various releases of FINAL FANTASY IV (Wii version features enhanced graphics).\n\nThe characters travel across the world map (although the whole map only becomes accessible in the final Tale The Crystals) fighting random enemies, enter towns to rest, buy equipment and talk to other characters, go to various dungeons for items and boss fights.\n\nThe battles use the same Active Time Battle (ATB) system from FINAL FANTASY IV, but it is improved in several ways. The class system from FINAL FANTASY IV largely remains the same but it has been tweaked and many new abilities have been added to the characters.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-iv-the-after-years"}
