It features a new land mass to explore, PvP arenas, a level increase from 50 to 60, a new climb ability and the standard new items and monsters. The major quest line for the expansion is commonly known as \"The Peacock Line\" - This series of 17 or so quests culminates with a raid requiring the player to group up with his guildmates to slay an entity known as \"The Godking\".\n\nPlayers can choose from a selection of rewards to be used in the weapon slot depending on their class, for example a mage would receive an item named \"Wand of Second life\" which can also be changed at will into a two-handed weapon - \"Staff of Second life\". This quest takes place throughout the Desert of Ro from the sinking sands to the living tombs and eventually the Silent City.\n\nNew zones include the Sinking Sands, Pillars of Flame, Clefts of Rujark and the dervish city of Maj'Dul. Also many instances such as Poets Palace and Shimmering Citadel are available with Desert of Flames.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/everquest-ii-desert-of-flames", "videos": [{"id": 7454, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MShhtj06VZc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShhtj06VZc", "title": "EverQuest II Desert of Flames Expansion [OFFICIAL TRAILER]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MShhtj06VZc/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 683, "name": "EverQuest"}]}
