Wander through ever-changing environments, face fears and phobias head-on, and feel like someone is always watching you. Even when you think no one\u2019s there, chances are, someone is still staring at your back.\n\nYour goal is to direct the events and assemble all the pieces into a logical story, giving insight into the character's state of mind. To achieve this, you\u2019ll need to explore the world and piece together narrative and interactive elements in your mind. Everything that happens has a logical connection to reality but appears surreal. This is exactly what can be found in the pages of psychiatry textbooks\u2014what might happen to a person suffering from such conditions. Just remember: what you see isn\u2019t real, but it is real for the one who sees it, as their mind is inflamed and deteriorating.", "summary": "This psychological adventure, focused on narrative, is based on a scientific representation of mental disorders.
