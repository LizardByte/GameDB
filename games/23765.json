There are two modes in the game; Empire Mode and Sandbox Mode. Empire Mode sends the player to one of eight casinos starting with a small one and working up to the biggest casino. In each casino the player will have specific objectives to meet in a limited time in order turn the casino into a successful place. Not meeting the objectives in time will end the game. Sandbox mode allows the player to build whatever casino desired without any objectives to follow or limited time. In this mode, the player is limited to one kind of casino, but can unlock more upon winning them from the Empire Mode.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hoyle-casino-empire", "videos": [{"id": 39078, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gG6PNfM5BWE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG6PNfM5BWE", "title": "Hoyle Casino Empire gameplay (PC Game, 2002)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gG6PNfM5BWE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
