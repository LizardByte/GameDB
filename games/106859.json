To win a duel, players match mystical spells to damage their opponent, block against their moves, or quickly replenish their own health. Leaving a trail of fallen wizards in their wake, players will journey through magical realms while unlocking and upgrading new spells. Several playable characters can be discovered and levelled up along the way, from Tierra The Huntress to Lua The Voodoo Priest, each harnessing their own unique spells that enable fresh competitive tactics.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-spell-heroes", "videos": [{"id": 21618, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7s67adrhejY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s67adrhejY", "title": "Super Spell Heroes - launching globally on 20th August (iOS/Android) - Intro Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7s67adrhejY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
