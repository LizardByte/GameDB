This is Twilight Frontier's first danmaku game, and stars Nitori Kawashiro as the protagonist.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game involves collecting items that are dropped from enemies, or found in crates. When collected, the items will snap to Nitori at the point of contact, becoming a part of the character. Different items have their own unique offensive or defensive abilities, resulting in a wide array of firing patterns depending on which items are attached, and where they are attached. Items also have various degrees of weight, so if Nitori has many heavy items attached to her, then her movement speed will be greatly impacted.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 68734, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "j5Qybn_SLvA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Qybn_SLvA", "title": "\u53ce\u96c6\u8377\u53d6\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7d39\u4ecb\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5Qybn_SLvA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
