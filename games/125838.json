The game supports multiple player names so a group of players can compete for top score on the high score table.\n\nThe Classic puzzles can be printed, e-mailed, or changed to use letters rather than numbers. There is also an option which allows the player to manually enter puzzles and either play them or have the program solve them automatically.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/25000-sudoku-puzzles"}
