From the second you enter the mansion, every moment is filled with horror. Three mysterious women are your only guides as you try to escape the haunted house.", "summary": "The 11th Hour, the much-anticipated sequel to record-selling adventure horror The 7th Guest, follows the path of mystery, desolation, horror and grotesque logic set by its predecessor. It is one of the finest examples of blending cinematic sequences with a 3D environment. The 11th Hour, in a fashion similar to The 7th Guest, features 22 wonderfully pre-rendered 3D rooms that took almost three years to craft. This challenging interactive story offers a wide array of games, puzzles and quests wrought by the twisted mind of the legendary Henry Stauf. Will you unearth Old Man Stauf's fate at last, or seal your own forever?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-11th-hour", "videos": [{"id": 9094, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "gq0huYRL_hg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq0huYRL_hg", "title": "The 11th Hour trailer - Adventure Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gq0huYRL_hg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
