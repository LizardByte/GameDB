At the request of the Pope himself, Bon, accompanied by a group of his peculiar friends, sets off on a thrilling mission, leaving behind a trail of cigarette butts, empty whiskey bottles, and broken demonic hearts.", "summary": "The Unholy Society is the first part of BonBon's crazy adventures. Inspired by '80s and '90s movies, comic books, as well as everything else that fits into the categories of \"iconic\"and \"pop culture\", it takes a humorous look at usually not-so-humorous themes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-unholy-society"}
