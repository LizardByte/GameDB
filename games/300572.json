The solo/co-op campaign, \u201cBlood Tides of Lh\u2019owon,\u201d is a 20-level scenario sporting new textures, weapons, and enemies. More than that, the scenario sheds a surprising new light on the story\u2019s characters and the meaning of events. Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakened the ancient remnants of the S\u2019pht, the player now faces a world where friends become enemies and all is not what it seems\u2026\n\nThis classic 1996 Bungie FPS is now maintained by the fan community.
