The game sees players recruiting different characters from other Tales games and using their skills to battle monsters across numerous boards.\nThe heroes find themselves in a world unknown to them, and there, they meet a strange fairy named Rukku, who guides them around this strange world. The heroes work together in order to stop the relentless Black Army that has been threatening the world. For their plans to work, the heroes search and recruit more people, Tales series characters, for their cause. The question of whether or not these heroes will be able to return to their original worlds lingers over them while they search for a motive behind the Black Army's actions. In this new world where everything has been set, a new adventure unfolds as the all-girl Cardinals Scenes fight against the Black Army to protect that which they hold dear.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tales-of-mobile-tales-of-tactics"}
