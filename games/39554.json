Known for its similarities with early Samurai Shodown games (including random item drops and combining attack buttons for heavier attacks), it is the only game in the entire series to get a release outside of Japan.\n\nThe main series is composed of three separate games within the land of 'Jipang' (a fictionalized version of feudal Japan), each follows a descendant of the 'Fire Clan' and supporting cast in battles against a range of often comical villains. The stories of the games, though primarily of 'fantasy' fare, also attempt to provide commentary on common misconceptions about Japanese culture by western societies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/far-east-of-eden-kabuki-klash"}
