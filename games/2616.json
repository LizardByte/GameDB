However, there are common themes which occur with fairly level frequency. The game is meant to simulate the colonization of the new world-what is now North America. The player can choose from five different nations, including the natives, and battle the other nations for supremacy of the continent. Much like history-the player will settle the continent and gradually grow into a town and expand into other towns. These towns are able to create troops, which can be used to attack other nations. The player will also inevitably declare independence from the mother nation, due to increasing taxes administered by the mother nation-much like the American experience.", "summary": "Conquest of the new world is a turn-based strategy game that lets you control one of 6 different nations in their attempt to colonize the new continent. The gameworld is represented in an isometric point of view. Combat is a mini-game taking place on a battlefield where victory can be achieved by killing enemy troops or capturing the enemy's flag. This deluxe edition added new elements of diplomacy, including trade options, as well as specific bonuses based on which nation is played.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/conquest-of-the-new-world-deluxe-edition", "videos": [{"id": 3471, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "oHCG3xQIQ2A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHCG3xQIQ2A", "title": "Conquest of the New World - Intro Movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oHCG3xQIQ2A/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
