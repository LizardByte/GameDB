To complete a puzzle, just link all of the same-colored dots by placing them one near another. There's a catch, though... Once you have connected two dots, the others of the same color become locked in their place. \n \nIt's so simple to understand, yet it opens up a whole world of possibilities! Why \"only\" 120 puzzles, then? Because they were carefully selected from hundreds of others, in order to offer you only the best of the best. \n \nEach puzzle has more than one solution (and some have thousands). Will you find the one that requires the least number of moves? That\u2019s the real challenge! Should you complete it, you will be treated to a select number of puzzles that are bordering on impossibility. But the satisfaction of solving one of those can't be described in words\u2026", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dwelp"}
