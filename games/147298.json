Our protagonist has just arrived in the Big City by bus with the intention of getting employed in the Stain Financial company. On his way to the company's office building, he finds a shiny quarter. He gets past the security check and enters the building, where a friendly female secretary greets and urges him to wait for his interview on the couch. There he meets a man dressed as a cowboy and after a brief dialogue, the secretary instructs the protagonist to follow her to M. Stain's room. At the end of the long hallway, she opens the door to his room and leaves the protagonist alone. M. Stain, a millionaire playboy tycoon, politely greets the hero and offers him a seat on one of the two chairs in front of his table. The choice is pointless, as M. Stain's reaction is virtually the same, regardless of which chair we chose. He then asks the protagonist if he's comfortable and whether he replies positively or negatively, M. Stain's answer will be reassuring and understandable. Next, he asks if the protagonist knows what M stands for in his name. According to himself, it actually stands for nothing. After that, M. Stain proceeds to show us his three most prized possessions: a carved ivory fox, an antique newspaper and a well-worn saw, for us to select an item that describes our personality the best. Although his reactions are different with the pick of each item, in the end he still offers us to sign a contract in a very limited amount of time, in order for the protagonist to be unaware of it's questionable contents. If you fail to sign it on time or refuse, M. Stain will get furious and suggest that you \"need some time to think it over\", then presses a button on his table which opens a trap door under the protagonist's chair, sending him into an underground cell. In a cell on the opposite side is the already familiar to us man in the cowboy clothes, who apparently was also imprisoned by M. Stain. In our cell is some kind of a lever with the words \"save yourself\" written in blood above it. When the lever is pushed, the cowboy man shouts in distress and pleads with the hero to switch it off, as the lever has activated the spiked wall which is now coming towards the cowboy man. He's eventually crushed by the wall and we see his angry spirit leaving his body, floating towards the protagonist. Nonetheless, an elevator descends from the hole we have just fallen through and saves him from the spirit. When the hero reaches M. Stain's office, he's already gone and the hallway that we previously came through is completely different from what it used to be, with the red walls, ceiling fans humming ominously and massive fleshy growths ornating the doorway. After going down the hallway to the very end, the hero realizes that he just came back into the same office, however this time one of M. Stain prized items is lying on the floor, which one depends on the protagonist's choice. Upon interacting with it, the whole room suddenly turns black and we are inexplicably teleported to the entirely different location, near the gates of M. Stain's estate. M. Stain himself is standing next to his limousine, inviting the hero to enter the car. Note, that even if we were to sign the contract, this part will be the same, only without the protagonist being dropped into the dungeon and forced to kill the cowboy man to escape.\n\nAfter a short ride, the limousine stops near \"The Final Sacrifice\" bar. Since an invisible force is blocking our way out, the hero is forced to enter the club. The club is filled with indistinguishable people drinking and chatting. On the counter lies someone's forgotten dollar. The protagonist grabs the dollar and comes towards the weird jittery bartender. He offers you a complimentary drink from the bar for free. If you choose to taste it and then ask if the bartender wants a tip, he will refuse and instead ask you to play his favorite song \"Ol' Ramblin' Rattler\". You insert the previously found quarter into the jukebox and the song starts playing. All of a sudden, the bartender says that he wants to be completely bold with you, his head pops off like a hollow mask and a snake shows up in its place, saying that you should \"kill him the first chance you get\", possibly referring to M. Stain, and vanishes. Perturbed by this occurrence, the hero goes into the bathroom, only to find an inexplicably appearing eviscerated goat on the toilet in the second stall and words \"save yourself\" written in blood, just like in M. Stain's dungeon. For whatever reason he grabs the dead goat and finds a key to the room 3A in the toilet. With nothing important left to do in the bar area, he walks the stairs down into the arcade, filled with many locked doors, club music and suggestive moans. Entrance to the VIP area is guarded by the masked bouncer telling the hero that he should get the membership card to get there. Using his key, the protagonist enters the room 3A, where he finds a television set embedded into the wall that requires one dollar. After inserting the dollar and watching one of the three minute-long bizarre erotic films, he hears someone knocking on the wall from the nearby room. A skeletal arm holding a knife slowly sticks out of the wall. The hero arms himself with the mentioned knife and then hears a wall phone near his door ringing. He answers the call and hears only static for about half a minute, but in the end a disembodied voice informs him of someone standing behind him. Indeed, one of the doors behind us is open, with a raven sitting next to the bed with the membership card lying on it. The hero approaches the raven, with the latter suddenly flying right into his face and vanishing like an illusion. Regardless, the protagonist acquires the card and shows it to the masked guard, then enters the VIP area.\n\nIn front of him extends a vast room with ornaments on the walls, stained glass windows, two rows of benches and a pedestal in the far end, behind which is standing M. Stain himself, greeting the protagonist. After he comes closer to the pedestal and an altar beneath it, he notices a group of silent robed children with greenish skin and black holes for eyes. To the right of M. Stain is standing a robed figure with it's face obscured by the hood. M. Stain wishes to initiate the protagonist into his cult, but in order for that to happen he has to make a sacrifice. Having only a dead goat found in the bathroom stall earlier, he places it on the altar. M. Stain is displeased, noting that something greater is required. A robed figure to the right of him volunteers to become the sacrifice, drops the rob and turns out to be a completely naked female secretary from the beginning. M. Stain agrees and she happily lays onto the altar. Here, the hero has to choose whether to stab the woman or M. Stain himself in the back. Here, the hero has to choose whether to stab the woman on the altar or M. Stain himself in the back. Either way, if we stab the girl, the idol that they were making a sacrifice to will deem her spirit to be unclean and strike M. Stain through his back. If M. Stain was killed by the protagonist instead, the idol will incinerate the girl on the altar. Upon perishing through one of these ways, M. Stain's body will start glowing, then will be turn to shreds and the remains of it transform into the flying demonic beast with upper part of M. Stain's head and some of his internal organs. The hero is then forced into the center of the room and encircled by the mysteriously repositioned benches. After stabbing M. Stain several times, he falls to the ground and explodes, with the idol in the background collapsing as well, making the entire building burst into flames. The hero barely manages to escape the building before it goes down in flames. When outside, he hears the taxi signalling him from the nearby road and jumps into it without thinking. Depending on the protagonist's actions, the car's driver is either the female secretary's spirit, if he chose to stab her when she was lying on the altar, the cowboy's spirit, if he refused the contract and was forced to kill him in the dungeon, or a regular taxi driver, in case he harmed no one except M. Stain.", "summary": "Always wanted that great job in the big city? Looking for the opportunity of a lifetime? Right this way. M.
