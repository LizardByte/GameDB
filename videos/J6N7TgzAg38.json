The game was taken offline on the 6th of August 2018 and hasn't been accessible ever since. Until now!\n\nThis remake is built from the ground up with the goal of having this game playable until the end of time. As long as there is a download available somewhere, you will be able to play it!\n\nFEATURES\n\nPlay cards with your favourite characters and monsters from all over the Runescape universe.\nDive into single-player, multiplayer, and my personal favourite, asynchronous multiplayer!\n\nOr mix it up and change the game rules to how you want to play.  Want to try out new card combinations that were never available in the original game? Or change how the starting player is determined? It's all up to you.\n\nCurrently, 326 out of the original 419 cards are included, with more on the way with every update.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nWe're currently very close to bringing the game on par with the original. Only 3 key features are missing: the remaining 93 cards, an in-game deck editor and the dungeoneering game mode (draft).\n\nAlong with a nice tutorial, these have the highest priority. But we're not stopping there! The foundations have already been laid out for custom card modding, single-player campaigns (like the original \"Trials of Radimus\") and many more!\n\nIf you like this project and want to follow its journey through development, please consider following us on the social media platforms.\n\nThank you for showing interest in this project, and I'll see you around!\n\n#runescape #cardgame #devlog #gamedev #indiegame #unity", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6N7TgzAg38/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6N7TgzAg38/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6N7TgzAg38/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6N7TgzAg38/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6N7TgzAg38/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Runescape cardgame is BACK!", "description": "Download the game:\nhttps://www.chroniclerewritten.com\nhttps://kapistijn.itch.io/chronicle-rewritten\n\nJoin our community on Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/Z3an8y3NSu\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/questnpc\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 Trailer\n0:35 Intro\n1:08 What makes Chronicle different?\n2:48 The visual aesthetic\n3:29 Recreating the visuals\n4:20 Recreating the cards\n5:05 Half-Life inspiration\n5:38 Tweaking game settings\n6:00 Boardgame inspiration\n6:29 Server troubles\n6:55 Asynchronous multiplayer\n7:48 Legality\n8:12 Backup plan\n9:09 Future plans\n9:27 Thanks for watching!\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nChronicle: Rewritten is a recreation of Jagex's original collectable card game, Chronicle: Runescape Legends.
