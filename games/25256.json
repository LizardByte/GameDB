Why is the house burning? Where is that music coming from? \n \nThis game was created by Connor Sherlock and Cameron Kunzelman as a spooky Halloween teaser for their remastered Marginalia. The character of Eileen Kestler appears in both, and the developers thought that it would be interesting to delve into the mythology of that game. They hope you enjoy it!"}
