The story is set in Tokyo 20XX after the third World War. The A.G.E. Corporation is developing a new form of energy and has constructed a city called Neo Tokyo. It has multiple endings tied to which of the characters the protagonist allies himself with. Many of the familiar elements of the series return, such as demonic negotiation and demonic fusion, though some mechanics common to the Majin Tensei series in particular have been simplified.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/majin-tensei-blind-thinker"}
