{"id": "NmFuH1lZKwQ", "snippet": {"title": "Zzap! Launch Trailer", "description": "Zzap! Is the first video game I've ever created and completed. It's a frenetic twin-stick shooter with an addictive, high-score chasing gameplay loop. It's short and simple and hopefully a lot of fun. This trailer shows a brief snippet of gameplay.\n\n\nI designed Zzap! to have the simplicity of Atari 2600 / 8-bit computer games, and the aesthetic of a mid-80's arcade machine. Its over-the-top action is inspired by Robotron 2084, Smash TV, Super Stardust and We Are Doomed, and the colourful chaos of Llamasoft. It's easy to pick up, easier to get overwhelmed, and you're only ever a few minutes away from your next high-score.\n\n\n\nThe best part is, Zzap! is out now on PC and can be purchased from itch.io!\n\n\n\nIt took around 8 days of solid programming to create Zzap! from scratch, plus a couple more weeks of tweaking and polishing. Although the game is complete, support is ongoing and as my programming skills increase, features may be added. My next priority is implementing High-Score leaderboards. As well as standing on its own merits, this game will serve as a springboard for future game concepts. \n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this brief snippet, and if this is your kind of thing, I'd really appreciate it if you try out the game at https://neonretrotech.itch.io/zzap", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmFuH1lZKwQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmFuH1lZKwQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmFuH1lZKwQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NmFuH1lZKwQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Zzap!
