Instead of running Rogue Spear using RogueSpear.exe, you can use the latest Black Ops engine to run the game so it works on modern-day systems. All seven Rainbow Six parts merged into one game: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (1998), Rainbow Six: Eagle Watch Expansion pack (1999), Rogue Spear (1999), Rogue Spear: Urban Operations (2000), Rainbow Six: Covert Ops Essentials (2000), Rogue Spear: Black Thorn (2001), Rainbow Six: TakeDown - Missions in Korea. Play Rogue Spear and other Rainbow Six parts with the latest 2.61 engine. It contains: all levels unlocked (Custom mission: Terrorist Hunt/Hostage Rescue/etc), unlocked/modded access to all Lone Wolf Missions, modded/fixed Rainbow Six / Eagle Watch levels - very few glitches remain, Vista/7 audio fix, X64 Registry, Win7 Registry fix, remapped a load of the game files to be able to work with Black Thorn, modded campaign - play 57 missions from Rainbow Six to Black Thorn, 53 Weapons in total to choose from, special unlocked terrorist weapons - Uzi, Dragunov, AK47, AK74, Skorpion; secondary weapons have been modded so the player can choose 2 primary weapons, default 6 grenades instead of 3, has its own registry paths - this version will not affect your current Rainbow Six installation, modded MP weapons so you can select all weapons as secondary. It's a small game, easy for LAN-gaming.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rainbow-six-black-ops", "videos": [{"id": 34882, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "R_hsdYS2C_M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_hsdYS2C_M", "title": "A SiC Play: Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear - Reintroducing!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R_hsdYS2C_M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
