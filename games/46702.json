Guide both characters in single-player mode or play cooperatively with a friend or family member as you trek through frozen tundra, leap across treacherous ice floes, swim through underwater ice caverns, and face numerous enemies both strange and familiar in the journey to save the girls village.\n\nFoxtales features three all new levels full of environments to explore, puzzles to solve and enemies to face. Travel across open seas, swim through the ruins of a sunken village and paddle up the Noatak River on a mission to rescue a new friend.\n\nThe Never Alone Arctic Combo Pack includes both Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) and the Foxtales DLC.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/never-alone-arctic-collection", "videos": [{"id": 115630, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2k-y8KxiS-4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k-y8KxiS-4", "title": "Never Alone Arctic Collection Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2k-y8KxiS-4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
