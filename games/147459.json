The farm has lots of animals that want to be cared for. Their food grows in the yard, and Abbie can draw water from the well. Children playfully learn what to feed to each animal. But don't worry if they aren't fed or given water for a few days - they can take care of themselves as well! The following places can be visited on the farm: The Pigsty: Home to a family of three pigs, happily romping in the mud, waiting to be stroked and given lots of food. The Stable: Abbie's beloved horse lives here, and is happy to receive any attention. The stable is also where the farmyard cat tries his luck at catching mice. Despite the presence of the horse and the cat, there are a lot of mice, which are difficult to catch. The Garden: This is where all the food grows for the animals on Abbie's farm - carrots, apples, cabbage, beets, corn, grass, strawberries and more. After the fruit and other crops have been harvested, it takes a little while until they grow back again. The scarecrow keeps thieving birds away from the crops. The Well: This is where Abbie draws water to give to the animals, for example. The powers of deduction and logic of little farmers are challenged by everyday tasks: for example, to collect water, the bucket must first be found and then used with the well.
