The locations include castles, churches, asylums, and graveyards. The locations will be open-ended so you get to choose your path through each area. But there are risks to exploring to much.\n\nThe game will focus on stealth and exploration. Instead of getting directly attacked, ghosts will stalk and harass you as you investigate locations. You will have to find ways to avoid or trap them while managing your stress as they attempt to scare you to death. You will have upgradable tools and abilities to use as you progress in the game to help you search and survive.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ghost-theory", "videos": [{"id": 6924, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aFg1-sBiFSA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFg1-sBiFSA", "title": "Ghost Theory - Kickstarter pitch video (HD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aFg1-sBiFSA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
