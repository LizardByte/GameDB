On his tenth birthday, Link encounters a giant bird carrying a girl. He rescues the girl, but as a result his own sister is taken away by the bird. The girl is a pirate captain named Tetra, who agrees to help Link find and rescue his sister. During the course of their journey, the two of them realize that a powerful, legendary evil is active again, and must find a way to stop him.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is the first Zelda game for the Nintendo GameCube and also the first in the series to employ cel-shading, a lighting and texturing technique that results in the game having a cartoon-like appearance. Like its predecessors, The Wind Waker is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Basic gameplay mechanics are similar to those found in Ocarina of Time, but it differentiates itself with its massive Great Sea which must be explored using a boat named King of Red Lions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker", "videos": [{"id": 6612, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RxMos9muPYQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxMos9muPYQ", "title": "Zelda The Wind Waker E3 2002 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RxMos9muPYQ/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1897, "name": "Voice"}]}
