This promotional test video was originally created for presentation at the Avalon Technology Expo, sent all throughout time from 1056 to the 48th century. It has luckily now reached us in 2016 and has been carefully transferred and digitally remastered to a reasonably intelligible state, being that hundreds of playback cycles and physical handling throughout history have degraded the tape into instability, color loss and blur, analog dropouts and artifacts, and excessive audio noise along with wow and flutter. We now bring it to you here for preservation and posterity, along with a recently found ROM dump of the game which has been conveniently packaged into a playable computer program. Enjoy it now, as only time will tell if it will ever be lost to never be found again... \n\nBaby Eater game program available now! https://nnpllc.itch.io/baby-eater\n\nBaby Eater soundtrack AVAILABLE NOW!:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rViGHWzeb8M\n\nhttp://ninjanezumiproductions.com/\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Ninja Nezumi Productions, LLC\nMusic \u2117 2016 Lazaro Gonzalez\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nGame Credits:\n\nDevelopment, Programming, Graphics, and Sound Effects - Kevin Conner\n\nMusic and Sound Design - Lazaro Gonzalez\n\nPromotional Artwork - Andrew DeCrescenzo, Rusty Gilligan", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL9bL42Bqyw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL9bL42Bqyw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL9bL42Bqyw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL9bL42Bqyw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KL9bL42Bqyw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Official Baby Eater Trailer Videotape", "description": "Thought to be long lost to time, this videotape has once again surfaced in our times to showcase the 1986 video game titled 'Baby Eater' for the 8 bit Unicorn Entertainment System.
