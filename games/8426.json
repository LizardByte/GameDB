But not even this sixth sense could save her younger brother, Scott, from a brutal serial killer. Three years later, the investigation into Scott\u2019s murder has gone cold -- but Erica\u2019s work has only just begun.\n\nJump into Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller, the exciting four-part series that brings Erica face to face with the deranged demons of her past. A serial killer is loose in Boston -- one who seems to be leaving deliberate clues that only Erica, with her unique post-cognitive abilities, can uncover.

And how does this new killer know her secret?\n\nDeveloped by Phoenix Online Studios (makers of the King\u2019s Quest spin-off The Silver Lining), with contributions from veteran game designer Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter) and comic book artist Romano Molenaar (Batman, X-Men, The Darkness), Cognition is a thrilling adventure that grips you and won\u2019t let go.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller", "videos": [{"id": 4084, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DSNa_OsFXzM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSNa_OsFXzM", "title": "Cognition Game Of The Year Edition Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSNa_OsFXzM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
