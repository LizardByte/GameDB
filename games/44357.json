{"id": 44357, "name": "Computer Math Games VI", "slug": "computer-math-games-vi", "summary": "The importance of mathematics to the world throughout history cannot be overlooked. Math permeates every aspect of our lives \u2014 work, relaxation, entertainment. Its importance in the future to us and especially to our children will be even greater. Therefore, it is essential for all of us to know and understand how fundamental mathematics operations are performed. In order to develop this understanding, students must have the opportunity to practice, for only through practice can they develop strong mathematical skills. The Computer Math Games VI Solid State Cartridge is one of five modules of math games that can help provide this opportunity. The program was designed by Charles Lund, Supervisor of Mathematics for the St. Paul, Minnesota, public schools and the staff of Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in cooperation with the staff of Texas Instruments Incorporated. The games included in the cartridge are both fun and challenging, with an entertaining, motivating format designed to capture and hold attention. With this cartridge students will be able to: \n- develop math skills by playing four different, enjoyable math games using whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and integers. \n- have fun while practicing mathematics either alone or with other players or team members. \n- develop methods of problem-solving and decision-making. \nThe cartridge is designed to be versatile. It can be used in the home as well as the classroom. The team-use concept allows the cartridge to be used by large numbers of participants, and yet it is equally valuable to your child working alone at home to supplement lectures and homework. The cartridge is intended to be a supplementary aid for children from grades two through nine. It is assumed that the students have been exposed to basic math concepts. While even very young students can use the activities covering addition and subtraction of whole numbers, the cartridge can grow in application as your child grows in ability.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/computer-math-games-vi"}
