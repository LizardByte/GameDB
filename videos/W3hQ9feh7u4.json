The player plays the role of an unnamed counter-terrorist agent who engages in three major combat zones. These areas are under siege by terrorists and the player must kill the terrorists before they take aim and fire at the player character. Shooting hostages or getting shot by terrorists causes the player to lose lives. There are several power-ups in the game, such as rapid-fire mode for the player's gun or a powerful single-shot mode.
