Our hero sets out to inspect a suspiciously related incident at Saint Michael All-Girls Institute. He comes in contact with one of the friends of the victim, Kazumi Asano. Our hero and Riho Yamazaki find a secret underground room beneath the chapel. Here, they find a pendant, which had belonged to Kazumi. The situation is much more serious that he had expected.", "summary": "A remake of the PC-98 game \"Night Walker: Mayonaka no Tantei\". This version uses the same source drawings as the original game, except with 256-color displays, and plays similarly. The characters are recolored, and match the anime more closely. (Shid\u014d's hair is purple, Guni's body is green. Inexplicably, Yayoi's hair is bubblegum pink.)", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/night-walker"}
