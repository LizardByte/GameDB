However, as you progress you collect upgrades which flesh out you abilities and your experience. These upgrades start off fairly normal, such as allowing you to move left, but soon get more crazy (and funnier).\n\nTaking around 10 minutes to play through, it\u2019s a fun little game with a great sense of humor, beautiful pixel art animation, challenging gameplay and a delightfully quirky premise. There\u2019s one major feature that you don\u2019t get until near the end of the game that really affects how you play the game and makes you approach the platforming in a very unique way. Good luck!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nothing"}
