It was released as part of Tiger's short-lived \"Vrt-X\" range, in which the game would be projected as a pseudo-hologram image onto the screen.\n\nDaytona USA stands as the only Sega game to receive the Vrt-X treatment, although there were others for Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat 3, franchises such as Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers and Congo: The Movie. The range did not exist for very long.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daytona-usa--4"}
