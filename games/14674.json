A rebel group made up of dissatisfied aristocrats and like-minded soldiers and citizens calling themselves the Gallian Revolutionary Army rises up in arms in order to wage an ethnic cleansing campaign against Gallians of Darcsen descent. However, with the intense fight against the Empire having left Gallia's regular army in an exhausted state, there is initially little to stop the insurrection from gaining momentum. Laws preventing the formation of a national militia to fight fellow Gallians force the government to deploy military academy cadets to the front lines in order to combat and defeat the GRA forces.\"", "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed tactical RPG Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, which was released exclusively on the PSP (PlayStation Portable) system. The game takes place two years after the conclusion of the original game and takes you back to the epic adventure set in 1930\u2019s fictitious Europe. In this sequel, you play as a group of young Gallian Military Academy cadets who find themselves plunged into a bitter civil war when the newly formed Gallian Revolutionary Army stages a coup. As the drama and battle unfold, you will experience stories of friendship, love and growing pains during a time of war and revolution.\n\nThe 'CANVAS' engine originally developed by SEGA Game Studios Japan for Valkyria Chronicles has been fully redesigned for the PSP system. This incredibly distinctive engine will power over 20 new distinct and visually stunning environments where you will have over 200 different missions to explore. For the first time ad-hoc Versus and Co-op multiplayer gameplay will now be available. The 'BLiTZ' battle system has also been re-designed to offer players the freedom to strategically move around the environment and attack enemies using real-time controls, something never before seen in the tactical role-playing game genre.\n\nThis game adds some new unit classes and the ability to upgrade or change classes. It also changes the battle system to include multiple map areas that are unlocked as you take over enemy bases revealing more of the battlefield and allowing you to call units into that area.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/valkyria-chronicles-2", "videos": [{"id": 6269, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "PS80s3pepVg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS80s3pepVg", "title": "\u6226\u5834\u306e\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\uff12\u3000\u4e16\u754c\u89b3\u7d39\u4ecb\u7bc7", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PS80s3pepVg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40487, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "PTFpj-YE60I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTFpj-YE60I", "title": "Valkyria Chronicles 2 - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PTFpj-YE60I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
