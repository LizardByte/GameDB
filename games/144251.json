It was aptly named Millena, after the great warrior king. However,  \nnot all tribes agreed to the unification and this group of humans would later on establish another nation to rival Millena\u2026 \nThe people of Millena prided physical strength and beauty over everything else as they looked to build on their military might under the guidance of Uniclio Millenas,  \nwho was a just and caring king. For 500 years, Millena enjoyed peace and prosperity under the rule of King Uniclio Millenas and his subsequent heirs.  \nOver the years, as there were no wars and the absence of any single threat that surfaced to threaten the peace, the Millena army was dismissed.  \nComplacency took over and the people of Millena indulged in mortal pleasures such as drinking and dancing. \n \nThe Invasion of Rain and the First Great War (A.U. 532 ~ A.U. 643)  \n \nRight before the nation of Millena was established, Uniclio Millenas banished a group of humans comprising of several small tribes which opposed strongly against the unification plan.  \nThis act of mercy would later prove to be the downfall of Millena..  \nThe banished group risked their lives by crossing Lette Plane and settled down in the mountainous regions of Southern Crise to build their own nation which they named Rain. \nThe people of Rain turned to the Proimas and researched on Proima magic for over 500 years to build their nation and to bolster their military force.  \nA chance encounter with a Millena expedition group escalated from a minor conflict to a full scale war that lasted for 100 years as the people of Rain sought to seek revenge on Millena for banishing them. \nA better prepared Rain army, with the help of Proimas, finally emerged as the victor in the First War between the two nations and the capital city of Millena, Millenas, was utterly destroyed in the aftermath. \n \nHiding period (A.U. 643 ~ A.U. 820) \n \nFollowing their defeat at the hands of the Rain army, the remaining survivors of Millena took refuge deep in Twinible Forest and began efforts on re-building their lives and ensuring their survivability.  \nDetermined not to suffer the same fate again, Millena\u2019s leaders formed and trained a new army with the intention of reclaiming their lost capital. \n \nRetaking Millena and the Second Great War (A.U. 820~A.U.1200) \n \nAfter many years of preparation and developing weapons and equipment to counter Rain\u2019s offensive and defensive magical capabilities,  \nMillena came out of hiding and began their fight to reclaim their land. Thus the second Great War between the two nations began. \nAround the same time, Rain was occupied with another war with an unknown tribe of monsters.  \nMillena seized the opportunity and assaulted an exposed Rain rearguard and forced Rain to retreat back to Southern Crise, successfully reclaiming their lost capital. \nBoth nations would then continue to have many skirmishes in Lette Plane which lasted for about 400 years with neither side really emerging as a victor.  \n \nDiplomatic relations established, and increase of population (A.U. 1200~A.U. 1322) \n \nThe Second Great War which spanned for almost 400 years took a heavy toll on both nations as they experienced a decline of population and both armies were stretched thin. \nUnbeknownst to the humans, something evil was brewing in Lette Plane. The monsters took advantage of weakened defenses and mounted attacks on both capital towns.  \nThe threat posed by the monsters forced leaders of Millena and Rain to come to a ceasefire agreement to focus on defending their own nations against the monsters.  \nBoth Millena and Rain managed to repel further attacks by the monsters and soon after, diplomatic ties were established between the two nations thus ending the Second Great War after almost 400 years. \nMillena and Rain continued to grow and prosper as peace reigned once more in Crise. As both nations experienced booms in population, they once again looked to Lette Plane to expand their borders. \n \nDiscovery of Elda Stones and new conflicts (A.U. 1322 ~ ) \n \nExpeditionary parties sent out by both nations, whilst searching for new land for expansion, stumbled upon shiny stones which famous researcher Elda Tillother researched on.  \nHe discovered that the stones possessed stored energy which were magical in nature.  \nWith the help of other researchers, Elda Tillother found a way to extract the energy from the stones which the humans then used to power their settlements and towns.  \nThe magical stones were called Elda Stones after the famous researcher. The  \nElda Stones soon became a valuable and important resource as both nations started to compete for the Elda Stones. Only time will tell when this renewed competition will escalate  \ninto another conflict which may end up in yet another war\u2026\u2026\u2026 \n \nHistory of Rain \n \nBirth and prosperity (A.U. 143~A.U. 530) \nRight before the nation of Millena was established, Uniclio Millenas banished a group of humans comprising of several small tribes which opposed strongly against the unification plan. The banished group risked their lives by crossing Lette Plane, a dangerous and undeveloped land inhabited by monsters and unknown creatures, and settled down in the mountainous regions of Southern Crise. Their settlement was created in a wide valley surrounded by mountains to prevent monsters and any scouts from Millena from discovering their whereabouts. \nHowever, they lacked the resources and manpower needed to create weaponry and equipment to defend themselves. It was during this time that a talented magic researcher among them, Anat Rain, suggested turning to an ancient sentient race that wielded great power and magical abilities, the Proimas. They began to make contact with Proimas residing in Astral Plane and gained much knowledge about their magic. The banished people then dedicated themselves to the research of Proima magic. Under the watchful guidance of Anat Rain, who was rumored to have made contact with the ultimate Proima, the people built themselves a nation they could call their own. They named their nation Rain, after Anat Rain, in recognition of her outstanding contribution to her people. She also established an academy dedicated to the research of magic for future generations. After her death, the academy produced several other great magic wielders who contributed significantly to the development and prosperity of Rain. \n \nInvasion of Millena and the First Great War (A.U. 532~A.U. 643) \n \nIn the year A.U. 532, the two nations first made contact at the Lette Plane when expeditionary parties from both nations engaged in a small skirmish after a chance encounter. Upon Millena\u2019s discovery of Rain\u2019s existence, the leaders of Rain thought it best to mount an assault on Millena partly to protect their own sovereignty and partly to exact revenge on Millena for banishing their ancestors 500 years ago.Rain\u2019s assault took Millena by surprise and a fierce 100-year long war known as the First Great War ensued. \nRain\u2019s superior military and magical prowess aided the by Proimas won them the war and the capital city of Millena was captured and destroyed. However, many survivors managed to escape and took refuge deep in the bowels of Twinible Forest, an area which the people of Millena were very familiar with. \n \nExploration of the Lette Plane\u00a0 (A.U. 643~A.U. 820) \n \nFollowing the victory of the First Great War, Rain developed steadily as a nation and activities such as research on monsters inhabiting Lette Plane and attempts to communicate with higher level Proimas was at an all time high. Rain\u2019s population was also steadily increasing and Rain soon decided to build a town in Lette Plane to accommodate the increase in population.Expeditionary parties comprised mainly of scholars were sent out to Lette Plane to conduct further investigations and research. \nRain\u2019s head monster researcher, Mananan McNir, categorized monsters into 6 categories, continuously researching them by engaging in conflicts and contacts. However when he tried to conduct a research on an unknown tribe of monsters, he died leaving his research results behind. On the other hand, a high-ranking Rain magician, Arkheart Rain of Anat Rain\u2019s lineage, categorized Proimas into 5 categories and arranged their characteristics and abilities according to the different planes they reside in.  \nBased on these two great scholars\u2019 research, Rain gained valuable information to fight against the monsters of Lette Plane, but the pioneering expeditionary party sent to the Lette Plane barely returned alive. They were attacked and pursued by the same tribe of monsters that killed Mananan McNir. As a result, Rain engaged in a war with them and sent in a bigger army to Lette Plane. The monsters however were highly intelligent and adept at stealth causing the Rain army to suffer substantial losses and retreat from Lette Plane.  \n \nMillena\u2019s Attack and the Second Great War (A.U. 820~A.U. 1200) \n \nAfter many years of preparation and developing weapons and equipment to counter Rain\u2019s offensive and defensive magical capabilities, Millena came out of hiding and began their fight to reclaim their land. Thus the second Great War between the two nations began. \nRain, already weakened by the war with the tribe of monsters, was taken by surprise and their exposed rearguard fell quickly to Millena\u2019s assault. They were forced to give up the capital city of Millena that they captured during the First Great War and retreated back to their capital at Southern Crise.Both nations would then continue to have many skirmishes in Lette Plane which lasted for about 400 years with neither side really emerging as a victor.  \n \nDiplomatic relations established, and increase of population (A.U. 1200~A.U. 1322) \n \nThe Second Great War which spanned for almost 400 years took a heavy toll on both nations as they experienced a decline of population and both armies were stretched thin. \nUnbeknownst to the humans, something evil was brewing in Lette Plane.

Both Millena and Rain managed to repel further attacks by the monsters and soon after, diplomatic ties were established between the two nations thus ending the Second Great War after almost 400 years. \nMillena and Rain continued to grow and prosper as peace reigned once more in Crise. As both nations experienced booms in population, they once again looked to Lette Plane to expand their borders. \n\u00a0 \nDiscovery of Elda Stones and new conflicts (A.U. 1322 ~ ) \n \nExpeditionary parties sent out by both nations, whilst searching for new land for expansion, stumbled upon shiny stones which famous researcher Elda Tillother researched on.
