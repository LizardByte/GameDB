The German and US versions have a number of different included songs.\n\nThe main focus of the game is singing those songs as good as one can. The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/singstar-amped", "collections": [{"id": 592, "name": "SingStar"}]}
