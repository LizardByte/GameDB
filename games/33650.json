The rules are simple - use infinite jumps, precise movement and lots of trial-and-error to move around the mosaic. Avoid red tiles, and make use of other tiles to help you progress through the levels. Each loop you make around the mosaic changes it, building a progressively more difficult obstacle course ahead of you. Skill, precision, careful planning and lots of practice are essential for navigating the levels and reaching the end."}
