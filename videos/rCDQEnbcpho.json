Played in real time on Snes9x 1.55 with re-records used to optimize video length.\n\nParallel Remodel is a dumbed-down fork of Parallel Worlds, which is an extremely difficult game. Parallel Worlds has excellent overworlds and caves, but the dungeons are rife with extreme backtracking, bomb jumping, repetitive mini-bosses, enemies that are too powerful, etc. This fork of Parallel Worlds, released by PuzzleDude in 2012, attempts to address the biggest pitfalls of the original Parallel Worlds, but still falls short. The final result is that the new Parallel Remodel dungeons ended up being too linear, and the difficulty is inconsistent now. For example, Mothula is still the first boss of Nayru's Bay. The Cane of Byrna is still required in Farore's Isle and Nabooru's Hole. The Icy World dungeon order was changed. You only have to climb the Parallel Tower once, in the Icy World.\n\nDownload links:\nPR v1.1: https://mega.nz/file/VmBUgYJQ#psT5_Qz7zBRLI7oKyHnV9FfkFXzrDkWsHtp_qyfXOiw\nPR v1.1 (with MSU-1): https://mega.nz/file/Q6IUUKSL#UhgF-2R15EhL1dvlwOb3wjRDm0rIjvU4ekXKGkxvfno\nMSU-1 Getting Started: https://www.zeldix.net/t1607-msu1-getting-started-guide\nMSU-1 Patch and Audio Files: https://www.zeldix.net/t791-the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past\nUPS Patcher: https://mega.nz/file/w3BAFS7B#T1AEFUcJgp_rq5jeej-laObhhWT4S15iNFxZM3dXXMo\nSNES Rom Utility: https://www.romhacking.net/download/utilities/593/\n\nNote: You must use a US rom with no header.
