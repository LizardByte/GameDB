There are ten levels of positions within each of the ten career tracks - your Sims can work their way up in career fields.\n\nYour Sims can experience floods, fires, and robberies. Neglect, starvation, loss of energy, failure to perform basic bathroom visits - all can affect your Sims and even stop them in their tracks. Death is an option and entire families could be wiped out by complete neglect and starvation.", "summary": "The Sims is a life-building simulation with emphasis on intimate details of individual characters rather than expansion of an entire society or civilization.
