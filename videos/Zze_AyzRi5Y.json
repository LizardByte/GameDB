Classless character building, strategic management, and small unit tactical gameplay combine to create a multi-layered experience that puts players in the middle of a civil war in a morally grey fantasy world.\n\nA game of hard decisions and harsher consequences, Forged of Blood will challenge players to make decisions across every layer of the game. On the battlefield, character builds, turn-order efficiency, and positioning will be key to victory. While off the battlefield, your choices on the world map will determine the fate of your kingdom and future of your people.\n\nKey Features:\nTactical Fantasy: Take to the field with sword and shield or cast powerful spells in deep turn-based tactical combat against monsters and men.\n\nClassless Warfare: With 9 unique weapons and a vast magic system, Forged of Blood lets you build your characters any way you want \u2013 without being constrained by the typical tank/DPS/healer roles.\n\nScience in Magic: Explore the freedom and mysteries of one of the most complex and unique magic systems ever attempted in video games.\n\nKingdom at War: Command up to three parties of heroic characters on the strategic layer in your fight to reclaim the empire you lost.\n\nMeaningful Choice: Your choices matter. From character building to your choices in the game narrative, your decisions will reverberate across the Strategic and Tactical layers of the game.\n\nYour ends; your means: In a world of grays and unique perspectives, it is up to you to decide what is \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d for the future of Attiras. Forged of Blood will introduce a new Tri-axis Personality Index (TPI) system in lieu of the traditional Good vs. Evil scale common in most RPG settings.\n\nFollow us and connect with the team:\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/617640/Forged_of_Blood/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/fobthegame\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ForgedOfBlood\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pU843Jv", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zze_AyzRi5Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zze_AyzRi5Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zze_AyzRi5Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zze_AyzRi5Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zze_AyzRi5Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Forged of Blood | Official Feature Overview", "description": "\u2694\ufe0f Forged of Blood on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/617640/Forged_of_Blood/\n\nAVAILABLE AUGUST 2019\n\nAbout Forged of Blood:\nForged of Blood is pushing the boundaries of depth and mechanical complexity for the modern turn-based tactical RPG.
