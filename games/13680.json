You and a friend play female Marines and you must explore and destroy all aliens who have taken over a now abandoned space settlement LV426 Acheron. If you can find any survivors try to rescue them. As well as your normal gun there are other weapons that can be used to help you. A Caterpillar P-5000 can also be found and used.\n\nAliens is mainly a side view horizontal shooter where the screen scrolls as you move from left to right. Some parts of the game require you to look behind the hero firing into the screen as aliens come towards from the distance as well as moving in other directions like in a lift. You can also be driving into the screen trying to shoot aliens.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aliens", "videos": [{"id": 89499, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Vs2yN8iVb5s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs2yN8iVb5s", "title": "Aliens (World set 1) [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vs2yN8iVb5s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
