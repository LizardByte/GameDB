The auto-map is always visible, showing the player the character's position. Enemies and important objects are also visible on the radar. Whenever an enemy approaches, the playable robot is unable to move. The shooting is actually done in turn-based style; the player can only shoot once the robot's attack meter has filled up, and the rate of shooting depends on the robot's (or enemy's) agility. However, the game doesn't pause when the shooting occurs, creating the illusion of real-time combat.\n\nThough the game looks like a first-person shooter, it is, in its core, an RPG. Player-controlled robot receives experience and levels up after having defeated certain amounts of enemies. Attack, defense, speed, etc. get increased with each level up. It is possible to find and equip various kinds of weapons: a basic gun with infinite ammo, but low damage; powerful rocket launchers which cause high damage, yet have limited ammunition, etc. Two weapons can be equipped in each hand, and the player can switch between them during combat. Shields can also be found and equipped. Weapon energy, body (\"health\"), and shield energy can be restored with appropriate items.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
