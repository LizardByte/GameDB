Don't forget the additional bonus stages and Arcade Mode, too.\nThere are two elements in playing Party Wave: paddling and surfing. For paddling, touch surfers and drag them to a spot where the surf breaks, while avoiding the obstacles such as dolphins and turtles. And for surfing, touch surfers to make them turn and jump to prevent wipeouts.\nLet's surf a wave with the surfing crowd and the board-riding dog, Skip, while getting help from three mermaid sisters and Hiso Alien, who provides valuable bonuses.\nParty Wave!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/party-wave"}
