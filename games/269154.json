Feeling indebted to him and perhaps a little attracted to him as well, she tries to return the umbrella to his manor hidden deep in the woods. Manago quickly becomes swept up in a romance that is not all that it seems, and must figure out who exactly the mysterious man in white really is, or face severe consequences.", "summary": "Jasei no In: The Serpent's Lust is a short, linear game with a strong narrative.
