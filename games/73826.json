The player-controlled aircraft is able to move in any direction, avoiding enemy fire or preparing a better angle for the next shot. There is a wide selection of aircraft to choose from and each of them, before the gameplay, can be individually equipped with different types of weapons like missiles and bombs. Battles take place on eight different maps.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zone-66"}
