Unlike in the original game, where George Stobbart is the only playable character, Nicole Collard is controllable for selected game sections. While certain puzzles from the original segments were simplified, new first-person puzzles were also added. Hotspots are highlighted, and a hint system is added, along with a diary in which the player character takes notes. Some of the original game's dialogue and cutscenes were removed, with the blood edited out of retained cutscenes.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-the-directors-cut", "videos": [{"id": 9162, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mNviUlYNm5c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNviUlYNm5c", "title": "Broken Sword: Director's Cut Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mNviUlYNm5c/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
