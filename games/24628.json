You start with almost nothing: a run-down office, a rickety old desk, a crummy computer. By tapping the screen you can mine virtual bitcoins and slowly increase your wealth. Spend digital dough to upgrade that awful furniture into swanky things like entertainment centers and priceless works of art. If you're smart (which, you are!), you'll spend some of that money on investments to help you earn while you're away. And don't worry, investments aren't as boring as in real life. How could robot butlers, virtual reality and holographic dating be anything but awesome?", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bitcoin-billionaire"}
