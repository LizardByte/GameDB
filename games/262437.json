It is a collection of the first maps Tarnsman ever made, largely inspired by their Doom II originals (and sharing the same names) but also consisting of other influences, and with a new soundtrack. The project was originally titled Doom II Redux, and a demo was released in 2011, which received an honorable mention at the 2011 Cacowards. The last version of Suitcase of Gor released was in 2013, containing 22 maps, with the full 32-map version never materializing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/suitcase-of-gor"}
