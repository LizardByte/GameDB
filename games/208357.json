It\u2019s because Numberland is a big animated cartoon, but in this cartoon, the child gets to be one of the characters \u2014 Stuart!

When they have enough brainpower, they can use Numberland\u2019s powerful Imagination Machine! This machine turns \u201cimagined\u201d toys into \u201creal\u201d toys, which the children can then sell in Bee\u2019s toy store. So in a nutshell \u2013 \u2013 they explore and explore, learn how to play games from cartoon playmates, earn brainpower, make toys, sell them to customers, and learn math the whole time\u2026And they never seem to get tired of it!", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stuart-little-his-adventures-in-numberland", "videos": [{"id": 90776, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "-xkYVOHiUz8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xkYVOHiUz8", "title": "Stuart Little - His Adventures in Numberland gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-xkYVOHiUz8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
