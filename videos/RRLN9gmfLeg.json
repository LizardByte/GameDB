{"id": "RRLN9gmfLeg", "snippet": {"title": "Xbox Longplay [010] Project Gotham Racing", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: RickyC\n\nOne of my first games on original xbox, one that I loved quite a bit. I'm playing after quite a long time off for the game so in the beginning particularly I suck. I was going to replace the first few races but thought i'd leave it in as I was experimenting with a few different cars unlike later in the video were I stuck with one. I forgot how much I loved the soundtrack in this game, although certain songs got repeated a bit too often. The controls are very arcadey but still fun and the AI cars are super aggressive making it a real challenge to take corners when you have a car behind you.\n\nThe aim of the game is to gain kudos through mostly powerslides. You gain kudos you unlock more cars that can help you gain better medals which again help you unlock even better cars. There is a lot of repeating tracks so I thought i'd do a very basic longplay of this to show the tracks and the modes and not to complete everything. I alternative between the arcade races and kudos challenges. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRLN9gmfLeg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRLN9gmfLeg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRLN9gmfLeg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Xbox Longplay [010] Project Gotham Racing", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: RickyC\n\nOne of my first games on original xbox, one that I loved quite a bit.
