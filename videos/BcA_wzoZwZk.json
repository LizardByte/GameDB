It's a classic platform game with many dangers to avoid and a normal difficulty that becomes harder thanks to the horrible controls.\nGraphically is quite a good game, polished, with neat sprites and good sound. The playability is its weak point due to bad controls, so bad that I've recorded the game in demo mode, because I couldn't make enough footage to make a video.\nHere you'll find intro, and demo gameplay.\n\nAll footage taken from original hardware machines and upscaled to 1080P.\n\nLet me know what do you think about the video in the comments below but, most important, Enjoy!!!\nIf you liked the video, please consider giving a thumbs up and maybe also subscribe.\n\nThanks for watching.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BcA_wzoZwZk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BcA_wzoZwZk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BcA_wzoZwZk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BcA_wzoZwZk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BcA_wzoZwZk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dark Castle - Atari ST / STE", "description": "In this video, Dark Castle, released in 1989 for the Atari ST by Mirrorsoft.\nSituated on the top of a desolate hill lies the Dark Castle, home of the evil Black Knight.
