Both have their own characteristics and allow the game to be adapted to the target. Arcade mode allows to select the bike to race with, the rider - his name can even be changed - and whether to start a single race or a full Championship. All that needs to be done is win all the single GPs or get the first position by the end of the Championship. In order to win a Championship in Simulation the player must get the best out of his bike by changing all the parameters that the game offers. \n \nSuperbike World Championship provides 12 circuits around the world including Monza, Laguna Seca and Brands Hatch. Various bikes from the 1997 season are available in arcade and simulation modes; from Ducati, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki, driven by aces such as Kocinski, Carl Fogarty, Scott Russell, Aaron Slight and Pierfrancesco Chili.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/superbike-world-championship"}
