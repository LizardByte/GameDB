It takes much from the original games in the series, but even more from the GBA games. As usual, Crash can run, spin, jump, crawl, slide, and belly flop. There are Wumpa Fruits, Gems, and Crystals to be collected in the levels. Recognizable icons such as crates and enemies like carnivorous plants can be found through the game's 18 levels, which are divided into four different sections. Each level is quite short, but it adds to the challenge that you don't have any checkpoints or extra lives. If you get hurt then the level is restarted.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
