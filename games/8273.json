Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atv-offroad-fury-4", "collections": [{"id": 1111, "name": "ATV Offroad Fury"}]}
