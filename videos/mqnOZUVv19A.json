Their agents have destabilized the country, and local rebels, led by Prime Minister Vishaka, plan to assassinate the king. You play Jeff, a double agent, and when you arrive in Opalia, you are ambushed. You wake up in your hotel without remembering who you are and what you are doing here. Soon you learn who you are and what your mission is: to find evidence for the Minister's devious scheme.
