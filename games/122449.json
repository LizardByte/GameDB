Just as in real life, any hit delivered is painful. The game is built on a realistic battle system which emphasizes weapon positioning for defending yourself. A clean hit to the any vital area will result in an instant death. This system will help you to absorb your mistakes and give you a chance to mount a comeback needed for victory.\nSince every fight in Die by the Blade has different feel and difficulty, you can choose how many lives will be part of the round and then you can easily adapt to the difficulty of each fight for yourself. One to three lives result in high tension fights which might be sometimes based on luck and one random win can affect the whole result of the match. Five to seven lives fights are a bit more relaxed.", "summary": "Vanquish your foes with a single strike in 1v1 weapon-based fighter Die by the Blade.
