When a vulgar beast from Hell's deepest corners came to Emor, she was bitten and turned to a vampire. Forced to watch her family die, she refused to bow to the Queen's whims. Punishing her, the Queen sealed Procuni in a sarcophagus and forced to dream the same nightmare every night - the nightmare of babes falling from the heavens, to die and feed the lust of QUEEN SAPHRON!\n\nCan you save the babies, and help Procuni resist the evil Queen for one more night?", "summary": "Baby Eater was created to be an 8-bit style arcade game from the 1980s.\nThe premise is you play a vampire who has the same nightmare every night - babies fall to their deaths to feed the Vampire Queen - Saphron.  Your job is to save them all, by running back and forth across the screen to catch the babies.\n\nGameplay elements:\nIn addition to catching the babies, several levels have unique hazards and rules that change the demands of play, such as: a mist that deals damage during animated frames, a level which inverts control and flips perspective, a level with a low ceiling (forcing you to pay attention to audio cues and shadows), etc...\nThere are 3 power-ups and 3 power-downs, in addition to a rock that can damage you and destroy the basket, all of which change how you approach which baby to save and when.\nYou have one action button which allows you to put your cloak on and take it off.\n\n8-Bit Features:\nPixel count, Colors on Screen, Frame Rate, Music and Sound emulation follow optimized/averaged 8-bit rules/restrictions for arcade and home systems, rather than simply being \"retro-themed\" with updated features.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 11088, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KL9bL42Bqyw"}], "characters": [{"id": 11115, "name": "Queen Saphron"}]}
