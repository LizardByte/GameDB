The mapset was inspired by Scythe and Speed of Doom, emphasizing flow and gameplay over visuals. The project was originally meant to be a complete 32-level megawad, but was abandoned by Sealy due to education commitments. Only 17 maps were completed, plus 1 unfinished map.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/surge--2"}
