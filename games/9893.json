Fast forward to modern times where these leftover weapons are called \"Furies\" and warriors that wield them are \"Fencers.\" Fury weapons are said to be incredibly powerful, so Fencers constantly scramble to acquire them. By a strange coincidence, two fencers, Fang and Tiara, get caught up in the struggle between the goddess and evil god.", "summary": "Fairy Fencer F is a fantasy role-playing game under Compile Heart's Galapagos RPG brand for the PlayStation 3.
