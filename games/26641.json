Two pilots go head-to-head in their anti-grav ships to protect their goal. Five hundred 'hard light' balls are served and the pilots must keep as many balls in play as posssible. As the sport grew more popular, new modes of play were added: the first was Dodgeball where pilots must skillfully weave their ship between the balls as they get bigger and faster. Then the Loneball game was introduced where the pilots must only deal with one ball at a time in a neon-lit stadium.", "summary": "Impossiball is a love letter to one of the original video games: Pong! We have taken the simple bat-and-ball idea and given it a 21st century makeover. There are three game modes:\n\n1. Impossiball - 500 balls instead of 1! Power-ups change the gameplay and you can rotate your shp for fine control over how each ball bounces.\n\n2. Dodgeball - Your aim is to avoid the balls but they are getting bigger and faster. You score points when your opponent hits a ball.\n\n3. Loneball - The classic Pong mode BUT with an 80's retro vibe including neon lighting and a chiptune soundtrack!\n\nYou can play against the AI or, for the most fun, challenge a friend and let the shouting commence!\n\nThe game was created in Unity and is currently in Early Access on Steam.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/impossiball", "videos": [{"id": 11518, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "3ePCRboqXSQ"}, {"id": 11517, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "WL_KMjtIqQM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL_KMjtIqQM", "title": "Impossiball Trailer (Steam Early Access)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WL_KMjtIqQM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
