A liberator is someone who can perform the ritual of freeing someone's mind. Your goal is to escape the world of Femto and return to your own world, and only way to do so is by freeing people's minds.\n\nThe game consists of two main gameplay elements. The adventure part which is where the story unfolds and the typical visual novel dialogues are gone through, and a puzzle part which consists of two phases, a phase for moving puzzle pieces, and a phase for moving to a location. The puzzle picture consists of 15 key pieces in total, and you need to put them all in their right place to be able to escape. Each phase gives you limited number of turns and/or points you can spend until it is finished, after which another phase will start. By determining location, you will move onto corresponding adventure part. In each location during adventure element, various events will occur and you will be able to talk to characters there. After the adventure part is over, you will return to the puzzle screen and continue with the next moving phase of puzzle pieces.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/torikago-no-mukougawa", "videos": [{"id": 98665, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tM8klJ500VE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8klJ500VE", "title": "\u3010PS2\u3011\u9ce5\u7c60\u306e\u5411\u3053\u3046\u304c\u308f\u3000\u521d\u898b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3000Part\uff11\u3000\uff5e\u4e16\u754c\u306f\u6697\u304f\u3001\u771f\u3063\u9ed2\u3044\u95c7\u3000\u3010\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30aa\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba2\u3011\u3010\u30b9\u30bf\u30b2\u30fc2\u3011\u3010JAPAGE\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tM8klJ500VE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
