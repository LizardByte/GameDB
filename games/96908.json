Coast Guard: Beach Rescue Team is an exciting driving game that will let you drive and pilot multiple cool vehicles - cars, boats, buggies and more! With them, the game will take you along the beaches and into the sea. Drive patrol trucks on the sand, from there get on the road if you need to move to another location or hop into a rescue boat and pilot it into the sea. Whatever the beach vehicle you think of, you\u2019ll probably find it here. Are you ready to try out all of them?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/coast-guard-beach-rescue-team"}
