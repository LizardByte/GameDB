Six months later, the \"Midnight Sun\" approaches Earth, destabilizing magic and heralding the return of Lilith's master, Chthon. Doctor Strange, Tony Stark, and Carol Danvers attempt to retrieve a page of the Darkhold from Johnny Blaze but are forced to retreat to the Abbey to recruit the Midnight Suns and resurrect the Hunter, Lilith's child and killer.\n\nLilith enthrals Venom to help her abduct Wanda Maximoff and destroy Strange's mystic shield. The heroes, joined by Spider-Man, capture Faustus to learn Lilith's plans, but Hydra operative Crossbones kills him before they can get answers. Meanwhile, Lilith enthrals Bruce Banner and Wanda, using a gamma accelerator to empower them. The heroes rescue Wanda, banish Sabretooth, and destroy the Parchment, but Lilith unleashes the demonic Hulk and summons demons worldwide.\n\nThe heroes confront Lilith, who reveals her plan to destroy Chthon but inadvertently allows him to possess the Hunter. The Hunter expels Chthon, and Lilith sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold, restoring her human form. She, the Hunter, and Chthon's realm are consumed by the Darkhold, leaving the heroes to believe they are still alive. Meanwhile, Doctor Doom seizes the Darkhold for himself, deeming the previous users \"amateurs.\"", "summary": "Marvel's Midnight Suns: Legendary Edition is a special edition of the game Marvel's Midnight Suns, developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games.
