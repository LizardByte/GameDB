This vast realm of the far-north is considered uncivilised by everyone, except themselves. Reason: most of it is a monster-infested wildland.\n\nOur protagonist has three objectives: One, to survive this dangerous wildland. Second, to reach safe haven at the Church of St. Huldra. Third, find out who's the heinous thief who stole its treasure, which without the nuns of the Church won't survive the winter. Everything is going badly enough with him being lost in God-knows-where, just to turn worse when a dreadful encounter happens in the tundra.", "summary": "The Voyage Sinister it's a Gothic story with an investigative and mystery element, set in a Victorian-inspired world.
