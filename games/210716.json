But instead of building a case or solving puzzles, the player advances the story by clearing fitness goals, such as performing 50 sit-ups in three minutes.\n\nThe story revolves around the player\u2019s relationship with childhood friend Mayu Uehara and is divided into 20 fully-voiced episodes*. Players train in real life by doing sit-ups, push-ups**, and squats with their iOS device while Mayu counts their repetitions and cheers them on. As the story advances, you become closer with Mayu but your fitness goals also become more demanding. Clearing the story may take several months of training, but stick with it and you\u2019ll have something to show for in the real world as well!", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burn-your-fat-with-me", "videos": [{"id": 72511, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PyEEzwZgMg4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyEEzwZgMg4", "title": "Burn Your Fat With Me - Prologue (JP VA)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PyEEzwZgMg4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
