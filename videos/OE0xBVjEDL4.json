Use power-ups to gain an advantage, coordinate with the team, and fight for your universe in the ultimate multiverse battle for the ancient artifact to save your universe from incursion. \n\nhttps://skader.net\n========================\n\nOur Multiverse is collapsing, triggered by a catastrophic spacetime event. Many universes are already gone and just a handful left. Those who survived live in a constant universe incursion state and are about to collapse as well. There is an ancient artifact that can protect a single universe from collapsing and the multiverse sentinels, a pure energy intelligence without a body, decide to conduct an ultimate tournament.
