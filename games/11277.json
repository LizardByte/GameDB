Combat Chess takes the basic chess game and adds an imaginative element for players bored with the simple \"black vs. white\" chess board. Beautifully done in rendered 3D graphics, Combat Chess adds stunning animation sequences during gameplay. Combat Chess is written to Grand Master standards and supports play against human opponents.\n\nCombat Chess includes 3D rendered pieces from a medieval setting with fantasy elements. Pawns become dragons, Knights become real knights, the Black Knight\u2019s turning your pawns to green jelly, and the Queen\u2019s threatening to deliver a majestic head-butt to your king. With over 600 animation sequences, each piece includes \"fidget\" sequences for those moments you need to think. The animations include movement, combat, fidgets, and \"check\" moves. For the traditional minded, Combat Chess includes a traditional set, also 3D rendered. Two boards come with the game, each assigned to the genre of pieces.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/combat-chess", "videos": [{"id": 82803, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "blwvsoOM1P0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blwvsoOM1P0", "title": "Combat Chess gameplay (PC Game, 1997)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/blwvsoOM1P0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
