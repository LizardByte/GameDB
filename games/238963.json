While initially created as a fangame, after revealing it to Kane, it was turned into a canon sequel meant to take place right before Popgoes 2. The plot would have involved Simon altering Strings' Curiosity module, making him hallucinate a new Popgoes Pizzeria with Simon as the main attraction, forcing him to survive against the \"Generated Animatronics\". The ending screen from Popgoes Arcade 2 teased Popgoes0, showing the Generated Popgoes' box. Popgoes 0 was later de-canonized due to the amount of changes to the plot of Popgoes 2 it required. After this, Phil cancelled the game.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popgoes-0"}
