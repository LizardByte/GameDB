It's just another day in the office for Albert Wilde, feline private eye. Cat Detective set in New York in the 1930\u2019s, featuring atmospheric visuals, anthropomorphic characters and at least one joke about cat nipples (they have six!). \n\nPlay as the Cat Detective Albert Wilde. Walk, talk, interrogate, joke, solve a mystery, and experience an old film noir setting with humanoid animal characters. A story of quantum theory and parallel universes served with a lot of humour in 6 -7 hours of gameplay. \n\nIt\u2019s less of a typical \"whodunnit\" and more of an origin story\u2014showing how Albert Wilde evolves from a Private Investigator (P.I.) to a Quantum Private Investigator.\n\nDeveloped by beyondthosehills\nhttps://beyondthosehills.com/\n\nJoin us on Discord:\nhttps://beyondthosehills.com/discord\n\nThe trailer was made by Extra Nice team", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vtnc2L23hIs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vtnc2L23hIs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vtnc2L23hIs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vtnc2L23hIs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vtnc2L23hIs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cat Detective Albert Wilde - Release Date Trailer", "description": "Cat Detective Albert Wilde - Release Date Trailer\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1810670/\nLaunch on Steam on 24th of January, 2025\n\nCat Detective Albert Wilde is a comedy noir, sci - fi mystery game that blends elements of a walking simulator and interactive novel, with a strong focus on humor. \n\nA freakish corpse, a pissed-off bookie, a wormhole to another reality.
