That means it\u2019s up to you to preserve the family\u2019s legacy as rail tycoon, working to connect both coasts of America via a trans-continental railroad. But, it\u2019s never as simple as it sounds, and you\u2019ll face plenty of competition, from other rail barons to local bandits, angry Native tribes and much more.\n\nIn Bounty Train, you\u2019ll learn all about managing a train \u2013 from buying the best steam engines you can afford, to keeping them fueled and in good repair as you race from town to town, delivering cargo and completing tasks for your \u201cclients.\u201d And don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s always someone looking to steal your cargo or even your train, so you\u2019ll want to hire a hardy crew of gunslingers.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bounty-train", "videos": [{"id": 5339, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "suevYQoQd6s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suevYQoQd6s", "title": "Bounty Train - Gameplay Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/suevYQoQd6s/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
