They are everywhere and you have to be polite to them. I mean, I don\u2019t want to sound like a jerk. I know they mean well\u2026 at least most of them. They know not just what pinheads they can be. How nice would it be to be able to throw bowling balls at them. Well, here is your chance! And its legal! You can throw bowling balls at these pinheads all day long. Some of them will even like it. Not only the pinheads at the end of the lane, but also the rest of the pinheads taking up space. As long as you are playing this game, you\u2019ll never have to be polite to any pinhead you see. That is our promise to you.\n\nPinheads Bowling VR is a fun fun fun new way to play the classic game of bowling with animated pins that react as you bowl. The game is built on a hyper-realistic physics simulation, so whether you like to put spin on the ball and curve it in for a strike or throw straight down the lane, you will feel like you are bowling at a real bowling alley. That is\u2026if real bowling alleys were filled with living bowling pins. Watch the bowling pins get slammed by the ball and then watch them enjoy their off-hours by unlocking new activities for them as you play the game.", "summary": "Pinheads Bowling VR is a fun new way to play the classic game of bowling, with animated pins and sideline attractions that create an altogether unique bowling experience!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pinheads-bowling-vr"}
