Controlled by keyboard or mouse, the game is a test of reflexes. Each collected droplet gives 5 points; 45 points will get you to the next section; after three sections you will progress to the next increasingly harder level. \nMissing too many droplets will cause the beer glass to slip. Watch out for falling sugar cubes, peanuts, matchsticks and darts - you can only withstand them three times. Also beware of a little green caterpillar who tries to hinder your progress in all manners possible. Help comes in the form of a bell announcing 'happy hour'-mode - making your beer glass invulnerable for a couple of seconds. Another help is a sponge appearing from time to time. Jumping on it cleans all spilled droplets. \nUsers were encouraged to save their highscores on a blank disk and send them, accompanied with a slogan, to Dommelsch. The ten best highscorers would receive video game prizes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
