Blocks drop down from the top of the screen and can be rotated. To create a match and make them disappear, at least three identical pieces need to be lined up horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Every now and then blocks contain a star piece that can be matched with any piece.\n\nThe game is played at a fast pace with a time limit. To extend the time and continue playing the player has to form a certain number of lines. Progress is shown through a vertical Goal bar in the top right side of the screen. Multiplayer is supported for two players simultaneously, racing each other.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maniac-square--1", "videos": [{"id": 108339, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1LsU8QfSZps"}]}
