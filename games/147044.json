In a land of myth, magic, and monsters, it is your sacred duty to protect your people and see them not only survive, but thrive. How will you choose to serve your people? Will you push them towards power, risking the good will of the people for the chance to become the strongest of the Twelve? Or will you take the path of peace and bask in your popularity, while running the risk of attracting those who might not have your Tribe's well-being as a priority in their plans?\n\nThe path you take is up to you, but be warned, each will come with its own price...\n\nThere are many dangers in the land of Tis'te...\n\nWill your Tribe be ready when the Storm breaks?\n\nTis'te is a land full of many threats to your Tribe, both monstrous and human alike. However, none is greater than the constant threat of the Tempest, an ancient and everlasting Storm that has existed off the shores of Stonewall for time immemorial, and regularly throws off hurricane level Storms with the potential to wipe out the entire continent.\n\nProtecting the Twelve Tribes are the Twelve Towers, magical structures built by ancient and mythical sorcerers to contain the power of the Storms and Turn them away before they are allowed to cause too much damage. These Towers require a constant supply of Fyre, the magical force that all Tis'te are born able to cultivate and use to gain supernatural skills and control the very elements of nature. Your goal each year as Chief is to ensure that there is enough Fyre on hand to protect your people during the Storm Season, while balancing the demands of your people, your family, and your own ambition.", "summary": "A Storm is Coming.... The Empty Throne lies vacant, and the Ancient Towers of Fyre begin to fail in their protection. Who will unite the tribes against the threat of the Flood? Who has the power to protect the people?

Tribes of Tis'te is a kingdom building rogue-like, a blend of styles that will let you live the life of a Chief, one of the Twelve Rulers of the Tis'te Territories. As you protect, populate, and grow your territory in order to survive the harsh landscape your Tribe calls home, you will face many different dangers.
