They can make plants to grow in harsh wastelands, living tools that obey their commands, and powerful monsters to crush any who oppose them. They jealously guard their powers and destroy any who question their will. \nOr so they did. Then the revolution came. \n \nSome of their creations, tired of bondage, rose up. Jealous humans, wanting the powers of the Shapers for themselves, joined them. Now the lands of Terrestia are full of ruins, refugees, and maddened mutant beasts, hunting for prey. There is war. And the Shapers are winning. \n \nYou are a rebel, given the power to craft life and sent to fight the Shapers. At least, that is what they told you to do. Will you fight your oppressors? Or will you join them, tempted by the incredible rewards they offer? You have the chance to change the world. What path will you choose?", "summary": "Geneforge 4: Rebellion is the fourth video game in the Geneforge series of role-playing video games created by Spiderweb Software.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/geneforge-4-rebellion"}
