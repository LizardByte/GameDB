Although the official name of \u014cfuna Station to T\u014dky\u014d Station is T\u014dkaido main line, trains run directly from Kurihama Station to T\u014dky\u014d Station, so the line between Kurihama and T\u014dky\u014d Stations is known as the Yokosuka Line.\nThe train leaves Kurihama Station for Yokohama Station via Yokosuka Station, a military port town; Kamakura Station,famous for the Daibutsu statue and Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine; and \u014cfuna Station, where the train joins the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line. After Yokohama Station, the line separates from the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line near Tsurumi Station and heads for Shinagawa Station while running alongside the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen via Shin-Kawasaki Station where the Shin-Tsurumi Engine Works, and Musashi-kosugi Station is spead. After Shinagawa Station, the line goes underground to T\u014dky\u014d Station, its final destination. We hope you enjoy the various landscapes from the suburbs to the city and the many parallel trains.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jr-east-train-simulator-yokosuka-line-kurihama-to-tokyo-series-e217"}
