Her only clue is a series of encrypted messages locked on the device \u2014 and a mysterious new friend who woke up to a phone that wasn't his.\n\nWhat does this enigmatic hacker want? Why is he talking about the end of the world? And what does any of this have to do with Clara's quaint and peaceful life in Haven Heights?\n\nAll we know for sure is that if she doesn't embark on this quest... her friends will drag her into it anyway.\n\n\u25ba DESCRIPTION\nMonospaced Lovers is an indie game for PC, Mac, and Linux. It's a puzzle platformer featuring hand-drawn anime art, head-scratching puzzles, and an expressive soundtrack that blends modern instruments with old-school, chiptune-style accents. Above all, Monospaced Lovers is unabashedly a narrative game, with over 50,000 words of dialogue, a non-silent heroine who plays a large role in the story, and a whole world filled with strange friends and stranger enemies. If you enjoy emotional, character-driven stories like To the Moon, Undertale, or the films of Makoto Shinkai (e.g. Your Name), then you'll surely find something to enjoy in this game.\n\nIf all goes well, we'd love to port the game to the Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. But, we can't promise a console launch yet. For now, please enjoy the game DRM-free on Steam, itch.io, and possibly other storefronts.\n\n#indiegames | #indiedev | #gamedev | #indiegame | #discoverindies | #indiehighlights | #indiegaming | #indiegamedev | #videogames | #animegames | #animegame | #MonospacedLovers", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NL2x8c5A6kM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NL2x8c5A6kM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NL2x8c5A6kM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Monospaced Lovers \u2014 Demo v2.0 Trailer", "description": "Wishlist Monospaced Lovers on Steam! https://store.steampowered.com/app/1164460/Monospaced_Lovers/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=demo2\nCome chat with us: https://discord.gg/n6GQhXy\n\n\u25ba FOLLOW US!\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/scarlet_string\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/n6GQhXy\nEmail: https://mailchi.mp/2edf102a8670/monospaced-lovers\n\n\u25ba TRY THE DEMO\nitch.io: https://scarletstring.itch.io/monospaced-lovers\nGame Jolt: https://gamejolt.com/games/monospaced-lovers/501345\n\n\u25ba STORY\nClara wakes up to a phone that isn't hers.\n\nOn it, she finds a perplexing message left by a hacker named the Go\u0340d o\u034ff\u0334 B\u0334in\u0360a\u0338r\u0328y\u0327, stating that her time left in this world is short.
