Together, you'll travel to forgotten realms, solve challenging puzzles, and battle menacing enemies. Alone, no one can conquer what you're up against. But united, you just may defeat even the darkest of villains. Immerse yourself in the world of Moss to help write the story of a hero in the making.", "summary": "In Moss, players can reach out, touch, and interact with the environment while guiding Quill through her journey.
