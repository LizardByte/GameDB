You know it's the key to get through the first corner as fast as you can. Probably it will allow you to make a good start and overtake the two cars in front of you. They already reached their starting spots.\nIt's time to lift up gas pedal and focus on that yellow line on your grid spot. While gently applying pressure on the brake pedal, you try to gain every millimeter the regulation permits, and perfectly line up your front wing with the white line defining your starting position.\nNow you are pushing the paddles on the bottom part of your steering wheel, disengaging the clutch. Shift from 2nd to 1st gear. The car is still.\nFirst red light of the traffic light turns on. You did this already, you know how to do it. Your right foot pushes gently gas pedal.\nSecond red light is on, rpm hits the limiter.\nThird red light is on. The engine now howles loud, while you try to find the right rpms for a perfect start.\nFour red light is on.

Everything is ok.\nLights are out..."}
