The adventure begins in the city of Tilverton, a relatively small town that nonetheless contains all the essential shops and services to equip the party.

Outside the city of Tilverton, the characters may explore underground caverns, sewers, and outside in the wilds. Other locations include the Elven Forest, Zhentil Keep, the temple at Yulash, and the citadel at Hap, though these locations cannot be freely explored by the party. Instead, the player can use a menu to select places within the locations to visit. Yulash is under siege by marauders, and characters entering the town are also in danger from crumbling walls and sinkholes.", "summary": "Welcome to the official Advanced Dungeons & Dragons computer product, Curse of the Azure Bonds, A Forgotten Realms fantasy role-playing epic. This adventure game is based on the rules and background created by TSR, Inc. and a storyline created especially for this game.
