Quickly put enemies in to the ground, keep them stunned or launch them in to the air and continue to juggle! Maintaining a combo will fill your Super meter faster and allow you to unleash a devastating attack. You can also find and use weapons such as crowbars, swords and machine guns scattered around the levels. Last but not least, each character is equipped with a unique sidearm but ammunition is scarce so use it wisely! The game is easy to get in to but not easy to master.", "summary": "The Takeover is a side-scrolling beat'em up inspired by 90's classics such as Streets of Rage and Final Fight.
