Boxing was released in 1980 for the Atari by Activision. This is a one or two player game of sports combat, aka Boxing. This is a fun game and hails from the day when Rocky ruled the theater and Arcades ruled the malls.  Boxing plays like a retro arcade classic today with simple yet effective gameplay.  You knock out your opponent by scoring 100 points to earn a KO.  This game came out years before the famous Mike Tyson's Punchout and was loved by a generation of Atari vide game fanatics in the early 80's who lived and breathed the old school sports titles.  This is sort of the grandfather to the fighting games like Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom.  I wouldn't count on seing a remake for the PS3, Wii or Xbox 360 any time soon (although the Wii has its own boxing game)\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, PS2, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360.
