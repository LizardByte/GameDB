Whether you enjoy burning foes with damage over time, launching shuriken shaped blasts, shooting 4 shots simultaneously in a cone, piercing through enemies or firing at hit-scan speeds, the Shop has your creativity covered. \nWith thousands of combinations, your choices matter in your spaceship's growth and will affect your experience moving forward at harder rounds. Purchase power in small increments each round, or save your points to large amounts to see the Shop offer some higher-level supreme upgrades. \n \n\u279c Features \n- Wide variety of starting spaceships each with their own benefits and traits \n- Randomized enemy spaceships with unique attack styles each round \n- Creative bosses with stimulating skills that'll challenge your dodging precision \n- An upgrade system that allows you to build upon your spaceship (power, size, speed, flame shots, homing shots, spread shots, and more!) \n- Global leaderboard with statistics and records of gameplay sessions from other players \n- Adaptive Shop system - dynamically displays upgrades relevant to your income and availability \n- Large range of background soundtracks to harmonize with your experience \n- Three difficulty modes (casual, normal, hard) to suit your skill level and time available", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ozone-guardian", "videos": [{"id": 41118, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aaUejtNiAno", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaUejtNiAno", "title": "Ozone Guardian \u2014 Official Trailer  |  PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aaUejtNiAno/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
