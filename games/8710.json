Although the engine is similar to Doom in most respects (2.5D maps, bitmap sprites instead of polygons, etc.), Marathon 2 distinguishes itself with such features such as a rudimentary inventory system, ambient sound, multiple fire modes for each weapon, allies who aid the player, enemies belonging to different factions which will attack each other, a more developed plot (gradually narrated to the player at various computer terminals scattered throughout the levels).\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of the game presents a revised HUD and provides support for both 4-player split-screen play on the same console and 8-player Xbox Live gameplay. This version also supports 16:9 screen resolutions, high-definition output at 60 frames per second (compared to the original 30) as well as upgraded models and graphics", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marathon-2-durandal", "videos": [{"id": 121151, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Hfh8XwuynBc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfh8XwuynBc", "title": "Marathon 2: Durandal PC Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hfh8XwuynBc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
