In general it follows the same rules as a console release: it's an American football \"simulator\" where you can choose a team from a vast roster corresponding with 2003 season, pick strategies from a number of offensive and defensive plays and then command your players on the field. Also you can take a look at some of the historical teams and games. But there are a few differences.\n\nThe first and most obvious one is graphics - the N-Gage game has a totally different graphical engine: instead of a fully 3D world, only the field is polygonal and sprites are used for the players models, thus making it more close to the sports games of the 90s. Secondly, Dynasty mode that lets you customize the team, build programs and recruit new members is absent, instead there are only quick play and season modes. Also, there's a one-on-one Bluetooth multiplayer and a bowl game called Nokia Sugar Bowl National Championship.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ncaa-football-2004--1", "videos": [{"id": 88501, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MJGxhQqKWfE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJGxhQqKWfE", "title": "FIFA Socker 2004, NCAA Football 2004 Nokia N-Gage Commercial (2003)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MJGxhQqKWfE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88502, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fUmB3jNJzMw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUmB3jNJzMw", "title": "NCAA Football 2004 N-Gage Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fUmB3jNJzMw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
