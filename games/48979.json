The object is to race laps around a muddy race track while trying to get first place. There are twenty tracks to race in; each with a timer that forces the player to race fast. There is an option to either do a single race or a multi-race tournament against a computer opponent or through a human playing while using the Game Boy link cable and another copy of the video game. Items in the background like electric lines and rocks help provide a road-like feeling to the races. \n \nIn a single-player race, the player will race to the finish line against a field of approximately nineteen other drivers.", "videos": [{"id": 46625, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Lt-tlLh6B1o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt-tlLh6B1o", "title": "Jeep Jamboree : Off Road Adventure sur Game Boy", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lt-tlLh6B1o/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
