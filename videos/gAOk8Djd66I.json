There are a total of over 20+ weapons for you to find, eight of them have upgrades. Upgradable weapons are your standard Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Assault Rifle, Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, Plasma Rifle, Railgun and BFG 9000. Upgrades for these weapons are various, ranging from additional ammunition type like slug rounds, napalm grenades, shrapnel shells to special abilities like Plasma Overcharge or completely new firemode like Beam Mode for Railgun. But you also must take into account that some of the most devastating weapons can... simply break when using. These weapons include Street Sweeper, Firestorm Chaingun, Arkh Heliacal and Meteorite Crossbow, as you can see this is a roster of the most powerful equipment.\n\nMy Discord - https://discord.gg/XPtgcUAJjt\nDusted Pandemonia - https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=60984\nMusic - UAC Atlantica Combat from DOOM Eternal Ancient Gods\nMaps - Doom II HellScape & Doom II Dark World\n\n0:00 DUAL MISSILE LAUNCHER\n0:33 DOUBLE CHAINSAW\n0:49 PISTOL\n1:05 LASER RIFLE\n1:31 PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN\n2:03 SUPER SHOTGUN\n2:33 ASSAULT SHOTGUN\n3:04 STREET SWEEPER\n3:33 ASSAULT RIFLE\n4:04 NAILGUN\n4:33 FIRESTORM CHAINGUN\n5:12 ROCKET LAUNCHER\n5:45 METEORITE CROSSBOW\n6:15 GRENADE LAUNCHER\n6:54 DARK MATTER LAUNCHER\n7:25 PLASMA RIFLE\n7:58 RAILGUN/BEAM RIFLE\n8:27 PLASMA REPEATER\n9:01 BFG 9000\n9:57 BFG 10000\n10:13 BLOOD SCEPTER WAND\n10:48 HELIACAL ARKH", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAOk8Djd66I/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAOk8Djd66I/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAOk8Djd66I/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAOk8Djd66I/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAOk8Djd66I/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DOOM DUSTED'S PANDEMONIA 2.1 All Weapons Showcase", "description": "Dusted's Pandemonia 2.1 Mod for DOOM created by Dusted Pandemonic, this gameplay modification not only has tons of weapons for Doomguy but also upgrades for them, items to pick up and lots of new monsters.
