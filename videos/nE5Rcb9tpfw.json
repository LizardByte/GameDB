{"id": "nE5Rcb9tpfw", "snippet": {"title": "Mighty Warriors [Arcade] - play as Cypher", "description": "This is a playthrough using Cypher in the Arcade game Mighty Warriors. Read on below for more information...\n\nCypher is the one and only end boss of the game. He is an unplayable character.\n\n===== ABOUT CYPHER =====\n\nIf you have a good eye, you'll notice that this guy is mostly a sprite edit of Sagat from Street Fighter II. I'm not sure exactly what he is, but he appears to be some sort of mystical Roman/Greek God character with a flaming skull as his head.\n\nDue to him being a non-playable character, it means that his special moves CANNOT be performed when under human control (at least to my knowledge). Only the CPU can perform his special moves. His CPU-only special moves include:\n\n---- A projectile move where he emits a white ghost/clone of himself that seems incomplete. Looks like the projectile glitches that occur when you used the Action Replay character swap tricks in SNES SFII.\n\n---- A teleport move where a bat/flame engulfs himself and reappears by un-engulfing himself in a different position. \n\n---- A transformation move where he is able to turn into any of the other characters. He can also turn back into himself and then turn into another different character and repeat. It's a lot like Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat 1. This move isn't the same as the Mutant ability that the regular characters can have.\n\n===== GAMEPLAY =====\n\nEven without his special moves, Cypher is a very good character to use against the CPU... his low fire projectile is actually a basic move which means that it can easily be repeated, and his jumping basics are the Dhalsim drills (probably a sprite edit of him too) which has a constant hitbox that can hit multiple times. He always fights unarmed.\n\n===== BUGS & GLITCHES =====\n\nSerious glitches and crashes can occur in a Cypher mirror match. The problems will start when CPU Cypher uses the Transformation move - when he does it, it confuses the game into making the player Cypher transform as well... this causes corruption and will most likely result in the game crashing. You can see this starting around 15:15 in the video. And a different type of crash starting around 16:21. \n\nAdditionally, when using Cypher against the other CPU characters, getting thrown can also glitch or crash the game.\n\n===== ADDITIONAL INFORMATION =====\n\n---- If you actually manage to defeat CPU Cypher (requires a lot of luck) with him, the game will crash as it tries to go into his \"ending\".\n\n---- He does not have a \"lose\" portrait. This is because normally in the game, there is no instance of him appearing as the loser on the winning/losing screen.\n\n===== ABOUT MIGHTY WARRIORS =====\n\nThis is a period fighting game using some known historical figures and stereotypes for it's characters. The game was released back in 1993, and is most likely another attempt to ride the waves that Capcom's Street Fighter II created.\n\nThe gameplay uses a 3-button attack system, and consists mainly of single strikes with very few combo abilities. Unique features include: \n\n1) A Mutant ability that allows you to transform into the second character you chose on the character select screen for a limited time\n\n2) Having armed and unarmed modes. You start off rounds armed, and the unarmed mode will come into place if the characters loses at least half of their lifebar.\n\nIf you have a good eye, you'll also notice that there are a lot of SFII sprite edits in this game.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nE5Rcb9tpfw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nE5Rcb9tpfw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nE5Rcb9tpfw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nE5Rcb9tpfw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nE5Rcb9tpfw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Mighty Warriors [Arcade] - play as Cypher", "description": "This is a playthrough using Cypher in the Arcade game Mighty Warriors.
