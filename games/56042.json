Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen along nine tracks, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the \"groove meter\" increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song. \n \nThis release is a straight port of the arcade version Mickey Tunes, and includes a selection of popular songs from Disney's vast catalog of animated films. The game itself is built off of pop'n music 4, and features the same selection of game modes."}
