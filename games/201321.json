The experience system was dropped, but the moveset still underwent a few changes. The elbow attack and turning jump kick are gone, but with the standard kick directed backwards they seemed a bit redundant anyway. There are two new ways to make enemies in a grapple suffer, elbow smashes to the head, and a high kick to propel them away. In the brief time window when the Lee brothers are crouching after a jump or after getting knocked down, it\u2019s possible to perform a rising uppercut or a knee jump attack. The timing for these isn\u2019t easy, but they are the most powerful moves in the game.\n\nOn the NES, Double Dragon II is a much more innovative and unique sequel than in the arcade, but it marks also the time Double Dragon started its schizophrenic shifting between wildly different tones and gameplay styles. In a way it\u2019s one of the best games to bear the Double Dragon name, but it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that Techn\u014ds had already started to loose a cohesive vision of what it meant to be Double Dragon, both in tone and in gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dragon-ii-the-revenge--1", "videos": [{"id": 133265, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LckHHdc6yKM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LckHHdc6yKM", "title": "Double Dragon II The Revenge / Nintendo Nes / 1989 / Technos - Acclaim", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LckHHdc6yKM/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 694, "name": "Double Dragon"}]}
