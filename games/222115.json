I should really double-check my sources.\n\nSeems like some guys blew it up by accident while they were playing 8-ball pool. There was a frog there too, but he was in the bathroom whilst it all happened. And it also turns out the pool balls are like voodoo-doll versions of the planets? How's that meant to work?
