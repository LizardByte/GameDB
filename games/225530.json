It is the Sequel to the popular Football I game. It adds the functionality of running forward and backward, passing, etc (and actually has a 10 yard playing field, not 9 like Football I). This game also has an 'Easter Egg' of sorts, if you hold down the 'Pass' button while turning on the game, you effectively get Pro 3 or Pro 4 difficulty settings for the game play (i.e., if you have the switch on Pro 1, holding down the pass will give you Pro 3, etc. Pro 4 is VERY fast and difficult to play.)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/football-2"}
