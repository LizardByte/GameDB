Over the course of the evening you will wander the Arcadia Botanical Gardens' various rooms and eavesdrop on the other distinguished guests whose stories and dramas play out in a repeating cycle.\n\nThe Gardens claim to recreate the natural world of \"prelaunch\" Earth, a world no one has experienced in thousands of years. The game explores humanity's relationship to nature under capitalism, speculating on what \"nature\" would look when completely constructed by humans, and prompting the question of how close we may already be to such a reality.", "summary": "An experiential narrative game about people, plants, and interplanetary capitalism.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
