It's not always what you know as much as who you know, so time spent in Studio Town schmoozing industry insiders and fellow wannabes is well spent.\n\nSims now have a five-star meter that fills, half a star at a time, as they gain publicity and popularity among the masses. Studio Town is the place for superstars to be seen, and Sims can increase their star ratings with good routines there. While on stage or in the recording studio, the goal is to give the NPC directors the kinds of performances they want. Players can directly affect their characters' routines. They can choose the genre of music to be recorded in the studio, for example, and decide on the singing style for each part of a song.\n\nSuccess in the entertainment industry is the ticket to it all: money, fame, friends - as well as gaping groupies, persistent paparazzi, and perhaps even a star-struck stalker or two. For those Sims who might rather live the life of a celebrity without actually becoming one, The Sims: Superstar adds dozens of new objects that can be purchased for use in any home that can afford them. How about a state-of-the-art satellite dish that adds premium TV channels, or a fully operational skydiving simulator? Opulent new furniture and artwork selections are available, so spoiled Sims can \"flaunt it\" to anyone who might stop by for a visit. A new domestic staff is available to manage mundane chores, so that talented (or at least affluent) Sims might answer a higher calling.", "summary": "The Sims: Superstar is the sixth expansion pack for The Sims, allowing players to guide Sims to fame. For the first time, players can follow their Sims to work as they pursue careers as Rock Stars, Movie Stars, or Supermodels in the new, customizable Studio Town area. New work and leisure items are included, and in addition to the ratings for relationships and skills, players can now track the fame score ratings of their characters.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sims-superstar", "videos": [{"id": 52899, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IaSmm67NEtY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSmm67NEtY", "title": "The Sims Superstar Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IaSmm67NEtY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 52900, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "U_rUsbaGANU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_rUsbaGANU", "title": "The Sims Superstar commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U_rUsbaGANU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
