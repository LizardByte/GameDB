Similarly to the previous Doomworld Mega Project 2012, it accepted any and all maps for Doom II regardless of engine used, theme, content, or quality; in this edition, the only limitations were that the maps could not use MAP07 or MAP30 slots or secret level exits, and could not be potentially damaging to the user (e.g. by using scripts to change port settings, or using zip bombs).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doomworld-mega-project-2013"}
