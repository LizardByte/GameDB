The tour mostly consists of roaming the streets of the town and examining various buildings, presented as real-life still photographs. The player can occasionally interact with the town's inhabitants, as well as visit a saloon and order a drink. The player will also have the opportunity to practice quick-draw technique with a revolver when attacked by hostile characters; these exercises are done with a simple point-and-click interface, in a mini-game-like fashion. The educational elements consist of information about the life of the famous 19th century gunslinger Wyatt Earp, as well as testing the player's knowledge in the game of Old West Trivia.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wyatt-earps-old-west"}
