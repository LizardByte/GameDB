Play with your friends as a goblin, the underdog of all fairy tales. Adventure the dangerous yet beautiful world, grow your hive, craft items and weapons from your scavenged scraps, and vanquish your foes.\n\n- Cooperative gameplay -\nWork together with your friends to steal.. we mean.. umm.. gather resources, hide from.. we mean fight enemies, contribute, and bring glory for your hive!\n\n- Steal, Gather, and Craft -\nGather resources from the world and loot from your enemies. Choose what items you contribute to your hive and what you keep for yourself (you are a selfish goblin after all..) Craft equipment to help you and your team explore, gather rare materials and battle fierce enemies. Earn and discover new recipes as you go.\n\n- Choose your battles -\nYou will encounter both lowly creatures and difficult bosses out in the world. Sneak around and choose your battles. If you die, your hive will have a new goblin waiting for you, but you will lose your equipment and inventory. You can always gather your team and go find your old equipment. It might be hidden, it might be scavenged by the enemy, but it will be somewhere in the world.\n\n- Equipment based abilities & classes -\nAll goblins are weak in the beginning, but lucky for you, that means you can try to fill any role you want! Pick your equipment according to your team's needs. Try out different playstyles to find out what works the best. Cast, sprint, sneak, hit, dodge, shoot and stun your way through your enemies.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QkI-_m7_6dY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QkI-_m7_6dY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QkI-_m7_6dY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QkI-_m7_6dY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QkI-_m7_6dY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Goblin's Die Trailer - Alpha Playtest 2", "description": "Goblin's Die Alpha Playtest 2 live on Steam.
