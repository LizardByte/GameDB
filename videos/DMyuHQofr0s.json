Owing to its limited print run, it's an exceedingly rare title, and that fact is well illustrated by the sums the game has commanded on the second-hand market over the past few decades.\n\nThe prince of darkness has invaded the kingdom, and only the four who hold the magic bells have the power to stop him. This crew of would-be saviors includes Samson (a boy who throws bells and can scale walls and ceilings), Kikira (a dragon who can spit fire, hover, and walk on ice), Gamm (a golem who can walk on spikes), and K.O. (a mouse who can scale walls and ceilings, drop bombs, and fit through tight passageways). \n\nAfter completing an initial set of four stages meant to introduce you to the heroes' unique abilities, the true quest begins. All four characters become available and can be swapped out on the fly, and this freedom to choose forms the crux of the gameplay moving forward. The stage designs are straightforward, but their challenges are all carefully designed to force you to mix up your use of abilities, and in most situations, there are multiple viable approaches. \n\nIn spirit, it feels a lot like a linear take on Sunsoft's Ufouria (https://youtu.be/IL8sVFJipHE), and it's not far off of that mark in terms of quality. The music is a bit forgettable, but the snappy controls are intuitive and feel good, the difficulty level is reasonable, and the graphics put on an excellent 8-bit show. If you enjoy NES platformers, Little Samson is an easy recommendation.\n\n(It's not what you'd expect from the guys who made Nostalgia 1907, that's for sure!)\n_____________\r\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \r\n\r\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMyuHQofr0s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMyuHQofr0s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMyuHQofr0s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMyuHQofr0s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMyuHQofr0s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Little Samson (NES) Playthrough", "description": "A playthrough of Taito's 1992 platformer for the NES, Little Samson.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I went back to show the alternate stage that can be accessed from the waterfall area (54:00), and you can see the easy mode ending at 57:00.\n\nCreated by Japanese developer Takeru, Little Samson is a little known action-platformer that saw a 1992 release in Japan (under the name Seirei Densetsu Lickle) and North America, and it came to Europe in early 1993.
