One of sega\u2019s super scaler games like Afterburner and Space harrier but a lot more demanding couldn't have been expected to transfer well on to 8 bit systems although the Master System version wasn't too bad.  But here it is, brought to us by the same developer that did the Altered Beast conversion.\n\nIt starts off pretty promising at the title screen and then we get in game.  Surprisingly ingame music that changes with each level.  Then the super blocky almost spectrum style graphs start.  You fly around trying to shoot any oncoming enemies with your automatic laser.  With the press of the fire button you can also launch missiles if you have auto locked onto an enemy.  If you run out of missiles you will burn precious energy so best not fire them willy nilly. Make good use of the laser to kill as much as possible as you do need every energy bonus you can get at the end of each level.  Your energy reserve must last the entire 6 levels.\n\nYou can speed up and slow down but I found leaving it balanced was the best strategy. Stay at low speed to long and you will waste precious time burning up energy. Go to fast and you will not be able to kill enough for a good bonus at the end of the level.  You don't really get upgrades in this conversion and is kind of auto dropped on you although I didn't notice that they did anything while playing.  The Bosses/fortresses are pretty much killed in a single hit.   The game looks quite short, but it took me many tries to get the energy balance correct, id say the game is near impossible unless you everything goes to plan during play. Although not shown, you do lose bits of your ship when shield are gone and you start taking damage.\n\nThe Spectrum version is another version that shouldn't exist but it almost seems like a reskin of Afterburner with Galaxy Force graphics.\n\n00:00:00 Title Music\n00:01:55 Gameplay Starts Here! -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qb8mcFnMY9M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qb8mcFnMY9M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qb8mcFnMY9M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qb8mcFnMY9M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Commodore 64 Longplay [053] Galaxy Force II (EU)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nGalaxy Force II developed by Software Studios and published by Activision in 1989\n\nGalaxy Force II for the Commodore 64 is an Arcade conversion that probably shouldn't have been made or even attempted!
