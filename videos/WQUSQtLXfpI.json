Inspired by the magic of real-world celebrations like Mardi Gras, the Carnival of Venice, Burgundian Carnival and more. This parade tycoon lets you craft your own spectacular parades. You have limited time & resources and you will compete against others in single or multiplayer. The game provides many options and you can unlock new features in different modes by winning; you start simple at first but as you progress you create bigger and more complex parade floats. The idea arose from the Covid situation when parades around the world were cancelled. That's why I decided to develop a way to virtually build your very own parade float and (re)experience the parade.\n\nI took inspiration from other tycoon games and local cultures around the world and transformed it into a game. Think of Mardi Gras, Carnival of Venice, Burgundian Carnival (Brabant), Limburgish Carnival and more. The languages spoken in these cultures are therefore supported by the game. Even if you are not familiar with Carnival, you may still enjoy the game's relaxed atmosphere and tycoon aspects.\n\nMore information will follow, see you then!! \ud83c\udf8a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic: William Tell Overture [Orchestral Version] by Alexander Nakarada\nFree download: https://filmmusic.io/song/8996-william-tell-overture-orchestral-version\nLicensed under CC BY 4.0: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Building Phase\n00:09 Parade Phase\n00:27 More Features\n00:37 Outro", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQUSQtLXfpI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQUSQtLXfpI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQUSQtLXfpI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQUSQtLXfpI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WQUSQtLXfpI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Carnaval Simulator Trailer", "description": "Wishlist today on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2659710/Carnaval_Simulator/\n\nCarnaval Simulator is an indie Steam game where you build, design and manage stunning parade floats.
