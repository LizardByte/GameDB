Enjoy!\n\nJoin Pajama Sam, the world's youngest superhero!\n...as he journeys to World Wide Weather, the storm-stirring factory in the sky!\n\nDuring a scary thunderstorm, Pajama Sam journeys through his attic and up into the clouds to a massive weather-manufacturing facility called World Wide Weather. While confronting a surprisingly kind Thunder and Lightning at the facility's control room, Sam accidentally causes a major malfunction and so is tasked with retrieving several missing important parts, before the CEO and president of WWW, Mother Nature, an onion, finds out. The side objective of this game is to find all of the missing puzzle pieces, which will form an amusing picture when they are all collected.\n\nThis game employs multiple scenarios to play. Each of the four weather machine parts can be found in one of two locations which are completely random, although the player can now choose from several combination of scenarios to play with at the options screen.\n\n------------------------\n\nWatch more of this!\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/G77T6_RH0L4\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/r4XAW0GJZiw\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/oGE1LiqIPFQ\nPart 4: https://youtu.be/ceoru_NlkUA\nPart 5: https://youtu.be/oeYonoFtVzA\nPart 6: https://youtu.be/b8bvQI0wiK4\nPart 7: https://youtu.be/gzRqFqF8rew\nPart 8: https://youtu.be/u1VoXoCU2cE\nPart 9: https://youtu.be/qpriRDgA-Tw\nPart 10: https://youtu.be/yGsK43uHRB8\nPart 11: https://youtu.be/bubt2EOsDjc\nPart 12: https://youtu.be/N08hjNhh7Bw\nPart 13: https://youtu.be/KDhgh6xx-i8\nPart 14: https://youtu.be/qTnZ6f_OrkM\nPart 15: https://youtu.be/_0LAie2Aoo0\nPart 16: https://youtu.be/9ybofSnp0Wg\nPart 17: https://youtu.be/ShgKjtPsVHI\nPart 18: https://youtu.be/XCZOHC3_rO8\nPart 19:  https://youtu.be/_Jdf2ByTCsQ\nPart 20: https://youtu.be/1lP01S0cZjM\nLongplay: https://youtu.be/HnBp7fd0KvU", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnBp7fd0KvU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnBp7fd0KvU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HnBp7fd0KvU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening - Full Gameplay/Walkthrough (Longplay)", "description": "Watch the full gameplay/walkthrough of Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening - All Parts!
