Their only hope of survival is by learning to co-exist.\n\nPossessor(s) takes place across the interconnected sprawl of a destroyed mega-city, from collapsed skyscrapers to an abandoned aquarium, all riddled with secrets. Hauntingly beautiful 3D environments form a stunning backdrop over which hand-drawn and animated characters, and mysterious sci-fi horror action take center stage.\n\nChoose multiple paths in an open-ended world structure as you look to uncover the truth behind the catastrophe. Meet a cast of engaging characters, each with their own heart-breaking story to follow in the aftermath of the devastation.\n\nGameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise, combat. Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses. Find and unlock a wide array of powerful weapons and upgrades to bolster your arsenal and explore previously inaccessible areas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/possessor-s", "videos": [{"id": 134436, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "eFd32M4-muA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd32M4-muA", "title": "Possessor(s) | Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFd32M4-muA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
