Waking up in an unfamiliar room and no memories to boot, he wanders around the rather abandoned facility in hopes to regain his memories. Before he can even leave the room, he crashes into a mysterious girl that insists on him not leaving, and consequently decides to follow him when he refuses to listen to her. Play as Zai and help him regain his memories, for better or worse."}
