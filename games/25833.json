For example, the first case, \"Safecracker Suite,\" requires you to locate the gun used in a crime and have it verified at the gun store, then locate stolen money and return it to the bank and then capture Henri Le Fiend and turn him into the police station. You have only a limited amount of time before the statute of limitations runs out and Henri Le Fiend gets away.\n\nHindering your investigation are a number of obstacles, including potholes, falling objects, unfriendly animals, and knife-throwing thugs, to name a few.\n\nYou drive around the city in your modified 1935 Model A, which can jump as high as two stories. It can also make 90 and 180 degree turns on a dime. When you make the car jump, you also launch yourself out of it, enabling you to nab suspects in upper story windows.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/private-eye--1", "videos": [{"id": 115508, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "55S4PJpJ59c"}]}
