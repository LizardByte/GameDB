But as it often happens in video games, something goes wrong: the young and reckless Petka accidentally teleports the ship into the future, namely 1969. The ship collides with Hugh Hefner's motorboat. Chapaev is unconscious, and Petka realizes that the future once again depends only on him...\n\nLike the previous games in the series, Zoloto Partii (\"The Gold of the Party\") is a puzzle-solving adventure, mainly focusing on inventory-based puzzles. Graphically, it follows the template introduced in the previous game. The title and the setting are an obvious parody on James Bond; but the game also pays homage to Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail, also the seventh installment in the famous humorous adventure game series; like Love for Sail, it is set on a ship, and revolves around \"pleasing\" young sexy women.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/petka-007-zoloto-partii", "videos": [{"id": 15181, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "13OFKUt08uo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13OFKUt08uo", "title": "\u041f\u0435\u0442\u044c\u043a\u0430 007: \u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0438", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13OFKUt08uo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
