Each of the themes have unique hazards like bridges, crossing trains, oil wells, cyclones, snowmen and killer plants.\n\nIn each race the goal is to leave your opponents far behind so they go off screen. You can by pushing them off bridges or into hazards. When there is one player left, that player wins and all other players return to start again from that point. Each time credits are awarded depending on how long each player lasted on screen. Lose all credits and you're out of the game, last man standing wins the race.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 81982, "video_id": "6LIaf87UR4c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LIaf87UR4c", "title": "Motor Mash | Trailer [GOG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6LIaf87UR4c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
