Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?\" The Bad Dudes pursue the Dragon Ninja through the New York City streets, onto a moving big rig truck, through a large storm sewer, through a forest, onto a freight train on an old Southern Pacific line (where the titular character of another Data East arcade game, Chelnov, can be seen being transported in a frozen container in the arcade version), through a cave, and into an underground factory in order to save President Ronnie.", "summary": "Bad Dudes, are you bad enough?!\n\"Rampant ninja related crimes these days...
