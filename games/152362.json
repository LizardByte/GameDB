Link sets out to destroy all eight dragons and reassemble the Triforce to free Zelda from the dragons' dungeon. Once Link defeats the last dragon, he reassembles the Triforce and frees Zelda from her prison.", "summary": "Zelda is a multiscreen Game & Watch game that was only released in English as a stand-alone system pre-loaded with the single game. It has dual screens which fold in a clamshell design, similar to the Nintendo DS. It was re-released as part of the Nintendo Mini Classics line in 1998 and 2007. The complete game can also be unlocked in Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance and Wii U Virtual Console.\n\nIts core formula is based on that of the original The Legend of Zelda, where Link must fight through eight dungeons and obtain the eight shards of the Triforce of Wisdom. However, it bears more gameplay similarities to The Adventure of Link, since it is 2D and from a side-on perspective. The game features an original, though minimal storyline.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zelda--1", "videos": [{"id": 51135, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GkTD_JTxUKw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkTD_JTxUKw", "title": "Game & Watch: Zelda (1989 Nintendo)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GkTD_JTxUKw/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 71208, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "h0dksTCKDok", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0dksTCKDok", "title": "Game & Watch - Zelda (c)1989 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h0dksTCKDok/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
