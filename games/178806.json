In this tiny fantasy experience, that is easy to do and very relaxing, just like a 3D jigsaw puzzle. Carefully observe the island, try to memorize it, then shuffle the blocks. Swap blocks to reproduce the desired island and it will compose the archipelago. There is no time limit, no logic challenges, nor resources to manage, so you can calmly just focus on the core mechanics while listening to a soothing soundtrack.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/island-farmer"}
