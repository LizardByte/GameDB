The game utilizes a third-person view. Murphy can only carry one firearm and one melee weapon. Murphy's weapons will gradually deteriorate and break.

Periodically, rainfall will occur, which increases monsters' spawning and ferocity; the player can attempt to fight or run away and hide in a nearby building.
