{"id": "btUQXH0WBjo", "snippet": {"title": "Paper Mario: Master Quest - Huff n Puff EX", "description": "Pretty tough, grind it out kind of battle here. Probably could've been better planned in advance but this was an on the fly fight for me. The key is knowing Huff n Puff's attack pattern, as it is a fixed pattern, and knowing when he will suck in all the Tuff Puffs to heal. That way you'll know what turns you can attack, what turns you can heal, and to stall him out in general. One of his gimmicks in this fight is that he'll go invisible if you Outta Sight. This isn't a problem since you can Star Beam on the turn he would suck up Tuff Puffs anyway and avoid a turn of significant damage. His wind attack can now shrink you, it's tough to block (I managed to block it, miraculously), but I generally use the turns where Mario's shrunk to charge up his next Power Bounce, Focus, and heal if needed. When his HP is low he'll attack the same turn he charges, so you'll need to make sure to avoid that in advance. He also attacks the same turn he charges if you're in Danger at the time he dodges, this is a mechanic in Master Quest known as an \"Anti-danger move\", preventing you from getting into Danger and abusing the Danger Badges.\n\nFinally, if you bring any Life Shrooms to the fight, you will lose them on the turn the Tuff Puffs attack. This tactic was added into Master Quest since the Life Shrooms can severely break the Huff n Puff fight (in the original Paper Mario, if you were killed by the Tuff Puffs and resurrected by a Life Shroom, the attack sequence would break and Huff n Puff would not attack, so you could use that strategy to avoid Huff n Puff's attacks altogether).\n\nWhile these fights can be frustrating, a lot of the frustration can be mitigated since Paper Mario's soundtrack is so awesome, especially the boss fights.\n\nAlright, I'll shut up now.
