The Underground has smuggled a bomb into a closet inside the Fuehrer's Berlin Bunker. Now it's up to you to move it to a secret conference room, set the timer... and escape. And that won't be easy. The bunker is crawling with elite stormtroopers. Any one of them will trip the alarm at the least suspicion of trouble. But you're not worried. You're ready for whatever it takes to win this war. You're ready to go Beyond Castle Wolfenstein.", "summary": "Like its predecessor, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein is a combination action and adventure game. It is set in World War II during Adolf Hitler's rule as Chancellor of Germany. The objective of the game is to traverse all the levels of the secret Berlin bunker where the F\u00fchrer is holding secret meetings with his senior staff. The player must retrieve a bomb that the operatives have placed inside the bunker and place it outside the door of the room where Hitler is holding his meeting, a scenario bearing a passing resemblance to the July 20 plot.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beyond-castle-wolfenstein", "videos": [{"id": 34402, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NCz8L63vhOY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCz8L63vhOY", "title": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 Beyond Castle Wolfenstein", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NCz8L63vhOY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
