Arguably the lowest point of the series, although the SFC game certainly gives it a run for its money.\n\nNot terrible by any stretch, but several issues bring down what could've been a respectable entry in the series. The auto-centering is usually brought up, although that can at least be somewhat alleviated by lightly depressing the joystick. The poor pacing, and the fact that Cotton's backside obscures your view of everything directly in front of you, can not be alleviated. The default ROF is abysmal, forcing you to mash like a madman. I leave in the later cutscenes in this vid for the sole purpose of letting my hands recuperate! Also, the penalty for continuing is severe; unless you're playing on Easy, your EXP gets cut in half. If you die once too often on the final boss, you'll simply be too underpowered to stand a chance.\n\nIn spite of all these flaws, Rainbow Cotton may still be of interest to Dreamcast fans, given it's neither an arcade port, nor has a superior re-release on later consoles. How many noteworthy Dreamcast titles can you say that about?\n\nP.S. I hadn't played this one in a good couple of years, so I was a little rusty. Couldn't quite squeak out the 1 life clear...", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S23oPUiEqUo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S23oPUiEqUo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S23oPUiEqUo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S23oPUiEqUo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "[Sega Dreamcast] Rainbow Cotton (Longplay)", "description": "The much-maligned swan song of the Cotton series.
