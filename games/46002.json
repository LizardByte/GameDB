Basketball teams play in gruelling league matches where new players are bought and sold. Within this future, basketball uses a dedicated robot to perform the toss up at the start of each match as referees had been fired by Bill Laimbeer sometime prior to the year 2030. As a result, players now wear armor to their games and weapons are thrown from the audience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bill-laimbeers-combat-basketball", "videos": [{"id": 30682, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "kBZjf96WbGQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBZjf96WbGQ", "title": "Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball - Long Play (SNES)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kBZjf96WbGQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
