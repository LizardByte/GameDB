The player scrolls over a 3-dimensional wireframe city, looking for active fires. The player needs to position the copter over the center of the fire to spray water cannons to put out the fire. In addition, fire starting androids are present throughout the city, which need to be shot with the copter's laser cannons. The player receives points for fires put out and androids destroyed. As fire spreads, the city is in critical danger, and the player loses a life when too much of the city is engulfed in flame. The player has a total of 3 lives, and when all are lost it's game over. The fire has been quelled at the start of each life, and the city begins to burn anew.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-copter"}
