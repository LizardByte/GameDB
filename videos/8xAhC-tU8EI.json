{"id": "8xAhC-tU8EI", "snippet": {"title": "Ye Olde Games: Kosmonaut", "description": "Kosmonaut was developed by Bluemoon Interactive and released in 1990.  It is also the precursor to SkyRoads.\n\nKosmonaut is more or less the same game as SkyRoads, but running on an EGA pallet with nothing but the PC speaker for audio.  The controls remain the same.  The gameplay itself is mostly unchanged with a few exceptions.  The car is unable to land on the raised blocks without crashing, and collision itself seems to be a bit iffy.  If the edge of the car clips the wall while starting to pass a block or go into a tunnel, it crashes instead of getting bumped to the side like in SkyRoads.  If you enjoy this type of game, then SkyRoads is clearly the better version to grab, but Kosmonaut itself is good for a look at where it came from, and is a solid game on its own.\n\nBoth Kosmonaut and SkyRoads can be downloaded for free from Bluemoon's website: http://www.bluemoon.ee/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xAhC-tU8EI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xAhC-tU8EI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xAhC-tU8EI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xAhC-tU8EI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xAhC-tU8EI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ye Olde Games: Kosmonaut", "description": "Kosmonaut was developed by Bluemoon Interactive and released in 1990.
