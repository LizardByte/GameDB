Each decade is represented by a different stage set, which is based on the TV set of that era.\n\nIn the show, 100 people have been surveyed on different subjects and their answers have been collected. It's up to the two families who battle each other to guess what the top survey answers were for every question; the family with the most points wins.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/family-feud-decades"}
