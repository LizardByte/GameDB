Celeste Classic on Playdate was made to be as faithful as possible to the original game on PICO-8. But here are a few notable changes:\n\nThe game is in black and white only. A lot of visual elements have an outline to make them more readable. But this does not impact their original hitbox.\n\nThe game is rendered at 256\u00d7240 from the original 128\u00d7128. Four pixel lines are cropped at the top and bottom of the screen. The game can be played at its original resolution by disabling the Fullscreen option available in the game\u2019s menu.\n\nAssist mode is available under the game\u2019s menu. This allows players to skip a level, change the game speed to 0.5\u00d7, get infinite dashes, and enable invincibility. If assist mode is used during a run, a mention is added on each level in the lower right corner, as well as in the pause screen and the final score screen.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/celeste-classic--2"}
