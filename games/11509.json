The prologue is linear: the player has to survive the conflict between the Tyi (technology) and the Genides (biology). He handles missions for both factions and once he reaches level 6 he has to decide which side he wants to support in the future. Then the game becomes more open without story progression. In friendly space stations the player can accept missions which mostly result in grinding: killing a certain amount of enemies, scanning a certain amount of planets or flying to checkpoints. Most of those quests are in instances, i.e. in a especially loaded sector without other players, but there are also PvP and group missions for up to four players.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/black-prophecy"}
