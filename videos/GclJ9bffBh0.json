Inspired by the demanding gameplay of 8-bit action/platformers, Oniken pits your agility and swordplay against a gauntlet of enemies, traps, and challenging bosses.\n\nOdallus: The Dark Call is an exploration and action game, as well as a loving homage to 8-bit genre classics. You will play as Haggis \u2013 a battle-weary warrior who must wield his sword once more to rescue his son from Darkness.
