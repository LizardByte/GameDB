The player is given two minutes to fire an unlimited number of Kirbys, and he/she is given control of the power put into each shot. Ten points are awarded whenever a Kirby lands in a pocket. If a shot lands directly atop the big Kirby in the center, the player will temporarily win a chance to earn more points; the big Kirby will raise his arms and give 100 points to each shot that hits him in one of three locations. When time is up, the game ends.\n\nLike every other sub-game in Kirby's Toy Box, this game could only be downloaded by the Satellaview during the brief period it was broadcast.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kirby-no-omochabako-pachinko", "collections": [{"id": 7008, "name": "Kirby no Omochabako"}]}
