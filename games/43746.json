The arcade version was released in 1999, followed by the Sony PlayStation version in 2001. An updated \"Internet Ranking\" version of the arcade machine was released later on, containing 6 new tracks (as advertised by a sticker on the game's name banner).\n\nTo date, Dancing Stage EuroMIX is one of only two European home versions of the Dancing Stage franchise to coincide with an arcade game, the 2nd one being Dancing Stage Supernova.\n\nThe game is based on the same interface and engine as the Japanese game Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix, except with a songlist that is a cut-down hybrid of Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix and Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix's songlists, with the addition of 8 European-exclusive songs (28 tracks and can be expanded to a total of 34 tracks with Internet Ranking enabled). Unlike Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix, the home version of Dancing Stage EuroMIX does not feature \"Edit Mode\" and does not use a PC Card., a feature in which the player can create their own custom routines to songs featured in the game. This also means that the arcade version does not feature PlayStation-compatible memory card slots. The game's console port was released for PlayStation on June 1, 2001 and contains 24 songs. It removes the Dancemania licenses and all but one song added in the Internet Ranking version, but adds five Konami Original songs.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dancing-stage-euromix", "videos": [{"id": 128046, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ALbzolO9dF4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALbzolO9dF4", "title": "Polymega Gameplays - Dancing Stage Euromix [PlayStation - PAL]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ALbzolO9dF4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
