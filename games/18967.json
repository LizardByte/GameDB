The economies of both powers depend on a precious multipurpose mineral called Ragnite. Its growing scarcity results in the Empire declaring war on the Federation, sparking the Second Europan War. The Empire uses its military superiority to quickly put the Federation on the defensive. Emboldened by their progress and momentum, the Empire decides to invade the neutral Principality of Gallia in order to seize its rich Ragnite deposits.\n\nWhen Imperial forces launch an attack on the Gallian border town of Bruhl, Welkin Gunther, son of late Gallian national hero General Belgen Gunther, is forced to fight for his life alongside the town watch captain, Alicia Melchiott. Together with Welkin's adopted sister Isara and using Belgen's prototype tank from the first war, the Edelweiss, they escape to Gallia's capital, Randgriz, and subsequently join the country's militia forces. Welkin is given the rank of lieutenant and assumes command of the newly-formed Squad 7, with Alicia acting as his non-commissioned officer. Initially, members of the squad question Welkin's qualifications due to a lack of combat experience; however, he quickly earns their trust and loyalty with his tactical genius. Welkin and Alicia soon become romantically engaged.", "summary": "Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 in 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on November 11, 2014. A remastered version for PlayStation 4 was released in Japan on February 10, 2016 with a Western release planned for May 2016. Both PC and PS4 versions include previously released DLC.\n\nThe game is set in fictional Europa, loosely based on Europe during the early years of World War II. Because of its abundance of Ragnite ore, which takes the place of petroleum in the game setting, the neutral nation of Gallia comes under attack from the East Europan Imperial Alliance, which is itself engaged in war with the Atlantic Federation. Players take control of a unit of the Gallian Militia, dedicated to repelling the invasion. The game's visuals, which use Sega's CANVAS graphics engine, resemble pencil drawn paintings in motion.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/valkyria-chronicles-remastered", "videos": [{"id": 7975, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "tcqUN-fqPFE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcqUN-fqPFE", "title": "Prepare for War in Valkyria Chronicles Remastered", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tcqUN-fqPFE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 7983, "name": "Story Trailer", "video_id": "VWzqRKeQvdc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWzqRKeQvdc", "title": "Valkyria Chronicles Remastered Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VWzqRKeQvdc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40478, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "l8KlNhp6ko8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8KlNhp6ko8", "title": "Valkyria Chronicles Remastered - Launch Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l8KlNhp6ko8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
