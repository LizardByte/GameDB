Set taxes and policies and implement smart city technologies. Generate a sustainable city and take care of your citizens.\n\nStart by creating a few roads and specify zones where your citizens can start building their homes, shops and companies. Once everything runs fine, your can start expanding your city. Extend it by providing public transport for your citizens and implement policies. Ensure everything is taken care for: Pollution, noise, crime, waste, water, energy and so on. Your assistant will help you by guiding your through the process of doing all this easily.\n\nThe game is running in real-time, but can be accelerated and paused at any time. Manage policies, track financial data, analyze problems in your city. Expand the city when you have figured out how everything works and manage the public transport system, and build new infrastructure buildings, stations, rails, hypertube tracks, bridges, or even space ports.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smart-city-plan", "videos": [{"id": 29824, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EGRTmy6Otus", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGRTmy6Otus", "title": "Smart City Plan - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EGRTmy6Otus/sddefault.jpg"}]}
