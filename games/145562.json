Each die has its own role, depending on the value rolled on it (for example: shooting ship lasers, restoring shields, repairing the hull, healing wounded dice, etc.). You need to hold out under the onslaught of constantly arriving threats in order to successfully complete the flight. These threats can be external (pirate ships, asteroid fields, nebulae) and internal (boarding, spatial anomalies and even alien parasites!). You'll collect coins completing missions, which will allow to pay mercenary services to correct critical situations in your favor. At the end of each mission, you will have a fight with bosses with unique features.", "summary": "Dee-6: Dice Defenders is a game about survival in space travel, about the fight against internal and external threats, about the distribution of the power of the dice-team and, of course, about luck!", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dee-6-dice-defenders", "videos": [{"id": 47685, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "XP2LQbnaFlE"}]}
