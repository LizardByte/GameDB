It is in fact a stand-alone expansion pack of IL-2 Sturmovik. \n \nPacific Fighters focuses on the Pacific theater, with theater-appropriate aircraft, as well as aircraft carriers and battleships. The game gives the player 74 flyable aircraft, including variants. It has two types of missions that can be flown, \"dogfights\" or \"cooperative campaign\" modes. In either type, the player can play as either Allied or Axis forces, and the type of aircraft flown usually depends on the mission picked. The game also features a mission editor, allowing the player to make their own missions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
