As is typical of this kind of game, arrows appear rhythmically on screen and the player must hit the corresponding button in time with these arrows and the music, points are awarded for accuracy.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels. Easy, which uses four direction arrows; Medium and Expert both use eight direction arrows. In addition to the standard dance contest, the game has a workout mode which, when given the player's weight, calculates the projected calories burned during a dance. There's also a 'recorder' mode where the player can create their own dance routines.\n\nThe basic game is for a single player, but with two dance mats connected the game supports a multiplayer mode for up to eight players.", "videos": [{"id": 67683, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "L_moMBDzZlw"}]}
