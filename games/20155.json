In single player mode, Winter Stars offers a campaign full of variety that allows players to experience all aspects of an athlete's career. Winter Stars is a breath of fresh air for the genre, enabling sports fans of all ages and abilities to compete with one another or against virtual opponents in no less than eleven disciplines: snowmobiling, bobsledding, downhill skiing, figure skating, biathlon, free ride skiing, snowboard cross, ski jumping, paraskiing, curling, and short-track. In thrilling multiplayer action, up to four players can engage in dynamic online or offline competitions for championship titles, or simply enjoy the variety of winter sports themed mini-games on offer. The story-driven single player mode not only features an extensive career system and character development, but also a number of special challenges such as training sessions that provide arcade-style enjoyment in between events. Console athletes can use the experience points they earn to purchase new equipment and improve their skills in preparation for the diverse challenges ahead, and to support their team on its path to victory.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/winter-stars", "videos": [{"id": 78835, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "k3ikxnYbqaY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3ikxnYbqaY", "title": "Winter Stars (PlayStation 3) Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k3ikxnYbqaY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
