It was developed as an experiment, to answer the question: 'can you make dread a place?'. It is inspired by titles such as P.T. and indie developer Kittyhorrorshow's game Anatomy. It also draws inspiration from Davey Wreden's The Beginner's Guide. The retro, low-res aesthetic of the game is inspired by the work of Finnish indie developer 98DEMAKE, who was kind enough to get in touch during development.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rot--1", "videos": [{"id": 81820, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7imx97U8gcQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7imx97U8gcQ", "title": "Rot Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7imx97U8gcQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
