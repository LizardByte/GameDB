From the makers of Smash Cops \u2013 crash through America in the craziest road race to hit the App Store.\nPower up to faster cars, get the edge with getaway gadgets and outrun the cops as you speed to the state line.\n\nWell, almost. Whichever route you take through an ever-changing world of dirt tracks and dusty logging towns you can crash and bash your way through smashable scenery in the most intense display of destruction you have ever seen.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re always ahead of the game (and the cops) with cool car upgrades. Start with a puny compact and make it awesome with extra speed, handling and strength. And when you start earning big, you might just get your hands on the fastest road car on the planet, the stunning Hennessey Venom GT.\n\nWhat crazy road race would be complete without a TV chopper hovering overhead? The further you get and the more you smash, the bigger the TV ratings and the more cash you earn. Play against your Facebook and Game Center friends to see who can become the most famous Bandit on network TV.\n\nBefore you head off you get to choose something to help you along the way. Stinger-proof tires, the 'Stunner' car taser and even a tank are available to give you the edge over the relentless Sheriff McBride and his deputies.\n\nInnovative one-finger control makes it super easy to drive, drift & spin your car, and unleash those helpful gadgets - no matter where you\u2019re playing.\n\nThe Smash Bandits race organisers don\u2019t think that simply out-running the cops is a big enough problem, so they\u2019ve put together over 100 challenges where you can test your driving skills to the limit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smash-bandits-racing"}
