Your family fears that you'll spend the rest of your eternity alone, so if you don't manage to find a partner, they'll pair you up themselves. Good news though, a fellow vampire has arrived at your cozy (i.e. haunted) town. Even better, they've moved in next door!\n\nIf you don't manage to reel this strange sun-loving vampire in, you'll still have your best (unfortunately not-vampire) friend to keep you company.\n\nYou miss every neck you don't bite, so it doesn't hurt to try. The worst thing they can do is say no!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-batchelor"}
