Unfortunately, it released after the launch of the Game Boy Advance, which most likely attributed to the game's limited release in the handheld market.\r\n\r\nThis GBA platformer is a follow-up to the GBC adventure, featuring a similar graphics style but utilizing the Game Boy Advance hardware's more powerful capabilities. This sequel, tentatively titled Shantae Advance, features a larger quest than the original, with more labyrinths, more enemies, and more locations to explore.\r\n\r\nShantae Advance will feature advance gameplay mechanics where players will have to move Shantae from the foreground to the background planes in this side-scrolling environment in order to accomplish specific tasks. And just like the original platformer, players will have to utilize Shantae's transforming capabilities to get through the challenges; players can change into a bird, elephant, monkey, or mermaid so they can fly, dig, climb and swim through the different levels.\r\n\r\nThe Game Boy Advance platformer will even include a four player battle mode that only requires one copy of the cartridge. Two to four players can compete and battle in the rotating environment, obviously putting the GBA's hardware special effects to use.\r\n\r\nhttp://gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389501p1.html", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCwTNkdbW3A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCwTNkdbW3A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCwTNkdbW3A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Shantae Advance [GBA Beta Demo - UNRELEASED!] V2", "description": "http://www.unseen64.net/\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 2003 - Handheld game developer Way Forward has revealed the first screenshots of its in-development Game Boy Advance game, a sequel to its Game Boy Color platformer, Shantae.\r\n\r\nYou may recall way back during the days of the Game Boy Color, the developer gave us a first look at the Game Boy Color version of Shantae, easily one of the most graphically advanced platformer to hit the Game Boy Color system.
