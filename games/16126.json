The title translates to \"exceptional\" or \"extraordinary\".\n\nIt was the final game created before Toaplan's dissolution, and has been regarded as a key title in the development of the modern manic shooter, with elements of the game such as the size of the player's hitbox, the scale of their firepower, and the complexity of enemy bullet patterns all having an influence on future titles in the sub-genre. Members of the development team also went on to work on other successful manic shooters, most notably lead artist Junya Inoue.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/batsugun", "videos": [{"id": 87960, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qSMwbFgcdys", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSMwbFgcdys", "title": "Arcade Longplay [340] Batsugun", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qSMwbFgcdys/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 91019, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9QKaTsMKIes", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QKaTsMKIes", "title": "Batsugun [MAME] [shortplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9QKaTsMKIes/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
