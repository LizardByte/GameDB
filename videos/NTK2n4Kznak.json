In this new gameplay trailer, explore one of the many activities on your farm: raising and tending to your various animals. For the first time, care for and ride horses around the beautiful environments of your home and the surrounding areas.\n\nAs part of creating the largest Farming Simulator ever, many animals are available to be reared on your custom-designed farm. Cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens each have unique needs and rewards for effective farming, and which you choose is entirely up to you. React to the market and focus on the most in-demand produce or have a broad strategy with many more machines, processes, and area requirements.\n\nHorses are a brand new addition, rideable for the first time as a new means of traversing the land in and around your farm, allowing you to train them up for sale at a high price. Keep them healthy with the new oat crop, and transport them between locations in unique equipment. They join over 300 vehicles and tools, including the John Deere brand for the first time, new environments, and new crops in cotton and oat to make Farming Simulator 19 the biggest and best Farming Simulator of all time.\n\nFarming Simulator 19 is a giant leap forward for the multimillion-selling franchise, providing the richest farming game ever made for consoles and PCs. An accurate simulator at heart, filled with deep management options, the accessible sandbox mode lets players of all skill and experience levels learn and enjoy one of gaming\u2019s most popular genres. Mod support on PC and console, plus multiplayer with up to 16 farmers (6 on consoles) keeps the experience fresh for endless hours of play.\n\nFarming Simulator 19 releases November 20 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC/Mac.
