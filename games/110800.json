Each wall has a gap cut out in a different body shape. Hold a Joy-Con in each hand and move your arms to match the shape and slip through the gap! Sounds easy? It is at first, but the gaps get smaller and the walls get faster. How long can you survive before you're plunged into the slime? Practice alone or play together for some serious fun! 4 types of games! Classic, High Speed, Memory and Reverse will keep you on your toes. Three game modes! Challenge Practice and aim for the highest score. Versus Split screen head-to-head action! The pressure mounts as the walls keep coming! Arms & Legs Control the movement of the left or right arm, or the left or right leg with a single Joy-Con. Each time the round finishes the limb you control changes (but you're not told to which one). Quickly find your arm/leg and move it to fit through the gap as the wall approaches. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-wall"}
