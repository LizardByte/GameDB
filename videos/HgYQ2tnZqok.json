Is this game that terrible where nobody would pay a buck or two to own it legit? Well, the reviews of the day made it seem that way, so you can't exactly blame people. The game is kinda terrible... it's not because of how the game looks... it's not because of how it sounds... it's not because of how it controls... it's because of how it plays. Yup.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no difference between Boarder and Skier styles, you can never get any significant air time to pull off tricks, the game tried to be realistic and penalize you for turning too sharply or moving too quickly (so you're always on edge as to when to break and when to recover from losing balance), the game has a habit of making you fall at random or jump on bumps that aren't even bumps, jumping on jump spots has a good chance of making you jump INTO the ramp rather than jump off it (resulting in a fall, loss of speed, both, etc.), falling at bad points can make you get up slowly and crash into another object as soon as you get up, Stamina does nothing that I can see, etc. The game only has four stages that the characters can ride on over and over again (plus mirrored versions) and you can play Free Ride and Two Slalom modes. There are a few hidden characters.\r\n\r\nThis game is probably worth a rental or \"try\", but not a purchase unless you're a serious snowboarding video game enthusiast or can get it for really cheap, which you probably can. This video shows the easiest and hardest course (Easy: Free Ride, Hard: Slalom).
