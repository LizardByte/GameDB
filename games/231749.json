During his defense, however, Wario has to be careful not to hit any hens or apples, as they award him five and seven bonus points, respectively. The player is not penalized for hitting a hen or apple, but the player does get a miss if a Bob-omb or Bullet Bill manages to destroy parts of Wario's fort. However, Wario can remove a miss when he gets 200, 500, and 700 points by catching a heart coming from a Bill Blaster. It is Game Over if Wario's statue gets destroyed. This version also features music, with the tempo changing depending on the speed of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-attack--1"}
