It was published by Irem in Japan only for the Famicom Disk System. \n \nKinetic Connection, which has a longer title of Monitor Puzzle Kineco: Kinetic Connection for its original FDS release, is a puzzle game in which the player has to assemble a picture from a number of pieces like a jigsaw. However, the image (and thus the smaller pieces of the image) is constantly moving as it loops through an animation: This makes putting the puzzle together even more complicated, though it's occasionally made easier by carefully watching how pieces interact with each other. \n \nThe game was developed by Tamtex, a subsidiary of Irem that made computer games, and published by Irem in Japan. The game would be later ported to the MSX and C64 home computers, as well as on the Sega Game Gear. It was also followed a year later with a FDS-only sequel, Kineco II, which was only available via the Disk Writer service."}
