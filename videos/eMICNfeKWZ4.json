I finally got enough content to make a trailer and set the Steam store page live! the game is inspired by some games I really enjoy like Vampire Survivors and the Risk of Rain franchise. \n\nit's definitely most inspired by Vampire Survivors though. i was playing it with my family, and it was an absolute blast. I thought it was the most fun when we had objectives, like running around the map to get specific items we saw on the minimap, or finding characters to unlock. Since I wanted a bit more of that in Vampire Survivors, i decided to make this game. It's an autoshooter, so you generally don't have to aim projectiles (though you have to aim for example the sword) to try and keep that chill aspect of VS. But obviously this is 3d, so there's a whole new dimension to worry about, which makes it pretty interesting.\n\nI still have lots of things to implement, but it's getting somewhere. I've spent a lot of time lately just working on this trailer, the Steam Store page, and other promotional stuff. But im done with most of that now, which means i can get back to working on content for Megabonk (this is a terrible name i know). next ill probably add items, so you can start going for interesting synergies and stuff. kinda like risk of rain.\n\n#gamedev #indiegame #games", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eMICNfeKWZ4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eMICNfeKWZ4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eMICNfeKWZ4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eMICNfeKWZ4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eMICNfeKWZ4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Megabonk - Trailer", "description": "Wishlist Megabonk now or get bonked:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/\nDiscord - https://discord.com/invite/BGxud7HPEe\n\nMegabonk is an Action Roguelike / Roguelite I've been working on for a while now.
