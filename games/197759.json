Joining a band of inept misfits - a bossy tank, a handsome archer, a depraved mage, and a raging barbarian - you must keep your party\u2019s health topped up whilst simultaneously managing dwindling mana reserves.\nNot only can your party be taken down when their health ebbs away, they can also be hit with a range of debilitating status effects. It\u2019s like juggling with magic, and the crowd hates you. If you let party members die, they may well go into a sulk in subsequent encounters. Manage moods with magical curatives, death prevention, and witty dialogue choices."}
