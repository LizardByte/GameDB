During the course of the game, events will loop when time runs out and the player is able to cooperate with a past version of himself, as all the previous actions of the cursor can still be seen and influence the current session.\n\nAs such, eventually up to ten cursors will cooperate to reach the sixteenth floor, clicking boxes to open them, mounting stairs and pressing buttons simultaneously. The graphics are drawn as outlines in black and white, shown from an isometric perspective.\n\nThis edition features both recurring and new puzzles, including a deadly spear that can pin your cursor, instantly killing it, and a key to unlock a box. This version also introduces sound, unlike the first game. Apart from that, the gameplay mechanics are completely identical.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cursor-star-10-2nd-session"}
