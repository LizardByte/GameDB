Being the Dungeon Keeper and all, this is your home, too.

You lure them in with food and the promise of dank and fetid places to sleep. You keep them in line with the back of your hand and the threat of dire consequences. You pit their scaly hides against the best that the Forces of Good can muster, and they die for you as they rip steaming entrails out of the hapless heroes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-keeper-gold"}
