You'll have to unveil why we shoot stars, why are we chosen and why everything looks so undefined. Hide stars to obtain money, and spend it on building a village, collect Anialms, and unlock new features. Explore places like The Town or The City to read notes and watch shortfilms someone left behind to understand your roots and the history of the world.\nAll the models, music, cutscenes, animations, programming & story are made by me. It's been a long and hardworking journey to make a world where everything connects and everything makes sense at the end. This game was inspired mainly by Outer Wilds, even though it's very different, its way to tell the story mixed with the freedom you have to discover it was the first stone of Distant Lands: Earendel.\n\nIts core gameplay is based on the 3Dfication of the typical clickers. Get money, buy something that gives you more money, and spend that money to unlock new functions. A simple but fun way to discover new stars, every star has its own peculiar thing. Sometimes you just have to click it 10 times, sometimes it moves, sometimes it has other stars around it... \nThe Village System where you obtain passive money is made to incentivize the exploration and not to feel like you're losing money if you go to walk. You can also encounter Experience Orbs and Money around. The Experience system works so that the level you currently are, multiplies with the money a star gives. If a star gives you 2$ and you're level 3, you will obtain 6$\n\nThe art of the game is very basic, if you play you will understand why, but I also wanted to make a template where I could create things without the need of them to be realistic. Playing around plain textures makes the imagination create all what's needed for our minds to understand what you're looking at.\nI don't want to spoil anything about the story but just know I worked really hard for everything to make sense. The way the story it's told is multiple, and by that I mean it's not just notes and static reading. Didn't want to spoil anything on the trailer neither so you'll have to trust me when I say it's not boring at all, I worked so hard to avoid long and boring notes but at the same time tell the story the best way possible.\n\nMy intention is to follow the Distant Lands series and make more games within this universe. So many stories are still waiting to be told and game design has many ways to innovate and be fun to play.\n\n#distantlands #indiegame #indiedev", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iHFz3dhHkcc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iHFz3dhHkcc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iHFz3dhHkcc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iHFz3dhHkcc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iHFz3dhHkcc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Official Release Trailer | Distant Lands: Earendel", "description": "Wishlist now: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489630/Distant_Lands_Earendel/\n\nSocial Media:\nhttps://x.com/DistantLands_DP\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dparses/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@distantlandsdp\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@byDanielParses\n\nDistant Lands: Earendel is a First Person Clicker with a world to explore and a story to discover.\n\nBased on a future world where a strange and undefined disaster took place, we are chosen for unknown reasons to complete the mission of \"hiding\" stars, cleaning the astral view to watch further and discover new and random stars.
