This version contains new enemy types, more edited encounters, and even new renditions of certain vehicles. \n\nHalo: Reach Evolved is a sandbox overhaul of Halo: Reach that brings in certain aspects from the original trilogy of Halo games, as well as other titles like Halo 3: ODST and even a weapon from Halo 5. The mod also aims to re-balance the Legendary Campaign difficulty, edits some of the Campaign encounters, introduces brand new content, and alters the weapons and vehicles to give each tool of destruction their own distinct niche.\n\nDownload here: \nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/halothemasterchiefcollection/mods/23?tab=files\n\n------\n\nMusic by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori:\n\n-Winter Contingency\n-Tip of the Spear\n\n----\n\nVoluntarily donate to my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/vengefulvadam\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/vengeful_vadam\n\nJoin my Discord server: https://discord.gg/3WJVDPa\n\nFollow me on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/the_vengeful_vadam\n\n#Halo #HaloMods #HaloReachEvolved", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OEXjUMgcBvo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OEXjUMgcBvo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OEXjUMgcBvo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OEXjUMgcBvo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OEXjUMgcBvo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Halo: Reach EVOLVED Campaign Launch Trailer (Reach Campaign Mod)", "description": "Over a year in the making since it was an Xbox 360 mod, Halo: Reach EVOLVED's Campaign has finally made its way to MCC PC, with tweaks thanks to player feedback, as well as a whole host of new content.
