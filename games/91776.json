The purpose is to collect \"memorial shots,\" which are excerpts of comics in action scenes inserted between scenes while watching dialogue between characters.\n\nThe package illustrations are the anime pictures of the time, but the in-game graphics and settings such as calling Shizuka Minamoto \"Shizu-chan\" are in compliance with the manga, and there are dialogue scenes and quizzes that can not be understood without perusing the manga, making this a unique game that is clearly different in its target audience than before.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doraemon-memories-nobita-no-omoide-daibouken"}
