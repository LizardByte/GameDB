Discover secrets, collect specimens, unlock portals, and solve puzzles to find new areas of this beautiful planet. Exploration is the only way to find new species of plants, animals, new types of minerals, and even uncover artifacts that could be remnants of ancient civilizations. Get going explorer, and remember the people of Earth are always watching!\n\nScope is a virtual reality experience that centers around exploration and discovery. It involves a linear progression through the sections of each planet, in which the player solves puzzles and collects objects to reach the next section and experiences the narrative of the game along the way primarily through communication with a scientist from Earth. Once the story is over, the player is able to go back to any place they have visited and continue their exploration for as long as they wish.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scopic"}
