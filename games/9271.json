The result is a new campaign spanning nine areas, ranging from lush jungles to arctic wastelands, as players prepare to do battle with more than 100 different creatures. Enhancements to the original include 50 additional spells to wield, such as Diminution, Animal Rage, Zorkon's Bonecrusher, and the Orb of Fire, and the ability to play as a new character: the half-giant, who uses brute force to wear down his foes. As the battles become more dangerous and the characters more skilled in the finer points of hack-and-slash combat, the rewards will grow more enticing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
