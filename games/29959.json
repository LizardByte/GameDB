Through manipulation of the environment the conditions of survival change thus the cells have to adapt to their new surrounding. Unlike from similar games you cannot change the cells genome directly but only influence the chances of survival for certain random mutations. This is what evolution is about in reality: Totally random mutation and natural selection."}
