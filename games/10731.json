When the inventors aren\u2019t looking, their tiny robots go on big adventures. They never expected to stumble onto a plot so diabolical it threatened their very existence. With lasers! It all starts when Zander - possibly the world\u2019s most absent-minded inventor - trips over a metal box buried outside the factory. When no-one can figure out how to open it, the Bots sneak out and try it for themselves. Join the robots as they outwit mischievous children, curious animals, and dysfunctional inventors in their quest to find the truth. Will the Bots solve the mystery before it\u2019s too late?", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-bots", "videos": [{"id": 5248, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0Uy6xQWt3P4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uy6xQWt3P4", "title": "Puzzle Bots trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Uy6xQWt3P4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
