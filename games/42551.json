Even though, the teams are fictional, they are based on the real NFL team cities and the division setup of that time period.\n\nGameplay involves the usual football fare of choosing a play and attempting to execute it. On offense, when throwing the football, a meter appears which measures the strength of the passer's throw. On defense, the player controls a defensive player and tries to tackle the opposing ball carrier or attempt to break up a pass play.\n\nThere is an option to either play with the background music on or off.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/football-fury"}
