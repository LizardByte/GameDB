As a result, the number of irregularities decreased. Furthermore, Dr. Doppler declared that he would build \"Doppeltown,\" a peaceful city where humans and replicants could coexist, and he gained the support of both humans and replicants.\nA few months later, however, Doppler and his Repliroids, who had been exposed to the antibody virus mentioned above, rebelled.
