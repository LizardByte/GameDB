Twenty years have passed since world leaders offered an unconditional surrender to alien forces and XCOM, the planet\u2019s last line of defense, was left decimated and scattered.

Here, a force gathers once again to stand up for humanity. Always on the run, the remnant XCOM forces must find a way to rise from the ashes, expose the insidious truth behind the occupation, and eliminate the alien threat once and for all.", "summary": "The XCOM 2: Digital Deluxe Edition includes the full base game, XCOM 2 Reinforcement Pack, and the digital soundtrack.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xcom-2-digital-deluxe-edition"}
