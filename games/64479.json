Set up the Kinect and let Love Tore pull you into the dance club. The game is a trilogy of challenges. The first game Sweet sets up stage where you meet the girls in your club. Get used to holding their hands and their waists and guiding them across the dance floor. \n \nHowever, the club room is not the only place you practice. You might get into situations where you have to dance in swim suits. Practice the different routines and get used to all sorts of beats, because the club's over if you can't lead the girls to steal the show during the school festival."}
