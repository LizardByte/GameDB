The Nine have turned their backs on the Empire, which succumbed to corruption and conflict. After centuries of slow agony, it is a shadow of its former self. Only a true heir of the original bloodline can stop the darkness: A boy who just became a man, in a distant village on the fringes of the Empire.\n\nSages of Vandaleria is a retro-styled jRPG, inspired by classics of the genre. Combining tried-and-true action adventure mechanics and character progression with airship combat! Take to the skies on an epic adventure, to prove your worth to the Nine Gods and regain their favor to save the Empire from destruction - or let it plunge into the darkness forever!\n\nExplore a Fallen Empire\n\nVandaleria was once a vast empire. Now, fractured under the rule of corrupt False Emperors, it is a land of deceit and corruption. As you travel, you\u2019ll meet its people. Some will mock your quest, others will join your banner - or fight to keep the world as they prefer it to be. Still, some might even become your friends and loyal companions. You\u2019ll need them to reach the nine corners of the world and reclaim the throne.\n\nClassic Gameplay with a Twist\n\nHow you do it is up to you. Sages of Vandaleria is built around classic jRPG mechanics. Define your Emperor-to-be with a robust stat system and plenty of weapons and armor to choose from - including relics of a bygone age with tremendous power. Conquer dungeons, defeat bosses, solve puzzles to increase your power - then take to the skies aboard an airship and engage in high-stakes duels in the skies. All in real time, inspired by the legendary SNES Mode 7!\n\nRebirth of an Empire\n\nThe path to victory and reclamation of the Empire will be long and fraught with danger. Perhaps the greatest challenge will be yourself: Though you try to win the favor of the gods, you are still human. You seek out the sages, the Gods grant their blessings, and your power grows. As friends become mere mortals, tools of your ascension - will you find the strength to cling to your convictions and resist the temptation? Or give in to the lust for power and bring about a birth of an age more terrible than anything that came before?", "summary": "Vandaleria. A fallen empire.
