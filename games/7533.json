Some\u2014like the Sikandari, and most of the Giants\u2014were wiped out but others rose from the wars such as the Barakas and Castanics.\nNow that the gods were gone the seven races; Amani, Barakas, Castanics, Elin, High Elves, Humans, and Poporis must band together to fend off a new enemy.\nA metallic race from the underworld called Argons; their goal is to take over Tera and wake the titans to end their dreams and destroy Tera.", "summary": "Tera is an epic fantasy mmorpg experience.
