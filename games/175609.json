Just place the tiles according to simple rules to make your isle & score.\nBut every day the Imp resets the world - a new pack of tiles, dealt in a new order all day. A new starter map and new wildcard. Even the Imp\u2019s path is the same all day so there\u2019s no luck, it\u2019s all down to your skill at placing each tile to score the maximum. Check your map score against everyone else on the daily leaderboard.\nAnd certain tiles hold secret bonus scores if you can work out how to place them."}
