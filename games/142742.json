But unlike these games, the maps are entirely randomly generated, and enemy units are spawning randomly as well.

In this original turn based tactical war game, you take your army through a series of battles in which you\u2019ve gotta capture the flags before taking too many losses!\n\nLevel up your troops, rescue new recruits, and liberate your people!", "summary": "Gem Wizards Tactics is a turn-based strategy game with randomly generated maps and weird asymmetrical factions. Designed around endless single player play, Gem Wizards Tactics has three factions each with their own unique abilities which not only combine within factions, but you can also pick up units from other factions and combine them into your army to create new strategies.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gem-wizards-tactics", "videos": [{"id": 44804, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "QrgnDB2D-MM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrgnDB2D-MM", "title": "Gem Wizards Tactics - The Omni-Gem", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QrgnDB2D-MM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 44803, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "NsfTvXUWsQg"}]}
