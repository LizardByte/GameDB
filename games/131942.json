Or destroy all stars in Star Chain mode. Witch can walk of fly on her broom (by double tapping a direction) and can shoot boomerang like projectiles. But her most important offense is shooting comets. Comets (in the form of stars) can be picked up from the ground or you can pick them up after giving the puyos a good beating. Shooting comets at comets on the ground will make them explode, which can result in a chain of explosions. If there aren't any comets, Witch can spread them out herself.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 34679, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "d4bR4prTFII"}, {"id": 34680, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "UlCl5RVx3e0"}]}
