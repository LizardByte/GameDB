The consequences of the war for the ecosystem were disastrous and earth was left uninhabitable in the end. Almost all organic life forms were annihilated. Only a few humans succeeded to flee in the nick of time. However, from then on they were mercilessly hunted by the machines named Skilith.\nDive into the leading role of one of the last surviving humans and become the commander-in-chief on the spaceship of the Blue Science Union. Always by your side stands the artificial intelligence named AIRA. Embark on an interstellar journey across the galaxy and discover fascinating new worlds with yet unknown species.\n\nSince the violent take-over of power on earth, the Skilith continued to spread across the universe. While doing so, they continued to conquer new civilizations to rob them of their resources. Now, it is your duty to defend remaining resources at any cost.
