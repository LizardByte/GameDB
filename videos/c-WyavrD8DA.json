And you will have a lot of help for this new machine that can load cargo quickly here in Truck Loader. Control the truck loading machine and pick up the boxes around the area. Some buttons are also need to be pressed on some levels. Place them inside the truck and make sure they fit the guide correctly. You won't be able to finish the level if they are not properly placed. The guide will turn green and will order you to leave the truck. Do each level as quickly as you can to set new time records.\n\n```\nOverview:\n\nTruck Loaders have it hard when it comes to their work. You have to be a good and master user of these types of equipment. Now the game Truck Loader, allows you to emulate the job of a truck loader. Then again the game itself doesn\u2019t have a lot of real life physics involved but it is made up for the fact that it is fun but challenging. Just make sure to pile the crates in a good way to conquer all the levels.\n\nAesthetics:\n\nThe game\u2019s visuals are very simple but they are appealing. The art has that typical cartoon feel to it and the Truck\u2019s design is basically good to look at and the animation is fluent when the magnet moves. The background and terrain are also done simple. Then again it is basically a warehouse area so you couldn\u2019t expect much but again not bad. The music itself is suitable for the environment. It\u2019s nothing special but fits the bill perfectly. The overall aesthetics for the game is simple but not bad.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay mechanics is categorized as a puzzle based type. It is a different kind of puzzle game since it involves moving around the Truck which performs the puzzle solving. You can control the Truck with the WASD keys making it move from left to right and vice versa. The mouse is used to move the magnet in a 360 degree angle. Pressing the left mouse button will activate the magnet thus attracting the crate that the player will want to carry. The objective now is to get all the crates scattered in the level. The player must control the truck to put the crates on the truck. There is a catch though as you will see silhouettes of the crates where you need to put the crates. The silhouettes will turn green stating that the crates are in place. If they aren\u2019t green then you need to adjust the crates that they are in place. There are no specific orders to pile up the crates as long as they are in place. There are different kinds of crates for the players to collect. There are the two basic crates that come in a square and rectangle shape. The other two are the face up and fragile crates. The face up crates must be placed in the silhouettes with the arrows on the crates pointing up or facing up. If they aren\u2019t then the crates will not turn the silhouettes green. The fragile crates tend to break if you toss them around so be careful with it. The levels have different obstacles as they progress. The obstacles include elevators, pits and switches that you need to solve. This is where more of the game\u2019s puzzle aspect fits in. There are 24 levels for th players to complete. Each level can be finished with a timer but there is no time limit. You can choose to finish each level with the minimal time possible.\n\n---\nOther \"Truck Loader\" game sequels:\n\n\"Truck Loader 2\" Game Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/fJsY0OlmUZA\n\n\"Truck Loader 3\" Game Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/TK909Yr4jDk\n\n\"Truck Loader 4\" Game Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/D1Ag0yZeV9k\n\n\"Truck Loader 5\" Game Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/USx7CVImN7w\n\nAll \"Truck Loader\" game videos (playlist): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRVGpctimHO13L0GIsYiOJMKbD22yxcr7\n\nPlease subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/FreeGamesExplorer", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-WyavrD8DA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-WyavrD8DA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-WyavrD8DA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Truck Loader - Game Walkthrough (full)", "description": "Making deliveries for important cargo is a must.
