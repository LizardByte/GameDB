Moe & exciting shooting action!\n\n\"Momoko 1200%\" is a remake of Jaleco's action game \"Momoko 120%\", which was previously released for feature phones.\n\nThe main character is Momoko, a 12-year-old girl who falls in love with the Martian prince \"The Greatest Fire Dancer\".\n\nUse light-hearted action to tear and throw the Martians who have come to invade Earth! Tear and throw!\n\nAim for the exit somewhere in the field! Clear the stage by entering the exit or defeating a certain number of enemies!\n\nAs the game progresses, Momoko will grow into a \"15-year-old (high school student)\" or \"18-year-old (working adult)\". Depending on how you behave in the game, the schools and occupations you can go to, and even the special moves you can use will change. What kind of appearance will your Momoko show you?\n\nPay attention to the Mars Prince's preferred type.\nThe closer you get to the type, the more heated the final battle will be, and the greater the bonus score upon clearing. The type changes each time you play, so you can play under various conditions.\n\nUse special moves to destroy obstacles.\nAttack not only enemies but also walls and lockers to gain an advantage in the game! By destroying walls and lockers, you may be able to find a shortcut to the exit or items necessary for Momoko's growth.\n\nMomoko grows according to how you play. Let's grow Momoko by adjusting the number of enemies defeated, the number of items acquired, etc. If you defeat too much or acquire too much, you may become an unintended type...", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/g-mode-archives-plus-momoko-1200-percent", "videos": [{"id": 111567, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kVud9PKfPSI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVud9PKfPSI", "title": "G-MODE\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9+ \u30e2\u30e2\u30b31200%\u3000\u7d39\u4ecb\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kVud9PKfPSI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
