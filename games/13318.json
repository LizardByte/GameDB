Guard droids must be avoided, but shooting them can leave them inactive for a short period of time, and they can now be shot or hit to push them in that direction, which can be used strategically to make more paths available. There is a 2-minute time limit on each level. Every 5th level has a nuclear weapon guarded by a seeking enemy droid, which continually follows you.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anarchy"}
