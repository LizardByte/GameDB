Not only does this unlock the entirety of POPGOES and the Machinist after attaining 100%, but it also gives you some bonus features for the entire game BEFORE you reach 100%. \n\nThese are kept in the new accomodation in the forest inns. These are basically hotel rooms, and they include something called a Bestiary which logs all of the enemies you fought. The book shows stuff like hidden stats and fun descriptions.\n\nThese clips were made for Dawko's WWF Charity Stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfC024iDNqg\n\nPOPGOES Arcade: https://gamejolt.com/games/arcade/478668\n\nJoin my membership to access my Discord server and check out exclusive content: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kanecarter", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MG8dOkGdWYE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MG8dOkGdWYE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MG8dOkGdWYE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MG8dOkGdWYE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MG8dOkGdWYE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "POPGOES Arcade Premium - Clip #1 - \"The Bestiary\"", "description": "Wishlist POPGOES Arcade on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1986840/POPGOES_Arcade/\n\nWhen you purchase POPGOES Arcade, either through its ports or its expansion on Steam, you'll gain access to the \"premium\" version of the game.
