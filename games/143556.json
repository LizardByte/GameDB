Bummer. \n \nNow in the form of a ghost, her naturally curious character compels her to figure out how she died. Besides, if she doesn\u2019t, she won\u2019t be able to move on to the afterlife. \n \nTogether with her sister Emmie, the two Lawson sisters must work together to solve the mystery from both sides of life, and learn to let each other go along the way. \n \nSince Julia is now a ghost (or maybe I should say BOO-lia) she has a number of ghostly powers, such as: \nLevitate objects in the air around her \nPossess living beings and control their bodies and speech \nDash through thin fences and gates \n \nUsing these powers, you play as Boolia as she explores, interrogates, and investigates around Boonkle!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boodunnit", "videos": [{"id": 45860, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rSXmAEQH5PI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSXmAEQH5PI", "title": "Boodunnit?!
