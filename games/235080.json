Current intel obtained by [[REDACTED]], suggests noxious weaponry is being shipped from a suspected BioLab facility in Al Mazrah.\n\nOriginally planned as a resort destination, development on Ashika Island was halted in the mid-1990s due to [[REDACTED]] and the sterling work of [[REDACTED]], but publicly the reasons remain undisclosed. Since this time, travel to and from the island has been heavily restricted.\n\nRecently intercepted communications suggest that elements of Shadow Company, under the leadership of [[REDACTED]], have taken control of the isle, seemingly on the hunt for members of the Konni Group. While the location appears abandoned, there are whispers on the wires of Konni Operators remaining active in this conflict zone.\n\nRegardless of where you drop in, extreme caution is advised.", "summary": "Gear up for Season 02 in Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 and have you and your squad be victorious when the mist clears.\nResurgence Mode returns on a new battleground in Warzone 2.0 starting in Season 02.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-season-02--1", "videos": [{"id": 83564, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "y_Bn8Iw-iJk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Bn8Iw-iJk", "title": "Resurgence Returns on New Map Ashika Island | Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_Bn8Iw-iJk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
