It's the newest game from the same group that made games like Hollow Song of Birds, Riverbed Soul Saver and Trifocuser. They are known for consistently making very high quality free Touhou fangames since 2012. \nI've played the demo for this one before but now the full version finally came out. \nThe game was designed by Len this time, who you might know as the guy that made Phantasmagoria Trues. It's easily one of the best Touhou fangames ever made because of that. \nThe stage design is very tight and all the boss patterns are super fun and creative. The stages are a lot more arcade-like than what you normally see in Touhou, but I prefer that a lot more since it's way more involved and fun.\nThe game is also very hard, way harder than their other games. \n\nMarisaB is easily the most fun shottype to use in the game. It has good speed and range and the backshot gets a lot of use too.\nThe biggest DPS with this shot comes from sitting on top of an enemy unfocused and letting both your front and backshot hit it at the same time. This does a MASSIVE amount of damage. Shades of Impossible Spellcard perhaps. \nThe demo had a bit of a problem with Youmu being very bad. They fixed it by buffing her but they went like waaaay overboard with it. She kills basically everything before it even does anything now. Not quite MoF MarisaB tier but it's close. \n\nThe system is basically the Mystical Power Plant system but with a twist. Shooting enemies and grazing their bullets releases autumn items. Collecting these will give you levels at certain thresholds, and every level gives you a perk.\nUnlike Mystical Power Plant though, you keep these perks until you use a special attack, which will consume two levels. \nSpecial attacks vary between character and shottype, they can cancel some bullets or give you some temporary invincibility. \nGetting levels and extra levels also gives you bomb and life pieces. \n\nStage 4 boss was a bit of a mess but I made up for it by getting a perfect stage 5 lmao. The stage 5 boss is crazy hard so that was kind of silly.\n\nCheck out the Youmu LNNN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-l_gWYCakA\n\nDownload the game here:\nhttps://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/20533\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:23 Stage 1\n04:18 Stage 2\n08:56 Stage 3\n14:04 Stage 4\n20:01 Stage 5\n26:29 Stage 6\n33:45 Ending\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yqqVOTDvfX0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yqqVOTDvfX0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yqqVOTDvfX0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yqqVOTDvfX0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou \u6771\u65b9\u9b3c\u846c\u5263 \uff5e Infinite Blade Pavilion - Lunatic 1cc (No-Bombs, No-Special)(MarisaB)", "description": "Turn on captions for some extra comments. \n\nA clear without using bombs or using the special attack.\n\nNew freeware Touhou fangame that came out recently.
