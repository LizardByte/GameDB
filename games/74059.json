Viewed from slightly above and behind the spaceship, the camera scrolls into a 3-D environment in all directions. There are seven levels to negotiate situated above huge crowded cities on earth, earth's oceans, space and on the futuristic world of Morzique. A striking feature is the fighter cannot collide with the backgrounds. This is a good thing, though, as from the word go Morzique spaceships fly into the screen from all directions and fire at you at an alarming rate. Luckily, you have three types of weapon at your disposal: standard fire, three smart bombs, and by holding down the fire- and smart bomb-keys simultaneously, a laser beam. Certain destroyed ships leave behind three types of power-ups: mint-coloured orbs add 10% energy to your energy bar, green orbs gain 100 points and red orbs gain 200 points. Finally, at the end of a level a huge end-of-level boss awaits and needs to be put to rest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xenic"}
