Due to its characteristics, it has been chosen for a unique mission. \n \nYou must cross the enemy lines, locate the headquarters of your opponents and get the blueprint of the particle bomb that can become the most destructive weapon created by man. Humanity is not safe until these plans are achieved. \n \nDerdhal knows the danger posed by the mission and the vital importance of completing it successfully, but he takes the risk and embarks on an adventure, a nightmare from which it is difficult to escape.", "summary": "Army Moves is a one-player game which is divided into two parts. In part one, you drive a jeep and must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end. \n \nIn part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus. \n \nSome versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/army-moves", "videos": [{"id": 40488, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9joNfknpGgU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9joNfknpGgU", "title": "Army Moves (1/2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9joNfknpGgU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 40489, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "obbQnpsg6ck", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obbQnpsg6ck", "title": "Army Moves (2/2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/obbQnpsg6ck/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
