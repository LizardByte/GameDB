The game was later localized as Tetris Attack, starring Yoshi and other characters from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. The game had an official Tetris license, although it didn't have anything to do with Tetris, being only a marketing strategy to release it under a famous franchise as a way to attract more attention.\n\nThe game was later relocalized for the Japanese audience, released only as a digital download via the Satellaview peripheral. The only difference that this version has, aside from the language translation, is the absence of anything related to the Tetris franchise.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-yoshi-no-panepon"}
