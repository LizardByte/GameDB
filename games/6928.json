In the span of a few short years, humanity suffered every disaster imaginable \u2014 and all as a prelude to the one we couldn't have imagined.\nAn army of literal demons marched straight out of Hell, trampling over the survivors wherever they found them. When they killed, they wore their victims' skins. When they conquered, they seized their enemies' weapons. Powered by supernatural evil and loaded with military hardware, they scattered us and ran us down.\n\nBut then she came. At first, we thought she was one of them \u2014 a woman in black, with a long gun like a witch's broom and the magical powers to match. Survivors whispered her stories in the alleyways: stories of battles so intense that they leveled whole city blocks, during which she mowed down entire demon regiments with flaming bullets, then shared her own blood to save the wounded. They say she can summon clouds of ravens, call up thorns from the ground, and even conjure up lightning and tornadoes at will.\n\nMaybe she flew down from Heaven. Maybe Hell spat her back out. Either way, she's all we've got.", "summary": "Bullet Witch is a shooter video game for the Xbox 360 developed by Cavia. It was released in Japan on July 27, 2006 by AQ Interactive, followed by a release in North America on February 27, 2007. Atari Europe handled translations and other localization efforts. The game was not released with a multiplayer component, although players could participate in a score ranking competition via Xbox Live. Downloadable content includes new costumes and new missions. A later Japanese re-release under the \"Xbox 360 Platinum Collection\" label included all of the downloadable content on the game disc.\n\nThe player takes control of a witch named Alicia Claus in the near future of 2013. Mankind is on the brink of destruction, having suffered major natural disasters and an invasion of demons. The protagonist Alicia utilizes a gun rod that has transformations such as shotgun, machine gun, and Gatling gun. This weapon can also be used to cast spells.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bullet-witch", "videos": [{"id": 24650, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ksgOR7SZ_9g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksgOR7SZ_9g", "title": "Bullet Witch Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ksgOR7SZ_9g/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
