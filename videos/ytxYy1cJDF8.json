Well, this is that game, known as Mitsumete Knight, and it was only released for Playstation. In cooperation with Red Company (Entertainment) and Konami, Mitsumete Knight is a very well-made game within the Japanese Visual Novel/ Sim series, equaling or even surpassing the standards set by the original Tokimeki Memorial, IMO.\n\nYou assume the role on an Asian mercenary who travels abroad to a school where he can hone his abilities and become a brave knight, wooing the local ladies and mysterious denizens in the process while preventing all-out war. The artwork is simply gorgeous as one might expect (with the help of designers like Takenami Hideyuki (\u7af9\u6d6a\u79c0\u884c) of Sakura Taisen fame no less) and the core gameplay is the same as Tokimeki (building the stats of your character through various exercises), but there are a number of additional elements that make the game stand out as its own entity.\n\nFirst and foremost, you gain levels in various areas depending on your daily routine. Besides making you appear more debonair, etc., it helps you when you go to battle. What? Battle? Yup. In Mitsumete Knight, you can wage war with soldiers at certain points and fight in one-on-one duals. Battles are largely easy and aren't the primary focus, but it's a great addition to the game which is already full of fun events and mini-games ala TokiMemo.\n\nAnother interesting element? Characters can die. Some scenarios in this game require more precise micromanagement and attention to detail. Failing to meet certain requirements can prove fatal. This game also has several secrets and a cameo or two (I won't spoil who, but you'll be amazed... he even speaks!). All in all, this is a criminally overlooked game within its genre.\n\nWe'll be uploading a couple of vids for this.
