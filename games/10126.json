Knights of Pen & Paper II is a turn-based, retro style, pixel-art adventure full of danger, intrigue, death, and saving throws! Players assume the role of a group of teenagers, playing a classic pen & paper RPG to overcome dicey situations. As both party and game master, they get to assemble both their characters, and the challenges they will face. Select among mighty classes like Wizard, Thief or Warrior; proud races like Dwarf or Elf; and snark-slinging players like Goth, Lab Rat or Rocker. Choose quests and combat encounters, delve dungeons, craft powerful items and watch in horror as your muscle-packed barbarian rolls a one on his body check.
