Produced just in time for the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing China, Video Olympics has the spirits of the Olypia of years past all wrapped up into one convenient Atari cartridge.  Lurking deep within Video Olypics is basically 10 different versions of PONG.  Sure they may use fancy names like Quadrapong and Ice Hockey, Soccery and Volleyball... but it's basically pong.  You watched the footage of the different events in the massive Chinese stadium like swimming, gymnastics and track and field... but does that really get you into the action like Video Olympics does?  Who won the gold medal in rings... who won the silver in high jumping... what country won the bronze in the 50 meter dash...?  I don't know.  But I do know that when you play pong you're a winner.  Watch the news for up to the minute.. nay, up to the second covereage of the 2K8 olympics in China, but watch your Atari 2600 for up to the second covereage of what's going on in your Atari 2600 Video Olympics!
