Hope you are all good. I have been working on Baby Blues Nightmare for some time now back-to-back with Rotten Flesh.

Please like, comment and subscribe if you like it.\n\nBaby Blues Nightmare is a survival horror stealth game where you play as a toddler and have to do what it takes in order to survive your horror-ish nightmares of what's real and not. Fix, maintain and customize your Tricycle to roam around your little world with. Run, hide and survive but remember; try not to cry when you are scared.. or the monsters will hear you and get you.\n\nWISHLIST IT ON STEAM \u25bahttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game\n\nGAME Press Kit \u25ba https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VQTT2cM-Wu9qFtN7UzXuwZTP3ALsAazQ?usp=sharing\n\nIndieDB \u25ba https://www.indiedb.com/games/baby-blues-nightmares-toddler-horror-game\n\nWebsite \u25ba https://steelkrill.com\n\nTwitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/steelkrill\n\nTikTok \u25ba https://TikTok.com/@SteelkrillStudio\n\nInstagram \u25ba https://instagram.com/Steelkrill\n\n#horrorgamestamillive  #horrorgames2023 #horrorgaming #horrorstories #halloween #scarygaming #gamingvideos #newgames #gaming #mascotas", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmRGzTW_9e0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmRGzTW_9e0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmRGzTW_9e0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmRGzTW_9e0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmRGzTW_9e0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Baby Blues Nightmare - [OLD] Announcement Trailer 2024 (Toddler Horror Survival Game)", "description": "WISHLIST IT NOW ON STEAM \u25ba\u25ba https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game\n\nJoin Our DISCORD \u25ba\u25ba https://discord.com/invite/d8WUuuRCJK\n\nHello everybody!
