The narratives are tied together by the experiences of the Syrian artist Jack Gutmann, who co-developed the award-winning game \"Path Out\" with the game\u2019s developer, Causa Creations.\n\nFollow the narratives of:\n* Light, a non-binary Syrian refugee who arrives in Vienna after years of hardship and war in Syria and the United Arab Emirates.\n* V\u00e2n, the daughter of a Vietnamese contract worker who grew up in East-Germany and who must deal with the duality of being Vietnamese-German.\n* Michele, the son of Francesco Cicora, an Italian coal miner who died in the great mining disaster of Marcinelle 1956 in Belgium.\n* Hasan, who came to Austria at the age of 1, when his mother moved there from Istanbul, Turkey.\n* Olya, a Ukrainian lawyer and a refugee who has had to flee twice: first when she left her home of Donetsk in 2014 and fled to Kyiv, and then when she fled from Ukraine once war erupted in 2022.", "summary": "An animated graphic novel exploring the unique stories of five migrants seeking new beginnings in Europe.
