But don't count them out just yet - with your help, they'll fight to climb the ranks and become the ultimate 5-star idols!\n\nChoose from three thrilling game modes as you strive to reach the top. But be warned: the competition is fierce and the stakes are high. You'll need to quickly feed weaker idol units to your own to level up and reach a coveted 5-star rating. But if you're not careful, you could end up as level fodder yourself!\n\nThe world of this fictional mobile gacha game is not for the faint of heart. It's a cutthroat place where only the highest star idols will survive. Do you have what it takes to lead Flow, Macho, and Jade to their dream in this GachaHell?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gachahell", "videos": [{"id": 87357, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "l2mIIr4UfbQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2mIIr4UfbQ", "title": "GachaHell - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2mIIr4UfbQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
