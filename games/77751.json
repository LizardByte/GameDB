Express your full creativity and build anything your mind can imagine! There will be 2 distinct modes available, Creator and Builder.\n\nIn the creator mode your only limit is your imagination. All blocks and all materials are to your disposal. You can save your block creations in the library or share them on the workshop\n\nIn the builder mode you will walk through a small campaign where in each level you have to build a more difficult set.\n\nUse you virtual hands to grab and manipulate blocks. When blocks are close enough each other a blue preview will show up. Dropped block will instantly connect to the other block. Help blocks are highlighted, when the disconnect button is hit, the highlighted block is separated from the rest of the group.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blockworks"}
