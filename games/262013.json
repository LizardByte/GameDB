The level should take around 15-20 minutes to complete, and provide a decent challenge. Difficulty levels are supported. Freelook is fine, but avoid jumping.\n\nThe main gimmick of the map is that it uses a snow effect that doesn't require decorate or a more advanced engine, inspired by the old map \"nordhell\" by Eternal/Deadall. The effect can break down if you look at it too closely but most of the time it looks pretty nice.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snowfury"}
