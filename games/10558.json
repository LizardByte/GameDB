What--or who--brought down these ships and is killing their crews? For what reason? And can Powell find a way off-planet before he shares the same fate?", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/morningstar-descent-to-deadrock"}
