It was shot in full 1080p to give the most accurate impression of what the game looks like in action. The trailer gives you a chance to get an impression of some of the maps -- iconic locations in the Pacific Theater such as Guadalcanal, Saipan and Iwo Jima. It also gives you a great chance to see some of the new weapons in action -- the Japanese knee mortar, their rifles, the well-loved Garand and Springfield rifles and the American flamethrower. Not forgetting the Japanese ability to banzai-charge, with leaders waving katanas!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w_NqnnRmsb4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w_NqnnRmsb4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w_NqnnRmsb4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w_NqnnRmsb4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w_NqnnRmsb4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Rising Storm Official GDC Trailer", "description": "This is a brand new trailer for the upcoming Rising Storm, the next game in the Red Orchestra franchise.
