Half out of casual interest and half with serious intent, you ended up taking a look at the club.\n\n\"From now within 7 days, we'll completely sever our attachments to this world and end our own lives.\" You were overcome by the five club members' seriousness and became afraid of committing suicide, quickly coming to think \"I want to live\" instead.\n\nAt the same time, it wasn't like you had the courage nor felt you were in a position to tell them, \"actually, I don't want to die\", knowing that these boys were seriously working towards ending their own lives...\n\nYou carried this secret in your heart and these strange, repulsive 7 days had begun. 7 days of following the boys' desires and dark sides as they headed towards their deaths.", "summary": "Club Suicide is an anti-romanticism otome game developed by Morpath for PC.
