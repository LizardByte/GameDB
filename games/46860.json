One or two players could control space fighters assigned to deal with an alien invasion using incredible firepower through eight stages. The game is somewhat parodical as many of the game\u2019s mini-bosses resemble previous Taito game characters and the ending theme consists of a Beethoven song. \n \nIn the future, Earth has achieved a state of global peace, but one problem has arisen: a wholesale disappearance of young women. A top-secret planetary protection organization investigates the strange disappearances and discovers that the women are being abducted by aliens. The aliens hail from the planet Zancs, where a rampant disease has sterilized the entire female population. Unable to mate with their own kind, the people of Zancs have found the perfect reproductive substitutes in the women of Earth, abducting them to keep the planetary population steady. \n \nTwo fighter pilots - Downson and Bogey - are ordered to rescue the women of Earth, including one of the pilot's significant others, by flying to Zancs and eliminating any threats the inhabitants pose.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/megablast"}
