Since its victory at Dunkirk and the long and costly war against the Soviet Union, Germany\u2019s cruel and nightmarish rule over Europe seems outwardly secure, but as Hitler grows old and ill, instability and rebellion threaten to shake this \u2018New Order\u2019 apart. At the same time, the ripples caused by the fall of Europe roll across the globe changing the course of history, with European colonial empires falling and a rising Chinese Republic eager to fill the vacuum left by a defeated Japan. though the memory of war lies fresh in the memories of everyone, the perverse status quo cannot hold for long\u2026\n\nThousand Week Reich is an alternate history mod that attempts to bring a sense of grounded, gritty realism to the age-old trope of an Axis 'victory' in the Second World War. Originally based on a series of maps by AP246/Proximexo, the TWR mod aims to explore a more grounded and \u2018realistic\u2019 version of the trope of a victorious Nazi Germany. Enter the world of TWR in 1952 and fight to hold onto the disintegrating remains of German \u2018New Order\u2019 or rise up to the task of defeating the oppressor and liberating Europe from Nazi tyranny.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thousand-week-reich"}
