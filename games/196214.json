You'll be tasked with identifying and destroying deadly nanomachine outbreaks on a variety of procedurally generated space faring vessels whilst fighting for survival.\n\nThe game features procedurally generated levels and the stats of the monsters are randomly generated. Players have to use a variety of tools to find the infection and destroy it.\nPlayers will be hunted by horrifying amalgamations of flesh and machine, whilst having to deal with the dangers of living in space as the environment is being corroded away slowly but surely, causing oxygen deprivation and machinery/tool malfunctions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/disinfection"}
