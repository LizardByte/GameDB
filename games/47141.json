He dreamed about completing his father\u2019s work, and spent countless hours imagining there was someone out there listening. Daniel was only 12, but like his father was obsessed with the idea that we were not alone in the universe. His imagination ran wild as he began flipping switches, twisting knobs, turning dials. This is the unknown story of why They are here...\n\nDecades later, alien ships began entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere. At first, contact was peaceful...but then something happened. Computers around the world began malfunctioning. Self-driving cars would crash into each other. Cellphones would overheat and catch fire. Rockets would explode on their launch pads. The humans blamed the Aurayu, but they were battling problems of their own. Their biomechanical immunity implants, which make their long lifespans possible, were failing, and their ships began behaving erratically.\n\nNeither species really knows who shot first. But what we do know is further attempts by either side to improve their technology to combat these malfunctions and defend themselves only made things worse. Some thing happened. They weren\u2019t created. They weren\u2019t programmed. They just were. They call themselves IO. A bit of human and a bit of Aurayu, this new artificial species assembled an army of their own.\n\nYou are a combatant of this war. Will you defend your race from the intrusion of your enemies as a Human? Will you exact revenge on your creators as the IO? Or will you conquer the blue marble for the honor of the Aurayu? Collect resources, conquer enemy territory, and build towers to ensure victory for your race. Be the first to claim your neighborhood, town, and city!\n\nChoose a side, and enlist now\u2026before it\u2019s too late.\n\nTerra Mango awaits you.", "summary": "Terra Mango is a location-based strategy game.
