It is the sequel to Puzzle & Action: Tant-R and is the second of the three games in the series. Gameplay is similar to Tant-R, in that the player must complete a series of mini-games, although its crime theme is replaced with a mediaeval theme. The game was ported to the Sega Game Gear in 1994, Mega Drive in 1995, and released with Sega Ages compilations for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation 2 (Rouka ni Ichidant-R and 2500 Vol.6 respectively). The game was released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. All console versions are Japanese exclusives. The third and final game in the series, Puzzle & Action: Treasure Hunt, was released in 1997.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-and-action-ichidant-r", "collections": [{"id": 6855, "name": "Puzzle & Action"}]}
