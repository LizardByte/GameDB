A real knight in... not so shining armor! When he is not laying siege upon the castles of the duke of Crimson Lands (that sleazy fellow), ambushing fat merchants or fighting for the king in glorious battles he can usually be found drinking with his men in the four legged fowl.\n\nYeh, life went well for old G\u00f6tz but now pesky beaurocrats have convinced the king that canons, lance carrying jockels and peace amongst all duchies (PEACE?!) are the new hot thing in the kingdom. If G\u00f6tz doesn't want to drift into insignificance he must act now!\n\nGo on puzzling handcrafted adventures across medieval europe at the brink of the 15th century and fight for knighthood with all means neccessary to bring the king to reason.\n\nG\u00f6tz is a narrative multiplatform puzzle game available on iOS with Android following in the near future. Stay tuned for news", "summary": "Goetz is a challenging game. But if you have a soft spot for planning ahead and making your units help each other to create a choreography that will bring the enemies to their knees, Goetz is for you.\n\nEach solved mission is accompanied by a rewarding narrative piece, lovingly illustrated and fully voiced by a cast of over 12 voice-over artists. These not only seamlessly tie into the gameplay, but will draw you into a captivating story of friendship and intrigue that never takes itself too seriously.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gotz", "videos": [{"id": 137362, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Y_o-whTa0cU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_o-whTa0cU", "title": "Goetz - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y_o-whTa0cU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
