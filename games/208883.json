With every move, more ice cubes appear, so plan your moves well. Every five levels, a bonus level will fill the screen with ice cubes. Click on a block to remove all connected ice cubes of the same color. After removing those, the remaining ice cubes will fall down to take their place.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/penguin-puzzle"}
