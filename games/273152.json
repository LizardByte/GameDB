The teleporters are being run from a U.S. military establishment on a small, rocky island in the Pacific. Duke is sent there alone (his preference), to find the teleporters and get to the moon base. The trouble is, the moon base is probably locked up. The commander of the base has the only key card - he was murdered in his Embassy Suites hotel room in L.A.. Duke will probably have to retrieve it. If and when he reaches the self destruct center at the base, he will have only a few moments to escape. There is an escape route already defined (leading to the docking bay). It will be opened after the base's self destruct mode has been initiated. Good luck...", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/complex--1"}
