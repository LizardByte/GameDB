You can buy and play them separately, but they link into the same main menu - and, if you have bought them all, you get another bonus game for free (it will be unlocked after you've installed the last game).\n\nEight Ball Chaos is \"billard light\" - you don't play against an opponent, you \"just\" have to shoot the balls in the pockets with the corresponding color. You can get bonus points for scoring tricks, though.
