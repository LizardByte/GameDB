Newcomers, veterans, young and old put their hearts into hundreds of unique experiences, all seeking to share their ideal of a \"Mega Man level\" with the world.\n \nNow, in 2024, the 6th Worldwide Sponsored Robot Tournament has begun. Compiling all of the levels originally submitted, ranked by a team of five judges from worst to best and laid out across fifteen Tiers, Mega Man must challenge not just the entries, but fellow competitors all seeking to prove themselves. \n \nClear the entries. Beat the Tier Bosses. Earn the Ranks. Seize victory.  \n \nBut there is more than meets the eye. The tournament has become a lightning-rod, drawing in a swirling storm of dreams and ambitions with a paradise in its center. \n \nBurning passions. Dubious sponsors. Grudgeful challengers. Unlikely allies. Dark conspiracies... \n \nSecrets, upgrades, room decorations, battles, and more battles....\n \nIn Make a Good Mega Man Level 3, you'll witness a hurricane of blazing ambitions from beginning to end. A massive love letter to the Mega Man community, and the people who make it up. Hours upon hours of lovingly crafted content from both entrants and contest staff alike await.
