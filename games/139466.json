Due to outsider pressure and the willingness for the Red Colony to do anything to be their rivals the Blue Colony, Maria agrees to let Dr J continues his experiments, pretty much unchecked. What could possibly go wrong, right?\n\nA few weeks later, Maria awakens in a dark and damp warehouse with no knowledge of how she got there. All she knows is that there are flesh eating Zombies clawing at the walls and Dr J has something to do with their appearance.\n\nThe Doctor will have to wait though. Maria needs to first save her family and have them escorted from the Colony. Then when they are safe, she can uncover the mystery behind the terrifying Zombies.", "summary": "Red Colony is a 2D Horror Game filled with drama, mystery, zombies and gore.
