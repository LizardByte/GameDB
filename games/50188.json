Engage rival merc squadrons, third world dictators, and the armies of the dreaded IRS. In a world gone mad, there\u2019s plenty of room to fly, all that\u2019s required is the cash.\n\nStrike Commander puts you in the best place to witness fast-paced dogfighting action: the pilot\u2019s seat. Fly high as you take on over 60 missions, each more challenging than the last in your top-of the-line F16 squadron piloted by the best crew in the business (operational success rate of 86%). Strike Commander is a classic flight combat sim where a pilot is only as good as his, or her, last flight. Fly to survive and survive to fly, in this modern-day action-oriented jet fighter combat simulation!\nStrike Commander includes the original game, Strike Commander: Tactical Operations, and the expanded Speech Pack.\nFeatures Gauntlet mode: wave after wave of enemies.See how long you can survive!\nA powerful and gripping story set in an alternative future that didn't turn out quite as expected.", "summary": "After the success of the Wing Commander games, Chris Roberts and Origin turned their eye to developing a story-focused combat flight simulation.
