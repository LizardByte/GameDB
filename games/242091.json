It was produced by Super Game and published by Realtec.\n\nThe game is a recreation of the original Boogerman, but is considerably less faithful than Boogerman II: The Final Adventure, with a mixed-up level order and severely limited abilities for the player, which is compensated for by providing infinite ammo.\n\nLike many of Super Game's other bootlegs, this game has no ending; after the player defeats the third boss, the game merely resets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boogerman"}
