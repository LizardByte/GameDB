In a departure from its predecessor, Famicom Grand Prix II features a behind-the-car view. Rather than consisting of a handful of short tracks, 3D Hot Rally provides three long tracks consisting of a variety of different terrain types giving the feel of an actual rally race. As the name implies, the game allows you to use the Famicom 3D System glasses to give the race a real feeling of depth.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/famicom-grand-prix-ii-3d-hot-rally"}
