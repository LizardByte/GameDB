{"id": "uZufZyJw59E", "snippet": {"title": "Hyper DBZ Eighteen and Krillin by Team Z2 Release Trailer!", "description": "!MERRY CHRISTMAS!\nWell, we originally wanted to release our big new build of the game around now but it proved more work than we could chew off in time. That's delayed until 2020. However we didn't want to leave you guys and gals empty-handed on the holidays, so we scrambled and crunched to wrap up the two characters that were the furthest into development - Android Eighteen and Krillin!\n\nThe main big dogs working on these have been NicotineFist and XGargoyle on Eighteen (sprites and coding respectively) and Daeron and JustNoPoint on Krillin (sprites and coding respectively).\nBut honestly every team member has contributed in some way.\n\nSpecial mention to the voice actors for these characters:\nDanielle McRae for Eighteen: https://twitter.com/DanielleMcVO\nAnd our MVP voice lord David Dixon (ShockDingo) for Krillin.\n\nThough we always strive for the highest quality we can achieve, these are still the first public releases - beta versions. So even after extensive testing, you may encounter bugs. Or maybe not! However if you do, especially if it's a game-breaking one, please report it to us!\nYou can find us on the Hyper DBZ Discord: https://discord.gg/PPrnAb8\n\nBoth characters can be found and downloaded from here: http://network.mugenguild.com/balthazar/chars_z2.html\nMost of you should be familiar with adding characters to your Hyper DBZ build or personal MUGEN. Though if you're still a bit green in that regard, check out this how-to video narrated by Goku himself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1YvNtg06ps\n\nTheir stages can be found on this page: http://network.mugenguild.com/balthazar/stages.html\n(Eighteen's stage is Mountain Road and Krillin's is Kame House Sunset. Both come with their corresponding background music included in the download).\nAs an added Christmas bonus, we've released yet another stage, put together by Ethan the Human - Baba's Palace! It can be found on that same Hyper DBZ Stages page.\n\nThe music featured in this video is by DaMarcus008. The theme for Eighteen is a CPS3 remix of a classic japanese DBZ track for the Androids, which also makes a special appearance in the Eighteen Z2 character. It's backing one of the coolest new moves in the game!\nThe theme for Krillin is, well, Krillin's theme - \"Don't Underestimate Me\".\nYou can find these themes and many more awesome CPS3 themes on his Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/damarcus008\n\nIf you enjoy watching and playing this game please share it around! One of the most rewarding feelings for us is watching other people play the game and having a blast. So grab your mates and throw together some local tournaments!
