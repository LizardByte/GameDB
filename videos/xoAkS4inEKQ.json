To escape, you need to collect all the Animal Powers scattered across the land, in mysterious blue boxes.\n\nOnce you collect an Animal Power, you can shapeshift into that Animal for 10 seconds maximum. Some animals destroy enemies, some are invulnerable, some are scary, some can ride through lava, other can fly, some are invisible, and other are, well, surprising.\n\nThere are 20 different animals to collect, will you catch them all ?\n\nMusic by Uniform Motion : https://uniformmotion.bandcamp.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xoAkS4inEKQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xoAkS4inEKQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xoAkS4inEKQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xoAkS4inEKQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xoAkS4inEKQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Shapeshifter Biker", "description": "You're a shapeshifter biker, all alone in a desolated world, chased by angry ducks in black trucks.
