Every so often, a strange this happened in this place: a yokai in the shape of a giant foot appeared and demanded to be cleaned. If the resident cleaned the foot, the foot left peacefully. However, if the foot was not cleaned, then the foot stomped throughout the house and destroyed everything.\n\nAshi Wash is our take on this Japanese folktale.\n\nIn Ashi Wash, you have three minutes to clean the giant foot. There are tools scattered throughout the house to help you. Get crackin'!\nAlso included in the download is a Virtual Reality version of the game. We know you've dreamed of cleaning a giant obnoxious foot in VR and your dreams are about to come true.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
