{"id": "CzQ56XwPep8", "snippet": {"title": "Orb Runner Launch Trailer", "description": "Orb Runner is now available for purchase on Itch.io -- https://lavoie-studios.itch.io/orb-runner\n--\nDetailed Game Description: \n\nOrb Runner is a game I originally made in the time span of a week. After some feedback from followers, I have decided to make a full playable title.\n\nThe objective of Orb Runner is to complete levels as fast as possible. You have 2 minutes on the clock to reach the finish before time runs out and you fail the level. Orbs can be collected on the way to increase your score, multiplier and number of lives.\n\nThe game comes with 2 game-modes, Normal and Endless. In Normal mode, you progress through the levels in chronological order and have access to collecting the secret hidden orbs for bonus xp. Endless mode allows you to endlessly progress through levels in any random order but you must complete Normal mode to gain access.\n\nThe game also comes with a selection of in game achievements and a player xp system. The more orbs you collect, the more xp you gain and the faster you can move, sprint, and dash, along with increase time on the clock. \n\nFor more information, visit my Discord server for all my self titles - https://discord.gg/XXdKYeareN\n\n---\r\n\r\n\u25ba Join the Discord Server: https://discord.gg/XXdKYeareN\r\n\n\u25ba Follow Me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BBPGames\r\n\r\n\u25ba BBP Games Merchandise: http://tee.pub/lic/BBP-Games", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzQ56XwPep8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzQ56XwPep8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzQ56XwPep8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzQ56XwPep8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CzQ56XwPep8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Orb Runner Launch Trailer", "description": "Orb Runner is now available for purchase on Itch.io -- https://lavoie-studios.itch.io/orb-runner\n--\nDetailed Game Description: \n\nOrb Runner is a game I originally made in the time span of a week.
