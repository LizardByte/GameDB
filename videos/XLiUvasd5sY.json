You can download this Sonic Robo Blast 2 mod from here:\nhttps://mb.srb2.org/showthread.php?t=50008\n\nIt's Sonic but with Persona gameplay. I'll be honest, I never played the Persona games, or RPG's for that matter. And the reason is simple, I don't like RPG's... like... at all (only exception being Undertale, but that one is the outlier). I won't explain why I don't like them in the description, but even with that in mind, I still find this SRB2 mod to be really really REALLY cool.\n\nAnd after playing it... I still don't like RPG's... but dammit if it isn't worth playing.\n\nAnyways, please enjoy the video. :)\n\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/marius_rednblue\nMy Steam Page: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106610936", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLiUvasd5sY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLiUvasd5sY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLiUvasd5sY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLiUvasd5sY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XLiUvasd5sY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic The Hedgehog But It's Actually Persona - Sonic Robo Blast 2: Persona", "description": "Mod made by Lat' as well as various other modders/programmers.
