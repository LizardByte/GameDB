We like making maps, we were aware of Eternity\u2019s capabilities, and we decided it\u2019d be fun to create some maps that made use of those capabilities. We organized a little project amongst a few of ourselves, and over time it evolved into this.\n\nVaporware also includes a large quantity of new resources, including textures, monsters, weapons, ambient sounds, and an original ogg-format soundtrack composed by Julian Hope and Esselfortium.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vaporware"}
