The player must make sure that the leader stays alive, until the army reaches the enemy castle to defeat the leader of the opposing forces.\n\nThe game was responsible for laying the foundations for the tactical role-playing game genre, or the \"simulation RPG\" genre as it is known in Japan, with its blend of role-playing and strategy game elements. The game has also variously been described as an early example of an action role-playing game, an early prototype real-time strategy game, and a unique reverse tower defense game. In its time, the game was considered a major success in Japan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bokosuka-wars"}
