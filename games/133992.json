Ancient orbital paths and gravitational partnerships were forever altered, and our centuries-old knowledge of them was rendered unreliable. The calculated, near-zero risk of an asteroid impact on an inhabited world suddenly became unknown. \n \nThe Solar Union scrambled to recalculate the odds, to find lost objects before they could strike one of its five member worlds. Nuclear warheads were stockpiled and aimed at the skies of the Incorporated Planet of Mercury, the Republic of Mars, the Federation of Jupiter, and the Colonial Republic of Titan. Meanwhile, on Earth, they built something entirely new: the Ra laser. An orbital, Solar-powered cannon capable of reaching across the Solar System and removing kilometres-wide objects from existence. \n \nThe power within the Eye of Ra defends us all from the modern asteroid threat. The Solar Union entrusts Earth with the protection of its member worlds, who in turn entrusts the Eye of Ra to one technician: you.", "summary": "ATMOSPHERIC SPACE SIMULATION \n \n- Played entirely within fictional operating system sMaat 9 \n- Simulation of 250+ solar bodies \n- Exploratory narrative told through email, news headlines, and REGISTRY database entries", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 36070, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "D341VLU0Wng", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D341VLU0Wng", "title": "Eye of Ra Gameplay: Event 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D341VLU0Wng/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
