Upon nearing the puzzle the game begins and the player is offered the first clues. Cell 1 is preselected for the player to enter a letter. None of the cells are numbered, however when selected a cell changes colour and any associated clues are displayed in a window in the lower right corner of the game area. Answers are entered letter by letter and to do this the player must select each cell individually, enter a letter, then select the next cell, enter the next letter and so on.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberspace-crossword-puzzle"}
