You once again take on the role of Matt Hazard, parodying gaming clich\u00e9s. In order to stop the evil Marathon MegaCorp from consigning Matt to certain death, he must travel back in time to stop them. In order to deal with the minions of Marathon, Matt will have an arsenal of standard weapons at his disposal that includes shotguns, plasma rifles, flamethrowers and grenades, which can be upgraded as the game progresses, you will also be able to find various power ups that will aid Matt's quest. The shoulder buttons also allow you to enter the precision aim mode, which allows you to conserve your limited ammunition.\n\nThere is a two player co-op mode available, in which the second player assumes the role of Matt's partner, Dexter Dare.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/matt-hazard-blood-bath-and-beyond", "videos": [{"id": 64688, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Qu_hptnnhNM"}]}
