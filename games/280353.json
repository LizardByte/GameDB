But beware. Your greed will attract the alien. Use warships and defense platforms to protect your fleet at all costs - in real space, in real time.\n\nStarminer is a space industry and logistics simulation that strives to be at the forefront of space strategy gaming, blending cutting-edge rendering technologies with deep tactical and creative gameplay. It's set against backdrops of fully-realized 3D environments, where the beauty of space becomes an integral part of player immersion, setting Starminer apart as a visually stunning and technologically advanced space base-building game. Starminer is built with realism and immersion as core design pillars through the incorporation of Newtonian physics for propulsion and movement. This not only adds a layer of authenticity and complexity to the gameplay but also introduces a rewarding learning curve for players seeking a genuinely advanced spacefaring experience.\n\nIn Starminer, the universe is more than just a pretty backdrop for exploration and conquest\u2014it's a playground for players to explore their creativity and long-term ambitions for their fleets. Central to the game's creative ethos is the ability to design a variety of space stations that bring them toward their goals; whether it's to mine resources, be a defensive power, colonization, energy production, or something else entirely. The dynamic and customizable nature of these different types of stations means that the player doesn\u2019t only decide what their cosmic empire will be; it will become a unique reflection of their strategic prowess and imaginative flair.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starminer", "videos": [{"id": 103419, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "MtekOaZmaBc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtekOaZmaBc", "title": "Starminer Announcement | Paradox Arc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MtekOaZmaBc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 115379, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "82fGMm_YQqs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82fGMm_YQqs", "title": "STARMINER - Navigation Gameplay Trailer | Paradox Arc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/82fGMm_YQqs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
