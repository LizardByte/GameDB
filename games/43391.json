Updated D1 Grand Prix data from the 2005 racing season is included, as are new cars and new courses, including more than ten technical courses. Also features GT Force and GT Force Pro wheel support.\nFor American gamers (this being the first of the series here), the game has been kept close to the Japanese original (including all the real pro Japanese drivers). A tutorial mode is added to teach players the unique demands of professional drift racing, and the game's brutal commentator team has been redone with snide English-language voices.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/d1-professional-drift-grand-prix-series"}
