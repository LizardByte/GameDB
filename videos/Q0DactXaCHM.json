Chicks follow you in a long procession, and can get scattered around, should a cat come into contact with them.\n\nOverall, Flicky is a pretty cool arcade game for the era. It's simple to pick up, but tough to master, and still remains pretty fun today.\n\nVideo Notes\n---------------------------------------------------\n- Game has no ending.
