Let them co-exist with the general population or lock them away in a padded cell, how you manage their needs is up to you!\n\nSHRINKS\n\nAny prison holding the criminally insane needs a team of Psychiatrists and trained Orderlies to keep everything under control. These valuable prison staff can sedate rowdy prisoners or pull out the straitjackets when things get too rough.\n\nDOCTOR'S NOTE\n\nProvide counselling to the criminally insane with the new Psychiatrist\u2019s Office. Improve their sessions by upgrading the office with leather sofas, medicine cabinets, and Rorschach tests.\n\nIT'S GONE VIRAL\n\nTreat your inmates with care. Subjecting your inmates to excessive suppression or punishment can cause them to turn criminally insane.\n\nEXTRA PADDING\n\nPsych Ward: Warden\u2019s Edition adds padded cells along with a bundle of new objects, floors, and wall types to customize your prison. Now you can easily build a dedicated wing for the criminally insane.\n\nTOOLS OF THE TRADE\n\nAdditional contraband, including Adrenaline Shots, Fountain Pens (Shanks), and Gold Pocket Watches, can be stolen by your prisoners, or by you in Escape Mode.", "summary": "Welcome to the Psych Ward!
