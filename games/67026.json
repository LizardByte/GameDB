The game features Kinopio (Toad in English translations) as the primary character, guiding players through the quizzes and minigames. The game was distributed as a Periodic Soundlink release.\n\nDuring the Satellaview's early years, St.GIGA broadcasted quiz events called Waiwai de Q (\u300c\u308f\u3044\u308f\u3044\u3067\uff31\u300d), which would phase into being called Satella-Q after the third event. These aired in periodic intervals, unlike their traditional Soundlink broadcasts wherein the episodes were played week-by-week until the conclusion. In October 1995, Satella-Q would be merged with another earlier sound magazine called WaiWai Check (\u300c\u308f\u3044\u308f\u3044\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af\u300d) to again form WaiWai de Q.\n\nThe game used the Satellaview's Soundlink technology to give the presentation of a quiz game show, with announcers presenting the questions for players to answer and music ranging from various sources ranging from classical to J-Pop to British Rock given use, sometimes playing key roles in the quizzes themselves.\n\nEach episode was split into \"rounds\" that consisted of various types of quizzes, both in \"multiple-choice\" and \"type-out the answer\" forms, which ranged from Japanese cultural trivia to guessing the contents of obscured photo-realistic pictures.\n\nSometimes non-quiz mini-games would also be played, including one where players must move Toad through an area resembling a pool table, collecting the balls that the on-screen HUD requests. Another one features a game of cards that uses Poker cards with Yoshi on their backs.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 35129, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9IHjUyEuIbQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IHjUyEuIbQ", "title": "NND Videos Combined - BS \u30b5\u30c6\u30e9Q \u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089\u5e73\u6210Q\u5e74 | Satella-Q \"Sayonara Heisei Q-Nen\"", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9IHjUyEuIbQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
