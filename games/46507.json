And it might also seem to be a bit unusual for another Kaboom! clone to be made for the system as well (Vaboom!, as the first clone, Spike's Water Balloons, from the All Good Things cartridge, was released four years earlier). Arguably, this odd pairing of games makes this cartridge still stand out a bit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vectrace"}
