Enemies and bosses fire way more bullets and are way more aggressive. They might also have more health. \n\nIn this game you can shoot to the right and to the left. Holding up while shooting will make you shoot diagonally up. \nYou also have a lock-on laser system for shooting enemies in the background. You stop shooting to lock-on and press shot to release (or hold shot if you're using the manual setting). \nYou can jump as well as double jump. You will always jump the maximum height when you press the button, but you can cancel it into a dash.\nDashing gives you some invincibility frames. Dashing is very important for dodging bullets and getting the right jump height.\nJumping has some funky properties to it. If you hold right and jump at the same time, you'll do a somersault, but if you press jump and then hold right, you'll do a normal jump. Kinda like in Super Metroid I guess.\nSomersaulting makes your shot lose a lot of forward focus damage, so you have to be somewhat mindful of that. \nYou can also press down+jump in the air to quickly land, as well as jump on enemies Mario-style.\nYour main shot and subshot is actually divided between two characters. You control both at the same time, but they can desync under certain circumstances. Make sure you don't let the partner fall into a hole, because you'll have to wait a long time before you can get her back.\nThe partner controls the lock-on lasers, so you'll lose that ability as well.\n\nThis fourth team I'm using unlocks after you beat the game with the other three teams (you can use continues).\nThe magic missiles the partner shoots work kinda like the bombs in Progear and are pretty powerful. \n\nThere are a bunch of powerups in this game and they're all dropped from red crows. What items drop is fixed.\n- Invisible - Gives you invincibility for a short amount of time.\n- Bonus - Gives 50k points. \n- Shot - Gives you a hyper with limited ammo, so don't waste it. Your shot will do a ton of damage.\n- Laser - Upgrades your maximum lock-on's for the duration of the stage.\n- Recover - Refills your health back to full.\n\nThere are no lives in this game, if your health reaches zero, it's game over. \nLuckily your health refills between stages and there are some items in the stages that recover your health.\n\nThe game is quite hard if you don't use some of these speedkill strats for the bosses. I actually have no idea how you do some patterns without them. \n\nYou might see me dashing into bullets or enemies for no reason sometimes. This is because double-tapping left or right makes you dash.\nIt's extremely obnoxious, it gets in the way and there is no way to disable it as far as I know. I end up taking a lot of unnecessary damage because of this.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://twitter.com/JaimersSTG\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/jaimersstg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gB3vfYbQPP8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gB3vfYbQPP8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gB3vfYbQPP8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gB3vfYbQPP8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gB3vfYbQPP8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\u5c71\u767e\u5408\u9023\u5f3e Lilian Fourhand - Hard Mode 1cc", "description": "Charming little game that's pretty fun to play.\n\nHard mode is the hardest difficulty setting in the game.
