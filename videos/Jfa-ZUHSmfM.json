It was made by me yesterday (day 2) with my learning in editing. It is the release trailer for the fan game inspired by the Donkey Kong Country commercial from Nintendo CES 1994. (Best known for \"Not on Sega\")\n\nFor those who don't know, the game is now available and is complete! But since June 1st, revision 2 has already been corrected, correcting some things that the first version had. For those who don't know how to save the game, (yes, this is the first time I've implemented the save option in one of my projects and it was a lot of work) just pause the game (in-game) and press \"backspace\". The game will restart but will already be saved when you press start on the title screen.\n\nAnother way to save is by pressing \"no\" on the game over screen. If you have an old game save, unfortunately you will have to remove it to avoid revision bugs.\n\nCollecting all \"DK Coins\" in the game will reward you with a secondary sub-adventure (as if it were an episode 2) in the lost world with a final battle totally different from those seen in the Donkey Kong Country series. And here's a spoiler that won't affect anything: there are two rounds.\n\nI still need to remember that the texts will undergo alignment corrections in the future, because the way I made the texts (the only one I found) is difficult to know if it is aligned in-game, resulting in half of the same word being on top and another one below.\n\n*EPILEPSY ALERT*\n*Download* (PC Only)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1I7t6Otlrb5dOlyaf8NIn0rXKT6qGXvLm/view?usp=drive_link\n(Download pauses will be taken.
