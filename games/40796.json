There are two distinct stages: During the first, the player simply has to dodge incoming obstacles (trees) and points are awarded for every kilometer. During the second stage, the obstacles are replaced by animals (e.g. deer or wolves), the player gets a gun and points are awarded for shootings. The player character can move freely during both. The two stages alternate and become faster over time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ski-hunt", "videos": [{"id": 132045, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VbPAz8bnLOo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbPAz8bnLOo", "title": "Ski Hunt for the Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VbPAz8bnLOo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
