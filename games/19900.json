She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to help her break chests open.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 47255, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9tFfxahz9L8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tFfxahz9L8", "title": "Disney's The Little Mermaid (1991) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9tFfxahz9L8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
