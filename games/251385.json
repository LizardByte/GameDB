If you don't, you'll lose a heart. You start the game with only 10 hearts, so you'll have to make sure you don't lose too many or else you'll lose the game.\n\nTo hit the ball in Monogolf, all you have to do is slide your finger back to adjust the power and the direction of your hit. Before you let go, you'll have to keep a couple important factors in mind, like the different surfaces the ball will roll over and how that will affect your shot, or the walls it can bounce off of, and so on.\n\nIn Monogolf, you'll find more than 100 different levels which you can unlock as you beat the easier levels in the beginning. Each time you beat a level, you'll get some orange hexagons (the game's currency) that you can then use to increase the maximum number of lives you have or get other useful abilities.\n\nIf 100 levels isn't enough, there's also a scenario editor so you can create your own. Once you create a level, you can send it to the developers on Twitter. The best ones will appear in the game.\n\nMonogolf is an excellent mini golf game with nice graphics, relaxing music, and a simple, fun, and addictive gameplay.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monogolf", "videos": [{"id": 90727, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-IQnnx1wnfM"}]}
