Nature is rich, and all kinds of animals live peacefully together with the fairies. The fairies live with various things found in nature. Nothing in nature can survive without a fairy. [so basically, the fairy world is reliant on fairy magic to run properly.] They dwell together with all kinds of things, from water to the green of forests to fire to wind. Every fairy possesses magic as well. It's not intended to hurt anyone; instead, this magic is used to maintain the peace of the fairies' and animals' world. One of the fairies, the flower fairy Lip, is a cheerful and spirited young girl. Unfortunately, she isn't very good at using peacekeeping magic yet, so she has to use the help of her magic wand to cast spells. One day, out of nowhere, monsters appeared in this peaceful land and started wreaking havoc. They bullied the fairies, laid waste to the world, and did whatever they pleased! As if that weren't enough, they cast an evil spell on the fairies who were best friends with each other, causing them to fight with each other! \"At this rate, those monsters will take over the entire fairy world!\" One fairy alone--Lip, who managed to escape from the monsters' magic--went to rescue her fellow fairies.", "summary": "A tile matching puzzle game for the Super Famicom, the first in the Puzzle League series.
