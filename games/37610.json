The player is an ostrich named Ozzie and must walk around a grid, pecking at certain lynchpin areas of the ground in order to collapse parts of the level into the ocean. The goal is to remove all enemies by dropping the ground they're walking on. It is structurally similar to Dig Dug 2. \n \nThe game has a multiplayer mode, which allows two players to try to outmaneuver and out-think each other.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
