Fuel must be collected along the way, and at the bottom of the last level a Martian base must be destroyed. Horizontal sections provide variety, scrolling is smooth, and the fast paced, though methodical shooting action is intensely enjoyable, making this a truly addictive game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/caverns-of-mars", "videos": [{"id": 104888, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fr-UMY4iuqo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr-UMY4iuqo", "title": "Caverns of Mars (1981) Atari 800 (No commentary)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fr-UMY4iuqo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
