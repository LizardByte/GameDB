The player can shoot in eight directions. There are also different second characters that the player can indirectly control through AI. There are multiple weapons that can be collected and that can be switched at will. There is a lifebar that regenerates if no damage is taken for a period of time. The game has a save system. The game also contains many anime cutscenes. There is an English fan translation available for this game. The game is currently freeware.\n\nThe game uses two buttons.\nWith a button you shoot, with the other you change weapon. If you press both a menu will appear. The menu allows the following actions: equip , plan , info , talk , load, save , options.\n\nTWO CENTS\n\nNot much to say, the game is well done, with a good story and a good gameplay.  The graphics in not the best in the world  but it's ok. The musics are very nice and appopriate to the different situations. Unfortunately is not possible to play in co-op.\nThe game is fun and so it's recommended.\n\nI had to split the video in two parts because my computer is not powerful enough to eleborate a video so long.\n\nA VERY BIG THANK to Radical R for the translation!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7C-rFwTDbh8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7C-rFwTDbh8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7C-rFwTDbh8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7C-rFwTDbh8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "[x68000] Die Bahnwelt - Longplay (part 1)", "description": "Die Bahnwelt is a multi-directional Run and gun that was released for the Sharp X68000 in 1992 by Glodia.\n\nThe title literally means Train World in German (that makes no sense)\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe player directly moves one character in three dimensions in an overhead perspective through science fiction themed dungeons.
