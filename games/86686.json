But instead of moving the snake in a window, the snake moves across your screen itself, or even from screen to screen.\n\nThis version includes multiplayer games, highscores, levels, and various little additions that should make the gameplay comfortable and fun. Perfect when you have to wait for your computer to finish something, or if you want to play a game behind the back of your teacher or parent.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/screen-snake"}
