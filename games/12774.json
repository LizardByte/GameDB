The playfield \u201cwrapped\u201d, so if anything went off-screen it reappeared on the opposite side.\n\nStardust featured five different worlds (all connected by 3D hyperspace tunnels) and 30 action-packed levels full of asteroids, enemies, and bosses bent on destruction.\n\nAt game\u2019s end, the evil mutant penguin Professor Schaumund made his first-ever appearance (and subsequent escape), meaning he could (and did) return to wreak cosmic havoc in future Stardust titles!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stardust", "videos": [{"id": 8921, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "vtx0Tdl48RI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtx0Tdl48RI", "title": "Housemarque Let's Play Episode 20 - Stardust", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vtx0Tdl48RI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
