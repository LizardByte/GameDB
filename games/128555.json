It subtly connects players in real-time across the world, to help one another in a battle against gravity. \n \n* Build a Tower. The mission is simple. But once again, things get in the way... Explosives, thunderstorms, completely incompetent colleagues. Oh, and have you heard of this thing called gravity? \n \n* Play with your friends. Dreii automatically connects all screens across all platforms. This means you can even play with your friends who have Dreii on their mobiles. \n \n* Speak in 19 Languages. Dreii features an universal communication tool which allows players to speak to others, wherever they are in the world. \n \n* Let's Dance! One of the best thing about Dreii is how it sounds. Each player has its very own instrument. Avatars work together to form Dreii's unique universal orchestra, creating a unique musical landscape, inspired by archaic instruments and ancient melodies. \n \n* Uber Swiss Design. Dreii is designed to be as universal as possible. However, in a strange way it's also very Swiss, where it was made. Clean typography, minimalism with attention to detail. Maybe that is why it has won the European Design Award.", "videos": [{"id": 33165, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qkrWSxGNHN0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkrWSxGNHN0", "title": "Dreii Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qkrWSxGNHN0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
