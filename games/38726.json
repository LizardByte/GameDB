(Not that anyone has actually seen a Blob up close, but everyone knows they\u2019re hideous!) Go on stealth missions, run alien blockades, and investigate mysterious planets, \"aided\" by Lloyd, your insufferably obnoxious shipboard computer.\n\nFor example, suppose Lloyd has just informed you that your ship will crash land on the jungle moon of Cygnus Delta in 93 seconds. What will you do?\n\nA) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moon's gravity well.\nB) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he's so smart.\nC) Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moon's surface instead of attempting a risky escape.\nD) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloyd's screen with a torque wrench.\n\nHumanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero? Will you uncover the secret that sparked the Blob invasion? Will you serve as ambassador and convince the Blobs to spare the human race? The choice is yours.", "summary": "Choice of the Star Captain is the hilarious interactive science-fiction novel where your choices determine how the story proceeds.
