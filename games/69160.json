A dire situation for Wallace who is a little bit afraid of commitment to say the least. At the same time his new business, \"Golden Retrieval\" - specialist on finding lost items -, is off to a hard start with Major Crum not really knowing what exactly he has lost. Ultimately everything leads to the Picklet Thicklet golf club which has lost it's deed to its golf course and has always been a thorn in the eye of the Flitt-family.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 32237, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5kgMwW5rDwc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kgMwW5rDwc", "title": "Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kgMwW5rDwc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
