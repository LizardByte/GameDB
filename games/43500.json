With simple controls and simple objectives, it's a game that anyone can pick up and play. \n \nYou and up to three friends are dropped into a small environment which quickly comes to life in bright colors and intense sounds as simple but devious enemies do everything in their power to knock you and your friends off the edge. You can work together to keep the game going for as long as possible \u2026 or knock each other around to try to earn the highest score! Rack up points by surviving consecutive waves, defeating enemies, and defeating each other. Watch out for sudden events that can mix up gameplay, including power-ups and wild changes in the world's behavior! \n \nSpin the Beat can be played with 1 to 4 simultaneous players on a single screen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spin-the-beat", "videos": [{"id": 23316, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Ic6pAd72HeA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic6pAd72HeA", "title": "Spin the Beat - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ic6pAd72HeA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
