The concept is simple : crash for cash by creating the biggest car crash.  \n  \nThe Danger Zone is a virtual Crash Testing Facility where players step into the shoes of a dangerous driver and are challenged to survive a variety of spectacular crash testing scenarios.  \n  \nIt\u2019s easy to crash, but can you also grab all of the Bonus Pickups?  \n  \nPowered by Unreal Engine, Danger Zone combines real physical crashes with explosive gameplay. Shunt vehicles into oncoming traffic, take down trailers to shed their payloads and use your explosive \u201cSmashBreaker\u201d to move your vehicle around. The more explosions you cause, the bigger your score.  \n  \nIf you\u2019re feeling burnt out by congestion and jammed roads, take the highway to the Danger Zone. Take your revenge on rush hour traffic. This place is a paradise for those who like their driving flame-grilled.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/danger-zone"}
