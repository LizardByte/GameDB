Dropping a resident on the ground will cost you a life. As you build up points, the game will speed up and you may be forced to juggle two, three or even four victims at a time.\n\nOnce the ambulance is full, rush them to hospital for treatment. Crashing the ambulance into other cars will damage it \u2013 ultimately the ambulance will break down and cost you a life. As your score increases, the traffic on the way to the hospital will become busier making accidents more common. Pick up the bonus coins to build your score.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
