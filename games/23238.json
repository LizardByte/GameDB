Like its predecessor, it is a hybrid of wrestling game and arcade versus fighter, with over-the-top, unrealistic moves. Concept and presentation are similar to Mortal Kombat games: digitized sprites are used to represent the wrestlers, and the game features finished moves that are performed before the final pin. There are a total of ten WWF wrestlers in the game: The British Bulldog, Goldust, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Ahmed Johnson, Shawn Michaels, The Ultimate Warrior, The Undertaker, and Vader. A new four-player mode is available.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wwf-in-your-house"}
