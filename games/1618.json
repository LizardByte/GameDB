Fighting is set as one-on-one combat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a \"Fatality\" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat--2", "videos": [{"id": 44131, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6jgrW12Eg_A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jgrW12Eg_A", "title": "Arcade Longplay [050] Mortal Kombat", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jgrW12Eg_A/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
