Scientists conduct research and develop new products, bringing your company profit. Conveniently, the products your company's scientists develop take the form of new weapons that you and your fellow security officers can use to pound the other company into submission.\n\nYour company needn't be happy just letting it's small staff of scientists toil away at new developments when there are plenty more scientist resources ripe for the picking at the competition. Stealing scientists from your rivals is a great way to boost productivity and keep those new weapons coming, but of course your competition has the same tactics in mind. So defending your company's scientists is just as important as \"finding\" new ones. Of course, the vagaries of particle physics are difficult to ponder in the middle of a firefight, so if you expect your scientists to be productive, you'd better keep the fight as far from them as possible.", "summary": "Science and Industry is a teamplay mod for Half-Life, in which players assume the role of Security Officer in one of two rival corporations striving for domination in the cutthroat world of chemical and weapons research and development.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 76428, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5-0Oi9VIgCw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-0Oi9VIgCw", "title": "Half Life 1 Mod - Science & Industry - 0.97b Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5-0Oi9VIgCw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 76429, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "p2YWhqR1ALI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2YWhqR1ALI", "title": "Half-Life-Science And Industry Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p2YWhqR1ALI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
