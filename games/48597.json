He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning \"Monmotaro\" (not to be confused with \"Momotar\u014d\"), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
