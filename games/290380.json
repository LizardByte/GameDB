It s not a space sim - it s a combined indoor/outdoor shooter. So don t look for physical realism - look for action and cunning! The gameplay demo is just a conceptual version of FreeGen which demonstrates the main idea of the game. The demo is LAN multiplayer only without Internet and singleplay (bots) which of course will be added later. In the final release most code (graphics and network engine AI etc.) and art will be changed or replaced. We just think that conceptual demo is better than conceptual art or movies and screenshots.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/freegen"}
