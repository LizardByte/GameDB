The rules are simple: switch the orbits, survive against all odds and keep calm. A tap is all it takes to get through. But you'll discover less is more when your dexterity starts to be put to the test. Starting of fairly simple and gradually building up into something quite fiendish, the game will keep your grey matter ticking over in unison with the stimulating techno sounds. Appearing out of nowhere and vanishing in darkness, the round-dancing shapes will make your head swim, hands sweat and teeth clench. But as you get the rhythm you will see that there's nothing more satisfying than the feeling of genuine achievement after you've nailed another hellish level.
