World was released worldwide on July 27, 2010. However, people who ordered a \"Starter Pack\" had an early \"head-start\" in the game, which started on July 20, 2010.\nNeed for Speed: World, along with other EA free-to-play titles Battlefield Heroes, Battlefield Play4Free, and FIFA World, went offline on July 14, 2015.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-world", "videos": [{"id": 118248, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cpmw_eTphFU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpmw_eTphFU", "title": "Need For Speed World Offline - Lamborghini Reventon - Late Departure", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cpmw_eTphFU/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 12, "name": "Need for Speed"}]}
