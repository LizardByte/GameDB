The tanks are controlled by two joysticks in a dual configuration. Pushing both joysticks will move the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Moving the right joystick forward while pulling the left joystick back will cause the tank to turn right, while reversing the motion will cause the tank to turn left. The players are represented by one black and one white tank sprite, and mines are denoted by an \"X\". Points are scored by shooting the opponent or when a player runs over a mine; the player with the highest score at the end of the time limit wins the game.\n\nTank was also one of very few games to be ported onto 1st generation consoles, usually under the title \"Tank Battle\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 15992, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "3OsBUzYBJgU"}]}
