It was developed by two former employees of the software house Taskset.\n\nThe aim of the game is to find and collect ten cassette tapes of dance music, get people to dance to them by blasting them with notes from your ghetto blaster, then delivering them to your record company, Interdisc. These ten music tracks were played by the game throughout. A maze of streets, alleyways and cul-de-sacs are laid out, populated by bizarre characters, some helpful and some deadly.\n\nThe street names are named after famous songs (\"Blackberry Way\", \"Desolation Row\", etc.) - a map was provided in the cassette inlay - and some of the characters reference others (one to avoid is the Psycho Killer, while the Jumpin' Jack Flash It's A Gas Gas Gas takes you to a tape's location)."}
