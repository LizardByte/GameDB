He is a pirate around 1641, who while he has some problems with his compass, he and his crew get near an island (devil's island), where seems to be Redbeard (a bad guy) with his crew. In a night attack, Redbeard's men steal ship's resources and kidnap Jeremy's crew. It seems that there was a traitor between Jeremy's crew, that broke the compass in the first place. Only Jeremy manages to escape using his cabin double wall. The next day he begins his quest to free all of his crew, take his money back and perhaps more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/traps-n-treasures"}
