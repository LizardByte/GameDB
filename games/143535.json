Earth governments try to rebuild the remnants of civilization after the war against Hell. Meanwhile Cabalco remained latent, waiting for the right moment to take over the old UAC facilities. The goal of Cabalco is to build its own portal generator, not just to bring back all the Cabal fallen army, but to resurrect Tchernobog.\n\nDuring the process of opening the portal, the Cabal's engineers detected an anomaly surely due to a bad adjustment of the collider. This produced an space-time disturbance in which the past (Blood) merged with the present (Doom II) in a fragmented universe known as the Void.\n\nAnd not only that! The vortex brought back Cabal's army along with all the demons from hell slaughtered by Doomguy!\n\nCabalco sorcerers tried to put the Icon of Sin under their control. But after several attempts, they found it was an impossible task. War of The Void begins...\n\nBeing unable to subdue the army of hell, Cabalco scientists created the Hybrids. Servile and lethal creatures, combining Hell demons and Cabal forces.\n\nLuckily, on this occasion, Doomguy won't be alone. The time vortex fusion brought an ally: Caleb.\n\nTogether they will not only fight to destroy the demons and acolytes of Cabal, but also the secret weapon of Cabal, the hybrid creatures!", "summary": "Bloom (sometimes stylized as BlooM) is a mod for id Software's video game Doom II.
