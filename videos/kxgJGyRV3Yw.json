Player takes on the role of a powerful mage-ruler capable of moving and reshaping parts of the planet. Both game mechanics and history are based on an innovative concept of dynamic topography and issuing orders to individuals with free will.\n\n\u2003Become a powerful mage and rule the Driftland. Develop a great empire and set objectives for its army.\n\n\u2003In the face of the destruction of an entire civilization and life on the planet, warring parties decided to call a truce and tried to repair the damage. For that, however, was already too late. Using all the remaining magic resources to cast a powerful spell, they managed to keep their world in a relative balance. Many dark ages have passed, but when all seemed lost, a spark of hope shined once again: new sources of magic appeared and the whole planet began to give birth to new mages. Now, the rediscovered power can either restore Driftland to its former glory or devastate what's left of the planet, when the old conflict inevitably returns.\n\n\u2003You take the role of a Mage Overlord with your own castle, tower, and a small realm on one of the islands. With your unique powers, you can explore a procedurally generated world and connect floating islands, expand your increasing kingdom.\n\n\n\u2003Gameplay focuses on setting general goals for all the units, without the need for micromanaging each one of them. Under your command, warriors, archers and mages are able to tame and ride different types of flying beasts, creating various aerial units.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBuild a city you want to rule - Kingdom building and upgrades of buildings, expanding their capabilities - economic, military or magical power\n\nDynamic topography - Move and terraform floating islands of the shattered planet\n\nGet to know the rich lore - 4 different races with unique skills, each one speaking their own language. 4 points of view on the Driftland\u2019s story.
