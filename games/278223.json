Demon lord Rogles extinguishes a light in Vecanti which functions as a source of power for those who live there, and in a desperate plea for salvation, its queen Valia reaches out for a brave soul who can help them in their time of despair. Yuko on Earth is the one who answers the call, being summoned by magical forces into Vecanti to liberate them from the evil of Rogles.", "summary": "Valis: The Fantasm Soldier is a side-scrolling platformer. Yuko can jump and attack enemies with her Valis sword, which can be upgraded and used as a ranged weapon by collecting power-ups found in the stages. She can also find and use items that grant her powerful all-screen attacks or temporary invincibility. Each stage culminates with a boss battle, after which Yuko's hit points and attributes increase.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mugen-senshi-valis-the-fantasm-soldier", "videos": [{"id": 102326, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "N-KttSe0Nqo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-KttSe0Nqo", "title": "MSX Longplay [005] Valis: The Fantasm Soldier", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N-KttSe0Nqo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
