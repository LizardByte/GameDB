The Northern wind tugged his hair and froze his uncovered fingers but still he made no movement to shelter. Even though it was now dusk and time for travellers to leave the dangers of the road behind a firmly closed door, he looked on. His eyes stared at the silhouetted Castle that loomed ahead against the backdrop of heavy clouds. They rose to look at the towers that seemed to almost bend over him as they pierced the skies. He looked away as a feeling of nausea overcame his tired body and he closed his eyes for a moment until the feeling disappeared. Yet when his head cleared, his eyes began searching the castle again and he began to pace slowly along the track, which would ultimately be swallowed by the span of a great gate...", "summary": "Bram Stoker's Dracula is game loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name. It was released simultaneously for multiple consoles and while the plot remains largely the same, there are differing styles of gameplay and graphics across platforms.\n\nThe DOS version is played from a first-person perspective, similar to other games like Doom or Wolfenstein 3D. In this version, Harker must traverse several large stages to locate and purify a varying number of coffins with holy wafers, while warding off various monsters with either a pistol or a knife. When all of the coffins in a stage are purified, Harker must then confront Dracula in one of three forms (his old man, young man, and original knight form).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bram-stokers-dracula--3", "videos": [{"id": 15708, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "hmW4V9qq_vs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmW4V9qq_vs", "title": "Bram Stoker's Dracula gameplay (PC Game, 1993)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hmW4V9qq_vs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
