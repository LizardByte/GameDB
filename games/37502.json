The curse also affects Kurouzu's environment as it simultaneously creates whirlwinds and whirlpools, especially turning the abandoned lighthouse into a hot furnace while making whoever looks at it walk in circles.", "summary": "Uzumaki: Denshi Kaiki-hen is an Action game, published by Omega Micott, which was released in Japan in 2000.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/uzumaki-denshi-kaiki-hen", "collections": [{"id": 5130, "name": "Uzumaki"}]}
