Now, for it's tenth anniversary, the game has been rebuilt from the ground up, sporting a fresh coat of paint and a handful of QOL improvements!\nLight the Way brings a twist to the classic memory game genre! A sequence of tiles will light up across the playing grid. It is your job to memorize which tiles light up and the order that they light up in, then recreate said sequence. Sounds easy, but as you reach higher difficulties, the playing grid becomes larger and the sequences longer, testing how effective your memory truly is!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/light-the-way-10th-anniversary"}
