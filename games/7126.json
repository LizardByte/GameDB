While you will usually need to take a tactical approach to gameplay when on foot, you will earn points called \"Field Units\" that can be used to buy equipment like tanks and gun turrets to destroy Axis soldiers. You can simply buy equipment by using the Y button on your controller in conjunction with the left thumbstick button to select an item to buy.\n\nAs such, the game developers call The Outfit \"destruction on demand\". The equipment you buy with Field Units will initially be occupied by AI-controlled soldiers, but you can replace whoever is using the equipment so that you can have some fun blowing stuff up. Sporting a fully destructible environment, almost everything in The Outfit can be blown up.\n\nYou can play as one of three characters. Tommy Mac can take lots of damage before dying, and comes equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, but equipment will cost him more Field Units than other characters. Deuce Williams comes equipped with a rocket launcher and pistol, and doesn't need as much Field Units to buy stuff as Tommy does, but he isn't nearly as strong as Tommy. JD Tyler is the most accurate of the three, sporting a sniper rifle and shotgun, but unfortunately he will die with one shot, so he must take an extremely tactical approach to gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-outfit"}
