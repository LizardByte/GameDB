The environment and characters are - on the whole - historically credible. They didn't exist in eighteenth century Sweden, but they could have.\n\nYou are not out to collect swords to kill monsters or to search for keys to unlock doors. There will be a few ghosts and some supernatural events here. But you won't risk your life, neither by hunger nor thirst. A fall through a window won't hurt you much. You can study a map whenever you like, but it will reveal no secrets. Your task is to gather information, to do historical research.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/country-house"}
