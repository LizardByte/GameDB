It tells the story from several perspectives but there are two main protagonists: Norifumi, a guy who has been taking pictures since he was small, and Yumi has been working as a model but suddenly shows interest in photography. Instead of a typical to a visual novel cast of heroines, this game rather follows a story told from both of their perspectives. Even though the title suggests that it isn\u2019t about love, it tells a drama of adolescence describing a type of 'love' which is not quite romantic but close.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/koi-de-wa-naku-its-not-love-but-so-where-near", "videos": [{"id": 86620, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "o3O7zRJEAWQ"}, {"id": 86621, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "GkZjzdKp9V8"}]}
