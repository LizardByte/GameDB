In an unusual town full of odd locals, your stranded character must explore the town and its castle to find a way out, using only his carried torch to light his way and to fend off the unexpected and unexplainable horrors that await. Advanced new lighting and graphic techniques are used to impress upon you the feeling of fear and loneliness (the tite \"Kurayami\" means \"Darkness\" in Japanese) as you venture through to the end of your quest. Kurayami was cancelled before it was ever released.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kurayami"}
