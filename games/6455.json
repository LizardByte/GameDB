Unfortunately, the King's over-exuberance creates a tsunami that strikes and devastates nearby Paradise Commonwealth Island. One of the residents, a turtle, washes ashore next to the Royal Family and tells them his tale. The King then decides to make new islands for the animals of the Commonwealth with several katamari. Similar to the previous Katamari titles, the King sends the Prince to the Sunflower Continent, which is full of the paraphernalia used to create new landmasses.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/me-my-katamari", "videos": [{"id": 2335, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oeQWYoZxA5U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeQWYoZxA5U", "title": "Me and My Katamari Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oeQWYoZxA5U/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
