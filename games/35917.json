After she captures the pirate king Flint and knocks out the three protagonists, the three find themselves cursed with their souls separated from their bodies.  \n  \nIn the first part of the game, the three protagonists have to find a way to reacquire their bodies, a method of reattaching their souls, and a ship in order to leave Vooju island and seek help. They have to do so before they are turned into zombies or before the cock crows thrice, otherwise they would be forever lost as ghosts.  \n  \nIn the second part of the game, the three have to gather allies and stop Greenbeard's attempt to attack Blue Belly's home port with the aid of their ghostly powers. In the final part of the game, with their allies, the three heroes have to defeat Zimbi's evil mother Mama Malidei and stop the demon god's resurrection.", "summary": "Mysterious Things are Happening on Vooju Island...", "videos": [{"id": 47723, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qvqPrYgjexo"}]}
