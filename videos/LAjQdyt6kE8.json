I've been working on it for three years, and it's finally getting close to complete. Check out more info on Steam, and if it seems interesting, please throw it on your Wishlist!\n\nWebsite: www.mournfulsword.com\n\nTwitter (Personal Account): https://twitter.com/DuncanKeller\n\nI started this game in 2016 because I wanted to make a game that was really challenging in a way that I didn't think a lot of modern indie games were. It has difficult platforming, but more than any individual challenge it's an endurance test, challenging you to preserve your health and make it to the next save point. In that way it's similar to Megaman or Castlevania, but the action is closer to Shinobi or Strider. You have a melee attack, and that's pretty much it. However, you can also lock enemies into combos and unleash a flurry of fast attacks, but only if you master the timing.\n\nWhen I started the game, I had no idea that it would evolve into such a crazy project. I can't believe I've been working on it for three years already! I won't lie, there were some points where I thought I would never finish it. In a lot of ways, I feel like I've imbued the story of Rhen and her story with a lot of my own struggles while developing the game. It's been quite a journey to get here, and I hope you'll come along with me for the ride.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LAjQdyt6kE8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LAjQdyt6kE8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LAjQdyt6kE8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mournful Sword Trailer, 2D Action Platformer", "description": "Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1122930/Mournful_Sword\n\nI'm making a game inspired by my favorite retro platformers called Mournful Sword, and it's very simple to play but also insanely difficult.
