A great hero, the warrior \"Magi\", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, \"Tores\", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, \"When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-magic-sword-of-the-elements"}
