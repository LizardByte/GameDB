The core systems are scorched and broken and the world beyond the BARATHA DIVIDE, a vast and treacherous expanse of nothing, is an alien mystery.\n\nBrick M. Stonewood (the \u201cM\u201d stands for \u201cMetal\u201d) is a remnant of an older time. A time where men were men and truth spilled at 60km/s from the barrel of a gun.\n\nFound by ingot miners in sleep-lock, drifting in a LOKATT MKII DSP eject pod and revived at the Holloway-Exeter Station, Brick is a man driven to unlock the secrets of his past and the strange mysteries that lie just beyond the Divide; a specialist with a ceramic alloy steed, the Starr Wolf, and a fate to make among the stars.\n\nThe Holloway-Exeter is a frontier town packed into spinning ringed cylinder orbiting the fourth moon of the third planet of a dying star; a great place for a mercenary pilot like Brick to find himself at the pointy end of some clatter and sin.\n\nThen there\u2019s the girl. There\u2019s always a girl.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starr-mazer"}
