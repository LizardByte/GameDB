Each puzzle requires turning off a 5x5 grid of light switches. The twist is each light switch also toggles its neighbors. In zen fashion, you will find yourself reflected in the simplicity of puzzle-solving.\n\nPlaying enLIGHTen is a mix between a traditional puzzle video game and a lecture-based webinar. The lectures cover learning concepts and unlock tools so you can apply the concepts to your puzzle-solving. The puzzles provide a clear way for you to measure your understanding. The lecture and puzzle elements are designed to work together, back and forth, but you are free to focus on whichever part of the game you want. No matter your experience or skill level you will become stuck. It is here, when things are at their darkest, that enLIGHTen really shines.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/enlighten-learn-the-art-of-learning", "videos": [{"id": 45955, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "_aaWhfcpyx0"}]}
