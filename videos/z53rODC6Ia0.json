{"id": "z53rODC6Ia0", "snippet": {"title": "The Mimizu Panzer [\u307f\u307f\u3071\u3093] Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Described as the \"Articulated Undulating Omnidirectional Shooting Game\", \"The Mimizu Panzer\" (aka \"Mimipan\") is one of Nepia World's (a once popular Doujin circle) lost games. Originally released between 2004-2005 (Pre-Release and Official), Mimipan has the distinction of being one of Nepia World's most \"complete\" games. While many of their titles were short, survival-based score attack games or demos (Pre-Release), this game features dozens of levels (48 plus an \"Alpha\" side with more content), config settings, replay data, boss battles, and even a little story to boot. Followers of this channel know that I have been tracking down Nepia World titles for years and I now have all of the Windows titles beyond their \"phantom\" releases (a modified Pre-Release version of \"Neko Bouraku\", the Pre-Release version of \"256 Rabbits\" / \"256-Biki Usa-chan\" and the 2007 prototype of \"Imone and the 99 Brothers / \u30a4\u30e2\u30fc\u30cc\u3068\uff19\uff19\u306e\u5144\u3055\u307e\"), two which DO exist on the super dark web... but I'm not taking my chances right now and searching for physical copies. It works fine on modern computers barring minor graphical bugs like other NW titles.\n\nIn simple terms, it's an action-oriented version of the classic \"Snake\" game, but that might trivialize how hardcore this game is. Mimipan might look cute and whimsical in spots, but it is a game that requires laser-precision, a LOT of practice, and a bit of luck, and tells a preposterous alternative story of Berlin's fall with Japanese Animu elements and tropes. It goes something like this...\n\nThe Pre-text: North Africa in 1941. In order to appease Italy, an unscrupulous ally, Germany generously invested valuable forces. The DAK (New German Afrika Korps) were led by General Erwin Rommel. With unconventional tactics, they fought against the overwhelmingly outnumbered British army. Under the scorching heat, Germany's latest weapons arrived at the North African Campaign. MIMIZU PANZER or \"Mimipan\" for short. It is a tank with an unprecedented structure. It was designed by Germany's proud unnamed mad scientist with a girl at the helm. Her name is Mimmy. Controlling Mimipan requires 333 times more cognitive ability than an ordinary person, but Mimmy had met that condition. In fact, she is a genius and the granddaughter of the mad scientist. Who would have predicted that Mimmy's success would drive the British out of North Africa, which would hasten the Berlin attack? Now launching a counter offensive, will she be able to protect her home city from the communists?\n\nPlayers assume the role of Mimmy, a German-born native of Berlin who is the Car-Commander of the DAK Panzer Unit and stakes a claim to bring down her opposition with her bumbling Italian assistant, Macarona. Leading the attacks against her is a proud British woman named Liz who takes her tea time very seriously (seeking retribution and death for those who ruin it without just cause) and Francesca, a beautiful but nihilistic Russian woman with a cold personality who only enjoys Borscht and Vodka... and her incredible combat skills. Rommel and others make an appearance, but the plot is a light-hearted take on an otherwise complicated and very serious time in history. Those without thick skin will find various things to take offense to in terms of its themes, but it's hard to be mad at a game that flashes a behind at you when you meet your demise... and you will die very often. War is hard. However, in the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.\n\nMimipan utilizes a single action button and a button to commit suicide (something that happened quite a bit during WWI & WWII). The player can shoot in front and must avoid their \"tail\" and enemies (you can run over some obstacles which give large score multipliers). Shooting enemies directly is not recommended and mostly futile -- it is weak and most enemies can't be engaged head-on for long... so the key to victory is perforated \"Counter-Tails\". Mimmy's tank can blast flames if she makes a U-Turn and shoots ignited tail segments charged by enemy fire! These flames last a few seconds and defeated enemies add to the length of your tail and give more opportunities to counter as well as greater score multipliers! Conversely, it becomes harder to maneuver and survival becomes nearly impossible when you get to a certain length. Dying reduces your tails length by half. The game sports crunchy 16-bit pixel graphics and upbeat war ditties.\n\nWhen the game clicks, it's a fun blast to play (no pun intended) and addicting, but it is not for the faint of heart. There are a few videos out there that shows the game's content in decent detail, so this video is for our archives showing various things in HQ.
