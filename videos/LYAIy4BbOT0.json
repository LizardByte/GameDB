The game is an updated port of the 2017 mobile game Egglia: Legend of the Redcap with various upgrades and features made for consoles. Japan will get the game on December 16, and it will arrive later in the Americas, Europe, Australia, Korea, and Hong Kong.\n\nEgglia Rebirth is essentially an updated version of Egglia: Legend of the Redcap. It features a new UI made for consoles and other adjustments that weren\u2019t possible due to smartphone limitations. As for new features, the game will add new residents and new missions for more gameplay volume.\nAbout Brownies\n\nHere\u2019s a little bit of a history lesson on Brownies ahead of the Switch launch of Egglia Rebirth. President and founder Shinichi Kameoka worked for Square in the \u201990s, where he did character designs on the Mana series, among other titles. He established Brownie Brown along with several former Square staff and artists in June 2000. The company developed several Mana games for Square Enix, including Sword of Mana and Heroes of Mana. Brownie Brown also co-developed Mother 3 with HAL Laboratory.\n\nHowever, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo, Kameoka found it difficult to make the games he wanted and left Brownie Brown to independently re-establish it as Brownies. Former staff, including artist Koji Tsuda with whom he has worked since his early Square days, also joined Brownies. Following the change in internal structure, Brownie Brown changed its name to 1-Up Studio and has since then worked on titles such as Super Mario 3D World, Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more for Nintendo.\n\n#EGGLIARebirth #EggliaLegendoftheRedcap #RPG\n\n\u2b50 The most anticipates games coming out in 2021: https://youtu.be/Ju3oIIqAv6Y\n\nFollow us \ud83d\udc47\n\ud83d\udd39 Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@mustache.gamer\n\ud83d\udd39 Twitter: https://twitter.com/Mustache_TV\n\ud83d\udd39 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mustache.tv/\n\ud83d\udd39 Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/gamer_mustache", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LYAIy4BbOT0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LYAIy4BbOT0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LYAIy4BbOT0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LYAIy4BbOT0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LYAIy4BbOT0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "EGGLIA Rebirth Trailer w/ Gameplay | Nintendo Switch", "description": "SUBSCRIBE for new game trailers daily! \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/mustachegamer\n\nBrownies, the developer made of former Brownie Brown staff, has announced Egglia Rebirth for Nintendo Switch.
