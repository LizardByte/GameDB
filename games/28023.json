Along with the other MoS crew, you\u2019re tasked with exploring Septemius 2, an important exploration vessel that mysteriously veered off-course before it could return to Earth. This is where the game begins, though there\u2019s also a lengthy backstory involving the future of the world (get ready for Neocommunism, folks!), and how governments create killer satellites to keep their opponents in check. This information doesn\u2019t really play into Psy-O-Blade\u2018s main story, but it does remind us that people will always be brutal to each other and that there\u2019s truly nothing new under the sun. The Ministry of Space boasts quite the cast. In addition to Keith, there\u2019s Bob the navigator, a quiet fellow who shares an uncanny resemblance to Robert, the de facto leader of the operation. Mark is a chemical analyst. Michael is an engineer and resident jokester of the group. Doctor Jimmy is old, bald, and unusually quiet. Feminine is a green-haired Data Analyst with an awful name \u2013 surely the English translator didn\u2019t bequeath this moniker upon her, did they? Finally, Sofia\u2019s a computer engineer and Keith\u2019s love interest throughout the game. These characters \u2013 for better and for worse \u2013 are the game. The only way to progress through Psy-O-Blade\u2018s tale of sabotage, murder, and mystery is by engaging with these characters repeatedly.", "summary": "In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite \"Raiden\". The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship \"Septemius 1\" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, \"Racoon\", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship \"Septemius 2\", was sent to investigate the strange disappearance. Psy-O-Blade is a Japanese adventure in anime style. The player interacts with the game world by moving a cursor and clicking on objects to examine or use them, and people to talk to them, or by choosing options (\"Move\" and \"Scroll\") from a menu. There are no puzzles to solve; the player advances in the game by talking to characters, visiting different locations, as well as examining and using objects.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/psy-o-blade", "videos": [{"id": 12889, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "7y2VZ3zCedQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y2VZ3zCedQ", "title": "MD Moving Adventure Psy-O-Blade", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7y2VZ3zCedQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
