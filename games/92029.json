An accident in one of the labs causes all the robots to malfunction and attack the human staff. Over the course of the game, you play two playable characters, Alexia and Mika, who must solve a series of puzzles to piece together what happened and escape the base. \n \nTECNO was developed largely by one person, Paolo Cosentino (as GURUY Entertainment), and was originally sold by him directly through the game's website. It was later offered as a freeware download for a time before the website went offline. It was written in Blitz3D and features an impressively full physics engine with thousands of interactable objects and environments.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tecno-the-base"}
