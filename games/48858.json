The seeemingly innocent and sturdy-looking floor tiles can move, change, flip and reverse your direction at anytime, throwing you for a serious loop. And, throughout the tangled labyrinth of causeways, there are scarab beetles hiding in the tiles, trying to block your way. \nBut if you can gain the power of the sun god, \"Ra\", you just might have the skill and cunning to find your way to the Tomb of the Pharaoh, Scarabeus. \nSo, if you're ready for the challenge of your life, power up Pyramids of Ra. You'll be amazed. \n \nScarabeus is prototype of a very simple puzzle game. In it, the player must figure out the best path to draw one line through a series of tiles without any overlap. In fact, to give the player extra incentive not to backtrack, the tiles actually crumble away after use, which leaves no choice but to venture on. Players must cause all of the black tiles to disappear, and then land back on the starting square, with a reward for a quick performance.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scarabeus"}
