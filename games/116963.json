As the \nfront line sees most of the action, small remote outposts like the one found on the planet \nEshus are often undermanned and overlooked. The Eshus outpost has in fact only got an \nold pre-war spacecraft, one inexperienced pilot, and a spirited technician stationed there. \nThe two are going about their daily business when a screen suddenly flashes the message \n\"RED ALERT! The Houdan Confederation is attacking!\" The incoming data states that \n6 dreadnoughts have come out of hyperspace near the moon of Eshus. \nThe odds are stacked against them but surrendering the outpost would give the enemy a \nbackdoor into the Dangan systems. There's no helping it, the Houdan Confederation must \nbe stopped! \nAlthough not brimming with confidence, they ready the spacecraft. Tally the technician \noffers her support as the pilot takes off", "summary": "Dangan GB is a short simplistic boss-rush/bullet-hell shmup released for the Game Boy to celebrate the console's 30th anniversary.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 26069, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "47IBUhjU6JU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47IBUhjU6JU", "title": "'Dangan GB' by Snorpung/Nordloef (Itch.io) [Full Playthrough]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/47IBUhjU6JU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
