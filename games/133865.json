Illusions become reality, and reality becomes nothing more than a vision.\n\nHuman is a short psychological horror game which examines inherent, earthly, and otherworldly evils, and the forces which drive them. As you make your way through an Alaskan auroral research facility in search of employees it quickly becomes very clear that something has become alerted to your presence. Suspiciously, once it knows you're there, you're more than welcome to be there. Drawing you in, you soon begin to question all you see and hear.\n\nHUMAN is highly metaphorical, yet accessible. All is explained in it's simplest essence, but for those willing to look beyond the surface, there lies layer upon layer of symbolism, and clues regarding the nature of reality, which add depth to the meaning behind Human.\n\nHuman is primarily story and experience driven, however environmental puzzles and problem solving are interlaced within. You will also use observation to find what's necessary in order to progress. Tablets throughout the facility contain research notes which you can zoom in on and read which help give further context to the story.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/human", "videos": [{"id": 35878, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "en1_16Ja18g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en1_16Ja18g", "title": "HUMAN Horror Game - Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/en1_16Ja18g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
