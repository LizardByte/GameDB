Other factions will also be affected by the relentless spread of fire and death left in its wake by the arrival of the Aberrant Cult; such as the elven forests, victims of the quest to recruit new creatures to add to their ranks, as well as seize areas with exceptional magical powers and devastate nature and life in their path.", "summary": "Turn-based strategy game that immerses you in an epic fantasy world, with a variety of clashes to test your cunning and wits.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you unlock new units and abilities, as well as improving their combat capabilities, allowing you to face new challenges and try new tactics. There are a variety of factions, each with their own particular style of combat, and each with a large repertoire of units, from basic infantry, heroes, giant creatures, menacing war machines and, of course, magical entities.\n\nEach battle is a challenge, an opposing array to defeat, forcing you to decide which units to use, what skills and abilities you will need, and once the battle is underway, how to move between blows to achieve victory.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mind-of-war"}
