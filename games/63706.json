This version updates some minor things, including the timetable and scoring calculation. It is the last arcade entry in the series in 14 years, prior to Densha de Go!!\n\nThe original version was later ported to the PlayStation 2 on March 15, 2001, while the Daiya-kaisei version was later ported to the PC by Unbalance. The PS2 version also included a demo of Densha de Go! Shinkansen on a bonus disc, and later received a re-release (sans demo) as part of D3Publisher's Simple 2000 series of budget games, as Simple 2000 Series Vol. 22: The Tsuukin Densha Utenshi - Densha de Go! 3 Tsuukin-hen, on March 27, 2003.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/densha-de-go-3-tsuukinhen", "videos": [{"id": 19715, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "nLxx4FQyI64", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLxx4FQyI64", "title": "Densha de Go 3 Tsuukinhen Gameplay HD 1080p PS2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nLxx4FQyI64/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
