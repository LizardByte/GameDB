When these are gathered together in one place you will have 5 minutes (real time) to reach the teleport and escape before the nuclear explosion will blow up the asteroid.\n\nThere are 3 types of force wall which will bar your way. The cyan, purple and green force walls are all of varying strengths but contact with any of them will result in instant death! Each type can be deactivated for a different period of time by standing on their respective control pads.\n\nOther hazards to avoid include the Phantoms who will slowly drain your energy and poisonous plants.\n\nTo replenish your energy and oxygen stores you must find and stand on the supplies which are scattered all over the asteroid.\n\nYour mission is highly dangerous but not impossible!\n\nGOOD LUCK!", "summary": "Excruciatingly difficult platformer with early jet pack vs gravity game play.
