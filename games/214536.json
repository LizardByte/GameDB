Many years ago, the land was ruled by the forces of darkness. Monsters and dragons alike terrorized the small human populace in Irona. However, one day, a great sage appeared, commanding light and nature, and with the combined might of the sage and her allies, the monsters were sealed using the power of a mysterious tower known as the Spire of Darkness. Following the conflict, the warriors of legend went their own separate ways and founded their own lands, but they all swore fealty to the brother of the great sage, who was crowned Emperor of Irona.\n\n500 years have passed since the time of the Hero of Light. Irona\u2019s Emperor Perseus, a descendant of the first emperor, Hawke, has been acting suspiciously. He and a mysterious mage named Caelia have been reawakening the monsters using the Spire of Darkness. In Norbury, a land on the western end of the continent founded by the master archer Quentin, Duke Robert dies of unknown causes. Tragedy would also strike the duchy of Abrein, a southwestern duchy founded by Bishop Leticia. The son of Duke Simon and descendant of Leticia, Prince Travis, is killed by a surprise ambush by powerful monsters on a scouting mission. This tragic chain of events throws the whole continent into turmoil, pitting the western duchies against the loyalist eastern lands.\n\n11 years after the Great Tragedy, Travis\u2019s younger sister, Princess Aderyn, chooses to fight back. Together with her allies, she strives to save Abrein and to free the rest of the continent from the iron fist of Perseus\u2019s reign.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-emblem-justice-and-pride"}
