The map is somewhat exploration-focused, takes roughly 25-35 minutes to beat (depending on difficulty and how thorough you are with said exploration).\n\nDifficulties are implemented, UV starts off pretty easy but has a few tough fights near the end, though the difficulty may vary greatly depending on the amount exploration and secret hunting the player does. Because of that, and since the map is fairly lenghty, I recommend saving a few times. Expect HNTR and HMP to be on a significantly easier side.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-cognition-engine"}
