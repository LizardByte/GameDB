The Oldest House is a flawed, dark, dangerous but beautiful place of power with a personality of its own. Within The Oldest House resides the mysterious organization known as the Federal Bureau of Control, a secret government institute responsible for the research and containment of otherworldly phenomena. The Bureau are now facing a threat beyond anything they could ever imagine.\n\nThis is the script for the world of Control as told by Zachariah Trench (James McCaffrey):\n\n\"August 4, 1964. Bureau Agents discovered the Oldest House, investigating an Altered World Event case in the New York City Subway tunnels. It's a place of power. From the outside it looks like an ordinary building, a Brutalist skyscraper, but inside it breaks the laws of our reality, unstable, mad and shifting. There are rooms in the building, where other dimensions leak in. We call these rooms Thresholds.\n\nThere is a connection between our minds and the unknown, often hostile, forces intruding on our world. These forces gravitate toward everyday objects: a gun, a television, a house with a reputation of being haunted. So, somehow, we affect these events. We're holding the key but we don't have a clue on how to use it.  \n\nBut there's something in us, in the dreams we dream, in the conceptual reality we power with our minds. What's the cause and what's the effect? Are we the starting point, or just a necessary evil in this? We're dealing with dangerous, unknown forces here.
