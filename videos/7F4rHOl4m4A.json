You operate a repair core, which can navigate the system by ejecting between a variety of different hosts, each with their own dynamics and abilities. Some hosts are fixed in place, while others jump, slide, climb walls, or follow rails. To progress, it is often necessary to utilize several hosts in combination, taking advantage of each of their unique qualities and the rich interactions between them.\n\nJoin the community Discord channel:\nhttps://discord.gg/DkKJhfC5Ns", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7F4rHOl4m4A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7F4rHOl4m4A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7F4rHOl4m4A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7F4rHOl4m4A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Alpha and Iota Trailer", "description": "Available now!
