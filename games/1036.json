Unlike the others, Link transforms into a wolf but is captured. A mysterious figure named Midna helps him break free, and with the aid of her magic, they set off to free the land from the shadows. Link must explore the vast land of Hyrule and uncover the mystery behind its plunge into darkness.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the last Zelda game for GameCube, it was highly anticipated by many members of the gaming community and was regarded as finally fulfilling the dreams of those who wanted a much more realistic and mature game than the ones before. The art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. New to this game is the ability for Link to transform into a Wolf when entering the Twilight. As a wolf, Link can use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles, he can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees. Twilight Princess has received universal acclaim from reviewers and journalists, who cited it as the greatest Zelda game of all time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess", "videos": [{"id": 734, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KqUqxVKd5q0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqUqxVKd5q0", "title": "Legend Of Zelda:Twilight Princess Trailer November 1st 2006", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KqUqxVKd5q0/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119097, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RieKG7pw6g8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RieKG7pw6g8", "title": "The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess \u2022 E3 2004 Trailer \u2022 GC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RieKG7pw6g8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119185, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YHu7hvxjdww", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHu7hvxjdww", "title": "The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess \u2022 E3 2005 Trailer \u2022 GC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YHu7hvxjdww/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1897, "name": "Voice"}]}
