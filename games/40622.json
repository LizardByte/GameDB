Coco is up in the trees throwing coconuts at Stanley. You control Stanley and need to dodge the incoming coconuts. You begin the game equipped with a helmet and an umbrella to protect yourself. Each time you are hit by a coconut, you lose one of these items. You may also regain an item by scoring enough points. The game ends when you have nothing left to protect yourself and a coconut hits you. Of course, the longer you can last in the game, the faster it becomes!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/coconuts", "videos": [{"id": 106114, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "44PruNCl-pA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44PruNCl-pA", "title": "Coconuts for the Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/44PruNCl-pA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
