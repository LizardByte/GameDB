Production chains extend the business allowing players to sell products like bread, olive oil or furniture. The improved tutorial mode, AI helper and the new auto-load feature for logs and pallets support the players in their farming career.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farming-simulator-23", "videos": [{"id": 84885, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oxzYFjClZr0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxzYFjClZr0", "title": "Farming Simulator 23 announced!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxzYFjClZr0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
