Space Taxi features 25 screens with varying obstacles and challenges that must be navigated in order to collect your fare. Although Space Taxis sort of resemble yellow Checker Cabs, they operate on a different principle - the longer you take to deliver a passenger, the less money you collect. In addition to watching the clock because of an incentive to collect money, players have to be aware of their fuel supply. Run out of fuel, and you will crash.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-taxi"}
