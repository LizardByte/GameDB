By: John A. Reder, 2009 - Story: K.C. has found himself trapped in a Atari 2600 system along with some enslaved O2 zombies! The Atari system maze is deadly, he cannot touch the maze walls, if he does his 02 code will mix with the 2600 code and destroy him! \n \nObjective: \nIncrease your score! Gather Bullets (white dots) to shoot the O2 zombies for 10 points! Gather hidden vitamin tablets (red dash) to slightly protect you against O2 zombies for 1 point! O2 zombies and maze walls may kill you instantly if touched (you may be able to brush by them if you have some resistance given by a vitamin tablet but don't count on it every time)! O2 zombies take bullets out of your inventory when they reach a bullet before you do! They take a point out of your score if they reach a vitamin tablet before you do! You can only carry a maximum of 6 bullets at any one time! O2 zombies are sent back to the Graveyard (the center of the maze) whenever one is hit by a bullet, they will not hurt you when they are blue for a short time after they return to the Graveyard. Note the excessive use or exclamation points!!! After all, this is about an Odyssey 2 character!!! :)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
