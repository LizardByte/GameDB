Out of the wreckage, two new cutting edge, new model Silver Hawks, equiped with the brand new Burst technology were entrusted to the humanoid AI Terminal Ti2, and test pilot Riga Practica. Together, with the Silver Hawk Burst fighters, the heroes face nigh-impossible odds as they fight alone against the Belser Fleet.", "summary": "Dariusburst Second Prologue is a horizontal scrolling shooter developed by Pyramid and published by Taito. Being part of the Darius series, it is an offbeat sci-fi shooter set in outer space with aquatic-themed (typically fish-shaped) robotic enemies. The game also features branching paths instead of the linear progression found in most video games. There are a total of 11 zones in the game, with 5 stages per run.\n\nThe Android version offers three modes of playing: SP Mode, Original Mode and Mission Mode. Some of these need to be unlocked to be selected.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dariusburst-second-prologue", "videos": [{"id": 21871, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wGq1W5RwpGQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGq1W5RwpGQ", "title": "DARIUSBURST SECOND PROLOGUE Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wGq1W5RwpGQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
