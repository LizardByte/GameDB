Similar to the slot game and boxset, this collaboration title was created to celebrate Fatal Fury\u2032s 15th Anniversary. It also gave a chance for both companies to share the intellectual property for Fighter's History. The game was primarily developed by G-mode and was released for the i-mode and Yahoo networks on July 2, 2007. SNK Playmore returned the sentiments by placing Makoto Mizoguchi in KOF: Maximum Impact Regulation \"A\".\n\nUnlike their game of origins, this title is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Players travel the world looking for either Geese or Karnov. Fighting is like other games in the genre with the exception of the three-bar super gauge at the bottom of the screen, allowing players to perform their character's special or desperation moves. The computer can also use their special techniques and aren't given a particular limit. Plane switching from the Fatal Fury series is kept intact and serves as the dodge/block for this game. Stages, sprites, and music from Fighter's History Dynamite or Fatal Fury 2 are used for the main visuals.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/garou-densetsu-vs-fighters-history-dynamite", "videos": [{"id": 55411, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2qJL_uxYQwk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qJL_uxYQwk", "title": "[MobiGe] : Garou Densetsu vs Fighter's History Dynamite [Part 1]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2qJL_uxYQwk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
