The maps require a limit-removing port. The WAD is made up from three mini-episodes of three maps each which escalate from easy (with green details) to harder (yellow) to hardest (red). These are slightly larger than the maps in the original Sucker Punch (2018), and should mostly take 3-5 minutes each to play. Difficulty settings are implemented. The maps are designed for pistol starts.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sucker-punch-2"}
