Human species is endangered under the oppression of freaky viruses, a horde of roaming unfriendly human corpses, hungry wildlife, and limited natural resources. You, one of the few survivors, suffer from injuries and memory loss, thus you need to rediscover this new environment, hoping to catch a glimpse of a clearer future. Fortunately, you are not alone! A faithful companion is always by your side - your loyal dog! Do not be fooled by his fuzziness. He is a stealthy combatant who will help you survive, explore and adapt!", "summary": "DEAD YEARS draws an aesthetically polished post-apocalyptic world, where you survive with your best friend - your loyal dog! Inspired by games such as Fallout 3 and Borderlands, DEAD YEARS sets an open-world rocky adventure offering some action-RPG-like fun with elements of survival and exploration. The best part - you and your dog evolve independently and as a team, while not only combating enemies and natural elements, but also progressing through a deep meandering story line.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-years"}
