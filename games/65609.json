The group plans to cheat Flynn's client and take Polo's treasure for themselves. Unbeknownst to Flynn, Chloe and Nate had worked together before, and Chloe plans on blackmailing Flynn and escaping with Nate and whatever treasure they find. \n \nNate and Flynn break into a museum in Istanbul and find the lamp, which contains a map and flammable resin that reveals Polo's fleet was shipwrecked in Borneo, and was carrying the Cintamani Stone from the fabled city of Shambhala. Flynn double-crosses Nate, leaving him to be arrested. \n \nThree months later, Chloe helps free Nate with his longtime friend Victor Sullivan (Richard McGonagle). She reveals that Flynn is working for Zoran Lazarevi\u0107 (Graham McTavish), a Serbian war criminal seeking the stone. In Borneo, Nate and Sully infiltrate Lazarevi\u0107's camp, with Chloe as a mole. Nate discovers that the stone never left Shambhala, and locates a temple containing the bodies of Polo's crew, as well as a phurba and map detailing that its carrier will gain passage to Shambhala through a temple in Nepal. Nate and Sully escape after being cornered by Flynn and his men.", "summary": "The Game of the Year Edition of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves includes the following: \n \n- The game \n- A Super Voucher that allows you to download the following DLC: \n- PlayStation Heroes Skin Pack \n- Uncharted: Drake\u2019s Fortune Multiplayer Pack \n- Uncharted 2 Siege Expansion Pack \n- Currency Multiplier which grants Double XP up to level 10 in Multiplayer \n- Golden Guns option for the AK-47 and the 92FS 9mm pistol for use in Multiplayer \n- Early access to \u201cRevenge\u201d Booster \n- Uncharted: Eye of Indra \u2013 Motion Comic Bundle (which includes Episodes 1-4) \n- Uncharted: Eye of Indra \u2013 Rika Raja and Daniel Pinkerton Character Skins \n- Uncharted 2: Among Thieves \u2013 Avatar Pack 1 \n- Uncharted 2: Among Thieves \u2013 Avatar Pack 2 \n- Uncharted Avatar Pack 3 \n- Uncharted Avatar Pack 4 \n- Pinball Heroes \u2013 Uncharted for the PSP", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 41675, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "BAikkgBdr3s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAikkgBdr3s", "title": "UNCHARTED 2: Among Thieves\u2122 - Game of the Year Edition - Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BAikkgBdr3s/sddefault.jpg"}]}
