It alternates between comic book cutscenes and tactical battles inspired by games like Shining Force and Final Fantasy Tactics. Battles are challenging and deeply tactical, and there are always multiple paths to victory, which often include not only attacking but also interacting with map objects and recruiting temporary characters. The story develops from common errands of an ordinary guy, slowly escalating to an epic journey with psychological and political undertones.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-lonely-league"}
