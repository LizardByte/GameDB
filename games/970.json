The team soon discover an overturned military police transport truck, along with the mutilated corpses of two officers. The team split up and Bravo team's field medic, Rebecca Chambers, finds a train stopped in the middle of the forest. Rebecca soon discovers that the train, the Ecliptic Express, is infested with zombies.", "summary": "Resident Evil 0 is a survival horror video game that was developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo GameCube. It is the seventh home console game in the Resident Evil series by release order and was the last of the title to use the original Multi-View gameplay system prior to the release of Resident Evil 4.\n\nIn addition to the series' traditional survival horror gameplay, the game introduces what it calls a \"partner zapping\" system, which allows you to switch between Rebecca and Billy at any time. This feature must be used at times, as the game requires both characters to work together to solve some puzzles. New to the game are a bunch of terrifying enemies, like the mutant centipede, new areas to explore, and the ability to drop items on the ground instead of having to find an item box.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}]}
