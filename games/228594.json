Eggman succeeds and begins to create a paradox, causing the present-time Sonic to fade. Once he realizes what's going on with him, he sets off to stop Eggman before he completes the paradox and changes made in time are permanent.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-time-attacked", "videos": [{"id": 80668, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "72-qYKOez-Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72-qYKOez-Q", "title": "Sonic: Fan Games/Hacks 30: Sonic: Time Attacked (SAGE2002-2003)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72-qYKOez-Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
