Create your own character and fight your way through enemies who have done you wrong, with animations, graphics, and weapons that make you feel like you're playing in an original Madness Combat episode.\n\nPlay through a short but fun and difficult campaign to get revenge on a certain someone, while an original soundtrack by Lothyde plays in the background to feel even more immersed in the Madness universe. You can also play in experiment mode where you create your own scenerios to test and train your skills to become more efficient at killing agents.\n\nAnd just like the old Madness Interactive, modding is a very big part of the game. Make use of our development tools to easily create new levels, weapons, or apparel.\n\n- How much will it cost?\nNothing. The game is completely free.\n\n- Is this an official Madness game?\nNo. We are completely unaffiliated with Krinkels.\n\n- Will the game be moddable?\nYes.
