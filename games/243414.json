Despite the turmoil in the Holy Spirit Agencies, the world had calmed down, and the peaceful days had returned to Gyoen Girl's Academy.\n\nHowever, one month ago, the aftermath of the boundary melting phenomenon, which had been prevented before, appeared in a clear form. Large-scale dimensional distortions were observed in large quantities throughout the Kanto region. The Japan Holy Spirit Agency began to bring the situation under control, and some students of Gyoen Girl's School, who had sensed the anomaly, also stood up. In the midst of all this, saints from the Holy Spirit Offices overseas arrived in Japan under the guise of dispatching the Holy Spirit of Disaster.\n\nThere are only seven days left until the Great Kanto Collapse.", "summary": "On October 30th, 2008, this major update had been released to further balance the game and fix some bugs.
