The gameplay is pretty brutal: the germans are overwhelming, and fast to attack, many of my units get eliminated even without a chance to replay. \n\nThis time I am trying to build a defensive line and carefully counter attack, but it does not seem to be a good tactic. Maybe next time I will try gather my forces at the second river and start the counterattack when the german's try to cross.
