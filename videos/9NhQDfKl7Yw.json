It involves a group of friends going on a wacky adventure to get home, having to traverse bright, colorful environments in a strange dimension.\n\nOriginally, the game started life as a tech demo for a future project. This game was made in Construct 2 and is completely free to download. Currently the game is available for Windows, though I may release other versions as well.\n\n=====CREDITS=====\n~Main Developer/Main Artist/Main Programmer~\n-Unlimited Trees\n\n~Composers~\n-RRThiel\n-A-S-H\n-Scooblee\n-CosmicGem\n-Mr. Sauceman\n-[c]\n-MiniMacro\n-Crash\n-littlelamp100\n-Woofle\n-Lange\n-MegaBaZ\n-SoundCirclet (dante)\n-R3tronaut\n\n~Testing~\n-LooneyDude\n-LakeFeperd\n-SpectraS02\n-Voltrix\n-Barak\n-GameBro\n-Tpot\n-Apple\n-staticj3ff\n-probably some others I don't exactly remember\n\n~Mystic Garden Assests / K&LWW Team~\n-Shane (Sparks)\n-Lapper\n-PixelatedEric\n-FUNKVESSEL\n-Woofle\n-The KKM\n-Naoshi\n\n~Special Thanks/Shout outs~\n-Mr. Potatobadger\n-Heraga\n-MtH\n-Red\n-saladplainzone\n-TrippleJaz\n-TysonTay\n-MeloSoni\n-Thursday\n-Sliat Scarlettt\n-JamoART\n-Tony (pressedyes), who I'm using various sfx from Petscop as placeholders\n-PixelMonkey\n-LaDestitute\n-Nexter\n-Stealth\n-Spazer40\n-Senri_Kitty\n-Peeper\n-Andrew75\n-Jeto\n\nI hope you enjoy this game I have spent the past year and a half creating.
