The Prince encountered some monsters and found a woman captured by them. After several encounters with the woman, she introduced herself as Elika and they started to travel together. Elika sought the Seed, in hopes that it would save her kingdom. Elika suggested following the Magic Spirit to the seed. The Hunter caught up with Elika, but the Prince interfered, and chased him away. Elika told Prince that the hunter must be killed, and they used a Diamond Dragon to fly North where the Hunter dwelt. On the way, Elika told that her father is to blame for all the corruption. They found the Hunter, who kidnapped Elika, Prince followed him and killed the Hunter. The Hunter also held the seed that Elika was searching for. The seed from the Tree of Life. Elika didn't really blame her father for destroying the Tree of Life, as he was grief stricken after losing his wife, and when he lost someone else, he brought that person back to life using the Tree of Life. After Elika's father destroyed the Tree of life, four elemental creatures absorbed the seeds. Elika needed four of these seeds and they journeyed to the canyon where the next creature lived. Second elemental creature they encountered was the Octopus. After defeating the Octopus and getting the seed, they flew towards the observatory on the Diamond Dragon to search for the Child Queen, but the Child Queen attacked them during the flight instead. They managed to fight off the Child Queen, and then tracked it down on land and defeated it for good. They went after the last seed at the hands of the Warrior, residing in the lava rift. Elika revealed that she was the one her father resurrected. The prince was starting to have feelings for Elika, and tried to convince her not to sacrifice herself, and find another way. But Elika didn't think there is another way and gave her life to restore the Tree of Life", "summary": "An HD remaster of Prince of Persia (2008) for Symbian devices", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/prince-of-persia-hd", "videos": [{"id": 137655, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9pj3_Xy2qKI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pj3_Xy2qKI", "title": "Prince of Persia (N-GAGE)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9pj3_Xy2qKI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 137656, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wAETVHIOT1Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAETVHIOT1Y", "title": "Prince of Persia HD Full Gameplay \u2502Nokia Symbian Version \u2502FULL GAME 100%", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wAETVHIOT1Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 137657, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tgHaP-rBMRw"}, {"id": 137658, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ptxbkmWGOiA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptxbkmWGOiA", "title": "[HD] Gameloft Prince Of Persia HD 2008 (Pocket PC / Symbian) Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ptxbkmWGOiA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 137659, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mUNS44ujOrE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUNS44ujOrE", "title": "Prince of Persia HD (Symbian Game) - Walkthrough (No Commentary)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mUNS44ujOrE/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 187, "name": "Prince of Persia"}]}
