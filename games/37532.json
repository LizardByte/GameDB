Unique features include double paths from the second till the fifth levels, swimming in water and a level which requires the player to rotate the wonderswan by 90 degrees as Arthur climbs and swings down a rope in a vertical shaft. Unlike other games, the player is not required to repeat the game after the penultimate level in order to get the one weapon to defeat the final boss Azrael.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
