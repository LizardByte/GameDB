With live demo updates based on real-time player feedback, Tomas is lifting the lid on his development and utilising his passionate community of gamers to help him craft his vision, with the game on show and playable much earlier than traditional campaigns.\n\nThe Evolving Demo is not going to be on Steam forever, so play it now: https://store.steampowered.com/app/290100/Bulwark_Falconeer_Chronicles/\n\nBulwark: Falconeer Chronicles is a chilled base builder, focusing on the joy of freeform creation. Build, defend and expand fortified settlements shaped by the harsh landscapes of the Ursee. Explore your unforgiving environment, manage the flow of resources as you help to breathe life into the land and provide asylum to those lost! There is no scrollable view of a single map, there is an explorable 3D world in which you can build on any rock, cliff and mountain you can find. \n\nBuild without a grid or planar restriction, up or down it; does not matter. Meet and hire commanders and specialists that unlock new building options, units and stories. Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles requires a novel approach to building, something that isn't about clicking over a screen but focusing on the world itself. In this sense, the game is one of experimental gameplay and controls, supported by a world and settlement that comes alive before your eyes.\n\n#IndieGame #BuildYourBulwark #CityBuilder\n\nJoin the Bulwark Discord to share builds, Screenshots, videos and feedback with the games creator and Help to build Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles. https://discord.gg/falconeer\n\nFollow Tomas on Twitter: https://twitter.com/FalconeerDev\n\nFollow Wired: \n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/WiredP\u200b\u200b\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WiredPro\u200b\u200b\nDiscord : https://discord.gg/wiredp\u200b\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/wired_produ...\nBandcamp: https://wiredproductions.bandcamp.com...\nWired Unplugged Podcast: https://wired.gg/Unplugged", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_hBlLBPAL4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_hBlLBPAL4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_hBlLBPAL4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_hBlLBPAL4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c_hBlLBPAL4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles | Tomas Builds | Trailer", "description": "Join Tomas Sala the solo dev behind Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles as he does a deep dive.\nhttps://wired.gg/Bulwark\n\nForgoing the \u2018beta route\u2019, Tomas Sala has launched the first \u2018evolving demo\u2019 that will see players help shape Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles in a way never before seen.
