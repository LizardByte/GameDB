There was no Internet, no text messaging, and no GPS. Forget blue-and-pink neon. The 1980s were scary.\n\nThe game was delisted with the release of Faith: The Unholy Trilogy in 2022.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/faith-chapter-ii", "videos": [{"id": 30854, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sXInQXodLOk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXInQXodLOk", "title": "FAITH: CHAPTER II - Pixel Horror Indie Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sXInQXodLOk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
