The main character of the game is a fox. His beloved Suzy has been kidnapped on the other side of the Sahara desert, and to get her back he has to advance through 15 levels. Player's goal is to avoid dogs, construction workers, giant bees and similar creatures. The player can fight back by throwing objects back at them, or - most notably - picking walking enemies up from behind and throwing them as projectiles at other obstacles.
