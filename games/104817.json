But once upon a cruel wizard called Nemrok curses this place with wretched charms, placing seeds of evil into every living soul of Impossible Forest, even into \"the Guardians of the forest\" - the long-lived protectors of the forest.\n\nYou are playing as forester boy, named \"Little Jorji\" - the one who has an immunity to the evil wizard's charms. The controls are very simple - jump, air-dash, shoot, climb - but levels will become hard very fast and your every fail will be a lesson. Fast respawns, puzzles and crafty enemies will make your journey even more fun. Your main aim will be to purge evil forces from the Impossible Forest, making it peaceful again, while understanding why Nemrok has such an interest in this place ?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jorji-and-impossible-forest", "videos": [{"id": 21121, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YRIDStPhRoI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRIDStPhRoI", "title": "Jorji and Impossible Forest", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YRIDStPhRoI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
