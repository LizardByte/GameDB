You can still try to play, but you won't go much further than the main menu unfortunately. Well, maybe someone smart will be able to make it work, for instance by making the game glitch or something. But I doubt it. We've already tried everything.\n\nWhen we start the game, we're just faced with endless menus that make no sense. I mean just look at this mess. Someone managed to get to the world map and it's clearly unplayable.\n\nThe game worked perfectly well some time ago. We don't know what happened. It's as if something messed it up... from inside. I know it sounds insane but there's no other explanation. It's always the same. There's that weird smiley face taunting us and preventing us from going further. I've asked the team and it's clear none of them programmed this thing. Where the hell did this smiley face come from?\n\nWe'll still leave the game on Steam in case someone wants to solve this weird mystery. Just don't get your hopes up. Oh and by the way, the game doesn't even close. Some of our computers seem a bit messed up since we installed it. Legal notice: Our company won't be held liable for any damage it caused.", "summary": "You can't quit the game, but you can't play it either. You're stuck forever in endless menus full of glitches, unless you manage to break the code open.\n\nIt's a very unusual action-puzzle game that will make you think outside the box. Each screen is a new surprise, although not always a pleasant one. An ominous presence, taking the shape of an insufferable smiley face, will constantly taunt you and prevent you from progressing.
