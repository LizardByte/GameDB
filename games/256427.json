The update was first revealed in a blog post, followed by an immediate release on October 29, 2009. Aside from fixing a few issues, the update introduced two new maps: Harvest and Harvest Event. The release of these maps was unique as it was the first time that the same map had been released in both a standard and an event variety. The patch also introduced two new hazards: the ghost of Zepheniah Mann, which was exclusive to Harvest Event, and the Pumpkin Bomb, which only appears on Halloween-themed maps. Two new cosmetics were also introduced, the Mildly Disturbing Halloween Mask and the Ghastly Gibus, as was a pack of five Halloween-themed achievements known as Scarechievements. Finally, the patch introduced the Halloween pumpkin; a special pickup item that only appears on Halloween-themed maps and randomly drops when a player is killed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/team-fortress-2-terrifying-team-fortress-haunted-halloween-special"}
