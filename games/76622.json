You are the team\u2019s manager, a young Perkerian, thrust into the world of Arena Fighting by the drunken mischief of your reckless best friend, Jade. Together, you and your staff travel the realm of Khalea on the challenger\u2019s circuit, getting to know them and their stories as you lead your team to the Championship! As you explore the realm, you will encounter fantastic locations, intriguing characters, and exciting events in the Terry Pratchett-esque world of Khalea.", "summary": "In the magical land of Khalea, heroes are in no short supply. Alas, there is a woeful shortage of dragons to slay, or princesses to rescue. Thus, the heroes of Khalea find their adventures on the fields of Arenas across the land, in battles waged for the spectacle of common folk and nobles alike. Those hungry for adventure sell their swords on the open market, joining promising teams in exchange for a chance at coin and fame. Tides of townsfolk flock to the Arenas to free themselves from the drudgery of the mundane, and to watch their favorite teams of fearless fighters pit themselves against one another in epic battles for glory, riches, and the hearts of legions of fans. \n \nBeyond the arena walls toils another class of hero, busy banging dents from armor, mending bruises and broken bones, or teaching and training the newest recruits. These often forgotten heroes are the backbone of every team. Fighters move on, and contracts expire but these hardworking individuals remain, paving the path to glory for their warriors.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/challengers-of-khalea", "videos": [{"id": 16989, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fdxS0xJTTyE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdxS0xJTTyE", "title": "What is Challengers of Khalea?", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fdxS0xJTTyE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
