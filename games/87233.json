The player controls the altitude of a blue ribbon that is constantly moving from left to right through a cave. It's a one button game where the player makes the ribbon move upwards by touching the screen. When not touching the screen the line moves downwards. The goal of the game is to avoid crashing into the cave walls and to stay alive as long as possible. The further into the cave the player gets the cave become more narrow and the pace gets faster. At the end player gets a score based on how long he stays alive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sfcave"}
