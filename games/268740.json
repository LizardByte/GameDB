Against the clock, Fred must collect parts scattered across each room while avoiding deadly robots and hazards. With no weapons at his disposal, Fred's only defense is his agility, relying on well-timed jumps to evade enemies. Contact with any threat results in electrocution, costing Fred a precious life. The game features a unique navigation cheat that allows vertical movement between rooms, but using it restricts access to the top three levels, adding strategic depth to the gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fearless-fred-and-the-factory-of-doom", "videos": [{"id": 98699, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2HJA9Rzf9DQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJA9Rzf9DQ", "title": "Game of the day 3359 Fearless Fred and the Factory of Doom (\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30ec\u30b9\u30fb\u30d5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9) Mr. Chip Software 1986", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2HJA9Rzf9DQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
