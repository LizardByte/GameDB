After a piece was moved, a predefined delay prevented it from moving again for a short period of time. This, plus piece movements not being instantaneous, meant that speed and timing were crucial aspects of the game, as any delay could determine whether a piece was captured or whether said piece dodged the opponent's pieces. In addition to this, the game's \"real-time\" aspect led to essential differences between Kung-Fu Chess and standard chess. For instance, checks and pins did not exist in the game, since players were not bound to one move at a time and thus could respond to threats with multiple piece movements. Checkmate and stalemate were similarly both impossible to achieve; as such, the game only ended when one's king was physically captured or if one's opponent resigned. In following with the martial arts theme, the game also featured a rating system categorized by belt colors.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kung-fu-chess"}
