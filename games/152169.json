However, it was not enough, and with every new dawn humanity rose again knowing that, with darkness, comes extinction.\n\nHumanity found the \u2018Seal of Night,\u2019 an artifact that allowed them to stop the cycle in an everlasting day. In exchange for a blood oath that The Stalkers were willing to pay, the sun ruled for hundreds of generations and, for the first time, hope was a beacon of light. Yet fate proved unstoppable, and they paid the ultimate price.\n\nNow, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of the traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity.
