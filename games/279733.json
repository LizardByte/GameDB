An idea then began to germinate... a maze, and some ghosts? Why not try a scrolling isometric Pac-Man?\n\nHe's still not sure if a full isometric game is possible (that's for another day) but a scrolling flat one certainly is, and he's really pleased with the results. It looks good, is fluid and responsive, and features most of the aspects of the original - including the (slightly bugged) A.I. and attack patterns. Having a ghost as the main character means that I've had to supplemented the concept of 'lives' for 'spirit' - I mean, a ghost doesn't have a life, does it? - which introduces a slight twist on how you play the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-little-ghost"}
