When you die, you have to restart the level from the beginning which can get more then a little annoying.  \n\nAlso, you have to choose between sideshot and bombs as your secondary weapon but to me, the sideshot was mostly useless so pretty much use bombs throughout.  Also trying to use bth at the same time results in lower overall power of each shot.\n\n00:00:00 - Route 1\n00:39:25 - Route 2\n00:09:25 - Route 3\n01:34:50 - Boss Rush -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w45HrUxS6u8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w45HrUxS6u8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w45HrUxS6u8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w45HrUxS6u8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w45HrUxS6u8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [215] Super Nova (Darius Force)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by MadMatty (Read description for Timestamps)\n\nDarius for the Super Nintendo, called Super Nova in eu/us regions.
