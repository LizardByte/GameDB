Players choose different races and gamble on the outcome. Players can pick two different drivers they expect to come out on top. The racing itself is presented via prerendered CG cutscenes with some branching, so players' guesses aren't purely a matter of memorizing the cutscenes. With the money players earn, they can take part in the \"trip\" mode where they travel through the world of Wacky Races collecting items.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chiki-chiki-machine-mou-race-kenken-to-black-maou-no-ijiwaru-daisakusen", "videos": [{"id": 97770, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3bpx9q66h_U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpx9q66h_U", "title": "Chiki Chiki Machine Mou Race | Wacky Races - Live! 3DO Magazine Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3bpx9q66h_U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
