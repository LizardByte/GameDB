We have to go from memory (ugh), but it seems like the thruster sounds are different and initial landing a little more difficult than we remember. We also remember being able to rotate the ship 360 degrees. That said, it's still pretty close to the original and a great time waster.\n\nUse your left and right arrow keys to rotate the lander and the arrow down to thrust. Joysticks are supported. Like all Crozza Games, the game is portable, so no installation is needed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lunar-lander--4"}
