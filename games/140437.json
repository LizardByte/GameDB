As you journey over the mountains and under red-stained skies, you\u2019ll discover more about your companion and a land left in ruin. Uniquely designed to purposefully have no dialogue or narration. Players must breathe in their surroundings to solve various puzzles and speculate the meaning of a lost ancient civilization.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 43102, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "odKKiAlOyvY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odKKiAlOyvY", "title": "Spirit of the North Enhanced Edition - PS5 - Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/odKKiAlOyvY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
