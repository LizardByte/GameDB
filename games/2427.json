You have been summoned to embark on a noble journey to save all of humanity from an evil fate. You must keep your wits about you, your sword must stay sharp and ready, and your spells charged as you forge through Tempest's massive landscape. Descend into the maws of many a dark and dangerous dungeon in search of your quest's end.\n\nYou'll have at your disposal more than 25 spells and items of great power, each drawing upon one of the elemental forces such as earth, wind, fire, and lightning. Whether you prefer a more tactical approach or attack all-swords-swinging, Anvil of Dawn features a hybrid of real-time and turn-based combat to satisfy your needs. Remember, your choices and actions affect the ebb and flow of combat so think, and act, wisely. Are you prepared to pay the ultimate price, to steal away the gift of a dark god, and journey to the Anvil of Dawn.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 79452, "video_id": "Bq4xkmiwbRE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq4xkmiwbRE", "title": "Anvil Of Dawn trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bq4xkmiwbRE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
