Then one day, the island guardian Volzerk clashed with the legendary beast known as Magna, and both were apparently destroyed.\n\nTen years have passed since that day. Without the protection of Volzerk, the monsters of the island are in danger of extinction. However, a young girl is about to join the Research Commission. Her name is Fina, and she is the only human alive who witnessed Volzerk's disappearance. With her obsessive love of monsters, Fina's sole goal in life is to get as close to them as she can. And deep within her heart burns the desire to once again be reunited with Volzerk.", "summary": "Volzerk: Monsters and Lands Unknown is a Monster Breeding Action RPG.
