It contains rich and sometimes outlandish designs, themes, environments, and characters that go beyond the mainstream and standard metaverse projects.\n\nStarting out as a crypto token, it has evolved into a full-fledged game and environment built in Unreal Engine 5 and utilizing both on-chain and offchain assets so users can choose their level of involvement with blockchain technology. As the project's theme indicates, \"Be Yourself\" is the goal, and deep customization extends beyond characters to ships and environments.\n\nThere are portals within the STARL environment connecting to many aspects of the environment, such as the MMO Space flight, battle, and trading game Warp Nexus, live events arenas, living modules to conquer solar systems, meditation rooms, themed lounges, and the goal of integrating education into the environment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 81217, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "g70J1zPlAuM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g70J1zPlAuM", "title": "STARL Metaverse - Warp Nexus Chat w/ Scott Brown & Obie!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g70J1zPlAuM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 81218, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "um-8E-prrr8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um-8E-prrr8", "title": "Starlink Metaverse - Space Master FULL SHOW", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/um-8E-prrr8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
