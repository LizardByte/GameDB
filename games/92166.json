The player has to move a pawn from the left side of a labyrinth to the exit on the right side.\n\n- Supermind is a code breaking game. Four question marks will be displayed, along with the number of symbols left to be entered. The player enters four symbols of choice and if they're correct but misplaced, a red number will appear in the right of the screen (with the number of correct symbols guessed). If the symbol is correct and placed in the right order, it will be displayed in white. The computer keeps track of the number of tries taken and the game ends when all symbols were discovered and placed in the right order.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-labyrinth-game-slash-supermind"}
