I'll put aside a day soon to refine it a little more. So currently the picture frames on the walls are ominously empty and the main menu looks really excellent. \n \nThe only two functions in the scene currently are pressing the weather dial above the window changes the weather and clicking the bell around the cats neck changes the background music."}
