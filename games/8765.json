His witcher medallion twitched on his chest. Some kind of magic nearby, or some creature from another sphere. Either one spells trouble. So why hasn\u2019t she said anything? \u201cWe\u2019re here! And not a moment too soon \u2013 my saddle sores were about to incite an uprising.\u201d Dandelion always complained in his performing voice, to make sure his woes registered in the cheap seats.\n\nThis time his whining seemed especially loud, as though he were shouting to something in the darkness. Perhaps the cave\u2019s inhabitants were his intended audience. A profitable gold mine at one point, the caverns had been a gloomy, monster-infested place for decades. Villagers who wandered too close would vanish without a trace.\n\nLately, though, the gloom had receded, and no one had disappeared for months. The village elders knew someone who knew Geralt and had offered him a fat purse if he\u2019d gather a party to look into it. The elders claimed that the calm had disrupted the village\u2019s status quo. Yarpen stroked his beard and muttered something under his breath. He had suspected from the start the elders weren\u2019t telling them something. But he had agreed to come anyway. Why? And Triss \u2013 why was a court sorceress willing to abandon her post for a romp in an old mine? What was so special about this cave? As soon as they plunged into the darkness, Geralt knew he would have to wait for an answer \u2013 the hungry look of the ghouls crawling out of the void promised to keep him busy for a while.", "summary": "The Witcher Adventure Game takes players on a journey across the world of The Witcher as they assume the roles of four distinct characters known from the books and video games: Geralt of Rivia, Triss Merigold, Yarpen Zigrin and Dandelion. Each character has unique skills and multiple ways of overcoming obstacles - the choice is yours: do you fight your way to victory, call on your charm, or try your hand at diplomacy?\n\nA variety of quests invite players to hunt monsters, earn gold, and interact with the characters they meet in a web of alliances and treachery - a wild ride that starts as soon as you sit down to play. Players may assist one another from time to time, but make no mistake - there can be only one winner.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-witcher-adventure-game", "videos": [{"id": 73065, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sY_C_vWi4a0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY_C_vWi4a0", "title": "The Witcher Adventure Game | Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sY_C_vWi4a0/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 62, "name": "The Witcher"}]}
