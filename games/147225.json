There is some turn-based combat like in the mainline series and the game takes you to many exotic, surreal and sometimes disturbing places. Warau Warawau became a cult hit and is still popular among Japanese fans.\n\nThis is the first game to not use a mix of public domain music (classic, jazz, ragtime etc.), but instead it features the free music by Hirokazu Akiyama, whose music was also used in other RPG Maker games/series like Alicemare.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warau-warawau", "videos": [{"id": 49229, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6SnIy1q-R7A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SnIy1q-R7A", "title": "\u3010\u5b9f\u6cc1\u3011\u7b11\u3046\u308f\u3089\u308f\u3045\u306e\u5192\u967a\uff031\u3010\u7b11\u3046\u3001\u308f\u3089\u308f\u3045\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6SnIy1q-R7A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
