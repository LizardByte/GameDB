Its been really important for us that the Non-VR (Flat) version feels great and not just a cheap ported 2D version of the VR version. We've worked hard on making the cameras and controls feel great! If you have Help Wanted already on Steam or PS4, you can play in Flat mode. If you don't have VR you can buy and play the game in Flat mode and if you upgrade with a VR headset later (PC VR or PSVR) your game will work with that as well.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hhw_oM-jfwA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hhw_oM-jfwA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hhw_oM-jfwA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hhw_oM-jfwA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hhw_oM-jfwA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted NON-VR Teaser", "description": "We have been working really hard to create a version of Help Wanted for everyone who doesn't have access to a VR headset.
