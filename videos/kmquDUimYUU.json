This flexibility allows game developers limited choice in selecting a configuration to fit the game's specific requirements, and allows the platform as a whole to more efficiently support gaming titles with vastly different computing needs. For example, the Type X+ and Type X\u00b2 models have upgrade graphics processing power, which could be put toward better game visuals, or outputing to higher-resolution (HDTV) displays.
