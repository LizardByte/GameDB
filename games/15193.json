There are no changes to the gameplay formula: player(s) sing into a microphone and the game gives points based on the performance. The only basis of assessment is if the correct note is hit with the correct timing; the sung words or octave does not play into the result. The PS3 version allows access to the SingStore, an online shop for downloading additional songs.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/singstar-take-that"}
