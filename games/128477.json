There are numerous magical gems on the college grounds because of an experiment that a former researcher did. Now, those gems are running out.

To make matches, swap two tiles to create a row of three or more of the same tile in a horizontal or vertical line. To clear most levels, you must make matches over gold tiles to remove them. Later, you will encounter unpolished tiles that must be matched twice to clear them. Each level has more than one board and most board are wider than the screen, requiring you to scroll to see everything. As you progress, items will hinder you like chains, fog and boxes. You will have assistance from other wizards with things like breaking groups of chains or temporarily clearing fog so you can see what gems are there. After a couple levels, when you match four items together, you create a rainbow gem that can be matched with any two gems that are the same color. When you match five gems, you create a helix that can clear an entire horizontal row.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jewel-match-iv"}
