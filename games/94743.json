It is the twelfth game in the beatmania series and is part of the BEMANI franchise.\n\nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch.\n\n7thMIX allow the player to have separate lanes for the two black keys. Instead of in between the lanes of the white keys. This makes the lanes much closer to the beatmania IIDX series. 1-Turn scratches are introduces, where you need to turn the turntable exactly once to get the best score.\n\nMANIAC has been renamed back to ANOTHER again. All singles and double charts has been re-rated and for the first time in the series the rate for the single chart and the double chart are rated separately.\n\nThe game has 27 songs returning from 6thMIX and introduced an additional 32 songs for a total of 59 songs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatmania-7thmix-keepin-evolution", "videos": [{"id": 38401, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "s4iX2w-8AKU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4iX2w-8AKU", "title": "Beatmania 7thMIX ~keepin' evolution~ gameplay (part 1)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s4iX2w-8AKU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
