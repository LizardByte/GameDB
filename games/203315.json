For example, it features the unique \u201cGlimmer\u201d and \u201cCombo\u201d systems, where characters can learn awesome new abilities in the heat of battle, the beautiful illustrations, and the wonderful soundtrack by Composer Kenji Ito.\n\nIt also features the series\u2019 Free-form Scenario System, which lets you experience the story differently depending on how you play. You choose one of eight main characters, and as you explore the vast world, your actions and decisions will weave a story that is uniquely yours.\n\nAll that already makes the game a must-play for fans of classic turn-based RPGs, but this release adds even more.\n\nThe game now features remastered high-definition graphics, new quality-of-life features that make it easier and more convenient to play, and you can even expect some new elements too!", "videos": [{"id": 68953, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1-sMRwc5boM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-sMRwc5boM", "title": "Romancing Saga -Minstrel Song- Remastered | Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1-sMRwc5boM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
