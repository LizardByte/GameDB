The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed! \n \nScummVM supports a huge library of adventures with over 250 games in total. It supports many classics published by legendary studios like LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software, Cyan, Inc. and Westwood Studios. Next to ground-breaking titles like the Monkey Island series, Broken Sword, Myst, Blade Runner and countless other games you will find some really obscure adventures and truly hidden gems to explore.", "videos": [{"id": 34379, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3toVdVuZ6EA"}]}
