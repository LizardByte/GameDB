The device featured a strap so the player would be able to wear it around the neck in-between playing. The Tomytronic simulated 3D by having two LCD panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device. Released in 1983, it was the first dedicated home video 3D hardware.\n\nThundering Turbo has the player driving down a three-lane highway, avoiding cars as they enter your lane."}
