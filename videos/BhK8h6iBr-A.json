The 2600 version has you fighting against waves of Hamburgers, Cookies, Bugs, Radial Tires, Diamonds, Steam Irons, Bow Ties, and the dreaded Space Dice, which look a lot like the yellow D20s a DM from my childhood used quite sadistically. If you call it a Space Invader clone, I'll teabag you with my sweaty balls in your sleep. If you call it an Astro Blaster clone, you'd be closer to the mark\u2014even the ships look alike. Still, I will always cherish this game, and fighting the things that I assume appear at the outer edge of the universe.\n\nThe game has two modes- guided shots and straight shots, each with a two player alternating option. The enemies offer a variety of patterns, some even change the size of their hit box as they rotate. Even though the Space Dice don't fire, they still prove to be formidable opponents.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BhK8h6iBr-A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BhK8h6iBr-A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BhK8h6iBr-A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BhK8h6iBr-A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Megamania (Atari 2600)", "description": "Activision's Megamania will always hold a place of sheer awesome in this gamer's soul.
