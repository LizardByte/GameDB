You wake up from a coma that has lasted for centuries, only to find your once-grand estate is now in ruins. It's time to turn it into a prosperous hotel! It's no easy task, though, as times are tough and resources are scarce. There are shortages of food, supplies, and workforce. Being a blood-thirsty monster doesn't help with customer satisfaction either. Luckily, underneath the estate lies a crypt and a system of caves. By foraging, farming, crafting, and fighting your way through the monster-infested dungeons, you'll find the resources you need to restore greatness to your mansion and turn it into a thriving hotel business.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloody-hell-hotel", "videos": [{"id": 73368, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ZP6gqoo-Dxo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP6gqoo-Dxo", "title": "Bloody Hell Hotel | Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZP6gqoo-Dxo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
