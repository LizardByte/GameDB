Read on below for more information...\n\nThe School Girl is an alternative version of a female character in the game (who is also a hidden character).\n\nFrom the looks of it, she is a hidden character which you can unlock and select in the game.\n\n===== About the School Girl =====\nAs an alternative version, she is most likely based on the 'regular' version of herself (in the karate uniform). I did not demonstrate the regular version of her, but you get the picture anyway.\n\nShe has some good fast combos, but her strike range is a bit short. She seems like a really basic character, but then I do not know her move-list.\n\nShe has a taunt, where she turns round and slaps her behind.\n\n===== About Shura no Mon =====\nShura no Mon is based on a Japanese manga series of the same name.\n\nThe game is based on the martial art of karate, and tries to be authentic with it. The game-play works by having the player out-last each other using mostly single blows, which needs some patience and strategy. You won't find any fancy stuff in here, although there are a few combos and some flashes of special moves that take off ridiculous amounts of life.\n\nAnother interesting feature is the fact that the fighter's arms can be  disabled, depending on the move used to inflict it. I'm not sure if this can apply to their legs though. \n\nThe hit-pause is almost non-existent, which makes the game feel very 'light' and shoddy.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QP8wsqNGyg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QP8wsqNGyg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QP8wsqNGyg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QP8wsqNGyg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0QP8wsqNGyg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Shura no Mon [PS1] - play as the School Girl", "description": "This is a play-through using the School Girl in the PS1 version of Shura no Mon.
