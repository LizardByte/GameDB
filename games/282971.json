In it the player takes the view from a spaceship cockpit so moving in the different directions shifts the entire screen. There are four levels you will play through avoiding obstacles, saving humans, and defeating alien enemies. Upon beating the four levels the game loops but will be more difficult.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blaster--3", "videos": [{"id": 110852, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Pq0v8-rk9VA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq0v8-rk9VA", "title": "Blaster [Arcade Longplay] (1983) Williams / Vid Kidz", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pq0v8-rk9VA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
