However, numerous years are skipped as the game is progressed.\n\nNPCs in the game, including the main character's son and wife also grow older as time passes. The game takes place in a new setting for the Harvest Moon series - a small village called Forget-Me-Not Valley, populated entirely by new characters.\n\nThe basic plot is familiar from several previous Harvest Moon games: the main character, a young man, inherits a somewhat run-down farm in Forget-Me-Not-Valley after the death of his father. Unlike most games however, the game features a variety of chapters.", "summary": "Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life will span a lifetime on the farm and follow the drama that goes with it.
