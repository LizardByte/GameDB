Are you bored with fuss? In this case, Chill Out gives you the opportunity to soar over all the worries and bothersome bustle that surrounds you. In this little game you can really relax, flying between the houses, which are illuminated by the rays of the morning sun. Listening to instrumental music that complements the overall picture and landscapes, you can feel the carefree atmosphere of the early morning when the city is still asleep, but the air is haunted by the feeling of a quick awakening of the whole environment and people living in it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
