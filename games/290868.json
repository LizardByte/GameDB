Like all previous installments, it once again consists of spectacular fight scenes featuring a black stickman.\n\nThe initial part of Xiao Xiao No. 6 is a series of more or less non-interactive fight scenes, where the player must simply keep pressing Space to keep the animation going, with no penalty for delaying. In the next scene, the hero's opponent is locked in a jail cell and the player's goal is to click levers at the bottom to activate crushers in order to kill the prisoner; it's not that easy because the prisoner is smart enough to avoid descending crushers. In the final scene, the player must press Space rapidly to fill a power bar before the time limit, so that the protagonist can deal a single powerful, finishing blow to his opponent; in the case of failure the player can immediately try again.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xiao-xiao-no-6"}
