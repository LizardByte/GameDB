You can smash your way through 4 twisting city stages, or attempt to avoid detection all together. Either way the Human AI will adapt as you progress - the more contact you have, the more aggressive they'll become. There are even some unique minigames to add to the excitement - Yeti Frisbee, managing the local \"Yeti Kingdom Of Eats\" restaurant, and catching poultry to offer to your prospective mate. You can even float down a lazy sewer river o' fun on a giant tube! Achieve the ultimate goal and show the world just what kind of Bigfoot you really are.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/urban-yeti"}
