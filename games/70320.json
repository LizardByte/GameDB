This add-on extends the original game with new missions and environments for players to explore in the RAH-66 Comanche attack helicopter. The expansion likely introduces more challenging scenarios and possibly new enemy types or weapons, pushing players' skills to the limit - as suggested by the \"Over the Edge\" subtitle. It maintains the core gameplay of the original, utilizing NovaLogic's Voxel engine to render detailed terrain and objects. Over the Edge aims to provide fresh content for fans of the base game, offering additional opportunities to engage in helicopter combat missions with the accessible flight model and intense action that characterizes the Comanche series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/comanche-maximum-overkill-over-the-edge"}
