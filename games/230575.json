The game is loosely based on Mendelian genetics, in which players grow various types of plants, aiming to become a Master Gardener by growing twenty unique breeds of plants. Growing plants are watered by visiting Miis encountered on StreetPass. After a flower has bloomed, players can receive new seeds by breeding their plant with plants of other Miis. Flowers can be arranged in several gardens where the player may take screenshots that are saved to the Nintendo 3DS Camera. Flowers and unwanted seeds can be sold for money, which can be spent on new accessories, seeds, and plots. Job quests are available where the player is tasked with growing plants of specific qualities to fulfill customer requirements.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flower-town"}
