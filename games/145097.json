Where will the quarrels over differing principles lead to?\n\nUnleash continuous attacks with Limit Burst in turn-based battles and form partnerships with the Familiar Spirits! The Magic Lab lets you power up your skills and you can also enjoy setting fields, dowsing areas, and visit side-job rooms to get items at the Magical Garden!
