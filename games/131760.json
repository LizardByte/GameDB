He soon meets the Head Librarian Angela, and after a brief scuffle, she decides to spare him and recruits him to be her guide on the outside world. Angela has a strange way of going about it though, as she sends out calling cards called Invitations to ask people to come to the Library and gives them a choice in whether they accept or decline. If the guests accept, they must survive mortal combat against the Librarians that guard the building; if they win, they can take any book they want. If they lose, they will become a book themselves. All of this is in service to Angela's goal \u2014 gaining the one \"perfect\" book that can make her into a human.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/library-of-ruina", "videos": [{"id": 34264, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5l15KJZO9sU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l15KJZO9sU", "title": "[ Libary of Ruina ] Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5l15KJZO9sU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 72218, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "KZipE3-BmjA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZipE3-BmjA", "title": "[ Library of Ruina ] Official Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KZipE3-BmjA/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 72219, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "bw1HLyrw4Vg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw1HLyrw4Vg", "title": "[ Library of Ruina ] Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bw1HLyrw4Vg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 107677, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aSq-ZN12TLk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSq-ZN12TLk", "title": "\u300eLibrary Of Ruina\u300f(PS4/Switch) \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6620\u50cf\u2161\uff5e\u63a5\u5f85\u7de8\uff5e", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aSq-ZN12TLk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
