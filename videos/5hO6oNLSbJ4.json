{"id": "5hO6oNLSbJ4", "snippet": {"title": "Steampunk style 'Metroidvania' like Game-PlateMan trailer PV", "description": "Greetings, players! Today please allow me to introduce a brand-new game Plateman, a steampunk Metroidvania game with Shaman elements. Playing as a student who accidentally gets into a steam world, adventuring in a civilization ruled by different engines having their own consciousnesses. The soul of the protagonist also possesses another fallen mechanic soldier, losing his previous memory. Aventure in the world full of mechanical devices and find the truth of the world and the memory!\n\nMany branches are designed on the map. Jump, attack, and sprint. Travel through the platforms. Explore unknown rooms one by one. What is worth mentioning is the design of the weapon, which is not a traditional firearm or sword, yet is Shaman Drum. It is a special weapon that attacks through the sound of a strike. The attack way is also relevant to one of the lore designs. If you are interested, add the game to your wishlist to keep informed. More game content will be revealed soon!\n\nSteam Page\uff1ahttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2146970/_/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hO6oNLSbJ4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hO6oNLSbJ4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hO6oNLSbJ4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hO6oNLSbJ4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5hO6oNLSbJ4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Steampunk style 'Metroidvania' like Game-PlateMan trailer PV", "description": "Greetings, players!
