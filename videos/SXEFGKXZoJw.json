Just as in the original before it, it stars a young Terry from Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation as The Hero.\n\nThe game begins with young Terry and Milly living peacefully in their house, in the days before Dragon Quest VI, when Terry and Milly were just children. When they go to bed at night, Terry gets up and goes into the next room. A strange monster then appears from a dresser kidnaps Milly and then vanishes back into the dresser he came from. Soon after, another monster, similar to the kidnapper, appears from the same dresser looking for Milly, but is surprised to learn that she has already been taken away. The monster, called Fluffy, then asks Terry if he would like to find out where his sister and the kidnapper are, and to follow him to the Kingdom of GreatTree. Fluffy and Terry both go into the dresser and Terry then finds himself in an unknown land. He meets the king and receives Slib the slime, his first monster to train. If Terry wins the Monster Trainers' Starry Night Tournament, he will be granted a wish. So Terry sets out with his team to explore the many monster dungeons to win the tournament and rescue his sister. \n\n\n\n\n\nFootage taken from:\nhttps://github.com/citra-emu/citra-canary/releases/tag/canary-1654\n\n\n\n\u00a0:::::download citra nightly / canary here:::::\nhttps://citra-emu.org/download/\n\n\nBE A FACEBOOK FAN: https://www.facebook.com/Citraemulatorforfans/\n\nCITRA - http://citra-emu.org/\nCITRA GITHUB - https://github.com/citra-emu/citra\n\n\nPC specs:\nCPU - Intel Core i7 8700K @ 5.0 Ghz\nRAM - G.SKILL 32GB DDR4 3600MHz CL16\nGPU - GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GAMING OC 8G\nOS - Windows 10 64bit", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXEFGKXZoJw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXEFGKXZoJw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXEFGKXZoJw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXEFGKXZoJw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SXEFGKXZoJw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland 3D - 3DS Gameplay 4K 2160p (Citra)", "description": "Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland 3D - 3DS Gameplay 4K 2160p (Citra)\n\n\u2665\u2665 Support Citra developers: https://www.patreon.com/citraemu \u2665\u2665\n\nSubscribe for more videos https://goo.gl/aDX1a1\nJohnGodgamesHD Channel subscribe: https://goo.gl/W9f1n4\nVisit us at http://www.godgames-world.com for more\n\nDragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland 3D (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba \u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c93D) - is the Nintendo 3DS 2012 remake of the 1999 Dragon Quest Monsters.
