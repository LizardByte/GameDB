This version of the mode has additional custom assets from the first basic one which was limited to cod4 only assets besides the custom mini map, and now a ton of MW3 assets are added to make the whole survival experience much closer to MW3! Source files for the MW3 Mod assets will be probably ready for upload a few days after this upload on the moddb page of the mode. If there are problems with the custom asset collection the upload will either take longer or in the worst case scenario, not take place at all.\n\nCredits:\n\nA ton of thanks to my very good online friend and programmer helper Scillman. Most of the features I implemented would either take too much time or never been completed if it wasn't for his valuable help. Not only in this mode. But in most of my projects. Also special thanks to Erik and NikolaiBelinski. The Lookout map itself was ported from Stendby and the survival implementation is made by SPi along with minor lighting tweaks and fixes.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BnoNQw5Eq2Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BnoNQw5Eq2Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BnoNQw5Eq2Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BnoNQw5Eq2Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BnoNQw5Eq2Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Call of Duty 4: Survival Mode MW3 Mod SHIPMENT LONG MAP RELEASE", "description": "Call of Duty 4 Survival Mode has been expanded with a mod that brings more MW3 elements to it!
