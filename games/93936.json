Unfortunately, the greenhouse is failing, and the owner is going to sell to a developer in eight weeks.

(For example, taking clover to a cow to get milk in return, or turning tomatoes into ketchup.)", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ranch-rush", "videos": [{"id": 140896, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "hgv8MrT-qeg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgv8MrT-qeg", "title": "Ranch Rush", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hgv8MrT-qeg/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6534, "name": "Ranch Rush"}]}
