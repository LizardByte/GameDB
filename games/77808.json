Tunsia fell in May leaving no Axis territory in North Africa. On July 5th, they launched their last great offensive on the Russian Front at Kursk and were nearing their \"highwater mark\" when the Allies struck at the \"soft underbelly\" of Europe by invading Sicily. The Invading American and British forces took 38 days to capture the island due to skillful defense and fighting withdrawal in some of the most difficult terrain in the war prompting one author, Carlo D'Este to call this battle a \"Bitter Victory\". Can you capture the island faster? Should the Allies have opted to have Patton invade western Sicily instead of covering Monty's flank? Find out with Sicily '43."}
