With crime back on the rise, the city will have to pull through and pray for a miracle\u2014fortunately, their prayers have been answered.\n\nAfter an attempt to silence the terrorist organisations, your squad receives word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately, they're a few days away from the city, and the G-Police can't keep things under control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival.\n\nThings are already too late when the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city. Those small gangs have become full-blown crime syndicates, making the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the upper hand. The G-Police uses a variety of five-attack choppers, including the Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines supplied their Corsair cruise ship, Raptor and Rhino: a giant mechanised robot used for mass destruction and a heavily armed patrol vehicle.", "summary": "G-Police: Weapons of Justice is a combat flight simulation video game and sequel to G-Police, developed by Psygnosis exclusively for PlayStation.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/g-police-weapons-of-justice", "collections": [{"id": 1116, "name": "G-Police"}]}
