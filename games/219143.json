The players then assume the role of this unexpected hero, who must get back home again without getting killed, while attempting to get rid of the evil forces and restore spiritual equilibrium and order in the strange dimension where the Zone is located.", "summary": "Datura Time is a third-person action-adventure game that catapults you into a realm swirling with mystery, suspense, and dynamic action. This captivating world is a tribute to the 90's console games era, handcrafted with love and passion by a single-developer, Vladeta Stojanovic, with an infusion of post-Soviet and Eastern European aesthetics.\n\nYou, the player, are plunged into an enigmatic alternative reality known as the \"Zone\" after an accidental encounter with a peculiar drug - \"Datura\". Here, you'll cross paths with a host of characters, some allies, some foes, all delivering a singular message - you are an outsider and the unfolding reality is more than meets the eye.\n\nAs you navigate this perilous world, you'll unravel the Zone's hidden truths - it's a metaphysical limbo, home to the souls of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, currently under the control of malevolent entities. This sinister realm is in desperate need of a true hero - a role YOU never expected but must now embrace. Your mission? Survive, defeat the wicked forces, restore balance, and return home.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/datura-time", "videos": [{"id": 92956, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "a9v1WlbA8q0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9v1WlbA8q0", "title": "Datura Time Early Access Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a9v1WlbA8q0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
