(NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Fuji TV's 1986 platformer for the Nintendo Famicom Disk System, All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros.

The first level now takes place at nighttime, some of the enemies have been changed to suit the likenesses of a few of the radio show's DJs, and various other changes have been made to background and item graphics. The ending is also different, resembling more the end of Super Mario Bros. 2 (\"The Lost Levels,\" not the American game originally released as SMB2) than the original's, but the Toads now look like various personalities from the show. Much of the game actually looks like SMB2 - it appears as if the levels from the original have been transplated into the framework of the sequel. \n\nRandom question: did the moving platforms in this one remind anyone else of those packs of dinner rolls you'd buy at the grocery store?\n\nYou also can now play as Luigi, and he plays just like he did in SMB2 - he's far more agile than Mario, but he's also a bit more unwieldy thanks to his speed and his slipperiness on flat surfaces. \n\nThough most of the stages feature minor differences from the original SMB (mainly in enemy placement and number), a few stages have been swapped around, and a few have been outright replaced with stages from SMB2. \n\nThe biggest and most notable change, and the one that really makes this version worth checking out, is the inclusion of somewhat altered versions of the final special stages from SMB2. Of course, these aren't easily accessed: this video is much longer than what you might expect for a playthrough of Super Mario Bros. because it is much more than a single playthrough.\n\nTo access levels A-1 through D-4, you have to beat the game eight times in a row. Notice the stars to the top-left of the title screen's logo graphic? That shows how many times the game has been successfully completed. You can play with either character, and warp zones don't disqualify a run of a game loop from the count,  so here's how I did the video:\n\nPlaythrough #1 is done with Mario, and all 32 stages are shown.  No warps at all. \n\n38:34, 2nd loop with Mario begins. \n     All loops after the first are of a higher difficulty level.\n     Warps zones are used in playthroughs 2 through 8.\n     Stage order: 1-1, 1-2, 4-1, 4-2, 8-1 through 8-4.\n\n49:56, 3rd loop with Luigi begins. \n59:00, 4th loop (Luigi)\n1:08:43, 5th loop (Mario)\n1:17:54, 6th loop (Mario)\n1:26:57, 7th loop (Luigi)\n1:36:39, 8th loop (Luigi)\n\n1:45:57, 9th playthrough (Luigi) - starts at level A-1 and shows all of the special bonus stages. The game no longer begins at 1-1 after the eighth loop has been completed.\n\nFor several years I have had a playthrough posted of just the first run through the game, but that really seemed lacking given the bonus stages, so here is a replacement to really show off what this game has to offer. \n\nThis is such an odd, obscure title considering how it is an official release that Nintendo themselves didn't publish. Given that there were so few copies of it ever made, I thought it deserved some proper, thorough documenting!\n\nAnd on a related noted, did you know that the Mario theme actually got lyrics and was released as a single in Japan? The lyrics were picked from yet another contest on All Night Nippon.
