The game is a vertical scrolling top down shoot-em-up with the screen scrolling constantly. You control your ship with a joystick and with a sight in front of you, you must bomb various buildings and defences which shoot at you trying to destroy you. Get shot and you lose one of four lives and the game can be played by one or two players, each taking it in turn when the other player loses a life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
