Invasion Mode will also be available in co-operative play increasing the challenge for the Axis invader as they now have two Allies to track down, but offering greater rewards.\n\nInvasion Mode will enable some unique skills for both players. The Axis invader can use of the AI Axis forces to help locate the Allied player. Tagging an Axis soldier will enable \u2018Eagle Eyes\u2019 which means that if that soldier spots the Allied Sniper then their last known location will be displayed on the map. \n\nThe Axis Sniper can also instruct nearby soldiers to \u2018Stay Sharp\u2019, increasing their awareness. For the Allied Sniper, each level has invasion phones scattered around the map which the player can use to discover the last known location of their opponent. But beware, as not only can these phones be booby trapped, but overuse will raise suspicions and reveal the player\u2019s location.\n\nSuccessful Axis Snipers will be rewarded with weapons, items and skin unlocks while Allied Snipers can earn weapon and character skins by killing their opponent. You will also be awarded with additional XP for having Invasion Mode enabled.\n\nSNIPER ELITE 5\nAs part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, Karl makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. It\u2019s Karl\u2019s mission to take out the high-ranking Nazi officers and end Operation Kraken once and for all. \n\nBased upon real world locations from France in 1944 the new game maps are the largest and most immersive in the franchise\u2019s history with the new traversal system offering players an even greater sandbox of options when it comes to taking out their targets. You can even invite a friend to help you on your mission with enhanced co-operative gameplay options.\n\nSniper Elite 5 continues the franchise\u2019s unparalleled tactical sniping experience complete with incredible ballistics and enhanced kill cam taking the genre-defining feature to the next level. New customisation options allow you to adjust your rifle, other weapons and ammo to suit the mission and your play style. \n\nWhy not check out our blog for even more information and exciting insights about Sniper Elite 5 http://reb.to/SE5Blog\n\nThe new CGI trailer was created by Rebellion VFX.
