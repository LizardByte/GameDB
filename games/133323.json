Your only option is to close your eyes. \n \nYou may need to adjust the graphical settings depending on your computer. \nEstimated play time is 1 hour.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 35804, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_7pyE9tl_dc"}]}
