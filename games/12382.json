The game takes place in a parallel universe to the visual novel Fate/stay night. At the start of the game, the player may choose to play as either a male or female character, as well as selecting one of three Servants \u2014 Saber, Archer, or Caster, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Players spend one ingame \"week\" interacting with other characters, viewing scenes that advance the game's story, talking to their Servant in their room, and gathering clues to the identity of the enemy Servant. At the end of each day, they enter the Arena, a dungeon in which they can battle monsters to gain experience points and strengthen their Servant. The game's turn-based battle system is comparable to rock-paper-scissors -- \"Attack\" overpowers \"Break\", Break overpowers \"Guard\", and Guard overpowers Attack. During battle, both the player and the opponent line up six such moves at the beginning of each turn.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fate-slash-extra", "videos": [{"id": 5446, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "bIIY9w9Tq-A"}, {"id": 5447, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jQ8GzLPRqME"}]}
