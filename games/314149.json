This MegaWAD shows what Doom 2 from an alternate universe might look like, with all 32 maps being made in the style of Sandy Petersen's original levels. And not just visually! Layouts, gimmicks, enemy placements, even all bugs, glitches, limitations and other quirks have been faithfully recreated.\n\nThis WAD doesn't distinguish between \"good\" or \"bad\", it just aims to recreate the original experience as accurately as possible, warts and all. It's a celebration of Doom 2, and a love letter to Petersen's design philosophy in particular.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/into-sandys-cities", "videos": [{"id": 123241, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "txv_lj4-Rn8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txv_lj4-Rn8", "title": "Into Sandy's Cities - a Megawad in the Style of Sandy Petersen", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/txv_lj4-Rn8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
