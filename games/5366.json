It was released simultaneously for multiple consoles and while the plot remains largely the same, there are differing styles of gameplay and graphics across platforms.\n\nThis version of Bram Stoker's Dracula is a side-scrolling platforming action game where you play as the young lawyer named Jonathan Harker. Harker must free himself from Count Dracula's captivity, follow him to London, and end his reign of terror.\n\nThroughout the levels, Abraham Van Helsing will help Jonathan in his quest by providing advanced weapons. The game includes six different stages (each having between a number of areas, except for the final stage which only has one area) and fights various bosses, such as Lucy Westenra as a vampiress, Count Dracula's three brides, Dracula's coach driver, Dracula's fire-breathing dragon, Renfield, and even Dracula himself in multiple forms, such as his bat form, his young form, his evil wolf form and finally his knight form.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bram-stoker-s-dracula", "videos": [{"id": 40721, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_q0VNbyf7Vw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q0VNbyf7Vw", "title": "SNES Longplay [314] Bram Stokers Dracula", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_q0VNbyf7Vw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
