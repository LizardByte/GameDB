With TIME magazine's '1993 product of the year'? Wanna play with the... 3DO?! After just releasing There Is Hope for the Atari Jaguar this year, Remute goes even more niche and already comes up with his next interactive music album Remute 3D exclusively for the 3DO.\n\nRemute 3D contains 15 brand new tracks ranging from psychedelic techno trance bliss to adventurous, spaced-out new wave electro-pop. It is showcasing once more Remute's versatility and lust for experimenting while staying true to his 90s electronica and rave roots.
