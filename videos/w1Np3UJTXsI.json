Half of human beings were turned into zombies to strengthen his army. But in the end, his invasion failed. He was defeated by humans, and got sealed under the base of St. Maria Church.\nA few hundreds of years later, wars of land fighting by humans burned the church to ashes. The new king of the land didn't know the history. Everyone thought the zombie lord was merely a legend. People started to build new taverns until they finally forgot about this dark taboo.\nIn the year of 1949, workers of Fort.Inc found a dark sarcophagus. They broke the tomb attached with magic stones, wishing for treasures, without knowing that an ancient lord of death has awakened and will rule this world again.\n\n[Infect Humans and Build Up Your Zombie Army]\nUnlike the other zombie games. Here, you are an evil commander. You will be leading your zombies to infect humans and turn them into walking dead to spread over the cities until you have a powerful army.\n\n[Powerful Zombie Generals]\nThousands of years ago, there were many zombie generals with different abilities under your command. After that legendary war, they all got sealed in the world of death. As your own ability is coming back, you will be able to call them back. Fire zombies, witch zombies, zombie dragons, devour zombies, and ten more different zombie generals will help you re-rule this world.\n\n[Evolve Zombie Talents and Fight Humans]\nHumans have powerful technology to develop diversified defense systems, strong soldiers, and even mechanical BOSS. But zombies can devour humans life spirit to evolve or mutate. Choose their evolving direction and use their different abilities to fight back against humans.\n\n[Dysfunctionize Cities, and Destroy them]\nThere are more than 20 unique cities in the game. Each has a large number of citizens, health system, technology center, and police forces that all work under certain rules. Observe and understand the differences among them. Find their weaknesses, make the best strategy, and infiltrate their cities until they are fully dominated.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1Np3UJTXsI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1Np3UJTXsI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1Np3UJTXsI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1Np3UJTXsI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1Np3UJTXsI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Swarm the City | Free Demo Trailer | New Casual Strategy Zombie Game | Coming June 16th", "description": "Free demo will be released on Steam by JUNE 16.
