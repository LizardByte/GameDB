Dein letzter Tag... just in a school instead of a office. The player takes the role of a pupil who wants to cause as much chaos as possible. With simple point & click controls the player walks trough the levels and uses the various items to play his pranks, e.g. knocking over a bucket or tearing apart a notebook. For some actions he needs to collect and use another item, e.g. toilet paper to clog a toilet.\n\nEvery action takes time and is rewarded with points, more complicated or mean ones give more. So the main goal for a level is to beat the highscore in a limited time. When the player gets caught he has to absolve a mini game of Hangman where he has to guess words in a limited time and in limited tries. The campaign consists of 21 levels and the player can choose his gender and the names of the NPCs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-school-schulverweis"}
