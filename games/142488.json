Well\u2026 Tiny Lands uses the basic concept of this idea, but with a new twist.\n\nWhat makes it different from traditional \u201cFind the differences\u201d games? Let us summarize what makes Tiny Lands so unique:\n\nChange the way you look at things - You play in a 3D environment, which means you can interact with the scene to adjust the angle and zoom your view.\n\nBring scenes to life with dynamic objects - You will experience a changing aura with fire, rain, thunder, snow, and wind. It all adds a lot of charm to the scenery.\n\nExperience many different environments - When you play on a beach scene, you can hear the sounds of waves and listen to how seagulls sing\u2026 It\u2019s very refreshing\u2026\n\nRelax and have fun at your own tempo - There is no time limit, so you don\u2019t have to worry about how long you spend in a level. Set your favorite lo-fi music and play at your own pace.\n\nTake it easy - Anyone can make mistakes, right? That's why there is no punishment for that. Grab a cup of coffee on a rainy day and just chill out :)\n\n*A curious note about Tiny Lands\nDid you know the game creators are twins? The idea started because people used to be confused with them, and they always pranked people to think they were the other one. So they took all this and put it in a very simple yet beautiful game to find the differences.", "summary": "Take your perceptivity to a new dimension in a relaxing low-poly isometric puzzle game.
