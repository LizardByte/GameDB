You can face a single match or the Sea Cup, a series of rounds in five world camps (Rimini, Fiji, Seychelles, Ibiza, Miami).\n\nEach player always controls the same volleyball player during a match; each of the four volleyball players can be controlled by a human player or by the computer, and in the case of two human players these can cooperate in the same team or be opponents. In the Amiga version, as in the previous World Cup 90 of the same manufacturers, it is also supported the hardware accessory that allows you to connect up to 4 joysticks, allowing three or four human players to participate simultaneously.\n\nIn beating you can choose whether or not to use the jump; the other reception, dribble and dunk moves are automatically chosen based on the situation and the player only needs to position himself and press the fire button. In defense you can make the wall. Trajectory and force of the shots are influenced by the precision in the synchrony of the shot. The shadow perpendicular to the ground helps to understand the position of the ball", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/over-the-net", "videos": [{"id": 125794, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pP1EHWf5Jow", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP1EHWf5Jow", "title": "[Amiga 500] Over the Net (Games)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pP1EHWf5Jow/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
