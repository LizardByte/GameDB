This time, he plans to melt the polar ice caps with the help of Tempest, another of Action Mans arch enemies, who has the power to control the weather. Complete a series of action-packed missions in order to help Action Man foil Dr. X's plans for world domination and restore peace. \n\nSince his embarrassing defeat at your hands, Action Man, Doctor X has been in hiding. But he has been scheming and planning, calculating his wicked return with precision so he will never be beaten again and will be able to fulfill his lifelong ambition: to take over the world! During his concealment he has recruited the dastardly Tempest, a character who is capable of manipulating the weather \u2013 a skill that Doctor X is eager to harness. Now Doctor X and Tempest have finally made their appearance in the Arctic where they are starting to put their evil plans into action. Action Man, you must stop these wicked tricksters before it\u2019s too late. You are the only one who can save the Arctic and, indeed, the World! You will need skill, speed, patience, and power.\n\n\nDrop Zone\n \nUsing your Action Man Helicopter, you must drop a series of crates containing high-tech equipment like the Polar Bike, Roamer Robot and other bits and pieces that will be needed in your battle to stop Doctor X and Tempest. You must drop the crates on specially placed landing sites.\n \nThermal Threat\n\nAn Action Man satellite has picked up faint readings of a series of bases about 1 kilometre North of your Arctic base. We suspect Doctor X is using high technology camouflage equipment, making it impossible to see these bases with the naked eye! Action Man, these bases must be destroyed. Head over there and using Blizzard\u2019s thermal imaging camera tally exactly what you see. When you\u2019ve done this we\u2019ll send in the stealth bombers to destroy this area.\n\n \nPolar Penguin Problems\n\nAction Man, a group of penguins have been spotted North East of your Arctic base. But, hang on, penguins aren\u2019t found in the Arctic. They come from the Antarctic - which is on the other side of the world! This can only mean one thing \u2013 they must be robotic penguins designed by Doctor X to block off an important mountain pass.\n\n\nCave Chaos\n\nAction Man, another satellite has identified some strange readings in a nearby cave and we suspect Doctor X is behind it somehow! It\u2019s going to be too dangerous for yourself or Blizzard to investigate\u2026 it\u2019s time for the Super Roamer Robot!!\n\n\nPolar Bike Perils\n\nHQ has identified a cluster of buildings containing ice melting chemicals and equipment. If these are not destroyed immediately the ice caps will start to melt! This mission will give you a chance to try out your Action Man Polar Bike, which is quick, powerful and armed with a stash of grenades.\n\nJetpack Jigsaw\n\nIt\u2019s time to check out another area of terrain in the Arctic, Action Man. This region, though, is too tough to go on foot. You will have to use your jetpack. However, there is a problem \u2013 the jetpack must be built. You will have to build it by selecting and placing pieces and parts so that they fit into the correct slots.\n \nScuba Survival\n\nHQ\u2019s Q-wave thermal detector has picked up Tempest\u2019s hideout. He is hiding in what appears to be an underground network of icy chambers. Your Sub-Aqua gear will come in handy for this mission. You will have to swim through the icy chambers by waiting for the water-level to be just right before you can unlock the pressure chambers and progress through to the next section.\n\n\nSupersonic Sub-traction\n\nWith Tempest dealt with there is now only one more setback to overcome. Who else but Doctor X? HQ has done some more good work and located his base \u2013 deep down in the Arctic waters! You will be using your submarine to find him but, as always, the wicked Doctor has a trick up his sleeve. He has a sonar-blocking device at his base, which renders your submarine\u2019s sonar detector useless.\n\n \nTerror Tunnel Trail\n\nFinally, you have Doctor X cornered in his base. He\u2019s not going down without a fight, though. He plans to use his latest flying machine to allow him to get away. It\u2019s well armoured and quick and to make matters worse he has number of his dangerous guards protecting him. To catch him you will have to use your missile-equipped jetpack.\n\n ActionManArcticAdventure \u00a0 \n\nWebsite: https://www.nostalgiarealm.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dtLv2Lxyizw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dtLv2Lxyizw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dtLv2Lxyizw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Action Man - Arctic Adventure (English UK) (PC) (2002)", "description": "Dr.X is once again trying to conquer the world.
