And what if you had to destroy it? This is precisely what this game is about.\n\nIn echo, the player has a clone, who mirrors your every move. Just like a mirror reflection. Your goal is to figure out how to destroy that clone. You solve puzzles by figuring out how to use the environment and items to correctly sync the player's and clone's movements. Only then can you destroy the clone. You have to be careful though. The wrong move can lead to you destroying yourself instead of the clone.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/echo--4", "videos": [{"id": 83653, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "FPa2kwSQyJs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPa2kwSQyJs", "title": "echo - Gameplay trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPa2kwSQyJs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
