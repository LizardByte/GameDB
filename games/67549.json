Like its predecessor, it is set in a theme park, this time with a broader range of parodies.\n\nGameplay-wise, it is very similar to the previous title. The player moves from screen to screen with key abbreviations representing the four directions, and interacts with the environment by typing combinations of verbs and nouns. The game is fairly simple and develops in a comparatively linear fashion, with only a few items needed to access the next area, and puzzles mostly involving talking to people or using the right item at the right place.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dezeni-world", "videos": [{"id": 141501, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "sh17uhpXgZs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh17uhpXgZs", "title": "Dezeni World (\u30c7\u30bc\u30cb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9) (longplay) for the NEC PC-88", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sh17uhpXgZs/sddefault.jpg"}]}
