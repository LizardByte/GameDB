The leaves obscure various junctions in the maze, so you are not sure if you\u2019re going to hit a dead end until you munch the leaf.\nEnemy bugs are hunting you as you navigate the levels, but there is a power up you can collect that works like the power pills in Pac-man and allows you to chase and eat the enemies for a short time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/botanic"}
