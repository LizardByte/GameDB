The catch is that different characters fall at different speeds: Toads bounce the highest, while Donkey Kong Jrs. bounce the lowest. Yoshi Eggs also appear and contain either a Bob-omb or a Moon (a Super Star in the first game); the eggs break open when they are caught or hit the ground. The player receives two points for catching an egg. If a Bob-omb reaches the carriage, everyone, including the Mario Bros., runs away as the carriage explodes, and the player gets a miss. If the Mario Bros. catch a Moon, the player receives five points. At 200, 500, and 700 points, Peach appears and blows a kiss, sending out a heart for Mario or Luigi to catch to remove a miss. Music is also featured in this version, with the tempo changing depending on the speed of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire"}
