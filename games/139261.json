If the term \u201comorashi\u201d is alien to you, then this probably isn\u2019t your type of game! It\u2019s usual turn based RPG action with adventures to be had, dungeons to be travelled through, and many puzzles to solve. All while drinking to recover HP and MP and having to deal with the bladder need of the characters who are animated with progressively more desperate squirming. If this need isn\u2019t handled, well\u2026 laundry can be done at any inn! Design is intended to not be frustrating: running is always successful, no missing, KO\u2019d party members still receive EXP, etc! \n \nA unique feature compared to other RPGs of this type is the ability for characters to learn to push themselves further with holding. After an accident or using the toilet when beyond their limit, the character\u2019s holding ability will permanently grow slightly!
