You just need a soft-modded Xbox so you can transfer the game files to your console over FTP. This does not appear to work on Xemu yet, but give the community time and not only will we have that figured out, but we will also figure out how to get Hurricane Pack 1 working 100%--because, truth be told, HP1 *already works,* but there is an odd glitch when you interact with Muramasa statues that crashes the game. As I said, we'll have these things figured out soon, but in the meantime, please enjoy some fresh, brand-new Hurricane Pack 2 content.\n\nINTERCEPT IS BACK AGAIN, BABY.\n\n\nJoin over 600 fellow NG fans at the GG Discord: https://discord.com/invite/ge3hFpT", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A5Ja-KlrgoI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A5Ja-KlrgoI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A5Ja-KlrgoI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A5Ja-KlrgoI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A5Ja-KlrgoI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hurricane Pack 2 is Back! | NINJA GAIDEN (2004) Prototype", "description": "Nearing the anniversary of what I consider my first Ninja Gaiden mod video, which also involved NINJA GAIDEN 2004 and the Hurricane Packs, comes an incredible development!
