One day, he asked the youngest to go on an errand by piloting the GwinBee aircraft. However, he never came back...\n\nThe doctor was starting to get worried, when suddenly a loud voice resounded throughout the laboratory and said: \"GwinBee is in my custody. My name is the Demon King Poko Poko\". Quickly, he ordered his remaining two great-grandchildren to board the TwinBee and WinBee fighting airships and bring him back. And so, both courageous pilots set off on a journey to rescue GwinBee.", "summary": "TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daima\u014d is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up video game produced by Konami released for the Famicom. It is the third and last game in the TwinBee series for the Famicom and it ditches Stinger's horizontal levels making it more in line with the first title.\n\nThe game is considerably easier than its predecessors due to an option mode that allows players to adjust the difficulty and number of ships, as well as the inclusion of the new \"soul reviving system\", which allows players to recover their power-ups after losing a ship.\n\nThe game uses digitized PCM voice samples, particularly when the conga music in one stage chants \"Poko Poko\", and in the beginning of each stage, in which a voice proclaims the name of the stage.\n\nIt was re-released on April 14, 2006 as part of the i-Revo downloadable game service.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twinbee-3-poko-poko-daimaou", "videos": [{"id": 105111, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eTO8y1N1zmQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTO8y1N1zmQ", "title": "\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc3 \u30dd\u30b3\u30dd\u30b3\u5927\u9b54\u738b (FC) \u3058\u3054\u304f\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u30af\u30ea\u30a2 (\u30ce\u30fc\u30df\u30b9 / 2184850\u70b9)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eTO8y1N1zmQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
