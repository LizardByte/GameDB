It is the seventh installment of the MAYhem series, and was led by James Caldwell (Obsidian) for the first time in the series, who took over from Michael Fraize (Marcaek).\nSeries founder TheMionicDonut proposed that as a reference to the Pok\u00e9mon series of video games, MAYhem 2018 would feature two megawads, run as separate projects at the same time. The orange edition features 22 levels, whilst the purple edition has 20. Each edition contains its own roster of custom monsters through the use of DeHackEd and custom palettes to bring out the colour themes better.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mayhem-2018-purple-edition"}
