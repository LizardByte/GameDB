This time the game is a little different from the previous ones.\n\nThe story is about that in the night before Christmas a terrorist group had hacked all the network in the city using a powerful video, and occupied the high school kipnapping all the students around there. Some of the female hostages are 3 girls that the player's character knows: Emi Sanokura, Kaho Shimizu & Yuka Okano (yes, they are the girls from the first No\u00ebl game).\n\nThe gameplay is about using your computer to destroy the terrorist virus and clear the network. To do that the player will use 3 antivirus that Yuka Okano created and to use them the player just have to choose hacking in a square of the network and select them in that square of the network that is infected and after that a bar will appear and pressing the button in the proper time will destroy the virus.\n\nOnce some parts of the network is clear a video phone event will happen and Yuka Okano or other of the girls will talk to your character and give you more information to advance in the game and clear all the network, here the gameplay is similar to the other No\u00ebl games, and in the right panel sometimes a ball of light appear and if the player is quick enough he can click on it and transfer it to the catapult part and when the ball of light shines there click again to ask the girl about that subject and gather more information.\n\nThe game features an album mode that will be unlocked playing the story mode. Probably this game is the best one in the series.\n\nFeatures:", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/noel-3-mission-on-the-line", "videos": [{"id": 143957, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "k16fXE4FqPM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k16fXE4FqPM", "title": "No\u00ebl 3  Mission on the line PS1 Game Opening Movie HQ", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k16fXE4FqPM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 143958, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "nn7mm1sZyS8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn7mm1sZyS8", "title": "NOeL 3 Mission on the Line Gameplay (PS1)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nn7mm1sZyS8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
