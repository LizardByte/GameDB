From this instant and for several centuries, a fierce competition took place between all the planets to obtain this rare resource.\n\nAs the energy depletion caused by the war worsened, leaders from all the planets scrambled to find a solution that would lead to a fair distribution of the mineral and put an end to the crisis.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the idea of the Metaball League was born. It was a sport modeled on early Earth's basketball, but where players have to ride a hoverboard. The game was an instant hit and became the most popular sport all over the solar system. People flocked to watch their favorite teams compete, each game more thrilling than the last.\n\nSince the birth of Metaball, all planets have risked everything to discover new players, train them in the Metaball Academy, and scout future star players. The brave Men and Women who pass their graduation enter the professional league and are called Riders.\n\nAs the popularity of the Metaball League grew, so did the competition between Riders. Each one fought tooth and nail to climb the ranks, vying for a coveted spot in the top leagues. The competition was fierce, and only the most skilled Riders could hope to make it to the top.\n\nBut the reward was worth the effort. The top-ranked Riders gain access to a special shop where they can buy rare and powerful equipment, giving them an edge over their opponents. It was a cutthroat world, and only the most determined and skilled could hope to make it to the top.\n\nAnd now, it's your turn to join the ranks of the elite. You are a rookie Rider who graduated from the Metaball Academy with top-notch grades. Take your place among the greatest Riders the world has ever seen and with grit and determination, climb the ladder to the top. The road ahead may be long and treacherous, but the rewards are beyond measure.\n\nAre you ready to hone your skills, claim riches and honor for yourself and your planet, and become the best Rider?", "summary": "Join the ultimate sports league on Hoverboard!
