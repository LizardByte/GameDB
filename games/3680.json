Someone has stolen the Music Keys and released the music they held. Without the Music Keys, the unstable power of the music is wreaking havoc on the land. Mario must recover them before the chaos destroys the entire Mushroom Kingdom! The path to the keys is simple: Left, Right, Up, Down, Right, Down ...Characters include Mario, Luigi, Toad, Waluigi, Wario, Bowser. Players clear levels by performing the correct steps. Once they clear all the levels in a particular world, they'll collect a Music Key. Collect all the Music Keys to win. Players control Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix by stepping on different arrows on the Action Pad (included with game). Players can finally experience the thrill of stomping Goombas and other enemies firsthand.
