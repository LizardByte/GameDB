Partie Burr, captain of the Angel Army Rabbit Group, was captured in a failed assassination attempt against President Doharas Happiness; while Arnie Rolento, revealed as another captain, escaped. Partie threatens that Archibald and her comrades from the Angel Army would arrive to save her, and finish the job; worried about this, and prodded on, Doharas hired Rance's party to destroy the Angel Army for 200,000 gold. Genri the monk, still searching for his brother, decides to follow them; along with Kisara Copri, who wants to thank Rance for helping her repay her debt to Pluepet.\n\nAfter sexually torturing Partie for information, Rance's party discovers that the Angel Army's main base is hidden below the idyllic Romance Park. With some rough investigation, they unearth a hidden path through a sandbox. Unbeknownst to them, Arnie is observing the group's every move; and has not only prepared the Angel Army for battle, but hired the four warriors known as the Marishiten Assassination Brigade to kill them. Another group is out to kill the adventurers, who she'd rather keep hidden: the Rare Gal Monsters Sailor, Blazer, and Jumper, seeking revenge for their rape in Rance IV. Aside from them, the homeless dog master Gotou considers Romance Park his territory, and will not stand for intruders trying to conquer it.\n\nAided by the mysterious Pink Mask, and with the restrained Partie still holding secrets, the team of four raid the base. They must discover the truth behind the Angel Army's attack on Happiness Pharmaceutical and the disappearance of the Holy Monster Gal Wenlina - all while Rance is set to deal revenge on Arnie for her treachery, get a moment alone with Kisara, and collect his much-needed reward money.", "summary": "Rance 4.1 and Rance 4.2 are two parts of the same storyline, and use the same mechanics and artstyle. Part of the game involves navigating the Happiness Pharmaceutical office and Romance Park, speaking with people, and investigating the surroundings through an adventure game menu.\n\nThe other part is a dungeon-crawler taking place in the Angel Army secret underground base. Within the base, there are specific rooms where the player can interact with the environment, use healing items, and load/save. The rooms are connected to each other by thin routes, where the only available actions are \"Advance\" and \"Retreat\", to take a step forwards or backward. (Most routes are about 3-5 steps long). These paths are the spots where random encounters can occur. When the game starts, the base is unmapped, and paths are marked on menus as \"???\". Each time the player crosses a path and enters a new room, Athena 2.0 will draw the room on the map (with a short dialogue among the party Rance about how to name and illustrate it; sometimes giving comical or non-indicative names). If Athena is not present, Rance will try to draw the map himself. The \"???\" option will change to reflect the room name. Some paths are hidden or trapped, and can only be crossed later in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rance-4-dot-2-angel-army"}
