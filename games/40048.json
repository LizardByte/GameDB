Each ship has a different firing pattern, and all three of them combined together when the ships are formed together as the Moon Diver; their mission is to quell an alien invasion which is spanning all of the Milky Way, and destroy the aliens' headquarters: the Danger-Seed.[citation needed]\n\nThe player starts the game with three separate fighters and has to make it through four tubes using the fighters separately; if one gets destroyed, then the next, more powerful ship makes an attempt to get through. If the player makes it to the fifth stage, the three ships combine into a singular composite ship called the \"Moon Diver\", which has a massive amount of firepower - and each ship has shields, but the stages must be completed with one ship", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dangerous-seed"}
