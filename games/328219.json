Among them, The Metamorphosis and The Judgment are the most representative, both closely related to Kafka\u2019s lifelong difficulties with his father. The Metamorphosis, in particular, resonates with people worldwide as it depicts the struggles of an eldest son who transforms into a vermin. In Kafka's Metamorphosis, the novella serves as the central motif, focusing on Kafka and Gregor Samsa\u2019s familial issues. The key difference is that Kafka's story emphasizes the conflict between his identity as a writer and his father's expectations.", "summary": "Kafka's Metamorphosis' is an emotional short-form story game based on the life of Czech writer Franz Kafka and his most famous novella, 'The Metamorphosis'. The game is set in the fall of 1912 when Kafka wrote The Metamorphosis. It captures Kafka's struggle to live as a writer while being pressured to fulfill roles as a young man, employee, and eldest son. The game aims to explore and express why Kafka wrote The Metamorphosis.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kafkas-metamorphosis"}
