This story begins 9 years after the original. Xander Gallo is now bitter, alone and out of control. He\u2019s causing problems for not only other families within the syndicate but also for younger Gallo members as well. Those who remained behind to continue the family legacy are soon forced to take sides with or against Xander Gallo, while others who have seemingly moved on with their lives are pulled back in against their will.\n\nThis is a tale of loyalty and deceit, murder and survival, as well as the strength or frailty of familial bonds. As a visual novel, Crime Opera II: The Floodgate Effect allows players the option of witnessing events in linear \u201ckinetic\u201d fashion or to affect how the narrative progresses by making key decisions along the way, all depicted with meticulously hand-drawn character portraits, a wide variety of scenes and scenarios to explore, original backgrounds and a soundtrack to fit the brooding and dangerous atmosphere.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crime-opera-ii-the-floodgate-effect"}
