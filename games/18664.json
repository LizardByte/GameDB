The game gives official groups, teams and the fidelity schedule of the championship. Gameplay occurs at a birds eye view.\nIt was ported by U.S. Gold for DOS, Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. The Spectrum version of the game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Manchester United. After the World Cup, the game was released as World Championship Soccer and later renamed to Sega Soccer on the Mega 6 compilation cartridge on the Mega Drive removing the Virgin Mastertronic credits. In Brazil was released with the name Super Futebol II.\nWorld Cup Italia 90 sees the player given the choice of participating as any of the teams that featured in the tournament itself, and no qualifying tournaments to reach the World Cup are available on this game.", "summary": "The game presents a top-down view of a simple version of soccer (there are no fouls, substitutions, or strategies).
