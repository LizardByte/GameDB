Its just for fun.\nPC Download: https://www.moddb.com/mods/whispering-hills-a-silent-hill-overhaul-for-fallout-4/\nXbox: Ingame\nThis release introduces the Lying Figures that will spit acid on you. They are scattered all around the commonwealth especially in Concord so be aware! \n\nAlso in this release i made some fundamental changes to Sirenhead. He is not anymore flying right at you when you attack him. Instead he will spawn creatures of hell that attack you including new cockroaches and others. He will still attack you as you have about 20 seconds time to retreat. So be carefull! The area where he lives is slightly radiated now too giving you a hint when you get too close to him. Despite that i made him less common now in the commonwealth.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my little Video as i had much fun creating it!\n\nCredits:\nVoiceover from the Man: https://www.kimckenzie.com/\n3DObjects: Mumbler and Lyingfigure made by: RayzerCalitri https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2278535", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVl6SnMsjDo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVl6SnMsjDo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVl6SnMsjDo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVl6SnMsjDo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JVl6SnMsjDo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Whispering Hills 2.5 Releasetrailer - Sirenhead and Lyingfigures in Fallout 4", "description": "Before you Spit out your coffee - This trailer is not a mod showcase but more like a Homage to Horror B-Movies and Silent Hill 1.
