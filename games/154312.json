(Syndicate for Terror and Illegal Non-Government, voted the world\u2019s #1 terrorist organization.) Did you ever want GI Joe with vampires? Well now you can have it, buddy!\n\nBATS is a throwback to the action sidescrollers of the 16-bit era, with a modern twist. It\u2019s a fast-paced, arcade brawler-shooter-slasher that rewards precision play and pixel-perfect timing. Play like a pro or take your time running around killing terrorists, slicing off heads and sucking up blood at your own pace. It\u2019s up to you! Either way, you\u2019re gonna have a bloody good time.\n\nThere are five hand-crafted levels of STING\u2019s fortress for the player to explore. Each level is filled with dangerous traps, deadly hazards, and an endless supply of Scorp soldiers to slice and dice into bloody bits.\n\nAs players progress through the levels they will collect blood droplets, which can be used to activate super deadly vampire powers, making the wholesale slaughter of disposable soldiers a breeze!\n\nBut watch out, there\u2019s still plenty of swinging saw blades, terrorist zombies, and electrocution chambers to navigate. And don\u2019t forget the STING sauna!", "summary": "A fast and frantic arcade extravaganza with tons of action and gallons of blood!
