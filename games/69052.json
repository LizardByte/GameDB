Unlike Big Rigs, it has proper collision detection, unintentionally removing one of the quirks that made the previous game famous.\n\nMidnight Race Club was originally intended to be a single package along with Big Rigs, but GameMill decided to split the two early in development. For this reason, both games share an identical UI and near-identical gameplay.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/midnight-race-club-supercharged--1"}
