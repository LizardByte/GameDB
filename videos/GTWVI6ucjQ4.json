It\u2019s made with Unity, my favorite game dev software, by one of my good friends, so I *am* biased!  But also, I genuinely think the game has unique mechanics, a witty sense of humor, cute robots made by my friend, and a really awesome soundtrack, produced by synthwave musician Protector 101.  I play a LOT of mobile games, but don\u2019t often find ones that really reel in my attention, but this one did.  I paid $1.99 for it & it\u2019s refreshing to enjoy a fun mobile game without any ads.\n\n\u2605 Featured in this video: \u201c9 to 5 Smash It\u201d in the Google Play store \u25ba\u25ba https://goo.gl/YPacAs \n\u25ba https://facebook.com/RasComGames\n\u25ba https://twitter.com/RasComVR (same dev also works in VR!)\n\u25ba Game Soundtrack https://protector101.bandcamp.com\n\u25ba Intro / outro music: Thanks to the musician & free Youtube audio library for use of \u201cDragonfly\u201d by Quincas Moreira\n\n\u2605 My Channels \ud83c\udfa5\n\u2554\u25ba Main Channel: http://youtube.com/JenniNexus \n\u2560\u25ba \u2702\ufe0f DIY Fashion Channel: http://youtube.com/DIYwithJenni\n\u255a\u25ba \ud83c\udfae Gaming Channel: http://youtube.com/c/JenniNexusPlaysGames\n\n\n\n \n\n.\n#Unity3d #mobilegame #madewithunity", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GTWVI6ucjQ4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GTWVI6ucjQ4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GTWVI6ucjQ4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GTWVI6ucjQ4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GTWVI6ucjQ4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd23 Funny Robot Mobile Game", "description": "Thanks for watching \u2665 http://JenniNexus.com ~~ Excited to share \u201c9 to 5 Smash It\u201d - the 1st mobile game produced by developer RasCom Games.
