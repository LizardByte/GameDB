Stories tell of a land of yore, now shrouded by centuries of time forgotten, called Ys. Despite its great knowledge, endless wealth, and bountiful prosperity, a sudden and unexpected cataclysm devastated the realm. Soon, its memory had faded completely from the minds of man. Centuries later, a young adventurer named Adol set sail to explore the world and leave his mark on history. During his travels, he learned of the tragic tale of Esteria, a once prosperous island now inexplicably engulfed by a crippling storm. Adol plotted a course for the besieged isle, curious to unravel the mystery... Available to North American audiences for the first time, this ultimate translation delivers the most substantial version of the famous Ys story ever made. Two games in one, Ys was released separately overseas, but North American gamers get them together. One of the longest-running, most beloved action RPGs of all-time, Ys has features exclusive to DS including 3D graphics, multiplayer, touch support, and more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legacy-of-ys-books-i-and-ii"}
