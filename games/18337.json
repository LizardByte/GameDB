The young Rykke Errel was the only one courageous enough to face the terrible creature. Instead of reducing him to dust as it could easily have done, the dragon bowed down before the young knight and swore loyalty to him.\n\nMonths passed by and Rykke met Helsephine, a young enchantress, and fell madly in love with her. When he introduced Helsephine to Bolgrot, Rykke would never have guessed what was about to happen. The dragon, mad with rage, killed the sweet Helsephine and flew away, destroying everything on its way.\n\nRykke chased the dragon into his cave. When he found it, the old friends confronted each other in a titanic fight. Using his weapons and magic, Rykke succeeded bringing Bolgrot down. But fatally injured, the young hero died short after.\n\nLooking for an explanation about the sudden violence of Bolgrot, the wise men of Amakna discovered within the entrails of the dragon six unusually colored eggs that were called DOFUS. Later on, it was discovered that when these eggs were reunited their power was absolute. Absolute, but also unstable. The wise men decided to conceal those terrible relics from the rest of the world.\n\nDuring the following centuries, the secret of the existence of the DOFUS was so well kept that people eventually forgot all about them. But a cursed day among others, the guardians of the secret discovered that the DOFUS had disappeared. The news quickly spread, arousing terror and covetousness. It didn't take long for adventurers to show up in Amakna, attracted by the prospect of glory or plunder. From then on, the destiny of Amakna was uncertain and the appearance of numerous creatures as terrifying as they're unknown added to the confusion.", "summary": "Dofus is a Flash-based tactical turn-oriented massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Ankama Games, a French computer game manufacturer.
