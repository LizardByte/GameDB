It reminds me of those early Apshai games but it seems to have an interesting outdoor exploration component  Lots of wilderness and little towns to find explore.  Deer roam the woods.   Still has a holder over from those early \"text\" games.  You have to type to pick things up.  A little rough around the edges sometimes but an interesting exploration game for its time.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CeYqYAkLGt4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CeYqYAkLGt4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CeYqYAkLGt4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Commodore 64 - Viking Raider (1984) Part 1", "description": "I remember seeing this game reviewed in \"Enter\" magazine when I was in elementary school.
