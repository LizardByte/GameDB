Interplay entered into a $100,000 contract with Activision to produce three graphic adventures. This was the first, and was followed by Borrowed Time, and Tass Times In Tone Town. All 3 games are fantastic.\n\nMindshadow was partly inspired by The Bourne Identity novel, with the player stranded on a remote island with no recollection of preceding events, nor who they are.\n\nYou must solve puzzles using verb/noun commands within the constraints of the game's parser. You'll stumble upon various names and objects, and must apply the \"think\" command to help recover your memory. The game can theoretically be completed in 5 commands, simply by thinking about the required 5 nouns, but that would be poor style!\n\nI've attempted to capture as much detail as possible from each location, rather than blitz through the game. This gives better context to the storyline and puzzles. Using a walkthrough, picking up objects before the location has described them makes no sense.\n\nThe graphics have a lovely style, ooze class, and enrich the storyline. I've always had a soft spot for text/graphic adventures, especially ones with rational puzzles like this game.\n\nI covered as many deaths as possible, and used the save/restore feature to resume the adventure prior to the untimely demise.\n\nCoder:  Bill Heineman\nGraphics:  Rebecca Heineman", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kwxlA6nsg0E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kwxlA6nsg0E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kwxlA6nsg0E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kwxlA6nsg0E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mindshadow (C64 Longplay)", "description": "Mindshadow is a graphic adventure that was released onto various 8-bit platforms in 1984, and the C64 in 1985.\n\nDeveloped by Interplay Productions and published by Activision.
