You become conscious in a world with a strange broadcast announcement that the city has a zombie infestation. 50 remaining humans are left to find food, water, and weapons to survive 3 days until the rescue helicopter can arrive.\n\nThe zombies are unpredictable and strong. This game requires stealth and strategy while balancing risk to explore and loot mintable skins you can keep if you claim one of the three seats the rescue team has to offer.\n\nThe remaining humans are only thinking of themselves.
