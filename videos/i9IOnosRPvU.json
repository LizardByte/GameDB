Their lives are threatened by dynamite and hungry little lizards called \"Smicks\", and Professor Hector's sleep-walking tendencies get him in trouble as well. Is there no rest for R.O.B.? As the Professor character moves through the levels, R.O.B. must aid navigation by raising and lowering red and blue gates. When a Gyro depresses the red pedestal, red gates are lowered. When a gyro depresses the blue pedestal, blue gates are lowered. The action on the screen never stops: so while operating R.O.B., the on-screen character continues to be vulnerable. This game can be played without the R.O.B. accessory by using the 2nd controller's A and B buttons to raise and lower the red and blue pipes.\n\nKnown on Famicom as: Robot Gyro \n\nNES Relatives: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0z79jq3sZ0\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est Jan 2007.
