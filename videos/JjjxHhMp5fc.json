{"id": "JjjxHhMp5fc", "snippet": {"title": "Goal to Go Arcade", "description": "Goal to Go plays much like Stern's other laserdisc game, Cliffhanger. After selecting a play on offense and seeing a diagram of the play, you are shown laserdisc footage of the play's execution. \nUsing a four-position joystick, a \"hands\" and a \"foot\" button, you must anticipate and mimic key actions of the quarterback and receiver or ball carrier. \n\nAfter you choose one of the on-screen pre-designed plays, you watch the play develop and have to interact using the joystick, the hands button, and the feet button at the proper moments of the play.\n\nFor example, if you've called a rollout pass, you must, on cue, pull the joystick down as the quarterback gets the snap and fades back, push the stick to the right as he rolls-out, push the \"hands\" button as he releases the pass, push the \"hands\" button again as the receiver reaches for the ball, and then push the joystick in the direction away from the defensive players involved in the pass coverage. \nIf at any time you miss a cue, the laserdisc immediately cuts to footage of a sack, deflected pass, tackle, or whatever. The \"foot\" button is used, as you might imagine, for kicking field goals. \n\nThere is no interactive defensive in Goal to Go.\n\nThe game continues for as long as you continue to make first downs; So you must make ten yards in four downs, or the game is over. A penalty, or turnover results in loss of yards.\n\nThe game support multiplayer, in the two player games, opponents take turns on offense.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjjxHhMp5fc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjjxHhMp5fc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjjxHhMp5fc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjjxHhMp5fc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JjjxHhMp5fc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Goal to Go Arcade", "description": "Goal to Go plays much like Stern's other laserdisc game, Cliffhanger.
