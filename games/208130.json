Players enter the game in the year 2022, using the smartphone app to overcome the laws of space and time and connect to the \"[Cocoon]\" terminal system in the distant future. But beware: the time-spanning connection overloads the system! Survival on the [Cocoon] is now in the hands of the player.\n\nPlayers will travel the galaxy taking control of the Leapers, a group of colorful, anthropomorphic creatures created out of cosmic rays who serve the Cocoon organization and their mission. The task of the players is to assemble a dynamic team, explore the new worlds and take part in challenging missions as the Leapers go into battle in auto-battler gameplay style. With a variety of unique leapers, players strengthen their own team and develop new strategies. They can expand their collection as additional Leapers are released.", "summary": "Go on randomly generated adventures and discover the secrets hidden in the depths of the universe.
