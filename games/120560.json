Everything will be against you: time, your very own furniture, a house that's different every time you play, and the fundamental question... what to take with you and who to leave behind?\n\nReaching the fallout shelter in time, alive, is only the beginning. Whatever you scavenged and whoever you saved will play a vital role in your survival. Each survival story will be different, with every day surprising you with unexpected events. Will all of these stories end well? It's up to you. Ration food and water, make best use of your supplies, face difficult choices and even venture into the wasteland.\n\nGood luck.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/60-seconds-reatomized", "videos": [{"id": 28901, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xqC3Bu94eU8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqC3Bu94eU8", "title": "60 Seconds!
