Well time to fulfill that dream by playing as compassionate but not afraid to say it straight faux-therapist/talk show host Terry Pebble. Interview the guests and decide if you should play the shoulder to cry on or give them a swift wake up call. Sometimes the truth hurts... and gets more viewers.\n\nToday's theme - The More You Have, The Worse It is\n\nThe Terry Pebble show is a short interactive narrative driven game. Don't come expecting fun gameplay, but maybe you'll be entertained for 10 minutes anyway!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
