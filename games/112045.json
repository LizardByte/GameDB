An enhanced port of the titular 1995 Sega CS game Stellar Assault, it was released exclusively in Japan in February 1998.\n\nLike its predecessor, Stellar Assault SS is a \"dogfight\" shooter set in outer space, featuring first- and third-person viewpoints. While the core gameplay remains much the same, Stellar Assault SS is more story-driven, with support characters and voice acting. Ships and environments are also texture-mapped, while some levels take place on planets.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stellar-assault-ss"}
