The player controls a fighter spacecraft, advancing through five large levels swarming with enemies (space ships, turrets, tanks, etc.), each culminating with a boss battle. The spacecraft is armed with primary and secondary weapons (fired simultaneously), as well as powerful bomb attacks. Each of these comes in three varieties distinguished by color: red, yellow, and purple. The red group of weapons focuses on spraying fire in different directions; the yellow group contains powerful weapons without covering much of the screen; the purple group is composed of homing lasers and missiles. Power-ups usually stay on screen for a while, changing their color properties.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flame-zapper-kotsujin", "videos": [{"id": 66123, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bNYcJIeU8lA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNYcJIeU8lA", "title": "PC-98 Longplay [002] Flame Zapper Kotsujin", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bNYcJIeU8lA/sddefault.jpg"}]}
