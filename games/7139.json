The cars on offer range from police car and VW Beetle to school bus and truck, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses - trying to win with the bus, which involves blocking everyone behind the hideously slow vehicle for 3 laps, is perhaps the ultimate challenge.\n\nInitially there are 5 tracks available, with practice and single race modes as well as full championship at 3 levels - winning each of the first 2 levels unlocks an extra track. They all have hazards running through them, and sections where you must make a split-second choice between the safer route and the risky but potentially rewarding one. Multiplayer can be done via network or by split-screen - in a break with convention the screen is split vertically rather than horizontally.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ignition", "videos": [{"id": 73244, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jRtMlkF2my4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRtMlkF2my4", "title": "Ignition gameplay (PC Game, 1997)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jRtMlkF2my4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
