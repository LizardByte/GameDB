The first one doesn't allow them to hurt other people. The second one calls the police if they're in trouble. These microchips are not mandatory and people get paid a basic salary for having one on or double the money for both.\nAlso, these chips are used for the economy, so if a person has a positive thought about the actions of another person the other person gets some money and vice versa.\n\nIn this world, there are also some creatures that affect the area around them in different ways. One of these creatures has stolen the voices of children from the first city, so the children have to use Sign Language to communicate.\n\nYour journey begins when Aeloras, a police student in the city of Visthansia, needs to defeat a memories manipulating creature to graduate. He finds and defeats the creature and passes out.\n\nHe wakes up in a village that is in an eternal 3-day cycle. On the first day villagers of the past appear in the village, on the second day villagers of the present and on the third day villagers of the future. These villagers can communicate through an object called The Board and exchange items through an object called The Box.\n\nHis saviour tells Aeloras that he's been infected by a disease where a person presents a mark somewhere on their body and another person somewhere in the world presents the exact same mark. The two people have to meet and go to the hospital to install a Reverse Module or they will die.\n\nAeloras can't find his Pair in Visthansia's database so he embarks on a journey to go to Gaia, the second city, where people can surgically change their likes/dislikes at will. So for example if someone don't like their job they can make themselves like it.\n\nAlong the way you will fight unique creatures, meet interesting people and be presented with conflicting and thought provoking concepts that aim to give you a fresh experience that will remain with you for long time.\n\nThe final goal of the game is to create an experience that will provide food for thought, something that's sorely missing from the gaming industry these days.\n\nThe game is dedicated to my lost nice named Ilaeira who died so unjustly and my family without whom I wouldn't have come nearly this far.", "summary": "An Action RPG about Utopia/Dystopia balance that aims to present some interesting concepts.
