I worked hard on them :)  \nDifferent cats :  \nchoose one from a bunch of different cats, each with it's own tastes, discover what cat likes what and what behavior each and every one of them follows!  \nOccasional updates :  \nThere might be updates to the game after it's release! adding new and different colored cats, adding new mini-games to the Arcades, or even new items to the shop!  \nAlthough you might not be able to transfer your old save to the new updated versions, but at least, try out a new cat!  \nRealism :  \nThis game is not Endless , meaning that if you don't take good care of your cat it will die. and sadly, even if you take very good care of it, when it gets too old it will also depart to the other side of the world. but hey~ that's not all this bad!  \nyou've given it everything it wanted. and now it's resting in peace! Besides, having no end would be really boring  \nSo that's it y'all for.. this time I guess?  \n  \nNOTE : This game is my first game ever. well.. at least technically. This the first game I truly ever program from start to finish, which allowed me to be more creative and free with the A.I. and how things interact with each other.  \nI'm taking courses online about programming and implementing what I can do my knowledge into this game. I want to get the most experience out of this game!  \nWhen it's released, it's going to be 100% free!  \nyour support, in any way, a comment or a critique or anything else. is deeply appreciated and would make my day.  \nThanks for taking the time to read this!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-cats-life"}
