Life seems so straight-forward, but something\u2019s missing\u2026\n\nMany years ago, Beth found an earring while metal detecting on a local farm. It brought her brief fame (and a modest sum of cash for a pre-teen), but\u2014most importantly\u2014it made her feel special. But she never found the earring\u2019s match.\n\nNow, the old farm is only a week away from being demolished so an energy company can turn it into a solar farm. Beth decides this is her last chance to rekindle that childhood sense of adventure. There\u2019s too much ground to cover by herself, so (despite warnings from her friends) she\u2019s hatched a plan to invite Adam back into her life. Beth\u2019s search for the long-lost earring will unearth much more than she's bargained for.", "summary": "The Magnificent Trufflepigs is a first-person, romantic, metal-detecting game.
