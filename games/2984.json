The game begins at the fall of the Han Dynasty shortly after the death of the Emperor Ling when the leader of the Way of Peace, Zhang Jiao, led an uprising against the Empire.\n\nThe game features a strong mix of fact and fiction from Chinese History and often exaggerates characters and their personalities, for example Lu Bu is portrayed as a virtually unbeatable, violent maniac. Most of the events and stages are reported to have occurred in the Three Kingdoms era during the struggle of power. The three kingdoms primarily involved, Shu, Wu and Wei, each sought power enough to overthrow the other two and unify China under their rule. Although the story in Dynasty Warriors is not perfect in the sense that it does not accurately follow the historical events, it has been changed to make the game more playable and less repetitive. For example, a number of the characters in the game died in the time frame that the game is set, but they still appear in later stages. The game features environments resembling that of Ancient China and various items from the era such as Fairy Wine and Dim Sums.\n\nIt also touches on Mysticism as some characters (Zhuge Liang, Sima Yi, Pang Tong) have either magical elements in their attacks or completely magical attacks.", "summary": "Dynasty Warriors 3 is the third installment of the Dynasty Warriors series in North America and the second within the Shin Sangoku Musou series in Japan. It is a spin-off from the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms and based around a series of books by the same name, written by Luo Guanzhong.\n\nThe game contains a number of fictional and non-fictional elements from the same era in Chinese history that Romance of the Three Kingdoms is set. However, it follows the main events of part of the story which is to unify China under the single rule of a kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dynasty-warriors-3", "videos": [{"id": 1533, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "SJwybak4eaY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJwybak4eaY", "title": "Dynasty Warriors 3 Xiahou Dun Yellow Turban Rebellion", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SJwybak4eaY/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 106586, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "rVVBuSjBlz0"}]}
