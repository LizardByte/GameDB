In order to save himself, Lupine must get hold of Sokai's treasure (it is said that there is a cure in the treasure that could heal from the dark blow), through a series of clues written in the Book, aka the Pink Crystals (accompanied by the Black Crystals in the second narrative strand of the game), which however are the prize up for the winner of the Miss Sokai competition. Fujiko signs up for the beauty contest, but a problem arises: it is the beautiful Ginrei, a girl so charming that she even arouses admiration of the impassive Goemon. As if this were not enough, the inspector Koichi Zenigata, bitter enemy of Lupine III, senses that the next target of the protagonist will be the Pink Crystals and then rushes to Ginrei to warn her about Lupine and to supervise her in order to keep her safe . The first encounter between Zenigata and Ginrei is not the best: she invites him to leave her alone because the young woman is convinced that she is out of any danger, while he considers her a vain girl and dad's daughter (not knowing that in reality the young it comes from the outskirts of Sokai, a very unreliable and above all very poor neighborhood).\n\nLupine, meanwhile, fearing that Ginrei could steal the title of winner from Fujiko, plans to sneak into the girl's hotel to secretly give her a dose of sleeping pill that will make her sleep for two days. But since Zenigata was there to guard the girl, the gentleman thief was tracked down twice (first in the restaurant where Zazz\u00e0 and the girl had dinner, then in the young girl's apartment after Lupine had managed to escape all the policemen who were patrol), but both times he quickly manages to escape. In the meantime, the relationship between Ginrei and Zenigata is notably changing: between the two an agreement begins to arise, Zaz\u00e0 no longer thinks that the young woman is only a presumptuous egoist, while the latter sees in the inspector a figure that protects her and who is always present next to her in times of need. In other words, the spark of love began to ignite.\n\nThe day of Miko's competition arrives: Fujiko and Ginrei parade on the catwalk with elegance and, above all, unparalleled seduction. But between the two it is Fujiko to tick it, undoubtedly more loose and sexy than the opponent, decidedly more shy and reserved. Armed then with pink crystals and the blessed Miko (Fujiko), Lupine and the woman hurry to reach the Government Palace of Sokai where the treasure is said to be hidden. The protagonist escapes all the traps and deadly traps hidden by the building; Meanwhile Zenigata tries to improvise a speech to herself to console Ginrei, when suddenly she feels that she is talking to Kourin, the architect of the Dark Strike who sentenced Lupine to only three days of life. Zazz\u00e0 discovers that Kourin is none other than Ginrei's brother, who wanted his sweet sister to win Miko's contest in order to obtain the Pink Crystals that will lead the terrible boy to Sokai's treasure. The inspector bursts into the room where Kourin and Ginrei are conversing, but the boss of the Celestial Dragon treacherously shoots the poor Zenigata, who fortunately manages to save himself thanks to the bulletproof vest he had worn to protect, if necessary, Ginrei. Kourin thus rushes to the Government Palace to prevent Lupine from taking possession of the treasure; the head of the celestial dragon reaches Fujiko and the protagonist, and informs the latter of the fact that the medicine capable of healing him from the Dark Strike is the so-called Fog Flower, a flower, in fact, capable of totally eliminating the effects of the terrible kill shot. To prevent the thief from continuing further, however, Kourin strikes Fujiko with the tremendous Dark Strike, unleashing the wrath of Lupine who, furious as ever, kills the boss of the Celestial Dragon gang through the blows of his infallible Walther P38 (in the second the final of the saga, instead is Zenigata to finish Kourin, to avenge the sufferings that the latter caused to his sister Ginrei).\n\nLupine thus manages to take over the flower of fog, making Fujiko drink the only purifying drop, which recovers and can barely see the smiling face of the thief, who falls apparently lifeless to the ground. Fortunately, the woman kisses the protagonist to thank him for saving her life,", "summary": "Lupin Sansei: Lupin ni wa Shi o, Zenigata ni wa Koi o is an Action game, developed by Nex Entertainment and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 2007.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lupin-sansei-lupin-ni-ha-shi-wo-zenigata-ni-ha-koi-wo", "videos": [{"id": 38324, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KWAr5Or1WT8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWAr5Or1WT8", "title": "Lupin III: Lupin la Morte, Zenigata l'Amore - Trailer (PlayStation 2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KWAr5Or1WT8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 129286, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8fvvju3-eDA"}, {"id": 129287, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OpmoLqwzwb8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpmoLqwzwb8", "title": "Lupin is dead, Zenigata is in love PS2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpmoLqwzwb8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
