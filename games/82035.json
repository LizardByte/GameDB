Legend has it that the Ancients were so powerful, they could shape the surface of the planet and control the currents of the oceans.\n\nThe Ancients who wielded this power created a world that existed between dimensions and yet was still close to where humans lived. The name of this world was... Verle a Zohll.\n\nLong after the Ancients lost control of the power and were annihilated, the planet continues to drift between dimensions...", "summary": "Legend says that there exists an ancient world known as Verle a Zohll, powered by the mysterious energy Verbias. The treasure hunter Connor Macguire and his assistant Rania venture into deep space in search of riches. Their ship is trapped in Verle a Zohll, and the two begin to explore the strange world, hoping to find the source of Verbias. On the way they will have to defeat robotic legions of a malevolent professor who pursues his own agenda.\n\nIn this top-down multidirectional shooter adventure, made by Glodia exclusively for the Sharp X68000, the player navigates Connor through maze-like environments, shooting at frequently respawning enemies in eight directions. A second character participates in battles on his side, controlled by computer AI; general tactics can be assigned to that character by the player through conversation. Each of the two characters can hold up to four weapons, using various types of energy ammo that can be found in treasure chests or dropped by enemies. Weapons can be switched at any time. There are no healing items, but both characters continuously regenerate their health. It is possible to save the game at any time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/die-bahnwelt", "videos": [{"id": 85028, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7C-rFwTDbh8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C-rFwTDbh8", "title": "[x68000] Die Bahnwelt - Longplay (part 1)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7C-rFwTDbh8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
