I have attempted a 100% run by showing all secret areas, levels and collecting all bones. This has no real impact on the game only producing a large score which is largely irrelevant without a highscore table. The game could be finished in about 20 minutes if you just rushed to the end.\n\nTwo secret levels exist (Underground and Moon Mines) but if you want 100% bones, you should collect them all first before going into the secret levels. In the case of Mine Moon, you need to lose a life to return to the checkpoint positioning you near the secret entrance. Each world also has a mini game requiring you to ring all the bells in order to claim a life at the end.\n\ntwo game bugs of note. In Loony Moon world, their are two extra bones you can collect for a 102 total. Do not collect the last 2 as the amount collected will roll over and it will be seen as 02 collected on the bonus screen failing the 100% collected in that world. Also in Zone 1 of K9, their is a block covering the route to 5 needed bones and after an hour or so messing about I can not find the trigger to move the obstruction. In the Amiga version, this is a destructible block allowing you to progress. This bug ultimately ruined this 100 perfect run attempt.\n\nA final shout out goes to the developers that take so much pride in their work that they forgot to add audio to the ingame and ending cutscenes.\n\n00:05:25 Bunny Hop Meadow\n00:10:36 Underground (Secret level)\n00:19:02 Dogsville (Password Mystic)\n00:27:55 Scrapyard (Password Ankles)\n00:36:42 Loony Moon (Password Ledzep)\n00:43:22 Moon Mines (Secret level)\n00:51:04 Planet Weird (Password  Reeves)\n01:03:49 Planet Foggia (Password Pixies)\n01:06:20 Planet K-9 (Password Woopie) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcAMtNMOAcA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcAMtNMOAcA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcAMtNMOAcA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zcAMtNMOAcA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega-CD Longplay [098] Wonderdog", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nAverage platform game for the SegaCD.
