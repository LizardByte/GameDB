It takes place in an alternate reality set in the 1950s with unique countries, cultures and characters. In this interactive world, the player is on a journey where they can express themselves politically, morally or pragmatically as the President of Sordland, as well as a father and husband.\n\nThe artistic aim and philosophy of the game is to put the player in the shoes of being a political leader at the personal level, delving extensively into power relationships, hard choices and real consequences. We strive to answer a few questions regarding the complexities of politics and raise even more questions about the driving force behind certain behaviours.\n\nIt has been a great challenge and experience to come this far and all of this has been possible thanks to the continuous passion of the diligent Torpor Games development team.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Torpor Games.
