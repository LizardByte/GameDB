Many of the same features from other baseball games are present and has three different game modes to choose from: exhibition, playoff, and home run derby, but what makes this version different from the others is a lack of MLB license, though it does feature a MLBPA license with top players of the time such as Roger Clemens, Otis Nixon, Bobby Larkin among many others."}
