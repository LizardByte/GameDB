As a fresh-faced recruit, you\u2019ll work under the guidance of Cecil Stedman, the GDA\u2019s unwavering director, helping to put out the dumpster fire that the planet has recently become. But don\u2019t forget, Cecil might be the one calling the shots, but it\u2019s you with the fate of the entire world in your hands. And we mean that literally - it\u2019s a mobile game.\n\nYou\u2019ll recruit and collect the best and worst characters from the world of Invincible: heroes, villains, and those in-between, each with their own particular skills and stats. Level them up, upgrade their gear, and customize your squad\u2019s formation and battle strategy to suit your needs.\n\nThis is an idle squad RPG: you choose and equip your team, set up your strategy, and deploy them into fast-paced idle battles. Watch them destroy the enemy (or get beaten to a bloody pulp, don\u2019t get over-confident already), or leave the game running and come back to scoop up your rewards later.\n \nAnd for the multi-taskers out there, there\u2019s a unique multi-battle system: your squad can fight loads of battles simultaneously, with no limit to the rewards you can accumulate. Check their progress at a glance and, if you\u2019re the micro-managing type, jump in to intervene whenever you want.\n\nFinally, Invincible: Guarding the Globe introduces a brand-new storyline which - without giving too much away, because where\u2019s the fun in that? \u2013 involves cloning tech, criminal masterminds, and\u2026 burger meat?\n\nInvincible: Guarding the Globe is available now on iOS and Android devices.
