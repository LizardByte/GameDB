It is not to be confused with Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure game, which is a spiritual successor developed by Kheops Studio released in 2006. It's an adventure game that puts most of the focus on exploring and puzzle-solving, with very little story interrupting the game. According to the developer, it was created in less than a year.\n\nThe premise is that you are a safecracker who is currently applying for a job as a security engineer at Crabb & Sons, a company whose primary purpose is creating safes.  As a test, the owner of the company has tasked you with breaking into his mansion and cracking all of the safes inside it. If successful, you get the job. This simple premise means that the core of Safecracker's gameplay is simply walking around the mansion solving puzzles to open safes.\n\nWhile many of the puzzles are basic and not very difficult to solve, it's still an interesting and fun game to play. The visual design is also very nice; the rooms of the Crabb mansion are well detailed. The music is also good, but has the unfortunate problem of being made up of very short loops. This makes some of the music extremely annoying to listen to for long periods, such as the music that plays in the Library.\n\nSafecracker is a fun game though, and it's especially surprising to find out it was made in under a year. I recommend checking this one out if you can get your hands on it for relatively cheap.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P10TZH3enmA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P10TZH3enmA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P10TZH3enmA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P10TZH3enmA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P10TZH3enmA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[PC] Safecracker (1997) - Full Playthrough", "description": "Safecracker\nPlatform: PC\nRecorded on VMware Workstation emulating Windows 98.\nAdventure game playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL6IvCPYLqOXm-E-peJ-sVjmt8EOXQ83x\n\nSafecracker is a first-person puzzle adventure game developed by Daydream Software published by Dreamcatcher Interactive in 1997.
