A Story-driven, single-player Strategy Card game of epic proportions, that merges the \"Roguelike\" & \"Deckbuilding\" genres in many new ways. Arcanium is a tale of fellowship and bravery and is set in a fantasy world of anthropomorphic animals in which good, evil, magic and technology collide.\n\nForm a party of three Heroes and embark on a dangerous journey in order to defeat Akhan the Calamity, and save the World of Arzu from destruction. But beware, should one of your party members succumb to corruption, your quest has come to its end!\n\nHere at SUPERCOMBO games, we are inspired by some of our favorite games like the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d LCG (Fantasy Flight), Dungeons and Dragons (Wizards of the Coast), Slay the Spire (Megacrit), Faster than Light (Subset Games), Hearthstone (Blizzard Ent.), and classic RPG games like Diablo (Blizzard Ent.) and Baldur's Gate (Bioware). We are also board games fanatics and relish in a good \u201cChoose your own adventure\u201d book. We wanted ARCANIUM to borrow some elements from all these amazing titles, genres and mediums. The result is a unique and genre-defining game that we hope will inspire you in return and scratch the nostalgia itch you may have for some of the games that we all played growing up.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oWc6Gdch0JU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oWc6Gdch0JU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oWc6Gdch0JU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oWc6Gdch0JU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oWc6Gdch0JU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ARCANIUM: Rise of Akhan - Steam Early Access Trailer #1", "description": "Official trailer for the game \"ARCANIUM: Rise of Akhan\", out on Steam Early Access on 12.08.20\n\n\"ARCANIUM: Rise of Akhan\" is an ambitious and unique title.
