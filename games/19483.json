The real Ptolemy IV fell under the sway of his evil advisor Sosibius, and brought the empire to ruin - but perhaps under your tutelage, things will turn out differently.\n\nOr disregard your responsibilities to focus on inventions instead! With the help of Archimedes and Euclid, you can discover the steam engine, the germ theory of disease, or even robotic automata, thousands of years ahead of schedule.\n\nWill you deplete the libraries of other cities to enrich your own? Achieve popularity for your scientific inventions, or protect the legacy of the empire? Will Ptolemy IV grow up hedonistic and selfish, or wise and just? Will you be ransomed by the pirate queen Nefertari, or can you win her over with your silver tongue?\n\nThe fate of the city of wonders is in your hands.", "summary": "Choice of Alexandria is an interactive novella.
