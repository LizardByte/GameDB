The commander wants you now to help him defeat Dr. Heinz and his evil plans in this arcade and platform-based game called Agent P: Rebel Spy. Your mission is to infiltrate the enemy\u2019s base and find their boss. Jump on the platforms and avoid all sorts of traps. You can use Agent Perry\u2019s abilities to steal weapons and shoot the enemy troopers. You will also need to rescue other agents trapped in stone slab to access locked doors. And if you want to raise your score, be sure to collect lots of rebel icons along the way.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe game centers with Perry the Platypus or Agent P from the Phineas and Ferb show. The game also revolves around Agent P being a Rebel Spy so you know what that means. The game takes the tone and follows the format of being a Star Wars game. Agent P must now enter the Death Star and save his fellow Repel Spies as well as destroying the Death Star in the process but the Dark Side won\u2019t just sit idly by as they would attempt to get rid of you.\n\nAesthetics:\n\nThe game uses art style similar to the Phineas and Ferb show. It is a cartoon so the graphics are cartoon displays and presentation. It has a very good and high quality look for a game of this type. The game looks vibrant and colorful plus the visuals are really nice. The terrain and layout also looks good despite having the tendency to repeat but of course it is a theme. The music is also good and it has that Star Wars battle theme to it even if it is an original composition.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game is a 2D side scroller and platformer as the players control Agent P being a Rebel Spy and he even looks like one. Players control him by making him move from left to right or vice versa as well as letting him jump and do a double jump. Agent P is also able to cling on to walls but will slowly drop. Wall jumping is also a crucial part of the game as you can progress through the levels by wall jumping. The main objective is to get to the end zone and battle the boss. Defeating the boss allows you to proceed to the next level and so on. Speaking of the levels there are also other objectives as well as enemies lurking around. In terms of one of the objectives, players need to save a number of rebel spies in each level. This is required as the spies are needed to open doors in the levels. If you don\u2019t save a spy then the door can\u2019t opened. The spies will also help you in the boss fight up ahead. There are also enemies lurking around as some of them can attack and hurt you. You will receive a number of hits before you die. You will have unlimited lives but when you die, you\u2019ll restart from a certain part in the level. You can also get weapons to help you fight the enemies. If you\u2019re lucky you get to hear the Wilhelm Scream when you kill one of the enemies. There are also terrain hazards like electric zappers that could also hurt you. Pitfalls could also kill you as well. The final objective although not required is to get those rebel tokens. The more tokens you get the more points you will receive. Then again points aren\u2019t really that important in the game to begin with but it\u2019s good as well.\n\n-----\nMobile games playlist: https://goo.gl/fVwWjJ\nSubscribe & watch new mobile games videos: https://goo.gl/zW3o5n\n-----", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ul17LkhEvJc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ul17LkhEvJc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ul17LkhEvJc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Agent P: Rebel Spy - Game Walkthrough (full)", "description": "The mysterious yet adventurous platypus is here to kick some butts in outer space.
