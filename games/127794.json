Conveniently, his cousin Takashi and Takashi's wife Ms. Silk live in the same area so Takuya has moved in with them while he is attending his classes. In exchange for free accommodation, Takuya started working as a part-time waiter at his cousin's cake shop.\n\nOne evening, while they were having dinner in the living room, a beautiful blond woman appeared before them out of nowhere. Soon, it was revealed that her name was Silk, the same name that Ms. Silk had, and that she was a trapped mage that was cursed to travel through alternate dimensions, never being able to return to her homeworld. Silk has informed Takuya and the couple that she needs a large amount of female elemental nature life energy to power up the spell that would return her to her own dimension, so she wants of Takuya to go out and seduce various women around him in order to gather the necessary sexual energy. To assist him in this task she has enchanted him with superhuman charism that will allow him to woo any women he desires.\n\nAnd so Takuya's ordinary life became ordinary no more.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/target-pheromone"}
