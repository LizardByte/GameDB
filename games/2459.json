In America, the game was released by Kyodai, and they changed the name to Psychic War and released the game for MS-DOS computers. The MS-DOS version censors Kayla's clothing. It changed the turn-based combat of its predecessor to a unique \"tug of war\" style real-time combat system, where battles are a clash of energy between the party and the enemy, with the player needing to push the energy towards the enemy to strike them, while being able to use a shield to block or a suction ability to absorb the opponent's power. The game also improves upon the conversation system of its predecessor and more closely resembles the one in Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei released around the same time.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
