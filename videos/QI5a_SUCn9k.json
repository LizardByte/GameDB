If you want to play the game you can download it through this link https://mittens0407.itch.io/shanye-easts-quest-to-burn-to-death-in-lava My friend made this game, and he is also a semi-youtuber like me, so you should check out his channel.

This game is currently only played by my friends and I, and we're trying to expand the community right now, so it would mean a lot if you checked out the game for yourselves. We are also currently creating a wiki and we are trying to set up a speedrun.com category for this game.
