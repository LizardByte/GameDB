Many maze levels were \"improved\" from the original (hardest levels became even harder), and there are also 4 extra (extremely hard) new levels at the end. Can you solve them all???\n\nDownload it now from here and have fun!\n\nNOTE: Play it on a ZX-Spectrum 128K model otherwise you will miss the AY music!\n\nNOTE2: This game uses multicolor graphics powered by NIRVANA+ Engine, so it will work on all original ZX-Spectrum models without the need for additional hardware. It should also work on any accurate emulator, including the ZX Vega.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snake-escape"}
