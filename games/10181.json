Players will also have to fight predators, can find treasures and get the possibility to take underwater photos to capture the beauty of the simulated, detailed and lively underwater worlds they\u2019re exploring also in a free mode. The game supports motion controllers. Spearfishing and Underwater Hunting are ancient fishing and hunting methods, used to catch fish and shellfish by using a mechanical harpoon. Today, spearfishing is a sports activity in many countries around the world, especially in the UK, around the Mediterranean Sea and in South America. Spearfishers hunt while diving apnoea, holding their breath, so have to coordinate their energy carefully while monitoring their prey, especially in tactically challenging hunting situations.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/depth-hunter"}
