Care for a flock of adorable little sheep in this excessively cute and charming sandbox game!\nThe fluffy and sweet balls of wool love it when you play and interact with them. Adorable as they may be, they\u00b4re not very smart. If there's a poisonous mushroom, they'll eat it. When the sun is shining, they'll just stand there until they have a heatstroke - and when the weather turns bad, they'll happily stand under thunderclouds and rain until they catch a cold or get struck by thunder and lightning. If you keep them healthy and entertained, they'll reward you with Happy Stars and make lots of little black and white baby sheep.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clouds-and-sheep"}
