{"id": "OSZDpyXIHWc", "snippet": {"title": "Famicom Golf: Japan Course [1987, FDS]", "description": "An updated version of the early 1984 Famicom Sports Series game simply called Golf, this version offered new courses, new modes of view, slightly better controls, and would go on to directly influence the development of NES Open Tournament Golf in 1991. \n\nUnlike the standard yellow disk used for all other official Nintendo FDS games prior, Famicom Golf: Japan Course came on a blue disk, complete with a sliding cover for the magnetic tape, designed to prevent corruption of data. \n\nThe disk was also made blue to clearly indicate to children that that Famicom Golf: Japan Course was a participating game in a high score contest Nintendo was running in mid 1987. Skilled players could use the in-game name entry feature to submit their name, address and telephone number to Nintendo via the then-nation wide Famicom Disk Fax kiosks across Japan. The winners of this contest received an exclusive golden version of Famicom Golf: Japan Course containing a harder version of the game. As one would expect, these gold Japan Course disks are now among the rarest, most valuable, and of course most expensive Famicom Disk System games ever produced. \n\nA few months after Famicom Golf: Japan Course, Nintendo followed the game up with Famicom Golf: US Course, and again ran a highscore contest. This time, the prize given out wasn't a gold copy of US Course, but an exclusive gold copy of a brand new game, called Punch-Out!!. This special gold prize version of the now-famous NES game was the first version of Punch-Out!! ever released, prior to even the commercial Famicom release. \n\nThe Gold Punch-Out!! differs so considerably from later versions, some consider it almost a prototype. Gold Punch-Out!! has different wording for each of the characters, different stage and opponent colors, and also different music. Most notably however, Gold Punch-Out!! does not feature the \u201cdream bout\u201d with Mike Tyson [or his pallet swapped alter ego, Mr. Dream]. Instead, the game ends after you defeat Super Macho Man.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSZDpyXIHWc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSZDpyXIHWc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSZDpyXIHWc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OSZDpyXIHWc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Famicom Golf: Japan Course [1987, FDS]", "description": "An updated version of the early 1984 Famicom Sports Series game simply called Golf, this version offered new courses, new modes of view, slightly better controls, and would go on to directly influence the development of NES Open Tournament Golf in 1991. \n\nUnlike the standard yellow disk used for all other official Nintendo FDS games prior, Famicom Golf: Japan Course came on a blue disk, complete with a sliding cover for the magnetic tape, designed to prevent corruption of data. \n\nThe disk was also made blue to clearly indicate to children that that Famicom Golf: Japan Course was a participating game in a high score contest Nintendo was running in mid 1987.
