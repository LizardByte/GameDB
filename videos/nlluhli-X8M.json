A miniaturized Pink runs about the house looking for themed items that mark the entrance to each of the available stages, and once he has finished the initial set, a mouse hole opens up in the mop board, giving him access to the final area where he'll finally face off against a phantom version of the inspector.\n\nPink can kill most enemies by jumping on their heads or by blasting them with his spray can, and he also gets access to an array of \"tricks,\" or special, limited-use items to deal with the bad guys, from stop lights (used to temporarily freeze everything) to weapons like attack dogs, bowling balls, and jackhammers (which will all travel in a straight line, wiping out whatever they come in contact with).\n\nHe also can pick up coins that can be dropped in boxes scattered across each level - some coins will build staircases or bridges, while others allow him to fly above hazards on a magic carpet, and some levels require you to use these coins to clear specific obstacles in order to move forward.\n\nThe game is short and fairly easy, but it does take some practice to come to grips with the controls. Pink's jump is a bit awkward to control, and running often leads to getting killed by enemies that you don't have time to react to, but the generally slow pace of the game helps to counteract those issues. \n\nI really liked the themed stages - they do a good job at providing variety, and the designs often reflect the theme - for example, when Pink is swimming through a pitcher of lemonade, he has to be careful to avoid getting sucked up by a giant straw as he runs over mounds of settled sugar and bounces off of floating bits of lemon.\n\nThe graphics and sound are of much higher quality than you might expect from such a game, too - the character animation is nicely done, and the use of color and the attention to small details in the background art go a long ways to evoke the feeling of the cartoon. The soundtrack is also absolutely outstanding. I don't recall ever hearing jazzy saxophones done so well on the SNES as I did while playing this, and the tunes all do a fun job of echoing motifs from the theme song without merely remixing the entire tune over and over again.\n\nPink Goes to Hollywood doesn't ever try to be more than a spirited, fun platformer based on a classic cartoon character, and it largely succeeds at being just that. It doesn't have any huge gimmicks up its sleeve, but it does a lot of personality, and I had a lot of fun with it. \n\nI guess that it would probably be way too corny to end by saying that I was tickled pink by it, wouldn't it? What, too late? Oops. Oh well.\n____________\r\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \r\n\r\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlluhli-X8M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlluhli-X8M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlluhli-X8M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlluhli-X8M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nlluhli-X8M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pink Goes to Hollywood  (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthough of TecMagic's 1993 license-based platformer for the Super Nintendo, Pink Goes to Hollywood.\n\nThe Pink Panther stars in his own SNES game in this action-platformer that pits the classic cartoon jungle cat against his longtime nemesis, Detective Clouseau, as he tackles stages, or \"sets,\" based on several classic MGM films. \n\nPink Goes to Hollywood is a non-linear, hop-and-bop action-platformer that opens with, \"Honey, I Shrunk the Pink,\" a hub-world from which you can tackle the first stages in any order you wish, much like can be done in Mega Man.
