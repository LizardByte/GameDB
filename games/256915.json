The story takes place not long after Doom 2, where Hell was defeated by the Doomguy. What no one knew was that there was a far greater and nigh inconceivable evil lurking beyond our realm: the Elder Gods. They saw how Hell had failed and felt it was now their time to succeed. They knew of the Doomguy's strength, and so decided to attack him in the one place he's vulnerable: in his nightmares. Thus, SoTNR takes place within the dreams of the Doomguy, each one manipulated by the Elder Gods.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward, with Doom-style exploration and combat. One difference is that your inventory is cleared and your health reset at the start of each map. After all, each one takes place in a separate dream :-P There are six total maps: three main levels, one secret level, one boss level, and a Quake-style start map.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadows-of-the-nightmare-realm"}
