In addition to the new Home Run Derby mode and Create-A-Team options, the game features the ability of pitchers to catch \"On Fire\" and impossible Special Pitches that zigzag, arc, and whizz by in ways that would leave any batter humiliated. New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame. The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game. And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators' booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mlb-slugfest-2004"}
