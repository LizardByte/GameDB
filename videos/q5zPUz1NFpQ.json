{"id": "q5zPUz1NFpQ", "snippet": {"title": "Jected - Rivals - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "First announced as Stuntfest: World Tour, Jected - Rivals is a free to play mix of extreme sports, vehicular destruction and break-neck speeds in a winner-takes-all elimination tournament between 18 players.\n\nJected - Rivals was developed by Pow Wow Entertainment, whose only other game they made was MisBits, which despite very positive user reviews, the game is no longer available to play or download. This is their first game under the ownership of THQ Nordic and although it was released on Steam Early Access, the reception on Steam is somewhat mixed, with the common complaint being that despite being literally new, as it launched on May 4th, 2023, the game is super dead. And that's because that nobody is actually playing this game, as it is an online-only game. And in the age where people only ever play FIFA, CoD and Fortnite on PC and consoles, and ONLY those games, it's easy to see why.\n\nBut is this game actually good? Does it deserve better? Or will it meet the same fate as MisBits? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments. And like I said, the game is still fairly new and it is free, so you might want to give it a try.\n\nJected - Rivals (C) THQ Nordic\nCurrently on Steam Early Access\nSteam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366850/Jected__Rivals/\nOnly available on PC via Steam.\n\n#steam #freetoplay #freegames #freesteamgames #free2play #f2p #steamfreetoplay #steamf2p #thqnordic #jectedrivals #jected #powwowentertainment #free2playgames #steamearlyaccess", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5zPUz1NFpQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5zPUz1NFpQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5zPUz1NFpQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5zPUz1NFpQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q5zPUz1NFpQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jected - Rivals - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "First announced as Stuntfest: World Tour, Jected - Rivals is a free to play mix of extreme sports, vehicular destruction and break-neck speeds in a winner-takes-all elimination tournament between 18 players.\n\nJected - Rivals was developed by Pow Wow Entertainment, whose only other game they made was MisBits, which despite very positive user reviews, the game is no longer available to play or download.
