One day, you receive a package with a virtual reality gadget that lets you experience a social networking service called Que. It just so happens that service is for girls only. As such, you create your female avatar and enter the world of an Ancient Leaf. While hiding your identity when talking to girls in virtual reality, many of your friends in real world have no idea about you, but at the same time you have an opportunity to find out more about them, things they wouldn't usually share with a guy.\n\nThe game is a typical visual novel which consists of reading through the text, which has full voice-over support for NPCs, lets you check the message log, and remove the text to see the clear background image with character sprites. Occasionally, choices are made to branch the story, and you can even select to go to different locations on the city map, both during daytime and nighttime.\n\nAccording to the project's original concept by Chiyomaru Shikura, the game explores the theme of \"Where is the boundary between the digitalized fictional world and the real world?\" It is considered to be connected to the science adventure series, including \"CHAOS;HEAD\" (2008) and \"STEINS;GATE\" (2009), which further developed this theme.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/que-ancient-leaf-no-yousei", "videos": [{"id": 18603, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "VtagM7RNpAg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtagM7RNpAg", "title": "[Direct-Play] Que ~Ancient Leaf no Yousei~ [PS2]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VtagM7RNpAg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
