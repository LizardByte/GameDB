Entertainment (makers of Powerpuff Girls GBC). The not-exactly-fresh backstory has alien spuds loitering in the streets of a quiet burg. You pilot a spud-cleaning vehicle that carries six spuds in two rows. Press A to flip the rows left and right and B to fire a row. If you shoot a spud at another of the same color, both will be eliminated, but if you don't, the spud you just fired will clog up the street until you eliminate it. If you crash into a spud, you'll lose one of your three lives.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
