Their research led to the development of teleportation, extreme advances in medicine and leaps in interstellar travel.\n\nIn 2080, the leader of the Cult known as 'The Protectors' spoke to then president of the UAC. There was an instant change from that day forward. The president suddenly announced a new project to open a gateway to the so-called 'spiritual realm'. Some employees of the UAC questioned this decision and left, however many remained. As time went on, less and less time and funding went towards egalitarian causes and more was funneled into the Spiritual Portal Project.\n\nRudy and his brother Jamal are ex-marines, doomsday preppers and conspiracy theorists. While the UAC and The Protectors have tried to keep quiet about their recent project, a few have infiltrated UAC bases and leaked information. The Protectors and the UAC had plans to finally open their 'spiritual portal' in the middle of the city. Jamal went to the site, armed to the teeth, but was brutally killed along with several hundred others when their attempt to open the portal failed, resulting in a massive explosion. Since then there have been reports of almost zombie-like people wandering the streets and attacking civilians, many of them dressed in hoods and capes worn by The Protectors.\n\nRudy is overcome with anger at the loss of his brother. Using his knowledge of UAC operations, he makes his way up into the hills to a secret base. He plans to take them down by force and kill anything they throw at him, avenge his brother and save the world from any more destruction caused by the UAC or The Protectors. Ultimately, he must find the heart of their operation and destroy it.", "summary": "Rowdy Rudy's Revenge: a 10 map partial conversion. 100% vanilla, heavy on the dehacked.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rowdy-rudys-revenge"}
