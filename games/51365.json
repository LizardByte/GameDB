But Michael soon becomes distracted by the mysteries offered up, as he follows a trail exploring and delving into the secrets of the past. As he is drawn deeper into the story, his sleep is shattered by mysterious noises, and he is plagued by nightmares that cross into reality.\n\nWhose shadows lurk in the dark corners? Is that lonely house inhabited by restless spirits of the past or something more sinister? What is that sound that chills to the very bone...scratching?\n\nJoin Michael in a suspenseful adventure, as you explore beautiful and chilling environments. Prowl dark corners and solve puzzles leading to the solution of a tale begun with obsession, and ending with madness and murder.\n\nThe Director\u2019s Cut includes an alternate ending that might be more shocking than the original.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scratches-directors-cut"}
