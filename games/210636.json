The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The \"Carnival Mode\" contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
