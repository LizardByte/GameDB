Merciless and wild death-hunters oppose them.\n\nA dying old man, the father of our hero, reveals to his son the secret of a mysterious installation standing in the deserved park. The legend says that it's a portal built up by an ancient civilization who disappeared a long time ago. The portal is able to transfer a man to another world located in a different dimension or on another planet. The old man gives him a medallion that is the key to the portal. Unfortunately the portal was stripped of its important parts by fellows ignorant of its true essence. Thus to make it possible to to activate the portal, one has to return all stolen crystals. But the old man himself proved to be too weak and cowardly to find out whether it's all true.\n\nSo our hero, having got to learn the mystery of both portal and medallion, dares to activate the weird device and leaves to seek for other worlds, more peaceful and prosperous.", "summary": "Russian Roulette II: The Next Worlds is a 3D shooter and sequel to Russian Roulette.\n\nIn the game you have to, again, unite six planets through the activation of galactic portals.
