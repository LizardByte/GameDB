Supports user content & the Oculus Rift!\n\n4089 takes many of the things you loved from 3079 & 3089, like character customization via stat points, grappling hooks, special powers, building options, futuristic settings, random enemies, weapons, and environments. Then, it presents itself in a much more focused game that gets you into the action easier and faster. 4089 takes more influence from the rogue like genre & has more emphasis on stealthy elements than ever before.\n\nYou'll be able to battle & sneak through a procedurally designed ship. Hack cameras & locked doors. Build walls for cover. Break down secret walls to discover new paths. Choose whether you are playing for the full adventure, or just a quick challenge. Edit or create your own rooms, enemies, weapons, textures, models & sounds, then share them with the world!\n\n4089: Ghost Within has 3 game modes, \"Normal\" mode (skill points are lost at death), \"Limited Lives\" mode (no skill points are lost, but you only have 4 lives) & \"Permadeath\" mode (you only have 1 life).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/4089-ghost-within", "videos": [{"id": 5658, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "w9HlkSTstHs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9HlkSTstHs", "title": "4089: Ghost Within Trailer (v1.1)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w9HlkSTstHs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
