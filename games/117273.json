It is a new IP inspired by many sci-fi and non sci-fi horror games and 3rd person shooters.\n\nIt is set in a universe in the midst of a cold war, in which A.I has been achieved via the use of organic processing cores, you play as a 49-year-old ex-combat medic called Samuel Edwards, aboard the long-range cargo and haulage ship the TRH Rusanov, after after a mysterious sickness spreads across the ship causing all the robots and personnel to mutate and deform into hideous creatures that are hell-bent on the destruction of all the organisms around them. You must escape, fighting your way through your former crewmates, rogue and sentient artificial constructs and the environmental hazards the Rusanov presents. As you progress throughout the game, your mental state will deteriorate and the hallucinations will set in.\n\nThe game features a limited ammo economy, dynamic level events - TBA-, a vast assortment of melee and projectile weaponry, drones and robots which can be fought or hacked, a non-invasive stealth system, zero-g movement, holographic world space UI - with an ECG heart rate monitor on the back which changes in speed and colour as your health deteriorates, a dynamic damage system - your character gets visually changed with blood stains, scars, open wounds, dismemberment etc, as your health decreases - and much much more to be revealed in the demo.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/negativeatmosphere", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 26314, "name": "Negative Atmosphere | F$%KING RUN - EGX DEMO TEASER", "video_id": "OOphIu1LbpI"}, {"id": 26315, "name": "Negative Atmosphere | Official EGX Teaser Trailer", "video_id": "vJKmVzT5cVE"}]}
