To cross it and reach your family, you must compete on - and win - a reality TV show broadcast by the Regime. Ministry of Broadcast is a narrative-driven single player cinematic platformer mixing Orwell\u2019s 1984 with modern reality TV.

To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on \u201cThe Wall Show\u201d, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side.
