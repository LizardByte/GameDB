Hanson and published by Mindscape in 1984\n\n\"Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom places you in INDY's boots. Test your intellect and logic as you enter a fiendish set of puzzles and traps in search of a fabled artefact. Warning: Don't expect it to be easy. No rules for play are given. You. DR Jones, must use your wits to success.\"\n\nA rather basic looking game but I guess that can be forgiven being developed in 1984. You play as indy and need to solve six puzzle rooms in order to complete the game. There are 3 difficulty levels with an individual ending picture rewarded for each. You can start from what ever room number you want but you do need to complete all six in one run to see the ending picture. There is no reward or ending for completing all 3 in one run.\n\nThe easy levels are fairly easy and a good starting point to learn what the puzzle room wants you to do without worrying to much about the enemies. On Medium, quicksand is introduced and you will fall through the level gradually requiring you to keep pushing up or swinging the stick to stay on top. Hard difficulty adds lots of fast moving enemies to the mix which soon become very annoying. Controlling Indy is a bigger challenge than the puzzle. It is far to easy to mistime a jump or fall through the floor leading to plenty of accidental deaths.\n\nFor its time, it wouldn't have been a bad game I guess. Its well presented but I don't think it holds up that well now and would just lead to frustration as it can feel very glitchy to play.\n\n00:00:00 Titles\n00:02:20 Easy Levels\n00:22:10 Medium Levels\n00:40:20 Hard Levels\n\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V1-wduzbDoI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V1-wduzbDoI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V1-wduzbDoI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V1-wduzbDoI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Commodore 64 Longplay [160] Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom (EU)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nIndiana Jones and the Lost Kingdom, developed by Michael J.
