It is actually rendered in real time in Godot, not FMV, and you can even slightly tilt the camera as the scene plays out.\n\nThis took so much more time to create than I thought it would that I'm actually surprised I got it done in time for the Mother Direct! I would like to thank Yuki Takahashi (aka karasudon) for her art direction help which took these scenes to the next level. You can see her portfolio in the links below.
