They begin as the player is seen riding in the back of a moving truck. The player character starts by moving to the Hoenn region from the Johto region with their mother, as their father Norman has been hired as the leader of the Petalburg City Gym. The player arrives with their parents at the family's new home in the village of Littleroot Town, on the southern edge of the main island. The player character begins their Pok\u00e9mon Trainer journey by saving Professor Birch, the leading professor in the Hoenn region, from a wild Poochyena, choosing either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to defend him. Following the defeat of the wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player receives the chosen Pok\u00e9mon as their starter. The player then travels around Hoenn to complete the Pok\u00e9dex and battle the eight Gym Leaders of the Hoenn Region.", "summary": "Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Pok\u00e9mon Alpha Sapphire are 2014 remakes of the 2002 Game Boy Advance role-playing video games Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire, also including features from Pok\u00e9mon Emerald.
