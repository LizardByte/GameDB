You will also end up on someone\u2019s plate. \n \nAs the saw starts... \nWhat happens when the body grows but the mind can\u2019t keep up? A child\u2019s fears and anxiety, but trapped inside a fully grown man\u2019s body. A furious body wielding a chainsaw? Someone who knows what happens as you disobey your family. What happens if anyone finds out what\u2019s in the stew.", "summary": "Leatherface is a Character DLC for Dead by Daylight. \n \nLeatherface is not only the skin clad maniac with a disturbed mind. He seeks acceptance and appreciation. He\u2019s learned the hard way and was molded to what he now is. A watchdog, a guardian, a blind gate keeper who never questions.
