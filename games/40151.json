Playing good hands now throws more cards at the opponent's field, disturbing their plans. As the deck is always limited, with remaining cards substracting from the score, matches are quick and intense. \n \nOnce again an \"adult\" game, Gun Dealer 94 lazily uses the same artwork as Sadari. New is the picture of an \"ugly\" woman displayed to mock the player each time the computer wins. In Japan, the game was known as Primella and published by NTC this time, like all of Dooyongs games after the first Gun Dealer.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gun-dealer-94"}
