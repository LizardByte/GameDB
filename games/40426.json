Developed by Techn\u014ds Japan Corp. and published by SNK, it was the last game the former company developed before they went out of business. The game was not officially released in Japan (only a Western version was produced, even though it was exhibited at the Japan Amusement Expo) but the game can be played with Japanese settings if the Neo Geo's motherboard is set to that region. No AES version of the game was released and MVS versions came in limited quantities.\n\nChoose from one out of seven characters from the Kunio-Kun series (each with two generic teamates) and compete agaisnt either the CPU or another player in a Dodgeball tournament.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-dodge-ball--2", "videos": [{"id": 125485, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "gFb8GaCoEyQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFb8GaCoEyQ", "title": "Super DodgeBall Arcade Completed", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gFb8GaCoEyQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
