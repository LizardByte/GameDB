And on the water, giant robots skate around and do battle.\n\nA prototype game developed in Unity in roughly a week and a bit for MechJam 2021. Inspired by Armoured Core! But also there's no sound because scoping is important and I failed at it. Mechs can be customized with a variety of weaponry, and then the player will go up against waves of warships, aerial gunships and enemy BattleFrames.\n\nAll game and art assets were developed by me (even though most are still rough block-outs). Game background music was produced by my talented younger brother.\n\nCheck out the game and other jam submissions below:\nhttps://impyrium.itch.io/liquid-metal-arena\nhttps://itch.io/jam/mechjam", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sk0v79p7TU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sk0v79p7TU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sk0v79p7TU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sk0v79p7TU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5sk0v79p7TU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Liquid Metal: Arena - MechJam 2021 Submission", "description": "In the dark future, there is a lot of water.
