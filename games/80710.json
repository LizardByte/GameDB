By far their most feared asset is the group known as \"Ich,\" consisting of their top researchers. Germa sends Ich to neighboring nation Liana to continue their research in secret.\n\nThis alarming move by Germa attracts the attention of Zizou Olympia. She descends upon Liana and defeats eight members of Ich, including an ill-tempered small girl, a military veteran, a familiar ditzy teen genius, a robot alchemist, a trendy \"big sis\" type, a drunken mad scientist, a strange philosopher, and a playful beastwoman. After defeating Ich, Zizou creates a plan for infiltrating Germa's castle; she enlists the help of an elite student, a moody fairy, an information broker, and the nation of Rasil's most fearsome warrior. With their help, Zizou arrives at Vilhelm Castle and encounters Empress Franzer the Fifth. Zizou defeats Franzer in combat, but a resilient Franzer taps into the power of Syega and becomes even stronger. Even with her newfound power, Franzer again loses to Zizou. Franzer reluctantly obeys when Zizou tells her to end her meddling, marking the end of Germa's aggression.", "summary": "The sequel to The Legend of Dark Witch for the Nintendo 3DS.
