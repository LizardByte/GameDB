In the first game in the series, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth\u2014nine supernatural edifices which are inextricably tied to the health of the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.\n\nBy the time of Soul Reaver, 1500 years later, Kain is a despotic emperor, his vampires dominate the land, and Nosgoth hinges on the brink of collapse. The Elder God, a demiurge-like entity, lurks beneath Nosgoth and controls the cycle of reincarnation; the vampires, whose biological immortality opposes his doctrine, are his enemies. In Soul Reaver, Raziel\u2014Kain's lieutenant\u2014is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past.\n\nIn Soul Reaver 2, it is established that, in Nosgoth, fatalism is an actuality\u2014history is immutable, and all individuals are subject to predestination. Raziel, due to his paradoxical destiny, is the only exception to this rule\u2014his presence enables temporal paradoxes to be triggered, altering history for better or worse. Kain relies on Raziel's free will in a bid to outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in Blood Omen, ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co-exist in the future. Soul Reaver 2 opens as Raziel emerges from the time slip and is greeted by Moebius, having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of Blood Omen. Two further time periods, 100 years after and 500 years before Blood Omen respectively, are also explored as the story progresses.", "summary": "Soul Reaver 2 picks up where Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver left off, with Raziel having just plunged through the Chronoplast time portal in his relentless pursuit of Kain. Over the course of his quest for revenge, Raziel must unearth the mysteries of Nosgoth\u2019s ancient races, expose the machinations behind the corruption of the Pillars, and the vampire genocide. Throughout the game, Raziel acquires numerous new abilities, weapon enhancements, and spells, all of which are critical to the completion of his epic adventure.\n\nSoul Reaver is a third-person combat adventure filled with devious puzzles and kick-ass combat. Fly, swim, jump, and even travel from the material world to the spectral realm to overcome obstacles and conquer your enemies. With over 40 abilities to choose from, no two fights will ever be the same.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-2", "videos": [{"id": 36562, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SbI27uyTAws", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbI27uyTAws", "title": "PC Longplay [886] Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SbI27uyTAws/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 131559, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EiO2CQSFhjs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiO2CQSFhjs", "title": "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2 (2001) - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EiO2CQSFhjs/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 5219, "name": "Raziel"}, {"id": 5220, "name": "Kain"}, {"id": 5222, "name": "Elder God"}, {"id": 5221, "name": "Moebius"}, {"id": 5223, "name": "Jaono Audron"}, {"id": 5224, "name": "Vorador"}, {"id": 5225, "name": "Ariel"}]}
