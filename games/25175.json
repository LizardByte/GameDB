By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel, children practice recognizing and matching letters, simple spelling and word formation.\n\nThere are several types of game:\n- Upper case matching;\n- Lower case matching;\n- Mixed case matching;\n- One little word;\n- What's missing?;\n- Spell the secret word.\n\nAt the start of each game, one of Muppet pets brings out a letter to match or word to spell and drops it on the seesaw. A letter appears on each ferris wheel bucket and as the Letter-Go-Round spins, child player should find the right letter to match or complete a word. Child may choose and try any letter, because there is no time limit to play. When a match is made or a word is completed, Muppet pets will dance and cheer a child player to the next round of play.\n\nThe game is recommended for 1 player aged 3 to 4.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
