In Age of Empires III, the campaign follows the fictional Black family in a series of three \"Acts\", which divide the story arc into three generations. All three acts are narrated by Amelia Black (Tasia Valenza). \n \nInstead of playing as one of the standard civilizations, the player controls special civilizations linked to the character or period that each Act portrays: the Knights of St. John for Act I, John Black's Mercenaries for Act II, and the United States for Act III. Most player units speak English, with the exception of unique units such as Spanish Rodeleros and Lancers or German Uhlans and War Wagons. \n \nAct I: Blood \nIn the late 16th century, Morgan Black\u2014a Scottish-born mid-level commander of the Knights of Saint John\u2014 defends their last stronghold on Malta from the forces of Sahin \"The Falcon\" of the Ottoman Empire (in a telling of the Great Siege of Malta). When the Turks flee, Morgan and his superior Alain Magnan discover a stone library telling of the Lake of the Moon; the Fountain of Youth, a rumored source of eternal life; and a secret society called the Circle of Ossus, who seek the Fountain for their own gain. Alain orders Morgan to sail to the New World to search for the Lake, but Morgan is attacked by the pirate Elisabet \"Lizzie\" Ramsey and lands in the Caribbean islands. After re-engaging and defeating Lizzie, Morgan's men find some navigation charts and sail to New Spain. In Yucatan, Morgan's forces destroy an Ottoman base. However, Spanish conquistador Francisco Juan Delgado de Leon captures Sahin. Morgan then defends his new Aztec allies from the Spanish and learns Delgado was looking for the map to the Lake of the Moon, disguised as a town square mosaic. Morgan sets sail for Florida, but his fleet is damaged by a hurricane and docks in Havana, Cuba, where he earns Lizzie's respect and promises her the gold from the Spanish treasure fleet if she takes him to Florida. \n \nIn Florida, while Alain claims the lake, Morgan and Lizzie capture Spanish treasure ships and Sahin, killing Delgado in the process. Sahin tells Morgan that he only wanted to keep the Circle from claiming the Fountain. Alain orders Morgan to execute Sahin, but Sahin and Lizzie convince Morgan that Alain actually leads the Circle of Ossus. At the Lake of the Moon, the group captures an enormous stationary cannon called a \"Fixed Gun\" from the Circle. Using the Fixed Gun, Lizzie's fire ships and Morgan's ground forces hold off the Circle's elite Boneguard soldiers, kill Alain, and destroy the Fountain. After the battle, Sahin returns to Turkey, and Lizzie, having lost her Spanish gold, leaves for the Caribbean, although it is hinted she and Morgan will reunite. Morgan silently wonders whether they really found the Fountain of Youth, then refills his empty canteen with water from the lake.", "summary": "Age of Empires III Gold Edition combines the exciting Age of Empires III and its respective expansion pack, Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs for one compelling gaming experience at a great value. \n \nAge of Empires III gives players the opportunity to pick up where Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings left off, placing them in the time period of roughly 1500-1850. As players work to establish their empire, they will take on the role of a European power struggling to explore, colonize and conquer North and South America. In addition, players will also have the chance to engage in epic warfare in the Americas with Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs, where they will lead proud, playable native civilizations to expand their empire and fight for control of the Americas.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/age-of-empires-iii-gold-edition", "videos": [{"id": 47712, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "SSempPDd3ck"}, {"id": 47713, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "IyUb5sCowMk"}, {"id": 47714, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "AHoTVC9gYjk"}, {"id": 47715, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JzhWITXSuKo"}]}
