This puzzle game follows match-three rules using a rotation mechanic similar to Octomania. Players control a cursor the size of four tiles, and can rotate the position of the four tiles within the cursor's radius. Connecting three or more tiles of the same kind makes them disappear. Customers will write their orders on the board, and players get bonuses for fulfilling customers' specific orders.\n\nThere are three main game modes: \"Kururin Mode\" has players fulfilling orders within a set time limit; \"Challenge Mode\", a score competition with an online learderboard in which players complete as many combos as possible in two minutes; and \"Tokorin Mode\", an endless mode in which players play without a time limit.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kururin-cafe"}
