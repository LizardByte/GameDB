This means you have to beat the level with more than half of the allotted time remaining. All of the items spawn randomly. They will be in a different place every time you play the game. The map and exit, however, stay the same. It takes a lot of luck to find the key quickly (especially on the bigger levels). And if you have the exits memorized, all you really need is the key. Of course the orbs will show you the exit, but if you have the map memorized, you don't necessarily need them. It's also good strategy to avoid enemies wherever possible, to avoid dying.\n\nThis game was a Japanese exclusive (it was never released outside of Japan).
