First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.\n\nThe second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.\n\nThe final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.", "summary": "An action game based on the movie of the same name.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beverly-hills-cop", "videos": [{"id": 120222, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6VSgp39DWuY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VSgp39DWuY", "title": "Beverly Hills Cop - Commodore 64 - longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6VSgp39DWuY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
