They were offered as a part of Happy Meals for a limited time in 2003. There are two buttons on the game. McDonald's later released a similar Tails Soccer which uses Tails instead of Knuckles.\n\nThe objective of the game is to make Knuckles intercept the ball which are kicked down the screen by Eggman. Knuckles must protect the goal which is directly behind him. The ball can move erratically on screen at times so it's best to keep a close eye on the ball. Catching the ball 10 times will increase the level and speed. There are a total of five levels. If the ball is missed five times in a single level the game will end.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
