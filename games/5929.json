For the first time in the series, the game was released only on the Xbox, with a Windows version rumoured for later release, but ultimately scrapped.[citation needed]\n\nThe game was developed by DICE (of Battlefield 1942 fame) and published by Microsoft Game Studios. This marked a change from the developer of the first two games, Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego). Coincidentally, Midtown Madness 3 was released in 2003 against Midnight Club II, created by the developer of the first two games, Rockstar San Diego.\n\nThe Xbox-only release and change of developer heralded a significant graphical improvement to maintain the console's graphical standards.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 11744, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "Vys-7jve7OE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vys-7jve7OE", "title": "Midtown Madness 3 Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vys-7jve7OE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 11745, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_p01VAVnlKM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p01VAVnlKM", "title": "Midtown Madness 3 Trailer E3 2003", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_p01VAVnlKM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
