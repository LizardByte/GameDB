The game is the sixth main instalment in the Ratchet & Clank series and the second instalment in its Future saga. The game continues from where Tools of Destruction left off, where Clank was taken by the Zoni, and follows Ratchet's quest to find him. Due to its length of approximately three to four hours of playtime, it was released at a lower price point than most standard retail games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ratchet-clank-future-quest-for-booty", "videos": [{"id": 53248, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "Wuql7jRIn6Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuql7jRIn6Y", "title": "Ratchet & Clank\u00ae Future: Quest for Booty Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wuql7jRIn6Y/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
