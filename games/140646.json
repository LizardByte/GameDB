Enjoy the game through the main quest line or just take your time and mind your own business. Form a player faction and get recruits, get bases and cars, craft items, trade with NPCs or other players by setting your own shop or just go solo and fight your way through the various dungeons. Want to be a thief, a sniper, a big-gunner, or scientist? No problem, it's all up to you. Tailor your character to your play style. FOnline 2 is offering deep PvP experience. Calculate your moves, use strategy and tactics, in order to be the last man standing during Turn-Base fights in random encounters all over the Wasteland, or take part in massive Real-Time battles between rival factions in order to take control over the towns and profit from the tributes.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fonline-2", "videos": [{"id": 42382, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Z1blZ73tDlI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1blZ73tDlI", "title": "Fallout Online: FOnline 2 - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z1blZ73tDlI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
