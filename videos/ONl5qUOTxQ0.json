Not sure how feasible this will be, but i'd like to support multiple fluid types. This will probably be a flag for a cell which affects viscousity. and a cell \"could\" simultaneously contain multiple volumes of liquid, just of different types. \nThe main liquid that I want to support is oil that will float on top of water.\n\n- Force dynamics (using pressure + velocity field).
