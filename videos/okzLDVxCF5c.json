No fancy editing, no added soundtrack, no unfunny commentary, just pure GalCiv. The Smedheadian Syndicate fortifies its borders, teams up with the Altarians and then finally crushes the naughty Korx. It's a timeless tale.\n\nIf you're not in the know, GalCiv is a series of sci-fi 4X turn-based strategy games dating back to '93 and given life by Brad Wardell. This 2003 installment is basically a remake of the original, and though I'd argue GalCiv 2: Dread Lords is superior in a number of ways, GalCiv 1 is still bags of fun.\n\nI got the idea for these videos when I noticed that there seemed to be absolutely no footage of GalCiv 1 here on YouTube, though plenty of GalCiv 2. I felt this wasn't doing an excellent game justice, and so ended up doing this.\n\nI should point out that I played the match on Beginner, mainly because I wanted to keep things going quickly but also partly because I'm a bit out of practice with GalCiv 1, having played the sequel much more in recent times. Forgive my noobishness.\n\nI had to play the game on my Vista PC because that's what the recording software likes, but GalCiv has a few minor incompatibility issues with Vista. If you spot anything odd, it could well be because Vista is historically awkward. Rest assured, the game works flawlessly on XP and is still perfectly playable on Vista. In a related note, I'm not sure why the footage ended up in a tiny square like this, but oh well.\n\nGalactic Civilizations is the property of Stardock, as is its soundtrack. I make no claims to have contributed to its production. This is simply a way of raising awareness of a quality product in the hope that other people will be inspired to buy it and support the creators.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okzLDVxCF5c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okzLDVxCF5c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okzLDVxCF5c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okzLDVxCF5c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okzLDVxCF5c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Galactic Civilizations 1 gameplay [1]", "description": "Let's plays - http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7799668BA3D8C79B\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Tryzon\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/TryzonPlays\nSteam group - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tryzonplays\nTumblr - http://tryzon.tumblr.com/\n\nI play through the entire first mission of Galactic Civilizations: Altarian Prophecy.
