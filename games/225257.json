In addition, this software also contains a horoscope-like game where you can input your birthday in for a fortune. Interestingly Bandai released a new design of the Design Master called the Paluseata (\u30d1\u30eb\u30b7\u30fc\u30bf) marketed towards girls along with this title. This package is unique in that it doesn\u2019t allow addon carts to be mounted to it, unlike other cartridges for the system."}
