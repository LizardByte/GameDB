This isn't as easy as it sounds, because this scrolling platform shooter has many sections in which the fairies are falling towards fiery pits, and you must catch them without hitting this pit.\n\nThe controls allow you to jump, and then jump again while falling, so you can, with effort, climb most of the way up the screen. The forces of the Black Queen are out to stop you, including spiders, bats and goblins, and even the clouds and stalactites on the ceilings launch deadly droplets of distilled doom. A bonus level is offered sporadically, allowing you to collect coins for extra lives - although you start with 9, you'll need them, as the levels are long and treacherous.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/deliverance-stormlord-ii", "videos": [{"id": 40614, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Er4FkDCv3ns"}]}
