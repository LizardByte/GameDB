The dying peddler gives Fenimore a golden skull and tells him the legend of a fabulous treasure that can be found by collecting two other golden skulls. To reach his goal, Fenimore Fillmore must battle the evil Friar Anselmo and the perfidious Colonel Leconte (who also seek the treasure), fight fierce Apaches (whose Chief's son's tepee boasts a sheepskin from Harvard), engage sleepy Mexican revolutionaries (whose leader is amnesic), outwit witty French soldiers (federated with Emperor Maximilian of M\u00e9xico), and suffer the insufferable alcohol-prohibition-ladies league. Solving the puzzles involves fabricating bootleg whiskey, blowing up a bank's safe, escaping from prison, rescuing a pianist from a well, locating and flying a balloon, and turning a devout monk into a gallant rebel general. The game elements emulate Spaghetti Westerns and caricature American Wild West themes", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3-skulls-of-the-toltecs", "videos": [{"id": 23852, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "8Kkiv5NTtRg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kkiv5NTtRg", "title": "3 Skulls of the Toltecs gameplay (PC Game, 1996)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Kkiv5NTtRg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
