In 2001, the game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance handheld system with new save features and minor graphical enhancements, with the English version being released in Europe for the first time.\n\nSet in a fantasy world, Breath of Fire follows the journey of a boy named Ryu, one of the last surviving members of an ancient race with the ability to transform into mighty dragons, as he searches the world for his sister. During his quest, Ryu meets other warriors who share his quest, and comes into conflict with the Dark Dragon Clan, a militaristic empire who seeks to take over the world by reviving a mad goddess. The game experienced mostly positive reception upon release, and was followed by a direct sequel, Breath of Fire II, in 1994.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/breath-of-fire", "videos": [{"id": 88667, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Yer5p6pk7ME", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yer5p6pk7ME", "title": "[Longplay] SNES - Breath of Fire (4K, 60FPS)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yer5p6pk7ME/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 282, "name": "Breath of Fire"}]}
