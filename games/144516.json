You accomplish this if you can successfully input a STOP sign when the fish are close enough on screen; if you're too early or too late, said fish will swim by as if the STOP sign wasn't even there. How rude!\n\nAs your training progresses, you'll learn about the 5 different types of fish that are known to disregard road safety in the city of [CLASSIFIED]. They are: Tuna, Salmon, Barracuda, Sailfish, and Swordfish. Each fish has a unique timing that changes dependent on the speed of the music.\n\nAt the end of each level, you'll be judged based on a score out of 30. Score a 15/30 or higher, and you can move on to the next level (unless it's the last one). Score anything lower, and you'll have to retry the level until you get a 15 or higher.\n\nAs of the current version, F.I.S.H. features a singleplayer campaign of 15 levels. There may be extra levels added in future updates.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fish--2", "videos": [{"id": 46764, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "qo34Vk8Zazc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo34Vk8Zazc", "title": "F.I.S.H.
