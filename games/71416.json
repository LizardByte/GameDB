Tiles are removed two at a time, matched tiles only, and, an eligible tile must have no other tile on top of it or touching it on at least one side... it must be open on either its left or right side.\n\nThere are two modes: solitary and tournament. In solitary mode there is no time limit. In tournament mode there is a pre-established time limit per game, but otherwise it is played the same as in solitary mode", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tiles-of-the-dragon"}
