Most of the songlist consists of new Konami originals from Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX and Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME CS (America), along with a few new licenses, some of the licenses from Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME CS (America), some old Konami original DDR songs, and two new KONAMI originals. Song list as a result has a large emphasis on Bemani crossovers than most Japanese CS DDR releases. Of the 55 Konami originals in DDR FESTIVAL, only 19 are original DDR songs/original remixes. Also, it is the only Japanese DDR without Dancemania licenses, hence no Dancemania advertisement is featured in the attract mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ddr-festival-dance-dance-revolution"}
