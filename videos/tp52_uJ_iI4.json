An OpenBoR playthrough I should have done long time ago. I am playing suhmai's (aka antyguf's) first OpenBoR hack. It's Streets of Rage Silent Hill (aka \"Silent Rage\"). This one is a crossover of Streets of Rage with Konami's famous horror adventure game series Silent Hill. There are (almost) all monsters from all Silent Hill saga including the Pyramid Heads. We have many playable characters: Axel as James, Lisa(aka Yasha) as Maria, Blaze as Angela, Adam as Travis, Bongo as Eddie (who is also the boss of the 4th stage), Lucia (from Final Fight 3) as Heather, Pyramid Head and Scarlet (who is a boss of the 6th stage). I did not use Scarlet, because she was too overpowered. This OpenBoR game is gory due to the death animations of the enemies and their appearance. I admire also his spritework. He drew them scary and gory and since it's a Silent Hill stuff, they are supposed to be like that. Of course I have never played Silent Hill series, but I heard a lot about it.\nThe first version of this OpenBoR game appeared a half year before the first version of Streets of Rage Russia, but it did not have any SH climate: a repetitive non Silent Hill music in 75% of all stages, there were the Left 4 Dead zombies and too little of gore. However by a one year it had changed a lot. Once someone made a full playthrough of the old Silent Rage and several of people, who were making the commentary videos on the new one made the short gameplay, so I decided to do a full playthrough myself.
