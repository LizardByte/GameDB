The player takes on the role of a pilot who starts his military career. He has to destroy Zeppelin, find and sink a submarine, defend his own base, destroy a bridge, attack an armed convoy, shoot down observation balloons or carry out spy missions in enemy territory.\n\nOur mission is disturbed by enemy planes, anti-aircraft defense, machine guns installed in airship galleries, but also weather conditions (limited visibility, dazzling sun or clouds in which we can hide from the enemy). The success of the mission is determined not only by skills, but also by armament. In addition to the mandatory machine guns, there are incendiary flares, bombs, etc. on the equipment of the available aircraft. In multiplayer mode we can face friends by piloting any chosen machine. The player also has individual missions, which can also be launched in training mode and surprise missions.\n\nThe authors of the game made sure that the historical truth is true. The combat environment and planes have been created using technical data and in cooperation with aviation specialists. Thanks to this, each aircraft has a unique set of features determining its character: ceiling, maximum horizontal speed, climbing speed, weaponry, volatile parameters (speed of reaction to rod movements, maneuverability, etc.), range (size of fuel tank), resistance to damage. The game was prepared with the use of modern 3D technology. Many special effects were applied, such as smoke of hit planes, explosions, flying balls, aircraft damage, sun reflections. Additionally, during the game you can switch between the cameras moving around the plane. The basic view, however, is the TPP - we see the plane from behind, and the camera slowly moves behind it.", "summary": "Aces Przestworzy is a Polish air simulator, bringing us back to the times of World War I to the north-east of France.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}]}
