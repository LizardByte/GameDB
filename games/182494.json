Players in Land Rush partner with DuskWorks co-founder Leon Dusk in a not-so-secret settlement just outside of the view of the Ad Astra Unlimited headquarters in Valles Marineris. Land Rush features similar elements of crafting and land development, but with a more simplified approach to realism and science, and a greater emphasis on creating a rich player-owned economy to support the game as it evolves. We see a future in which time spent playing games like Land Rush can not only be incredibly fun and engaging but also provide an economic opportunity for players who invest their time and resources skillfully.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/million-on-mars-land-rush"}
