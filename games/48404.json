Route-16 Turbo added multiple difficulty levels and improved graphics and music.\n\nIn Route-16 Turbo, players get behind the wheel of a car and drive around trying to collect valuable items lying around on the road while avoiding chase cars whose only purpose is to crash into the player's car.\n\nIn the game, the player's car drives around on a map that contains a bird's eye view of the 16 different routes (individual maze rooms) that can be entered. This overhead map screen shows which routes contain the items that have to be collected. Each item the player collects will increase their score. Collecting all the items in a level will allow the player to go on to the next round.\n\nWhen the player enters a specific route, the game switches its view to a single screen maze. These mazes contain dead-ends, zig-zags, multiple exits, enemy obstacles, with also the the threat of the chase cars entering and giving chase to the player's car.\n\nThe car itself has the ability to use turbo to get a burst of speed. This of course costs the player increased fuel usage (more than just normally driving around). Running out of all of vehicles fuel will cause the player to lose a life. Any remaining fuel left over after a round is completed helps to increase the player's score.\n\nThe game contains 3 difficulty levels (easy, normal, and difficult).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/route-16-turbo", "collections": [{"id": 8504, "name": "Route-16"}]}
