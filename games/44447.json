Thus begins Arc's quest to defeat the enemies and to rescue his beloved one from their clutches.", "summary": "Farland Story is the first in the row of successful Japanese strategy RPG games released in 1993.\n\nFarland Story consists entirely of battles (save cut scenes and the ability to shop if you are near a town after a battle). During battles, you move Arc and his party over the terrain, and attack when there are enemies in range. The party consists of different classes - knights attack with swords, archers specialize in long-ranged combat, priestesses heal, etc. Every attack leads to a counter-attack, from the enemy's side as well as from yours. You gain experience points for every attack, and can level up in the middle of a battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farland-story", "videos": [{"id": 67185, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bLrblv6FqsE"}]}
