You will find yourself immersed in a wide, varied and dark open world, exploring detailed locations with great visual and narrative depth, experiencing a culturally rich atmosphere that belongs to an irretrievable past.\n\nFIGHT AND SURVIVE\n\nMaster the fight and emerge a true warrior, engaging both in melee/ranged combat and spellcasting, an exciting and fluid system, suiting players\u2019 different attack styles. In crafting Mictlan's weapons, we aimed at balancing fun with historical accuracy, recreating ancient weapons and armour.\n\n- Slash and cut your enemies with the deadly Macuahuitl, a wooden club with shiny, sharp and cruel obsidian pieces embedded in its sides.\n- Keep enemies at distance using the Tepoztopilli, a long pole-arm weapon the height of a man, with its superior reach and thrusting ability.\n- Throw your spears from a great distance with deadly force and speed using the lethal Atlatl, easily piercing through any armor or enemy.\n- Increase your magic skills and conjure spells to summon spirits, defeat enemies and protect yourself.\n\nAN AUTHENTIC STORY\n\nMictlan is an indie game by a small studio with big aspirations. We take pride in two unique aspects of our game: it is the first semi-open world video game ever created by a Mexican-American studio, and it is the first video game completely based on Mesoamerican history and culture. With our game, we want to provide players with a challenging and engaging story, but also with the opportunity for celebrating indigenous cultures by reviving thousand-years-old tales.\n\nHISTORY MEETS FANTASY\n\nAt the core of our project is a varied and rich world where history meets fantasy. One of our main goals was to recreate with great accuracy the architecture and iconography of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, drawing evidence from textual descriptions and material remains, all wrapped up in a fantasy setting. Mictlan\u2019s stunning environments, architectural elements, objects and characters are designed using real-life references, locations and archeological sites, providing players with a truly immersive experience, while also enjoying classic fantasy elements. The game blends history and fantasy together as an epic retelling of the most pivotal and bloody moments in ancient Mesoamerican history.\n\nVALUING MESOAMERICAN CULTURES\n\nAt the heart of Mictlan, lies a great story and the revival of long-lost civilizations. Our ambition is to make a game which is not only engaging and fun, but which also allows the gamers to get to know Mexican and Mesoamerican history. 2021 marks the 500th anniversary of Mexico\u2019s independence. Valuing such a rich heritage, ancient culture, practices and myths, is one of our project's driving principles. That's why our game will be fully dubbed in \"Nahuatl\", the language spoken by the indigenous inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico, and in \u201cYucatec Mayan\u201d, the Mayan language spoken in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and northern Belize.", "summary": "Mictlan is an action-adventure third-person game set in the 15th century during the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
