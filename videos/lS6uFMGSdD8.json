As in Wolfenstein 3D, the player assumes the role of allied spy William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, on a mission trying to recapture the Spear of Destiny from the Nazis after it was stolen from Versailles.\n\nIn his desire to master occult powers, Adolf Hitler captures the legendary Spear of Destiny from Versailles, sending it off to Castle Nuremberg (or Castle Wolfenstein, conflicting information is given). In order to stop Hitler, B.J. Blazkowicz is sent to interfere, marking his first chronological mission in the original series (but probably not the first in his career). B.J. enters the castle only to encounter heavy resistance by Nazi personnel. He also encounters Dr. Schabbs's mutants for the first time - necessitating Schabbs's assassination in the future.\n\nB.J. defeats Trans Gr\u00f6sse, the first member of the heavy-armored Gr\u00f6sse family, then Barnacle Wilhelm, an officer responsible for protection of the Spear, the \u00dcbermutant, Dr. Schabbs' masterpiece, and the Death Knight, a heavy-armored castle commander and protector of the Spear. Upon capturing the Spear, however, B.J. is immediately sucked into Hell, where the Angel of Death awaits to challenge him to find out if he is worthy of wielding the Spear of Destiny.\n\nThe game consists of a single story-line episode, divided into 21 levels, 19 of which must be completed to win the game. The remaining two are secret levels that can be accessed from within the first 18. The gameplay is comparable to that of Wolfenstein 3D, which uses the same game engine. The levels are divided into four blocks (focusing respectively on the castle's tunnels, dungeons, main keep, and ramparts), each ending with the player having to defeat a \"boss\".\n\nUnlike Wolfenstein 3D, the game did not include a shareware version; however, a 2-level playable demo was distributed.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lS6uFMGSdD8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lS6uFMGSdD8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lS6uFMGSdD8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lS6uFMGSdD8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lS6uFMGSdD8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Spear of Destiny - Floor 1 (1992) [MS-DOS]", "description": "Spear of Destiny, often also called Spear, Wolfenstein 3D: Spear of Destiny or just SoD, is a 1992 first-person shooter computer game developed by id Software and published by FormGen Corporation, and is the prequel to id Software's Wolfenstein 3D.
