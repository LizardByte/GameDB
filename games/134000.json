There are currently two toys in this toybox: Chunky Orbits & Rock Tumbler. \n \nChunky Orbits is a friendly simulation of free-floating objects based on Real Life physics. Each object in the scene attracts each of the others in a cosmic tug-of-war. Tap out a few boulders and contemplate the wonders of the Universe. (^_^) \n \n- Create and destroy colorful boulders \n- Add trail effects to visualize the paths they take \n- Add an absorb effect to grow bigger boulders \n- Create a sun-like CenterStone and create your own solar system! \n- Zoom in for a close-up with the BoulderCam \n- Spacey, happy music-to-ponder-by included \n \nRock Tumbler is a simple bit of eye-candy. It's a sphere full of colorful rocks and gems. The rocks tumble towards the screen with a swipe of your finger. A pleasing display of gravity at play.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gravitas--1", "videos": [{"id": 36080, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qrKd2DIiH8E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrKd2DIiH8E", "title": "Gravitas Demo - a gravity toy", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qrKd2DIiH8E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
