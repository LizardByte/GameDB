Since the PSP's TV-out picture doesn't fill the screen, I scaled it up afterward. I do apologize for the graininess of the recording - it's as clean as I could get it.\n\nFinal Fantasy IV's PSP remake is an excellent update to my all time favorite role-playing game, having first played it on the SNES (as Final Fantasy II) after getting it for Christmas when I was 9. Oh, memories. This one has nothing censored in it, unlike many of the older versions. The graphics and sound also got a really nice overhaul - I far prefer this over the full 3D remake, even if that one was pretty fantastic anyway. It's my go-to choice if I don't feel like playing the original 16-bit game. \n\nIf you'd like to see my playthrough of the original SNES game upon which this PSP remake is based, you can find it here:\nhttps://youtu.be/pdEd3Z5TQYY\n\nThere are two sections where the video was edited. I didn't think anybody would enjoy watching hours of grinding, so you'll see the edits when I level Cecil up after he becomes a paladin, and once again near the save point just before the Elemental battle in the Giant of Babil. \n\nHope you enjoy it!\n_______\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haM3Bm42YXo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haM3Bm42YXo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haM3Bm42YXo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haM3Bm42YXo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/haM3Bm42YXo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Final Fantasy IV (PSP) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthough of Square-Enix's 2011 update of Final Fantasy IV from the PSP release, Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection.\n\nThis video was not done with an emulator: I recorded from a PSP Go using the component TV-out.
