As the new kid in charge of the store, you gotta understand the ground rules:\n\nRule One: The Customer Is Never Right - But You Are!\nThe customers of Repeater Records are an eccentric, indecisive bunch. Each and every one of them is after that ONE perfect record. It's up to you Wax Heads to read the vibes and pick out the perfect one from the pile!\n\nRule Two: Learn Your Divas From Your Beatniks!\nDid Scandinavian metal band Jarhead really murder their singer and put his head in a jar? Is it true Kerri Krow only sings when brushing her teeth? Has anyone actually ever seen Mimi? With over 50+ records and dozens of musical acts, there's a lot to learn and love as an aspiring Wax Head.\n\nRule Three: Don't Get Lost!\nRepeater Records has twists and turns, surprises and secrets, arcades and TV's, posters and zines - it's easy to get lost and distracted when looking for the right record. Just don\u2019t forget the clients, alright?", "summary": "A cosy-punk slice-of-life narrative sim about managing a struggling record store.
