One day, the seal is broken on a heavenly temple, and the \"seeds of ruin\" stored within are unleashed. The seeds lay waste to the gods before falling to the earth below. They contain the essences of monstrous ruinators that had been sealed away, and having stolen the gods power, if allowed to grow they will sow calamity throughout the surface world. The goddess Leonne, the last surviving deity in the Heavens, uses what remains of her power to slow their growth. She then sends her sprite retainer to the surface world to find the \"Great Savior\" and seal away the seeds once more.\n\nThe protagonist awakens to find himself bereft of memories and staring at a sprite named Lippy and a girl named Sara. Lippy refers to the boy as \"the Great Savior,\" and asks him to use the hero-summoning power of stonecantation to help purify their world. And thus, their adventure across a vast world begins. But none among the three friends can even imagine where their journey of purification will take them...", "summary": "Tales of Link was a mobile game with a puzzle combat system instead of a variation on the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS) the series is known for.
