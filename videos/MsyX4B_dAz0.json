The games are practically identical, save for the fact the disk version lacks any kind of music during the main game; I'm not sure I'm especially fond of the CD32 soundtrack, but it's preferable to the fairly limited sound effects on show here.\n\nIf I'm honest, the Amiga versions of the game just feel unfinished, lacking the levels and technical features of the Genesis version, as well as running at a much lower framerate. I'm pretty sure the A1200 could have pulled off a solid 50 Hz refresh, and the game was never released on Atari ST, so that can't be used as an excuse either. The art style and graphics are fantastic, which makes it all the more disappointing when you consider what Skeleton Krew could have been.\n\nCredits\nCoding: Jason Gosling\nGraphics: James Ryman, Heather Gibson\nMusic: Martin Iveson\n\nTime Codes\n00:00 - Intro (music by Martin Iveson)\n02:07 - Level 01: Monstrocity (music by Martin Iveson)\n08:20 - Level 02: Lift Shaft (music by Martin Iveson)\n15:07 - Level 03: Jungle (music by Martin Iveson)\n23:44 - Level 04: Mars (music by Martin Iveson)\n31:24 - Level 05: Venus (music by Martin Iveson)\n43:58 - Level 06: Kadaver (music by Martin Iveson)\n\n#skeletonkrew\n#amiga\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsyX4B_dAz0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsyX4B_dAz0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsyX4B_dAz0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsyX4B_dAz0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsyX4B_dAz0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Skeleton Krew Longplay (Amiga AGA) [4K]", "description": "Developed and published by Core Design in 1995\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to do a recording of the disk version of the game, just to see how it compared to the CD32, and it's actually pretty disappointing.
