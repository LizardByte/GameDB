{"id": "mPd6fRG53pU", "snippet": {"title": "'Aftermath' - Outreach Announcement Trailer", "description": "For more information about the game, please visit http://store.steampowered.com/app/501680\n\nSet in the 1980s near the fall of the Cold War, Outreach sends players into the unforgiving grips of Earth\u2019s orbit as a lone cosmonaut to investigate the disappearance of the crew of a covert Soviet military space station. They\u2019ll have to explore this crippled and seemingly abandoned installation, uncovering the secrets behind the lives and fates of those surrounding it along the way.\n\nOutreach challenges players to use their coordination and reflexes to explore a realistic zero-gravity world both inside and outside of the station. Surfaces can be pushed off of using the main character\u2019s hands and feet for propulsion, and handrails can be grabbed to keep from flying off into the unending depths of space.\n\nBlurring fact and fiction, Outreach\u2019s story draws inspiration from both the history and conspiracy theories of the Cold War and Space Race. Environments, technology and objects have been recreated with meticulous detail to their real-world designs. The game also features the voice talent of Adam Harrington, known for his role as Bigby Wolf in The Wolf Among Us, and Vine performer Matthew Post.\n\nOutreach is expected to launch in 2017 on Windows PC and Mac.
