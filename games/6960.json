Jack is equally lethal in close-quarters combat, offering players branching melee combos, counterattacks and disarms as they take the fight to the criminal element of Grant City. Jack will encounter a variety of ruthless gangs in the filthy slums and menacing alleys of Grant City, each with their own unique abilities and fighting style that will test his resolve to crush their murderous stranglehold.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-to-rights-retribution", "videos": [{"id": 10548, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pZXx4X6NFrw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZXx4X6NFrw", "title": "Dead to Rights: Retribution Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pZXx4X6NFrw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
