For example, level one you are after barrels of oil, level two is green money bags, level three is nuclear symbols (uranium, I suppose), etc. You must still bomb the ground to dig a hole to reach the treasures and the plane is still dropping giant clods of dirt to fill in the hole, and maybe bury you. When you gather a treasure, you must still land on your base to claim it. If you are destroyed before you return to base, you drop the treasure. You can only carry one treasure at a time. After you collect all the buried treasures, you move on to the next level.\n\nThe background has also been spruced up. There are mountains, a cloud and a sun.
