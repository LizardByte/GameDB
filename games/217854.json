From there, he challenges the world by offering a reward of 50.000 gold coins to whom can penetrate into the place and coming out alive to tell the carefully kept secret.\n\nFor centuries, many would-be heroes tried to uncover these secrets with no success, because the powerful spirits living inside the crypt ended the lives of those who try to defy them.
