From the Cathedral\u2019s blackened spires slithers a voice and a truth: the world is ending. The two-headed Basilisks demand an offering. This will delay the inevitable end of all things.\n\nThere is another voice. From the shit-reeking alleys where the rabble and gutterscums fester, a rumor: whoever appeases this demand will receive Arch-Priestess Josilfa Migol\u2019s blessing. She will cleanse heretic souls and grant them passage to the Shimmering Fields when the true time comes.\n\nThe ones desperate enough to embark on this quest are dubbed cursed walkers, and you are one of them. You know that your foul soul is rotting, and every night, you are tormented by visions of eternal damnation. You need a way out. One way or another.\n\nGather Your Party\nCursed walkers in M\u00d6RK BORG Heresy Supreme are no fantasy heroes. This miserable world is dying, and everyone is looking for salvation, wealth, or vengeance; you can try to cross your destiny with other walkers and form a party, but they will all join you for a reason. Keep everyone\u2019s agenda in mind during the exploration, and you might just get along. Wrong a companion, and they\u2019ll turn their back on you. Or put a dagger in yours. \u201cFriendly\u201d is such an alien world in the brutal, dying world of M\u00d6RK BORG. Remember that when someone offers their help!\nExplore the Dying World\nThe world outside Galgenbeck\u2019s walls is divided into regions, each one worse than the other. Locations and adventures are dynamically generated based on your progress and the quests you\u2019ll stumble into. Quests, adventures, bosses, and special items reset on every playthrough. Explore the dying world but don't get lost in it. You won't get out alive.\n\nGetting Better (or worse)\nM\u00d6RK BORG Heresy Supreme doesn\u2019t have XP or the like. Instead, you level up by performing certain actions during your adventures. When you level up, some of your characters\u2019 abilities will get better, but some will get WORSE. The more you level up, the higher the chances you may lose something in the process. Can\u2019t teach an old goblin new tricks! They\u2019ll kill you.\n\nMiseries\nThe world is breaking apart before the end, as it was written in the Calendar of Nechrubel. Miseries are cataclysmic events that will affect the entire world and the poor creatures dwelling in it. The more you play and the deeper you crawl into the filth, the more Miseries you get. They can trigger when you end an adventure and the closer you get to the Apocalypse the more likely this is.Rumors say that these Miseries can be delayed. The foolish claim that they can be prevented but nobody these are all unconfirmed heresies. And whatever the price is for such an unholy miracle, it's unpayable.\nOmens\nThis world is unforgiving, but Cursed Walkers have a secret trick: Omens that can be spent to deal max damage, reroll an ability check in a crucial situation, absorb the damage from a fatal blow, or guarantee a safe outcome from wielding the Power of a scroll. So remember, you can rely on the fickle fates of alternate worlds tangled with the eyes of eldritch watchers if you want\u2026 just don\u2019t tell the Inquisition.\n\nArcane Catastrophes\nSome classes can wield Powers from esoteric and ancient scrolls. In the dying world of M\u00d6RK BORG, conjuring such witchcraft is never guaranteed. Every scroll has a chance to trigger an arcane catastrophe, and nobody can foresee what kind of disaster it could bring. You may get dizzy and start puking\u2026 or explode. However, some arcane catastrophes might even be better than the intended effect. Use at your own risk.\nRPG Elements\nEvery character has four abilities \u2014 Strength, Agility, Presence, and Toughness \u2014 that determine your likelihood of survival. They affect mechanics and interactions with the world, enemies, and other characters. Some encounters, events, and choices require you to roll a d20 modified by the relevant ability. You should always put your life in the hands of a die roll. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called die roll.\n\nThe End is (always) Nigh\nOnce you have the relics demanded by the two-headed Basilisk, get your ugly sack of bones and blood to the Valley of the Unfortunate Undead and face the terrifying presence of Verhu, the truth speaker and the most worshiped of the Basilisk heads, and Gorgh, and his envious brother. Will you be able to appease them in time and cleanse your rotting soul by delaying the apocalypse? Will this torment ever end? Or will your repeated sufferings open your soul to the Heresy Supreme?", "summary": "The world's loudest tabletop RPG brings ruin to video gaming.\n\nTake control of the vilest scum ever to crawl upon the earth, and wander the dying lands of the original game through a graphic style inspired by the book.\nEvade deadly flails aimed to crack your skull open in a combat system both dynamic and unforgiving that\u2019ll require a strategic, ruthless approach.\nFace horrific quests testing your skills to the brink of the Apocalypse.\n\nLiterally.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mork-borg-heresy-supreme", "videos": [{"id": 127396, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "GwXgQ1buEZ4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwXgQ1buEZ4", "title": "M\u00d6RK BORG Heresy Supreme Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GwXgQ1buEZ4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
