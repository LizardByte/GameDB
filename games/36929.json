Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark\u2014by building your own kingdom! To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.\n\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo\u2019s award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don\u2019t need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love as well as a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\n\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won\u2019t be adventuring alone. \u201c\u201dKingmaker\u201d\u201d features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\n\nYour Kingdom\n\nWe chose to adapt the Kingmaker adventure path because it features a host of open-world mechanics, allowing players to experience the story at their own pace as they explore the Stolen Lands, which will challenge you as both an adventurer and a ruler. Most importantly, the game allows you to claim these lands as your own, letting you carve your own kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins \u2014 and while dealing with politics in your own court.\n\nAs you\u2019ll discover, building a kingdom goes beyond simply building a stronghold: Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.\n\nExplore \u2013 Conquer \u2013 Rule", "summary": "Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the first isometric party-based computer RPG set in the Pathfinder fantasy universe.
