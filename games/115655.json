Every round has 5 difficulties; starting with \u201cbaby\u201d difficulty all the way to \u201cnightmare\u201d. The amount of points earned for each successful guess depends on the selected activity \u2013 describing, drawing, or pantomime.\n\nFor example, describing is the easiest one, so for each successful guess you will get only one point. However, in the case of pantomime you get three points per word. Each round, you can pick which activity to do. You can decide to play it safe and choose to describe all the time, though if your opponents ace the harder activities, they will most likely beat you.\n\nYou can keep up with your current standing by checking team scores depicted as cute progress bars with each team\u2019s color at the bottom of the screen. They show which team is closer to earning fifty points and winning the game. To see who is the reigning Partivity champion among your friends, you can check out the previous games section for the history of all played games along with each game\u2019s winner. If you are up to the task of snatching their champion title, just tap the rematch button and the game is on.\n\nFeatures\nPlay in two to six teams with as many people as you like.\nPause the game just by closing the app and continue whenever you feel like it.\nRecreate teams from previous games to beat the last winner. Increasing difficulty with each successful guess.\nTeam scores visible at a glance with cute progress bars.\n6 supported languages: English, Spanish, Chinese (simplified), Japanese, Czech and Slovak.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/partivity"}
