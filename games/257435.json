You can control Jake's movements with the arrow keys on your keyboard, or with the J-I-K-L keys.\n\nAs you find the colored keys, use them to free the gorillas from their matching-colored cages. Once you've released a gorilla, you can use its morph (by hitting the space bar) to help Jake chase off the controllers...but remember, you can only stay in the gorilla morph a limited time.\n\nIf you encounter any animals along the way, be sure to stop and collect them for extra points.\n\nYou have three chances to help Jake collect all the keys and release all the animals, which then allows Jake entry to the Yeerk Pool area, where you must help him find the Kandrona ray machine that feeds the Yeerks and destroy it. Warning: don't forget to stay away from any roaming Yeerk slugs and use Jake's gorilla morph (by hitting the space bar) to cross the Yeerk Pool.\n\nAt the end of the game, your points will be tallied, and you can proceed to the next level. Your game ends when you either run out of time or after you've exhausted all three Jakes. Play again to beat your score!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yeerk-pool"}
