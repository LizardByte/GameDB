Only one cartridge is known to exist. \n \nThe game seems to be unfinished, because it still has over 1K of free space left that could have been used for a valid 'word pool'. \n \nThis game was most probably originally made by Home Vision, because a Home Vision logo has been found inside this ROM."}
