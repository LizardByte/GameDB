Avin is seen bringing milk for the kitten Eimelle snuck into the chapel. They both watch it drink to its heart's content. Before long, Oracle Ollesia appears. The children panic at being caught with the smuggled kitten, but Ollesia doesn't seem too concerned with that, yelling at them to take cover. Cathedral is under attack.", "summary": "The fourth game in the Legend of Heroes series and the second in the Gagharv Trilogy.\nThe PSP remake was renamed to simply \"The Legend of Heroes: A Tear of Vermillion\" and was the first entry in the storied franchise to be localized into English.
