{"id": "zwiaxWYGhhY", "snippet": {"title": "Spikeout: Digital Battle Online Arcade", "description": "Spikeout is a fully-3D beat 'em up which takes place in huge and sprawling stages \u2013 split into sections called Areas, further divided into little segments. Progressing through these \"segments\" are quite simple; beat up every enemy that appears within one of them. Once enough enemies have been defeated, the player then has to quickly \"Break the Gate\": Locate a flashing barrier/barricade of some sort (i.e. a door) \u2013 in the later Final Edition, with the additional help of a red directional arrow (ala Crazy Taxi) \u2013 to punch through to progress to the next segment/Area, within 30 seconds (in which doing so quickly enough will give you bonus points). Due to the semi-open nature of the levels, and the inclusion of multiple Gates in certain stages, it very much acts as a \"choose-your-path\" system.\n\nEach Area usually ends in a face-off with the \"Bosses\" \u2013 signified by the brief, flashing \"Here Comes the Boss\" overlay \u2013 whom, for the most part, act as mini-bosses. You may face up to three of these bosses at the same time; along with the current enemies in the Area. (Note that once one or many boss(es) appear, you will only need to defeat them in order to clear a segment, and not any remaining enemies.) After successfully clearing an Area, the score results will appear, giving you extra bonus points (and health) for the amount of enemies you've defeated in the Area, and how fast you cleared the last 30-second \"Break the Gate\" in the Area.\n\nDowned enemies can sometimes drop items such as \"Life Up\" health kits (which replenish your health) and \"Special Attack\" items which allow you to perform a \"Special Attack\"; the latter being represented as floating thunderbolt symbols. Many commonplace objects found within each stage can be picked-up and used as weapons \u2013 from baseball bats and swords, to chairs and car tires, to name a few. There's a constant time limit which can be replenished by downing a certain number enemies at a time within each stage \u2013 once the timer reaches zero, you get an instant game over. The KO counter on the bottom-left corner shows how many enemies you've defeated within each Area. Start changes the view of the mini-map on the bottom-right corner.\n\nIn addition, Spikeout is also a co-operative multiplayer game; up to four players can join a game, and can do so at anytime. One distinction against other 3D beat 'em up games is that any player in a co-op session can go anywhere within the boundaries of an Area's segment, thereby making it possible for players to stick close to one another and fight together, or to split up and take care of a multitude of foes elsewhere. Friendly fire can also be performed among players if so chosen, and there are also a variety of taunts and commands one can use as means of limited communication with other players.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\r\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InsertCoinArcad", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zwiaxWYGhhY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zwiaxWYGhhY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zwiaxWYGhhY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Spikeout: Digital Battle Online Arcade", "description": "Spikeout is a fully-3D beat 'em up which takes place in huge and sprawling stages \u2013 split into sections called Areas, further divided into little segments.
