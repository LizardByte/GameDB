The plot follows that of the 1939 movie.\n\nMany of the graphics are ripped from numerous other games. The title screen bears a strong resemblance to Castle of Dragon's intro. Barza from Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger is used in the cutscenes, the \"To Green Castle\" signs are taken from Mickey Mousecapade, the \"Good luck!\" message in the opening story being taken from Crossfire, the windows in the first level are likely re-edits of those from Hummer Team's Aladdin pirate, and Willy from Rockin' Kats shows up several times in the ending sequence.\n\nAs well as this, the mushroom enemy is taken from Don Doko Don 2 and the small one-eyed green blobs that the frog spits at you are the aliens from one of the bosses in Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers for NES, while one more enemy is from Little Samson. A few enemies are taken from Panic Restaurant, such as the jumping sausage (re-colored to green). The last boss is copied from Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2 being re-drawn in other colors and with new attacks.\n\nThe music is original, but the sound engine is stolen from Konami. Many of the sound effects also come from Konami games, most notably the death sound being the same as the one in Contra.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lu-ye-xian-zong"}
