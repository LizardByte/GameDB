The Light family has set sail on a luxury cruise ship, the SS Elroy! Unfortunately, it seems an up-and-coming group of ne'er-do-wells has set their sights on the same cruise. Before long, it's up to Mega Man to blast through the cruise's Simulation Fair in an effort to gather enough Energy Elements to save the day!\n\nMake a Good 48 Hour Mega Man Level (MaG48HMML, or just 48H) was held to test and refine the Megamix Engine in preparation for MaGMML3. Participants had 48 hours to create a level using randomly selected enemies and gimmicks from across the entire Classic Mega Man series. Levels were evaluated and ranked by a panel of 4 judges, and an elaborate game was built around the results. Unlike the main MaGMMLs, participants were not allowed to program custom objects for their levels - but that doesn't mean this game isn't just as wacky and innovative as previous ones.\n\n48H is a spiritual successor to Make a Good 24 Hour Mega Man Level that takes place between MaGMML2 and MaGMML3, but no previous MaGMML knowledge is necessary to enjoy the story.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/make-a-good-48-hour-mega-man-level"}
