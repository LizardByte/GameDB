There are different playing modes including \"head-to-head\", in which each player earns points by driving a full screen ahead of the opponent. TV presenter Violet Berlin features as a playable driver. The MS-DOS version featured a track editor.\nA selling point for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version was the J-Cart, a cartridge including two control ports, thus eliminating the need for a 4-player adaptor. It also included a 'pad-sharing' feature which allowed 2 players to share a single joypad; thus it enabled 8 players to compete simultaneously, on certain tracks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament", "videos": [{"id": 3449, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "omgZpeALT3U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omgZpeALT3U", "title": "[Full GamePlay] Micro Machines 2 - Turbo Tournament (Challenge Mode) [Sega Megadrive/Genesis]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/omgZpeALT3U/sddefault.jpg"}]}
