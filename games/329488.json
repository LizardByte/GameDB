It's not the scariest thing she's imagining, but the worst part is that Fiona can't help but feel like she's seen it all before. She saw it, and it seems like she even escaped from the nightmare, but if so, then why does it repeat itself over and over again? And is there even a way out of it?", "summary": "A story of fear and doubts about reality, decisions and regrets, dreams and darkness.\n~\nA psychological horror adventure that takes the player through the wide corridors of a mysterious estate and confronts the protagonist with far-reaching decisions.\n~\nFind your own path, explore the sinister estate and uncover some of its deep-rooted secrets.\n~\nLeave this waking nightmare behind you, or slide further and further down into the rabbit hole of the Labyrinth of Agoraphobia.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/agoraphobia-directors-cut", "videos": [{"id": 138873, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "u3ppwSjTVrk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3ppwSjTVrk", "title": "Agoraphobia Teaser-Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u3ppwSjTVrk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 138872, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nkkKuZgxljY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkkKuZgxljY", "title": "Agoraphobia Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nkkKuZgxljY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
