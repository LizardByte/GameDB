The game can be played with a standard joypad or the Super Famicom Mouse and is similar to the card game Monte Carlo. The game centers around a large playing field composed of a random arrangement of Mario heads, Coins, Yoshi Eggs, Fire Flowers, and Super Mushrooms. If two or more icons are connected, the player can move the cursor and double-click to make all the connected icons disappear. Once the entire grid is clear, the game ends.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/undake30-samegame-daisakusen-mario-version"}
