This is where you'll need to help them.\nWith one touch easy mechanic, touch the screen to make them flap their wings. Not so easy though, the forest they are is filled with obstacles including trees, spikes and forest folks such as Bee.\nThrough your way, you'll collect fruits and our birds love them!
