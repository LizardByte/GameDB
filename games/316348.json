In the game, players run a caf\u00e9 by cooking dishes and serving customers with the help of zombies. Players can turn customers into zombies, who become employees. Players gain experience by cooking and serving dishes. There are a variety of menu items, each differing in price, number of servings, and time to cook. As the restaurant builds up savings, the player can purchase recipes and furnishings, and can infect more customers. The player can also purchase pets and expand their restaurant. Along with growing the business, players can send their zombies to raid enemy caf\u00e9s to obtain new recipes.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zombie-cafe", "videos": [{"id": 126231, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zwLvFLusKdU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwLvFLusKdU", "title": "Zombie Caf\u00e9 Android & iOS HD GamePlay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zwLvFLusKdU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
