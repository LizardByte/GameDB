{"id": "sGoG2BKMk0s", "snippet": {"title": "Game Boy Advance Longplay [207] Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: NPI\n\nInspired in part by the \"mascots with attitude\" trend that was common following the introduction of Sonic the Hedgehog, the game features a red bat named Aero, who works and lives in a circus. He must defend the circus from an evil ex-clown called Edgar Ektor, who used to work in the same circus and wants it shut down forever. Aero must also deal with the sidekick Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel (who later had his own game).\n\nAero the Acro-Bat (also known as Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge on GBA) is a Mega Drive/Genesis and Super Nintendo game created by David Siller, developed by the now defunct Iguana Entertainment, and published by Sunsoft on October 1993.\n\nThe levels are played in typical 2D platforming, but in order to clear levels, the player must accomplish certain tasks so that the exit warp can be revealed. Those tasks include passing through hoops, stepping on platforms until they disappear, riding roller coasters, etc. There are 4 worlds with 5 levels in each one, and the levels are large, many of them containing awkwardly positioned spikes.\n\nDuring the 16-bit era, Aero had a fair share of fame. Sunsoft used him as a mascot during the 16-bit console days. After the 16-bit decline, he disappeared and was forgotten until 2002, when Metro 3D decided to port this game for the Game Boy Advance, with a battery back-up (which the original versions lacked).\n\nThe GBA port is poorly done. It\ufffds buggy and way too easy. Although I like the more elaborate animations, they were added at the cost of removing other animations from the 16-bit games. I like the facts that Aero\ufffds mobility is improved by allowing him to maintain vertical and horizontal momentum after a drill attack, to move horizontally while hovering, and making him fall down quicker, but all this is spoiled by leaving level layout the same, which results at times in less fluid platforming, much easier obstacles, or a player\ufffds ability to bypass a large difficult platforming section altogether in a single leap. The levels were changed slightly in comparison to 16-bit versions, removing enemies and spikes in many places as well as filling level space with more items (all of which I might or might not have picked up \ufffd I tried, at least). Sources of instant death were greatly reduced, some difficult enemies were removed from the game, and all enemies were dumbed down and given one single hit point, which makes game even easier, and, as if this wasn\ufffdt enough, all enemies often drop health pickups, practically giving players the ability to fly through an entire level, since, if Aero takes damage mid-air, drill and hover are cancelled and can be done again. Also, Aero runs slower, and his vision is more limited, which spells trouble in a game with spacious levels, objects that are necessary to find to progress in the game, highly mobile protagonist and spikes all over the place. And then the game is made easier still by the facts that each star pick-up gives five stars instead of one, and that shooting more than ten stars in rapid succession makes Aero invincible for the rest of the round. Stars can now be shot while running or crouching, which is the only improvement in the game with no drawbacks. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGoG2BKMk0s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGoG2BKMk0s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sGoG2BKMk0s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Advance Longplay [207] Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: NPI\n\nInspired in part by the \"mascots with attitude\" trend that was common following the introduction of Sonic the Hedgehog, the game features a red bat named Aero, who works and lives in a circus.
