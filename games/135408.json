Its predecessor Repton 3 included a level and graphics editor but Infinity takes it one step further with Reptol, a scripting language that allows the user to alter the behaviour of characters and objects. This means that the user can not only create new Repton levels but also completely new games. Four games are included to demonstrate the tools: \n \n- Repton 3: Take 2 \n- Repton 4 \n- Robbo \n- Trakker", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/repton-infinity"}
