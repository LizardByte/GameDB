There are over fifteen levels here on Mars, but you only need the four ship parts to get out of there! That's not to say there's no reason to explore anywhere once you have them. Oh, of course not!\n\nYou can talk to your passengers for tips or casual interactions, and you can discover tons of secrets and goodies as you romp around the monster-infested environment. Just be sure to keep on your toes! You're going to need all the ammo and power-ups you can get!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-in-marooned-on-mars"}
