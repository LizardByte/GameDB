Though the game's development was outsourced and Nippon Ichi only served as its publisher, it retains a very similar visual style to its prequels, and also features songs by longtime Nippon Ichi composer Tenpei Sato, who wrote the musical numbers that the Marl Kingdom series was well known for.\n\nThe game's story follows Miabelle, a young girl who lives in the eponymous kingdom of Antiphona. When the game begins, Miabelle's beloved older sister Lily, an accomplished singer, has just been given the honour of serving as Song Princess at a great festival held in the kingdom once every three hundred years. But just before the festival starts, Lily's voice is stolen by the devious Aulos. Summoning her courage, Miabelle sets off on a quest with her puppets and companions to restore her sister's voice, and save the kingdom from peril."}
