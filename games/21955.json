It was considered faithful to the physical version, but reviewers commented that it was not accessible to players who weren't already fans of collectible card games. The handheld versions were criticized for presenting a visual format inappropriate for small screens.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marvel-trading-card-game", "videos": [{"id": 119229, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "c7R1Zppljco"}]}
