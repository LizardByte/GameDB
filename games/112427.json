Train, upgrade and manage your army to prepare for waging endless battles in the War Zone. Focus on becoming the most renowned Warlord and provider of arms or chase glory on the battlefield as you climb military ranks!\n\nThe game starts off in Boot Camp where you focus on building a powerful army. Unlock new units, upgrade their production, deploy units off to battle in exchange for attracting dirty army contractors that will super-size your production! Best of all, you can amass trainers that will do all the work for you, even while you're away.\n\nAnd once you're ready, head off to the War Zone where you will fight battles for glory... and loot! All that precious gold you can gather via various activities and completing missions, will provide you that extra boost to your Boot Camp production as well as improve the strength of your army.\n\nBut to really stand out from rest of the competition, you will have to collaborate with your countrymen in invasions where you destroy enemy bases to get massive war spoils! If you are focused on chasing that glory as a hero or care more about your renown in the world, there's plenty of options that are presented to you during the game to differentiate from others and focus on your priorities!\n\nControls\nEverything is controlled via mouse/tap (it is playable on mobile, though NOT optimized for it).\nThere's a tutorial guiding your through ins and outs of the game so just get in there and you'll know what to do! :)", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/war-clicks", "videos": [{"id": 23342, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eGa9U7vZJFI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGa9U7vZJFI", "title": "WarClicks Trailer (official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGa9U7vZJFI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
