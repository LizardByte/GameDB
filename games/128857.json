Naturally there are baddies trying to stop Qubey in his quest and contact with these will cost a life, the player has two lives in the shareware version of the game but in the registered version they have four lives and gain another life for every five thousand points scored.\n\nThe game is mouse or joystick controlled, has sound and voice effects and a high score table. It occupies a fixed sized window on-screen within which the game plays. The game also comes with a level construction set.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-qube-hopper"}
