Take control of a street gang and order your recruits to attack, defend or even do a little safe-cracking to pick up some needed cash. Use that cash to buy nastier weapons and take down your punk enemies in this intense first-person shooter.\n\n\"Kingpin: Reloaded brings new life to the Quake II engine classic. 4K resolution, ultrawide support, and improved graphics in Enhanced mode enable the beautifully-depicted metropolitan nightmare shine. Controller support makes the game more accessible for anyone who wants to explore the depths of Kingpin\u2019s depravity. Overall improvements like new quest and conversation systems make Reloaded even better than the original.\n\nStalk lamp-lit streets and take down rival gangs to let the Kingpin know his end is nigh. Kingpin\u2019s immersive sim elements allow the Thug to recruit other gangsters with a conversation system. Increase the Thug\u2019s influence through multiple hub-based missions. Run with the gang on a violent warpath with upgradeable weapons including Tommy guns, bazookas, and more. Location-based damage leads to bloody, thrilling battles: kneecap, maim, or go for the head.\n\nIf that sounds too extreme, try No Violence mode. However, the \u201ccolorful\u201d language proudly used by Kingpin\u2019s gangsters remains. Lean even further into that era and start fragging in Gang Bang mode\u2019s old-school multiplayer.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kingpin-reloaded", "videos": [{"id": 34633, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "bIZncEjZoig", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIZncEjZoig", "title": "Kingpin: Reloaded Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bIZncEjZoig/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
