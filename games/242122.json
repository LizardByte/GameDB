Soon, the only places where humanity could survive were in the small gaps between Tekki activity.\n\nSince then, a thousand years have passed, and a single hero has at last struck a decisive blow against the heart of the Tekki menace.\n\n\u201cThe battle for the fate of humanity ended 100 days ago.\u201d\n\u201cThe only things left for the story that lies ahead are \u2018hope\u2019 and \u2018happiness.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe stage is set in a country known as Kanto, home to some eight hundred empowered individuals and reminiscent in some ways of long-lost Japan. This nation of scrappy survivors has built its whole culture around the struggle for continued existence\u2014and although that struggle is over now, the common citizens still cover their faces with fox masks and live as \u201cnobodies\u201d in the full sense of the word.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018hope\u201d and \u2018happiness?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWe don't know anything other than fighting.\u201d\n\n\u2014One day a young man from a thousand years in the past is dug up, to become the protagonist of our tale. Just awoken from an unreliable cold-sleep hibernation, he finds himself missing his memory, but although uncertain who he is, he possesses the knowledge of ancient civilizations.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2014can you promise me to join with us, and work to bring hope and happiness into this world?\u201d\n\nIn exchange for food, clothing, and shelter, he agrees to bring culture to the kingdom of Kanto, which might as well be a different world from our own.\n\nOnly after the fight for the fate of humanity does his story even begin.\n\nThis is a story of a strange new life,\nof coffee shops and the paper-money economy,\nabout the qualities and struggles of a leader,\nand it's about a girl who was nobody,\nfinding her feet and embracing a dream.\n\nAnd it's about the life and the death of a hero.\n\nBut more than anything, this is a confession.", "summary": "You wake up from a cold sleep upside-down in a tree.
