For the basic hockey gameplay a traditional side view is used, but whenever you or your opponent shoots at the goal the game switches to the special Shot Cam view. Occasionally when someone commits a nasty foul the game turns into a one-on-one fighting game; he who wins the fight can stay on the ice while the loser must spend some time in the penalty box.", "videos": [{"id": 39504, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "KxI1LsmYrvU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxI1LsmYrvU", "title": "Face Off gameplay (PC Game, 1987)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KxI1LsmYrvU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
