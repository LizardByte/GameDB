Egypt, China, and France are awaiting your arrival, and each country has a new set of skills for your Sims to learn.\n\nVisit the pyramids of Egypt and learn all about photography as you explore ancient artifacts; the game will actually switch to a first person point-of-view so you can snap pictures. Study martial arts in China, honing your skills for upcoming tournaments. And the beauty of France is a site to behold, where you\u2019ll learn how to make sweet nectar. But as the title says, this game is all about \u201cadventure\" and various quests are linked together by a main story. Your expeditions can range from exploring tombs (avoid the mummies, they\u2019ll curse you) to collecting valuable treasures. That photography skill will come in handy as you capture each and every breathtaking moment.", "summary": "The Adventure is near...
