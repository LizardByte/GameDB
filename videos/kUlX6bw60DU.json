{"id": "kUlX6bw60DU", "snippet": {"title": "WolfPack (PC/DOS) 1990, Novalogic /Br\u00f8derbund", "description": "Wolfpack is a World War II submarine simulator published by Br\u00f8derbund in the 1990s, for use on the Amiga, Atari ST, DOS computers and the Apple Macintosh. It simulates combat actions between wolf packs of German U-boats and convoys of Allied destroyers and merchant vessels in the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\nThe player can choose to command either side, the wolfpack or the convoy, with the computer controlling the enemy vessels. At any time the player may take command of any vessel in their group, including of the tankers and freighters which each carry a single gun. Each vessel can be set to remain on course or at rest, or to act under computer control while the player controls another vessel. This feature helped pave the way for many modern day real-time strategy video games.\n\nThe game allows the player to choose between different levels of tactical complexity. The player can simply command one submarine, or one a time, or issue orders and command the operations of the entire group. They can order a vessel to patrol a certain path, laid out using the mouse with the map screen, or to anchor at a certain point, or take other actions. The user can also create new missions, choosing initial locations, orders, and patrol routes for vessels on both sides.\n\nThe player can choose to run the simulation in real-time, or increase the speed by up to 64 times, allowing the ships to cross large distances in a reasonable time. The simulation automatically slows to real-time at important times such as when shots are fired.\n\nThe game reflects a number of advances in technology that occurred during the course of World War II. Each mission takes place during a particular year of the war. In later years new submarine classes are available to the player, with advances such as greater underwater speed. Destroyers gain radar and active sonar for detection of submarines, and hedgehog antisubmarine weapons, to supplement the depth charges, guns and passive sonar of the earlier destroyers.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUlX6bw60DU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUlX6bw60DU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUlX6bw60DU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUlX6bw60DU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "WolfPack (PC/DOS) 1990, Novalogic /Br\u00f8derbund", "description": "Wolfpack is a World War II submarine simulator published by Br\u00f8derbund in the 1990s, for use on the Amiga, Atari ST, DOS computers and the Apple Macintosh.
