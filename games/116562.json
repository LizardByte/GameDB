Those of us who made it are now living in ruined cities behind steel gates that separate the cities from one another and from deadly creatures roaming the wastelands. The only thing that stands between us and them are the remotely controlled war machines called ARMZ. But no machine, no matter how powerful, would be of any use without YOU, its operator. \n \nArmZ VR is a hellishly dynamic wave shooter that allows you to become one with a huge, heavily-armed Battle Mech! Your goal? To guard the city walls against constant attacks of horrifying human-machine hybrids. Be sure they\u2019ll use all their skills, weapons and won\u2019t hesitate to sacrifice their life when needed, as unlike any living being, they\u2019re not driven by a self-preservation instinct but pure will to kill.", "summary": "Think quick, but shoot quicker in this insanely dynamic wave shooter, where you operate a huge battle mech.
