{"id": "5wI8sHeRj0g", "snippet": {"title": "F1 Racing Simulation (1997) - Every PC F1 Game", "description": "F1 Racing Simulation by Ubi Soft, 1997.\n\nNote: Here I'm showing the Glide 3Dfx version of the game. The Direct3D version isn't radically worse, but isn't quite as nice! I'm playing on keyboard, hence the strange on/off engine/handling (the game crashes when I try to use a wheel).\n\n1. Race Start (Monza): 0:00 This game feels quite heavy, compared to other F1 titles. The track modelling is verging on the abysmal, however!\n\n2. Spray Effects (Silverstone): 0:38 The spray looks more like fast dissipating steam, rather than a spray of water. At least it gets the job done! There's also a dark fog and a darker looking circuit, to convey wet weather.\n\n3. Tunnel & View (Monaco): 0:51 The tunnel at Monaco is pretty dark, given it's lined with lights. The distant view after the tunnel is rather bland.\n\n4. Wet Track (Spa-Francorchamps): 1:09 There's some rudimentary rain effects here, but the main wet effect is heavy fogging, which isn't really very useful!\n\n5. Pitstop (Interlagos): 1:30 Pitstops are handled via a rather crude pitcrew animation. For some reason they have to fix damage before changing any wheels, which is rather slow! The fuel/tyre choice screen isn't very fast to use, either!\n\n6. Huge Crash (Montreal): 1:55 Crash damage in this game is up there with Grand Prix 2 and above, with cars being reduced to their safety cell. Note the parts seem to have their own unique physics! This is via a replay though; in real time they were marginally less jumpy!\n\nThis is part of the Every PC F1 Game playlist, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDobL0b26uiiYP8KdN3AwQmsu7ilzpxL", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wI8sHeRj0g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wI8sHeRj0g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wI8sHeRj0g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wI8sHeRj0g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wI8sHeRj0g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "F1 Racing Simulation (1997) - Every PC F1 Game", "description": "F1 Racing Simulation by Ubi Soft, 1997.\n\nNote: Here I'm showing the Glide 3Dfx version of the game.
