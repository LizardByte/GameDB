In this abstract strategy management simulation, players guide their civilization from the Neolithic era to the Atomic Age through an innovative node-based system where decisions create cascading effects across society. The game features interconnected elements including agriculture, commerce, religion, and warfare that players must balance while adapting to local resources and regional characteristics. Players can shape unique cultural and religious traits, engage with rival civilizations through diplomacy or warfare, and pursue multiple victory conditions. Building upon its predecessor, Orbi Universo II offers enhanced visuals, rebuilt systems, and deeper gameplay mechanics while maintaining an abstract visual style focused on clarity and readability.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orbi-universo-ii"}
