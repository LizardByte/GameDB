You can choose from six bowlers, including a secret android character who appears only after you reach a certain level. Each bowler is rated on power and technique and uses a different weight of bowling ball. Apparently, all the bowlers are ambidextrous because each one can bowl right- or left-handed.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-bowling"}
