Trailblazer is a Doom mod where your character is slightly overpowered in terms of speed, weaponry and of course, possibility to craft various stuff like M2 Brownings, Spikebombs, Armors and even a jar of Whiskey. One of the most funny weapons to use is your starting Macheterang, you can throw it at your enemies and it will return to you, really strong choice. After upgrading, it gains a possibility to damage the targets in line, imagine being surrounded by multiple Pinkies and using Machetterang. You will also surely like a Skullthrottle Minigun, a very difficult weapon to control with its huge recoil, it eats your ammo in a very fast rate. It fires tons of lead at a very large area and it can stunlock such enemies like Archvile or Cyberdemon without problems. Its upgrades are quite mandatory (M2 Browning that becomes Primary Fire), with such firepower you only need to worry about ammo. The slot for explosive weapons (5) carries a Magnun Revolver - might be strange, but this 6-8 cylinder weapon is loaded with explosive bullets. You might unload them in a rapid manner using an alternate fire or score precise shots from a distance with your primary fire. With a blueprint upgrade, you do not have to worry about reloading while using an alternate rapid fire mode.\n\n00:00 - Macheterang\n00:36 - Sidekick Pistol\n01:09 - Colts\n02:21 - Sawed-Off Shotguns\n03:09 - Chrome & Automatic Shotgun\n04:00 - FMG & HEAVY MACHINE GUN\n05:01 - Uzi\n05:50 - Magnum Revolver\n07:03 - Automatic Grenade Launcher\n08:09 - Skullthrottle Minigun & M2 Browning\n09:11 - Spikebombs\n09:56 - NUTCRACKER\n\nMy Discord - https://discord.gg/XPtgcUAJjt\nTrailblazer Mod - https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=47494\nBolognese Addon - https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/bbgorenew\nDemonastery - https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/102434-demonastery-released-now-on-idgames/\nPrimary Excavation Site - https://www.doomworld.com/files/file/19062-doom-3-primary-exavation-site/\nDiabolus E.X https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/101473-gzdoom-diabolus-ex-v11/\nHoly Hell - https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/g-i/holyhell\nDARKSTAR - http://www.mediafire.com/file/pdm73fa99mbcc29/doom_darkstar_low.zip/file\nSimpleHUD addons - https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=60356", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NRw4ZJii1gI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NRw4ZJii1gI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NRw4ZJii1gI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NRw4ZJii1gI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NRw4ZJii1gI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "TRAILBLAZER - Doom Mod Weapons Showcase & Explanation", "description": "Trailblazer Doom Mod All Weapons Showcase, together with explanation of their tinkering upgrades & blueprints you will encounter during the playthrough.
