They are taking the hobbits to Isengard, but their journey will take them across the land of the horse-lords, their bitter enemies, and they are pursued by the Three Hunters: Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. East Rohan is ruled by a number of powerful lords whose loyalty is to King Th\u00e9oden, but the whispered treasons of Saruman have already caused dissension to root in the plains of the Riddermark. Help its people as they strive to defend themselves against the growing threat of war. Witness the Argonath, the mighty Pillars of the Kings astride the Great River Anduin, and stand by the Seat of Seeing atop Amon Hen, marvelling at the ancient works of Gondor. And then journey beneath the eaves of Fangorn, whose trees are older still, and uncover the secrets of its mysterious shepherds.", "summary": "Riders of Rohan expands the online world of Middle-earth where players join forces to ride into the Plains of Rohan.
