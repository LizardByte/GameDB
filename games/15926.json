It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.", "summary": "Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.\n\nGo Go Ackman was created by famous mangaka Akira Toriyama, known for his work on Dragon Ball as well as games such as Chrono Trigger and Dragon Quest.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/go-go-ackman", "videos": [{"id": 42832, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "i69dEakWEjU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69dEakWEjU", "title": "SNES Longplay - Go Go Ackman (Fan Translation)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i69dEakWEjU/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
