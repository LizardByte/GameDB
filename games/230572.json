In this game, the player's Mii has been captured and it is up to the player to save him/her by battling their way through a series of rooms containing different enemies. Players use the Miis they have encountered, but can also use Play Coins to summon additional wanderers. Each Mii has a standard attack and a magic spell based on their color. For example, red Miis can cast flame spells whilst light blue Miis can freeze their opponents. Certain colored Miis are required to clear certain rooms, such as using a yellow Mii to break an enemy's yellow shield. If a Mii is encountered on StreetPass several times, their level in StreetPass Quest will increase, making them stronger, but only up to level 7. As the player progresses through the game, they can earn hats for their Mii to wear."}
