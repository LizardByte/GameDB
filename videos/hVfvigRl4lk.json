In this single button game you control Ratty as he tries to grab all cheese and avoid hazards. When all cheese has been found you advance to the next level. There are 8 levels to complete.\n\nRatty will automatically walk forward. If he touches a wall he will turn around and walk the other way. Sometime you pass a stop sign, where ratty will halt and wait for your command to continue. When Ratty is walking you can make him jump by pressing the mouse button to avoid the enemies and to reach new platforms.\n\nAs well as cheese, the stages are filled with various enemies. You have to watch out for spiders, slimy blobs, razors and other things that can harm you. You have three lives, and if you die you restart at the last stop sign.\n\nDeveloped by Donut Games\nAlso released on iOS, Windows 8 (Microsoft Store) and Web Browsers\n\n#theforeseenarcade #android #androidgameplay #androidgames #rats #rat #ratontherun #donutgames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hVfvigRl4lk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hVfvigRl4lk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hVfvigRl4lk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hVfvigRl4lk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hVfvigRl4lk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Rat on the Run - Android Gameplay", "description": "Ratty lives in a big house, that's fortunately is full of his favorite food: cheese.
