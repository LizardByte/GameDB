The game's model number was BU-201, and the contents within the box included the game, LR44 batteries, a caution leaflet, a how to play leaflet, and battery stickers. The game is very similar to the arcade classic Arcanoid and has colors due to the layers of colored plastic overlay. Your goal is to spit on the ball so that it'll go back up and destroy the blocks at the top. The unit was rectangular and silver. When Nintendo of America released the game in America, they made artwork for the game that had a more detailed character.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 71209, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AGFFjeueR9g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGFFjeueR9g", "title": "Game & Watch - Spitball Sparky (c)1984 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AGFFjeueR9g/sddefault.jpg"}]}
