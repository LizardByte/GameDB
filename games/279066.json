Rival armed gang members are hot on your trail, and it's a case of shoot or be shot. You control the motion of the getaway car as it speeds down a straight highway. The opposing cars have gang members leaning out of their windows to shoot at you either vertically or horizontally. You can also shoot back, and the direction of your shot will be opposite the one in which your car last moved. Once you have killed all your pursuing enemies, the level is complete.\n\nThe first level requires you to defeat only one opponent to complete the level. Subsequent levels add opponents and increases the frequency of their gun-shots. Multiple foes can appear on screen simultaneously, and defeating them before the timer runs out gives you bonus points. Additional points can be scored by collecting loot which randomly appears on the road as you drive by. If you are shot, you loss one of your three lives. Once you have used those up, it is game over.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gang-man"}
