They come in all styles and colors, and all of them are more or less inspired by John Romero, whether it's his old IWad maps, his modern offerings (SIGIL and its sequel), his other games, or even his real life. You can play each of these maps in any order you fancy, as there's no clear theme or difficulty order. Each wad can be played standalone, \u00e0 la Master Levels, and some of them contain new textures and resources.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/le-gars-qui-a-fait-doom"}
