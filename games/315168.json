Wary of the increased challenges of creating a single player map over a deathmatch one, mappers were allowed to reuse architecture from previous 32in24 maps to assist them in creating theirs.\n\nContinuing the food and holiday themes introduced by the thirteenth edition, this session was held on 21 December, 2014, and so the maps generally carried a Christmas theme, complete with map titles that mostly referenced either Christmas or food. The subtitle of the session itself refers to a Christmas story by Dr. Seuss As with the previous few sessions, a week was allowed after the session for minor polishing of the maps based on feedback.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/32in24-14-how-the-hamburglar-stole-christmas"}
