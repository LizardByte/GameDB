The three events are Slalom, Ski-Jump and Downhill and the events don't have to be completed to move to the next one. Slalom is viewed from above at an elevated angle and you ski down the screen which scrolls constantly avoiding obstacles like rocks, logs and trees, while skiing between flags to get to the finish line in the quickest time. You can control your speed but if you miss three gates or crash then the event is over.\n\nSki-Jump is viewed from the side as you move down the ramp while pressing the fire button as fast as you can. When you reach the end you move to another side view screen and you try to land safely. You press up for distance while you press down to land. Downhill is the same as Slalom but you just have to avoid the obstacles and get to the finish in the fastest time again. You are also able to jump which is needed as obstacles block routes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/olympic-skier"}
