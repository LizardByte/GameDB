Why? No particular reason, unless \"Arcade Games Are Cool\" counts. I'm not going to start off with elaborate titles or anything; I'm mostly going to play low-key titles and titles which we've made videos for on other platforms already (so you can see their Arcade counterparts).\n\nAs such, here's a video of the Arcade version of \"Puzzle Star Sweep\" (or \"Starsweep\"), which is simply known as Star Sweep. As far as I know, the Arcade game was only released in Japan. It's a simple but fun puzzle game by Namco and Axela. If you've played the Playstation or Game Boy title, you're not missing out. The Game Boy game is decent in its own right and the Playstation game is essentially enhanced with more modes, features, and an enhanced soundtrack (though you can listen to the Arcade tracks as well). The Playstation game was released outside of Japan by \"A1 Games\" and was one of the best titles in their budget game line-up along with titles like \"Battle Hunter\" and \"Top Shop\". I enjoyed the game's soundtrack, which is in my music account.\n\nDo you have what it takes to defeat the nine Stardust brawlers? Your goal is to stop the evil Dr. J. in the Story Mode or you can play by yourself and see how long you can survive mounting challenges or challenge a friend. You gather together different blocks with different stars and colors (three colors, two types of primary blocks). Simply match blocks of the same color with stars on their endpoints to dissolve them. You can create chains by cleverly stacking blocks and colors and then removing the catalyst piece from play. Watch 'em fall! The Arcade game actually seems a little easier than the Playstation game.\n\nThis is a video of some of the game for historical purposes. Also, after watching this again, I actually play a lot better than I did for the Playstation game, lol.
