Phaet is everything, everywhere, and everywhen. Phaet is the all. The creator. Before time, before space, there was Phaet. From, and by, Phaet all that is, became. Feeling the need for companionship, Nixil, came to be. Nixil was the first. An experiment without a control, without guidelines. If Phaet is capable of regret, Nixil is regrettable. Others followed, becoming what Phaet had intended Nixil to be. These 'gods' as they would come to be called were of Phaet as was Nixil, but to a much lesser degree. Nixil harassed and tormented these gods, and always argued with Phaet. When Phaet created what mortals know as matter, space, and time, Nixil confronted Phaet insisting that such an uncontrolled abomination should not be brought forth. Nixil was scolded for his doubt and withdrew. However, after corrupting a number of the gods to his point of view. Nixil again confronted Phaet and demanded that he stop. Upon Phaet's refusal, Nixil became enraged. Nixil lashed out at the creation in an attempt to destroy it. To protect the creation, Phaet banished Nixil to the emptiness between matter, space, and time. This place, known as the Void, was of Nothing. Forced to maintain Nixil's imprisonment, Phaet had to let the creation evolve on its own. The gods did what they could to nurture and beautify the creation in honor of Phaet. Within the creation formed things known as worlds, stars, moons, and various other celestial bodies. On some of the worlds life began and evolved. Beings of various types grew to sentience and intrigued Phaet, the gods, and even Nixil, who could see everything but was unable to affect it. On one of these worlds, Entia, numerous beings grew to sentience. Many of these beings also evolved the ability to manipulate the balance of matter, space, and time. The manipulation became known as magic.", "summary": "The world of Entia is again at war. The forces of chaos once again seek to destroy the world itself. It is a time of fear and darkness. It is a time for those with courage, to step forward and defend their beliefs, and their very existence.\n\nBlackMUD is a Diku/Silly based MUD, although it has become something far more than either. The world of Entia is a wonderous and challenging place. It boasts over 90 original areas, made up of 35000 crafted rooms (and growing), all designed around a comprehensive world theme and history.\n\nGood role-playing is encouraged and rewarded, although not required. With a wide array of races, cities, classes and sub-classes, BlackMUD offers the player a wide world of adventure and excitement.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blackmud"}
