Players take on the role of Spider-Man and complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.\n\nThe story is divided into multiple chapters, each with its own set of objectives, such as purchasing upgrades for Spider-Man, or acquiring a certain number of hero points from completing side missions. These side missions are given by random pedestrians across the game's map, and mainly consist of battling criminals, stopping speeding cars by jumping on top of them and punching them, taking injured people to the hospital, or saving construction workers from falling to their deaths. Each chapter includes at least one story mission related to the main plot.\n\nPlayers are able to web swing, crawl walls, and fight enemies using a variety of combos. They can use Spider-Man's \"spider sense\" to slow down time and dodge incoming attacks, including gun fire. This version of the game was considered innovative at that time due to its physics-based algorithms that simulate Spider-Man's web swinging in three dimensions, creating a new game mechanic unlike the traditional jumping or flying of previous Spider-Man games. Combat is far more complex, as it involves carefully timing the player's attacks and dodges. After completing the main storyline, a bonus mode inside a warehouse is unlocked, where the player can fight waves of enemies and bosses from the main storyline, as well as an exclusive villain: Calypso.", "summary": "In the console version of \"Spider-Man 2\", Manhattan becomes a gamer's playground as you take the role of Spider-Man in a battle against the nefarious Doc Ock. Based on the plot of the movie Spider-Man 2 and the heroes and villains created by Marvel, the game allows players to encounter unique and dangerous villains as they patrol the streets and rooftops of the biggest city created in any Super Hero game to date.\n\nAs Spider-Man, players must master new combo moves as they protect the denizens of New York City from the nefarious Doc Ock and other classic Marvel villains by swinging, jumping and wall-crawling through 19 new levels that extend beyond the film. With an unprecedented depth of gameplay, players experience original storylines featuring Vulture, Shocker, Rhino, and Mysterio all while battling through graphically rich 3D environments.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spider-man-2", "videos": [{"id": 25431, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "86G-9KC8AUA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86G-9KC8AUA", "title": "Spider-Man 2 Xbox Trailer - E3 2004 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/86G-9KC8AUA/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 27401, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FX8oB68O1ms", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX8oB68O1ms", "title": "Spider-Man 2: The Game E3 2003 trailer HQ", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FX8oB68O1ms/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 27402, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "f5HDRuAeL7s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5HDRuAeL7s", "title": "Spider-Man 2 [PC] - Full Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f5HDRuAeL7s/sddefault.jpg"}]}
