One end is always pinned in place while the other constantly rotates clockwise. Press a button to pin the other end while releasing the first one or hold a button to extend the line. Your goal is to move around while avoiding the borders of the screen. Collect the coins to score points but avoid hitting the purple spikes.\n\nThe game is over when both ends of the line go beyond the borders of the screen or when you touch a spike.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twin-p"}
