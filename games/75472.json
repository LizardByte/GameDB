Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player's choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF '98, and several regular characters have hidden \"alternate\" versions that may also be used in-game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-king-of-fighters-98-special-edition"}
