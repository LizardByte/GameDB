Unsure of his identity and completely isolated, his next terrifying revelation is that the town is infested with zombies. With a gun as his only protection, he must attempt an escape. During his nightmarish struggle, clues are slowly revealed about the extent of the horror he is involved in and what his true identity may be....", "summary": "Resident Evil Survivor is the first Resident Evil title to be rendered in real time as opposed to making use of pre-rendered backdrops. Levels are explored in first person, and when enemies are encountered the press of a button will bring up a targeting reticle for shooting. As with most light-gun games there is infinite pistol ammunition available, but limited ammunition for more powerful weapons. At the end of each level two doors are presented which both lead to different levels, although all paths eventually lead to the same ending.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-survivor", "videos": [{"id": 3886, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yyfJGINGgVE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyfJGINGgVE", "title": "Resident Evil Survivor!
