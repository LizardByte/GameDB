The larger the city you build, the more points you score. You build your city by matching three or more game-pieces: combine three grasses to make a bush, three bushes to make a tree... until you've filled the board with houses, cathedrals and castles. Along the way, you'll have to outwit giant bears who will try to block your progress. \n\nHow large can you grow your dream city before the board fills and the game ends? \n\nThis is the ultimate hardcore version of Triple Town. There are no in-app purchases of any kind in the game. There is no DLC. When you buy the game, you get everything it has to offer with that purchase. We hope you enjoy it!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y60d7xuwy6Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y60d7xuwy6Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y60d7xuwy6Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Triple Town trailer", "description": "http://j.mp/3Town_GOG DRM-free on GOG.com, only $5.99 (regular price: $9.99)\n\nTriple Town is an award-winning original puzzle game in which you try to grow the greatest possible city.
