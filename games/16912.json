It has an custom respawn system, 16 levels, 12 track soundtrack, competitive scoring, and a simple-to-use level creation feature.\n\nThe challenging levels are balanced with the inclusion of a simple yet unique respawn system wherein the player can leave a checkpoint at any location at any point, as long as they are on solid ground. Players have a number of gameplay modes to choose from, whether they want it easy, normal, or they want to try their hand at a mode designed specifically for Speed Running.\n\nBeyond the visual aesthetic, the challenging level design, and the abundance of features, there is the fantastic soundtrack composed by James Bennett, which brings the simple 3-color atmospheres to life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/love", "videos": [{"id": 34885, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "r5uXqMW9HyU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5uXqMW9HyU", "title": "LOVE, by Fred Wood (Nintendo Switch, Steam, Itch.io, Google Play)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r5uXqMW9HyU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
