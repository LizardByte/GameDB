Pick out your dish or cone, load up with as many scoops as you want from a dizzying selection of ice cream, add specialty items like brownies, cookies, or bananas, drizzle on sauces, and then top it off with everything from whipped cream to candy, fruit and nuts.\n\nYou can make banana splits, brownie sundaes, hot fudge sundaes, fruit sundaes, waffle cones, double ice cream cones, and more!\n\nAfter you have built the world\u2019s greatest sundae, dig in! Take virtual bites or even lick the ice cream off a cone just by swiping your finger. But before you eat it all, save a photo of your ice cream to your photos album, share it on Facebook, or email it to your friends.\n\nMore Sundaes has all the polish and variety our fans have come to expect from Maverick Software food apps.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/more-sundaes"}
