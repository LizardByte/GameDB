Fatigue is not simulated, but players can slow down their opponents after a series of large successful hits along with bruises, blooded and black eyes. \n \nThere are 21 different camera views to choose from, including first-person that will react to their fighters being hit (ex. if a player keeps getting hit in the eyes, the screen will start to blacken, simulating a swollen eye and if they take a hard enough punch they will actually see the game through double vision). Championship photos of each boxer is also show before a fight and commentary is provided by Tim Gammon.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/foes-of-ali"}
