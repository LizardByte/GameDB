The game takes place over five aerial stages where the goal is to survive for five minutes (stage 4) or defeat all enemies (all other stages). In normal mode stages unlock sequentially, and each stage has a set vehicle and co-pilot. Upon completing normal mode hard mode stages are unlocked, which have hardier and more aggressive enemies as well as the ability to use all vehicles, pilots, optional gear, and co-pilots in the game. The player can also toggle flight controls between Normal, where the Valkyrie jet mode moves similarly to its bipedal modes, or Real, where the jet can bank and spin like an actual aircraft. In combat Valkyries and the Large Varja units can shift between their different forms by tapping a direction on the right stick. The Queadluun-Rhea does not have alternate forms, but can still change between high speed and maneuverability modes. Units will have a primary weapon (typically a rifle), and a secondary weapon (typically missiles), a melee attack, and speed boost. Weapons have unlimited ammunition, but limited magazines, and must be reloaded when depleted. All units can dash in a direction to break missile locks by double tapping, and shoot down missiles automatically with the missile defense move as long as they have remaining Anti gauge. A Special bar is replenished by gaining sequential hits on targets, and can be expended to increase boost, turn melee into a charging tackle, unleash the vehicle's unique ultimate attack, or activate the co-pilot's special ability. Upon finishing the stage the player is graded on the number of enemies shot down, as well as time and health remaining.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/macross-trial-frontier"}
