The game follows one of several boxers in their journey to winning the championship belt.\n\nTitle Fight takes full advantage of the hardware's sprite-scaling effects not only for the large character sprites, but also for the ring itself (which now rotates in a 3D space, allowing for 3D side-stepping). It also features linked multiplayer, one of the few boxing games of its type to do so.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/title-fight--1", "videos": [{"id": 98833, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ydA4uo2iZTY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydA4uo2iZTY", "title": "Title Fight (Arcade) - Full Playthrough and Ending", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ydA4uo2iZTY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
