It also was the first car racing game from Konami. The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (fuel is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and Winding Heat in 1996, respectively. A Japan-only rebooted sequel was also released in 2010, 14 years after Winding Heat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 18942, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "1FzumH75whY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FzumH75whY", "title": "Road Fighter NES/Famicon TAS (4:49.76)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1FzumH75whY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47740, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "y_b6JL90_fk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_b6JL90_fk", "title": "Road Fighter (1985) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y_b6JL90_fk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
