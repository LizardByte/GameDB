The only certainty is that Velguirie is an incredibly dangerous creature that takes extreme pleasure in setting up intricately complex combinations of traps to lure her victims to their untimely- yet in her eyes wildly entertaining- death.\nTaking the franchise\u2019s spirit of casting the player in the side of evil up a notch, Velguirie has a unique set of abilities that grow with every successful quest completion. With an immense selection of traps at her disposal she can also try to defeat the previous protagonists of the Deception series and add them to the player\u2019s arsenal.\nRolling boulders and spring boards, falling bathtubs and banana peels, balance beams, human cannons, spiked walls, horse-heads and iron maidens are only a few of the more than 180 traps that players can choose from to create the funniest, darkest, or most elaborate combos to defeat their adversaries.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlx-XTz9Zvk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlx-XTz9Zvk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlx-XTz9Zvk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlx-XTz9Zvk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qlx-XTz9Zvk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DECEPTION IV: THE NIGHTMARE PRINCESS PROMOTION TRAILER", "description": "\"Like\" us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/tecmoeurope\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/koeitecmoeurope\n\nDeception IV: The Nightmare Princess is coming to PS4, PS3 and PS Vita on 17 July 2015 across Europe.
