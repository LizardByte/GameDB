The more balls sink the higher scores you get. Touch the screen to adjust the direction and drag down the power-up in the right to strike.\nThe initial time limit of Challenge Mode is 2 minutes but once you sink a ball you will get additional time. As all the balls have been cleared, the pool will create a new group of balls to keep the game going on. Also you can play the Practice Mode which has no time limit but no high score record.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pool-billiards-pro"}
