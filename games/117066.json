The British Army and its Native American tribal allies engage in battle against the United States Continental Army and the French Expeditionary Force. Take aim and fire muskets, prepare bayonets and take control of the battlefield to succeed in your campaign for final victory. Combat includes long-range rifle marksmanship and brutal close quarters hand-to-hand melee fighting. You will need a mix of first person combat skills and quick-thinking strategy to survive. So prepare yourself to do battle for your side and to meet the enemy head-on. Only one side can be victorious.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-grounds-iii", "videos": [{"id": 89179, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ETTqIh4_aq4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETTqIh4_aq4", "title": "Battle Grounds III Teaser Trailer OFFICIAL", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ETTqIh4_aq4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
