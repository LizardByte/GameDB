You play as Robin, a twelve-year-old girl who has an anxiety disorder and is very much alive in this hospital meant for beings that are not alive. Frankly, her anxiety was already bad enough before she landed in a hospital full of dead people, the still-shambling shells of ancient ghosts who try to take her down for a sweet taste of life, and the hospital directors hellbent on keeping her contained, and more importantly, away from the reason she's REALLY there.\n\nThankfully, you have your new friends Jay and Sarcastic Ghost- Jay is a ghost about your age, and still a very new arrival to the hospital, and Sarcastic Ghost\u2026well, he's an amorphous blob of a ghost, who talks a lot despite not having a mouth.\n\nGame, art, and story director: Lilly Lefton\nAssistant writer: Rosemary Arnold\nAssistant concept artist: Maggie K\nMusic: Bittersweetnsours, CMDthenerd\nOther music: TeknoAXE, Sim Gretina, Aaron Spencer\nRPG Maker Resources: Yanfly, Victor, Freepik\nSpecial thanks: Rob Kvacek, zephror\n\nThe game ends somewhat unexpectedly as you can see if you watch until the end but given the subject matter that Ghost Hospital deals with, it sort of feels right. The game has been updated already since release so it's possible spitblaze may expand the story but this is the full game as it stands on the date this video was recorded and uploaded (April 28, 2017)\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this game?
