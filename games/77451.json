The game is slightly easier due to the longer length of the videos (5-10 minutes as opposed to under 5 minutes). \n \nVideos \nThe game includes 10 cartoon shorts, with one of them (\"Stop That Pigeon\") hidden until players reach Level 4. Additionally, the game includes a variety of smaller clips from other Hanna-Barbera cartoons for use when players complete puzzles. \n \nPixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks - \"Cousin Tex\" and \"Plutocrat Cat\" \nHuckleberry Hound - \"Legion Bound Hound\" and \"Spud Dud\" \nSnagglepuss - \"Jangled Jungle\" and \"Royal Rodent\" \nDasterdly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines - \"Stop That Pigeon\" and \"Pest Pilots\" \nDino and Cavemouse - \"Goofed Up Golf\" \n2 Stupid Dogs - \"Door Jam\"", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
