Once there, he meets a group of multiethnic youths as well as the Little Man stock character from Pink's animated shorts in the role of a camp counselor. He also reconnects with an old friend of his, Von Schmarty, a scientist and caricature of Albert Einstein who shows him his numerous inventions.\n\nSoon after Pink arrives, the children start acting strangely and contradictory to their nature, hating their camping experience despite Pink's every effort to appease them. Pink finds himself traveling around the world, followed by three dogs who claim to represent the \"Better Camping Bureau\", to solve the mystery and restore order to the camp.\n\nArmed with a PDA (which stands for \"Pink Digital Assistant\") that contains information on the indigenous people, languages, clothing, entertainment, art, history, nature, and foods of each pertinent country in the game, Pink travels the globe fulfilling various tasks based on the children's needs and whereabouts. He eventually gathers enough evidence to prove that the dogs' leader, the Dogfather, is intent on ruining Camp ChillyWawa's reputation so it will be closed down, allowing him to open a lucrative fast food restaurant in its place. The Dogfather then reveals to Pink that he was able to replace the camp's children with robotic clones, programmed to hate the camp unconditionally. Pink engages in a final confrontation with the Dogfather and his henchmen, Pugg and Louie, as well as a traitorous Little Man that ends with all four villains sucked into a powered suction pump and the captured children released.\n\nReturning in triumph to Inspector Clouseau's office, Pink turns down his next mission, an embarrassing cover job, and vows to leave the spy business.", "summary": "The Pink Panther: Passport to Peril is a 1996 adventure video game that teaches children about six different countries with the Pink Panther.
