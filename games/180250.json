Communication will be your best friend, remember you play as a team.\n\nTwo teams are facing each other, the \u00ab defenders \u00bb and the \u00ab attackers \u00bb.\nThe defenders must complete missions all game long, if they manage to accomplish them, they\u2019ll win.\nThe attackers must attempt to escape by finding solutions, while doing tasks that the defenders will require them to do.\n\nThe lobby system allows you to create private or public games, in order to play, as you wish, only with your friends or other players from the Octofight community.\nThanks to the in-game mic system, you can as well coordinate and chat verbally with your friends and as well as with other players.\nUpdates are common for the delight of players, in order to add content such as characters, cosmetics, maps, and other ways of playing...\n\nTime is running out, don\u2019t waste it, run aways or catch them all!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/octofight-escape", "videos": [{"id": 58899, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RXaAgoQV3WM"}]}
