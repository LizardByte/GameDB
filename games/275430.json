The focus for this project was to create lots of fast action, fun nonlinear layouts that don't take a huge amount of time to complete, and as little grind as possible, all within the restrictions of vanilla doom v1.9. To accommodate that goal, most weapons and monsters have been rebalanced in favor of speed and/or damage vs. tankiness.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magic-doom"}
