Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin\u2026 and will your former captors take notice?\n\nPayback: No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own \u2014 until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you\u2019re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!\n\nFear of the Dark: As you\u2019ve explored your home system, you\u2019ve always suspected you weren\u2019t alone in the galaxy\u2026 especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an \u201cincident\u201d a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?\n\nNew Pre-Ftl Interaction Options\nWhat will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?\n\nCloaking Technology\nNobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong\u2026 you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stellaris-first-contact", "videos": [{"id": 82326, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_zDpXiK9ccY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zDpXiK9ccY", "title": "Stellaris: First Contact Story Pack | Announcement Trailer [GOG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zDpXiK9ccY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
