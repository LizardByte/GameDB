Games invented on the beaches by sun-baked beach bums with a fondness for ripping, grinding, and shredding. With six radically thrilling events intended to bring you to the edge and blow your mind. And make adrenaline California's most plentiful natural resource.\n\nWish they all could be California Games.\nGet ready to shred the face off an awesomely tubular wave. Turn a \"berm\" on a BMX bike and spray up a wall of dirt. Launch a few feet off-the-lip with your skateboard tucked high. And while you're up there, dance for the crowd. Or if you're feeling like kicking back a bit, float a flying disk, juggle a foot bag with your heels, or just slalom the boardwalk on skates.\n\nWhen the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\nBut this ain't beach blanket bingo. In fact, before you even set foot on California turf, you'll choose an on-screen sponsor from among the heaviest names on the circuit. Then, hit the competition route. Prizes include trophies for a single event and a top prize in overall competition.\n\nSo get air. Go crazy. Welcome to a new state of intensity.\n\nCalifornia Games was the original \"Extreme Games\" \u2013 what today's generation might call \"X-Games in the sun\". Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/california-games", "videos": [{"id": 52025, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8jrR2zollIU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrR2zollIU", "title": "California Games (PC/DOS) 1988, Epyx", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8jrR2zollIU/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 52026, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GSFYx5_bdNU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSFYx5_bdNU", "title": "Atari Lynx Longplay - California Games (OLD)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GSFYx5_bdNU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
