Even today, the heavy all-rounder impresses with extra-large wheels and generous ground clearance, combined with long outreach and high lift. The result is a capable and versatile wheel loader powered by a Volvo Diesel engine, introduced and produced between 1970 and 1972.\n\nUse the BM-Volvo LM 845 to load and transport large and heavy quantities of material: Logs from harvested trees, iron ore from the mine in Silverrun Forest, or crops, bales, and big bags as well as other resources you need to transport in your daily agricultural business. With a diverse set of attachable tools, Volvo's wheel-loader is strong and versatile enough for every task of your farming operation.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/farming-simulator-22-volvo-lm-845"}
