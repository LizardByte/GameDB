All of the world-class riders, demanding circuits, fantastic machines, plus more are ready to provide the greatest thrills. The podium beckons and the asphalt grinds as 500ccs of thunder are set to explode once again.", "summary": "Namco, the genius company behind Tekken and Ridge Racer, has also proved itself a dab-hand at the motorcycle racing game. Early 2001, the arcade giant released Moto GP for PlayStation 2, and its runaway success quickly led to the research of a sequel. After considerable development time, Namco return with the second instalment.\n\nMoto GP 2 players can expect a glut of updates. New season statistics have naturally been included, and there are now 10 circuits to race on, all of which are genuine true-to-life tracks, bustling with interactivity. The graphics are noticeably better, cleaner, with improved textures and far fewer aliasing troubles.\n\nThe gameplay is as polished as ever, with easy-to-learn controls, a steady learning curve, and AI that doesn\u2019t make you want to tear your hair out... at least until you reach the later stages of the game. Moto GP 2 also offers the usual Championship and Time Trial mode of play. But, in typical Namco fashion, multiplayer mode is where the majority of the fun is to be had. In the entire history of video games, the ability to play the same game with one or more friends is still one of the most welcome features in a game.\n\nMoto GP 2 doesn\u2019t disappoint in this regard. It\u2019s frantic, it gets personal, and that\u2019s what makes it interesting. A grand sequel, all in all. Well worth a look, even if you own the original.", "videos": [{"id": 66092, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "51td6Jc0b38", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51td6Jc0b38", "title": "MotoGP 2 (gameplay) - Sony Playstation 2 - VGDB", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/51td6Jc0b38/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
