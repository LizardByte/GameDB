Roche embarks on a journey to the Castle of Algerine to defeat the evil demon overlord Argos and restore peace and happiness to the world.\n\nThe plot of the NES version is entirely different from the Arcade version. Astyanax is a 16-year old boy who attends Greenview High School. He has been having a recurring dream in which a young woman is calling his name. One day while on his way to class, Astyanax is transported to another dimension. He meets the fairy Cutie, who explains that he has been summoned to rescue the ruler of the kingdom Remilia, Princess Rosebud-who has been captured by the evil wizard Blackhorn. Armed with the legendary Fire Axe, Astyanax sets out on a journey to Blackhorn's lair to rescue Rosebud.", "summary": "The Astyanax, referred to as simply Astyanax in the NES version, is a side-scrolling action-adventure game designed by Aicom for arcades and the Nintendo Entertainment System.
