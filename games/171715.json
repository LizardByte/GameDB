Making his way from camp to camp trying to stay alive in order to reach his family but he unknowingly gets closer and closer to the mountain.\n\nAs you play the game, you take the ax in your hands, place the log on the tree stump, and chop it into firewood. Feed the campfire and shelter the rest to save it from the elements but be careful to not overwork yourself. Fatigue can become just as dangerous as the cold.\nDo you have what it takes to survive in the woodlands?
