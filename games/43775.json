This is the fighting game children of Pong can relate to, yet may not hold the attention of the next generation.\n\nVersus: Intense, white knuckle combat. The survivor is awarded a short FMV of their character. Nuff said.", "summary": "A rare find but an absolute treat for the 2D fight fan: manna from heaven for the Monkey fight fan. Featuring some excellent, cheesy FMV complete with suspicious special effects and costumes introducing the nine characters and also awarded for victory in the versus mode.\n\nIn story mode you start off playing as Son Goku (Monkey) with additional defeated characters available for selection on your quest to rescue the priestess and prod around the evil multi limbed demon kidnapper. Gameplay is made more enjoyable down to the simple specials which are more suited to the Playstation controller. And aurally its very enjoyable with some appropriate rock riffs and over the top special effects.
