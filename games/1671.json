Presumed dead and left behind at the dig site, Edge wanted nothing more than to avenge his fallen comrades, and his prayers were answered when he was rescued by the dragon of legend; climbing atop the dragon\u2019s back, Edge set out in search of Craymen, and the truth.", "summary": "Enter the world of Panzer Dragoon Saga and experience a game like no other: a fusion of classic Panzer action with the most technologically advanced RPG to come to Saturn.
