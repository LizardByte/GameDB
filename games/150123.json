A wide variety of battle situations are represented in the game, including firebase defense, helicopter air assaults, meeting engagements, trench defenses, armored breakthroughs, battles of attrition, mobile defenses, search and destroy, and more.\n\nCampaign Series Vietnam introduces a wide variety of new units with special capabilities, such as helicopters, riverine units, tunnel rats, civilians, and supply units. New tactical realities include flight limitations, no-go zones, IEDs and hidden minefields, tunnels, and unconventional warfare.\n\nThe Campaign Series Event Engine has been expanded greatly. The dynamic nature of the Scripted AI offers a completely new experience and challenge when playing against the computer opponent. The Event Points system allows players to collect Victory Points based on completing tasks as opposed to just securing objectives and inflicting casualties.\nThere are four low-complexity Boot Camp scenarios, designed especially with the new player in mind, with step-by-step instructions on how to play. The remaining scenarios vary in size from very brief and just a few units to many dozens of turns and hundreds of units. They can be played against the computer, PBEM, head-to-head, hot-seat, or real-time local area network play.", "summary": "Campaign Series Vietnam is a new turn-based, tactical/operational war game that focuses on mid 20th Century conflicts in Southeast Asia.\nThe series portrays battles spanning from 1948 to 1967. Each scenario is played on a unique, historical map with nine view modes. Scenario maps are based on topographic maps from the period created on a hex grid. Hexes are 250 meters across.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/campaign-series-vietnam", "videos": [{"id": 73795, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "5xnNscEs7RY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnNscEs7RY", "title": "Campaign Series Vietnam 1948-1967 Full Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5xnNscEs7RY/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8181, "name": "Campaign Series"}]}
