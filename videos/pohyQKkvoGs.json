There are two playable character but I've focused mostly on Blazko because he is the only one that has access to heavy weaponry, Rayne unfortunately has only her melee weapon unique. This modification has also TONS of upgrades for each weapon, there are 3 of them for these weapons that are not heavy and they are unique. You can have multiple types of ammunition, different firemodes, silencers, bouncing projectiles, nuclear fallout upon impact, longer range, stun, electric discharges - trust me, it's a lot! The heavy weapons are a little bit different, they cannot be upgraded nor their ammo can be replenished, but their damage is incredible.
