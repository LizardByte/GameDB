At the same time, those fragments can grant a human power strong enough to change the world. Because of this, unprecedented chaos and prosperity enveloped the continent.\n\nThe continent branched off into independently developed regions, from industrial cities to nature-filled woodlands and polluted ruins.\n\nDangerous magical pollution severed the connections between each land, and although intercontinental traffic ceased for a while, adventurers who travel the world in unique \u201cairships\u201d eventually appeared. And just like that, they were known as \u201cBreakers,\u201d adventurers who break the boundaries of the world.\n\nBreakers have one purpose: to reach the Library of God, a place of legend said to have never been reached, where all knowledge before the division is accumulated.\n\nTo achieve their desires and ideals, and each with their own goals in mind, the adventure of the Breakers who aim to reach the Library of God begins.", "summary": "Breakers: Unlock the World is an animation RPG in development for PC and smartphone at Vic Game Studios.
