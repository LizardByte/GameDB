The same concept would later be seen in the Momotaro Thunderbolt games for Game Boy.\n\nMomotaro Katsugeki (\"Momotaro Action Movie\") is a side-scrolling action-platformer from Hudson that uses their Momotaro character who is better known as the star of the Momotaro Dentetsu and Momotaro Densetsu series. It is a PC Engine exclusive and never saw international releases.\n\nMomotaro Katsugeki seems influenced by and plays similarly to Westone's Wonder Boy in Monster Land and the sequels that followed: the goal is to move across a set of 2D stages, and the player can talk to NPCs for hints and to purchase better equipment with the money they find. There is also a world map that links the various stages together.\n\nThe concept of a 2D side-scrolling action game featuring Momotaro would be further explored by Hudson with the two Game Boy Momotaro Dengeki/Thunderbolt games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/momotaro-katsugeki", "collections": [{"id": 3752, "name": "Momotaro Densetsu"}]}
