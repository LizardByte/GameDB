She's made a living so far as a thief, her heightened senses allowing her to easily take advantage of people. She's also seen a lot of the worst of what mankind has to offer.\n\nIt's only after meeting Juliet, the owner of a small library, and Aspen, an aspiring novelist, that Miho starts to understand what kindness is, and that there's more than just the bad stuff when it comes to people.", "summary": "A story of love and friendship, and about understanding not just how to be happy, but how to be human.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/please-be-happy", "videos": [{"id": 50845, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "d10bKHJEBkY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d10bKHJEBkY", "title": "Please Be Happy Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d10bKHJEBkY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
