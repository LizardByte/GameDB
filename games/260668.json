(After all, it has been\u2026 wow, 15 years?) You can think of Kdikdizd as a Doom E1 remake with larger maps and a combined focus on atmosphere, exploration, and tougher combat. Kdikdizd is also packed full of weird mapping tricks and some really dumb joke\ufeffs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knee-deep-in-kdizd"}
