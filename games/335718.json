The gunner has to shoot all the runners before a set amount of seconds while the runners can earn points for every second they are alive. The runners can also pick up items mid game which can help the runners survive longer. Each player does become the gunner at least once. Once all the rounds are finished, the player with the highest number of points wins.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dino-gun", "videos": [{"id": 143248, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "YfsgU67M73Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsgU67M73Q", "title": "Dino Gun Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YfsgU67M73Q/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
