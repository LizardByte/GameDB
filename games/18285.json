One where the fight for survival doesn\u2019t mean food and water, but a purpose for living. Human labour and creativity has been rendered obsolete by AI, so people are now defining themselves by what they consume, not what they create.\n\nCharlie is a lower-class citizen who can\u2019t interface with the systems and augmentations of the world around him, due to an accident during his childhood. He\u2019s a citizen of the thriving metropolis and yet he\u2019ll never be a part of it. Then, a chance encounter offers him the chance to be part of something else and take matters into his own hands.", "summary": "The soul of a cinematic platformer with the heart of a sci-fi thriller, The Last Night is set in a post-cyberpunk world with a deep, vibrant vision of the future.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-night", "videos": [{"id": 12335, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "vZw1WjnIN8M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw1WjnIN8M", "title": "The Last Night Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vZw1WjnIN8M/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 14289, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pupdeq1MoVw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pupdeq1MoVw", "title": "The Last Night - E3 2017 reveal trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pupdeq1MoVw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
