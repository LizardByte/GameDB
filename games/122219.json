The interface even looks like clay. While the main character does not talk, the game includes an off-screen narrator. Most other characters do talk, however. \n \nLike most kids adventure games, there are things to click on but this game has more of an undercurrent of trying to teach and encourages exploring by the acquiring of marbles to play a pachinko game.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ollo-in-the-sunny-valley-fair"}
