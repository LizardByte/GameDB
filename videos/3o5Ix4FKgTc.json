Please enjoy, any comments, questions, concerns, just leave them in the comment section. I'll get to you whenever possible.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n Introducing a Sonic fan game titled Sonic vs Darkness \u2013 True Nightmare Revived created by Nefault1st. Sonic vs Darkness T.N.R. is a remake of my very first Sonic fan game Sonic vs Darkness, which began as a sprite-animated Sonic series project on YouTube. This demo features two playable characters Sonic the Hedgehog and Shadow the Hedgehog, 1 stage inspired by the 1st stage from the original fan game. Like the original version, the gameplay style is inspired by modern Sonic games Sonic Rush and Sonic Unleashed. Including Super Smash Brothers Melee/Brawl (All-Star Mode).
