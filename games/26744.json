The game's characters are trapped within the park, with the outside world being in a post-apocalyptic wasteland infested with murderous monsters. Within the park, the game's thirteen main characters are held captive by a mysterious mechanical doll named \"Alice\", who holds the \"death games\", which basically force the characters against each other for survival - the losers being exiled back out into the world. Alice refuses to stop the games until only two characters are alive and present. The game's protagonist is Kaname Ichijou, a young man who has the ability to see sound as colors and sees spoken falsehoods in the color red. He also harbors a grudge against most of the rest of the characters of the game for allowing the exile of his little sister.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tsuihou-senkyo--1", "videos": [{"id": 11816, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iZ3I51Zxj9o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ3I51Zxj9o", "title": "\u8ffd\u653e\u9078\u6319\u3000\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\uff08OP\u697d\u66f2\uff1aMelody and Flower\uff0f\u9060\u85e4\u3086\u308a\u304b\uff09", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iZ3I51Zxj9o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
