There are currently two distinct game modes in FFR. \u201cClassic Mode\u201d and \u201cRenaissance Mode\u201d.\nClassic Mode is intended as a faithful recreation of the original Final Fantasy gam, but with all known bugs fixed.\nRenaissance Mode is the same core game as Classic Mode, but with a number of new job classes available to choose from, as well as new game mechanics added. The new job classes are all based on job classes introduced in later games in the Final Fantasy series (such as Evoker, Lancer, Blue Mage, and many more).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-renaissance"}
