The game follows standard idle game rules but also incorporates several elements from other types of games into one game. It actually lets you toggle whether you are idle or not - if you aren't idle, not only will you get the rewards from playing whatever part of the active game you're playing, you'll also get more rewards than if you just left it on idle.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anti-idle-the-game"}
