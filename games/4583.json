In this action-adventure game, Zapper (a cricket) hops his way through six interactive worlds in a quest to find his brother, held captive by the evil magpie queen. Dangerous traps and even more dangerous enemies await Zapper. It will take fast-footed skill and timing to conquer all the worlds and survive the final showdown with the magpie queen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zapper-one-wicked-cricket", "videos": [{"id": 36295, "name": "Trailer (German)", "video_id": "KnClP7D3cxU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnClP7D3cxU", "title": "Zapper: One Wicked Cricket!
