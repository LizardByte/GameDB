Our hero Leopold, an intellectual lover of reading, is in his house immersed in reading when he's suddenly catapulted into a whirlwind that transports him back in time, to be precise on the island of Crete outside the royal palace of Minos. Our hero does not have time to settle in when something immediately arouses his attention - a flood of tears that drives him to advance towards a girl, a princess of royal blood and daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten. She was taken prisoner by King Minos and will be fed to the terrible monster, but while she is imprisoned in her room intent on talking with our hero, the latter was taken prisoner by the guards of the king who led him to his presence. The king asked what he was doing at the window in front of the young girl, Leopold replied innocently that she was crying and he was trying to comfort her. The king annoyed by the response warns Leopold that his fate is sealed: he is sentenced to death in the maze guarded by the minotaur, his illegitimate son. Only the symbols of destruction, conservation and regeneration will save him from death if he manages to survive. Thrown into the well of the labyrinth, our hero will land in a place of underground caves and trails here and will face his destiny, ie defeat the Minotaur and save the beautiful Anckesenamon. It's no easy task given that the labyrinth is an infinite set of doors and passages, many of which vary in size and different places, inside and outside the maze. Bringing together a monster, Argo, a guardian of the gods with many eyes we'll have to guess the number, otherwise a lethal jolt of energy that leads us to meet the fearsome monster.", "summary": "Set on the island of Crete, as Mr. Snooze, face the minotaur, escape the maze and save sweet Akhenaten in Dedalus, created by the italian author Ivan Venturi.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dedalus"}
