Despite having the same title, each is actually a different game. The NES title is arguably the best known and contains five levels culminating in a final showdown with the Joker in the bell tower of Gotham Cathedral. It was received well despite changes from the movie upon which it was based.\n\nSunsoft later released Batman: Return of the Joker as a follow-up which is not related to any movie.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-the-video-game--2", "videos": [{"id": 104790, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "sJ8i5WC70F8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ8i5WC70F8", "title": "Batman (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJ8i5WC70F8/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
