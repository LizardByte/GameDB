{"id": "g4FDPaEi-yw", "snippet": {"title": "Lost Ruins - Official Release Trailer \uff5c PC", "description": "Lost Ruins is a 2D side-scrolling survival action game, where you play as a young girl that has awoken in a strange and foreign place without her memories. Explore a dark and dangerous world, battle hideous monsters, and topple incredible bosses.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1306630/Lost_Ruins/\n\nSTORY\nA young girl wakes up in a dimly lit dungeon without any of her memories. Surrounded by horrible, bloodthirsty monsters, she is rescued by a mysterious magician, Beatrice. With the help of Beatrice, the girl goes on a perilous journey to find answers and unlock the secrets of the Lost Ruins.\n\n\n-Engage in Combat-\nCombat in Lost Ruins is in real time, and can be both fast and methodical. Slash away at enemies up close, burn them to a crisp with magic, or fire a bow from afar and even deflect their projectiles back at them. Players must arm themselves with a variety of swords, axes and other assorted medieval weaponry, and hack monsters to pieces.\n\n-Master Spells-\nFor those with an affinity for magic, Lost Ruins allows players to cast a wide variety of spells through wands, tonics, and scrolls. Electrify monsters in water, freeze bosses, or heal yourself when in danger. Players can assign slots and choose what works best for their playstyle and approach.\n\n-Choose Your Accessories-\nThe world of Lost Ruins is a dangerous one and being armed to the teeth with awesome weaponry is sometimes not enough. Accessories are unique pieces of equipment with all manner of effects -- one accessory might protect you against fire, while another might heal you when in water. Finding the right combination of accessories for the right encounter creates strategic options for the adventure.\n\n-Make Use of the Environment-\nAs players explore the depths of Lost Ruin\u2019s dungeons, they will find that everything around them might bring about death -- or they can also use the environment to their advantage. Elements within the world react with other elements. Flammable liquids will be set ablaze when in contact with lit lanterns. Ice magic will freeze bodies of water, making them dangerously cold. The more players understand the environment and how to use it to their advantage, the more dangerous they will become.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4FDPaEi-yw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4FDPaEi-yw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4FDPaEi-yw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4FDPaEi-yw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g4FDPaEi-yw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lost Ruins - Official Release Trailer \uff5c PC", "description": "Lost Ruins is a 2D side-scrolling survival action game, where you play as a young girl that has awoken in a strange and foreign place without her memories.
