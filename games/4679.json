Mini games help the animal to survive as they hunt for food, fight off predators and adapt to their environment.\n\nFeatures National Geographic information and presentation style which is not only educational, but will help you to work through the game. Throughout the game, situations events, warnings and educational information will be presented by the game's narrator.
