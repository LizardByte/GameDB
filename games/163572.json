After the battle, people built a shrine to protect it. Several years later, princess Zelda noticed that Vaati might have escaped from the blade of the Four Sword and asked Link to come to the Four Sword shrine to check with her. As soon as they came there, Vaati captured Zelda and carried her away. Some little fairies later told Link that princess Zelda was at Vaati's palace up on the sky. In an attempt to recuse Zelda, Link dragged the Four Sword and it created three more Links! The Links then began their adventure to save Zelda.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords is a multiplayer game in the Zelda series originally released together with The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Game Boy Advance. The game has many features not seen in the series and it requires at least two people to play and uses randomly generated dungeons. During the game, players must collect as many Ruppees as possible while solving puzzles and defeating enemies. When enough Ruppees are collected, the Great Fairy will give the players a key to open the unlockable level. At the end of each level, the one who collects the most Ruppees will be the winner.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
