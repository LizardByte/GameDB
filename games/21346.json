Locales, vehicles and weapons have the same look and feel of the classic battleships and planes, but the battles over the Pacific were never this hot or this insane -- your single fighter will turn the tides of history, but only if you survive!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/1942-joint-strike"}
