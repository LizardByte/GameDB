The game will be available for Xbox One, PS4 and Windows PC via the Epic Games store when it launches later this year.\n\nTo keep up with the latest updates from The Eternal Cylinder and sign up to be eligible for the upcoming closed Beta, please visit http://www.eternalcylinder.com \n\nIn The Eternal Cylinder, players control a herd of adorable creatures called Trebhums. You must explore a strange alien world filled with exotic lifeforms, surreal environments, and the constant threat of the Cylinder, a gargantuan rolling structure of ancient origin which crushes everything in its path. This unique ecosystem is a massive, procedurally generated land with  real-time world destruction and organic exploration.\n\nYour Trebhums begin at the bottom of the natural food chain but can mutate and evolve with new physical attributes and abilities by eating a variety of flora and fauna. Discover and adapt dozens of mutations, including new traversal skills like flying and swimming to reach new areas, and new senses to help overcome puzzles, challenges and dangers. Your many Trebhums can each have different mutations, and new mutations don\u2019t replace ones you already have, letting you stack ability sets in dynamic ways. Each mutation will also change the physical look of a Trebhum and stacking these will generate near countless surprising new creature designs which players will be able to organically discover as they explore this unique alien ecosystem.\n\nSubscribe now and activate the bell \u27a4 http://bit.ly/1pMsoAA |  | Thank You for every Like, Share, and Comment! \n\nThe currently most popular games \u27a4 http://amzn.to/2mbWxxO\nThe most requested games \u27a4 http://amzn.to/2mcaLP4\nThe best reduced game offers \u27a4 http://amzn.to/2mbQCss\n\nNOTE: These mentioned companies in the video have approved courtesy these audio-visual content on XboxViewTV. | All Rights Reserved. | http://amzn.to are affiliate links.
