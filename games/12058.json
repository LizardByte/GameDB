The interaction is performed either by typing text commands or by selecting verbs bound to function keys. Among those verbs are traditional \"Look\", \"Talk\", as well as the more unorthodox commands such as \"Buy\" or \"Hit\".", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dream-zone"}
