One of the most important aspects of professional basketball is being able to drive to the lane and have a player make it look like he's going up for a shot so that he can draw defense, but then pass the ball to an open man on the inside or to a wide-open player out on the perimeter. Indeed, generally driving through the lane can be a little problematic since the AI tends to latch onto players in the paint, and the juke moves can be difficult to use effectively against tough opponents.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-inside-drive-2003", "collections": [{"id": 4959, "name": "NBA Inside Drive"}]}
