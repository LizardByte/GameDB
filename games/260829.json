Probably noticable by the Rewritten at the end of the name, this hack is a remake of SR4. 95% of the levels were made with completely new level models, which were made with the original design of the levels in mind to improve upon them.\n\nThis hack has 100 stars and is made in the open world style, which means that you access very few levels via an overworld and rather go from level to level via entrances in the levels itself. There is still an overworld which acts as a place for shortcuts to later levels if a game over happens.\n\nYou can find 15 new main courses and some side levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-revenge-4-dot-5-the-kedama-takeover-rewritten"}
