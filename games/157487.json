There are 2 modes of play, in Eco-system mode you start with a limited range of resources that can be placed in your world. As you play it your own music the world will react and evolve. Dependent on what you have added and the music you play, different creatures will be attracted to feed, breed or take shelter. The more that you attract the more resources you will be able to add. Can you create the perfect system or will it be a natural disaster?\n\nIn Creative-system mode there are no limitations. Build a world and play it music, make your own music visualizer, build a scene for a music video or create a set to stream to the world.\n\nWhat will your music attract?", "summary": "Just Add Noise is an audio reactive sandbox world builder.
