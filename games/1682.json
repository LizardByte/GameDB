Players guide the rag-tag bunch of heroes through a 3D world full of adventure and combat. While jumping, sliding, and stomping through the environment to complete the main objective, gamers can also engage in mini-games and side quests for money and rare items. Although the story revolves around new characters, the HEX battle system returns and several known avatars make cameo appearances during the game. Duel-pistol wielding skills make their debut in Wild Arms 5, and allow gamers to shoot different bullets that solve puzzles located throughout the adventure.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wild-arms-5"}
