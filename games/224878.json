The player begins at the destroyed Icon of Sin site and retraces their steps through the Hell levels, city levels and finally the starport levels, while facing increasingly heavy demonic opposition and changed, mostly destroyed and twisted architecture heavily reminiscent of the original layouts.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-long-trek-back-home"}
