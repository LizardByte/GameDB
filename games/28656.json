As hardcore as Thornyway band that made it. Don't even think of solving its riddles. No one will tell you where to go or even how to run or jump. There are no enemies in this game except yourself. Most players couldn't even get out of the first dungeon. The aim of the game is to get Thornyway's album, but you won't get it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/thornyway"}
