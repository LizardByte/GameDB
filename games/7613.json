To buoy up, the colony pursues more and more influence in the town and doesn\u2019t shirk from ruthless means.\n\nThe 20-year-old Adelaide Spektor feels threatened by this menace. Adelaide was still a child when she was left by her father, the famous detective Karol Spektor. Since then, she is hiding on the town\u2019s streets and lives in fear to be discovered by the colony and to get swept up in a life of crime, contrary to the morals of her family. When she witnesses the murder of her father\u2019s old friend, she sees her chance to find Karol Spektor and reclaim her former place in society. But only the notorious colonist and double murderer Emily can help take up Adelaide\u2019s father\u2019s trail.
