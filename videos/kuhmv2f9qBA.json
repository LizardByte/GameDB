She's a dual-wielding, lightning fast sword dancer and also happens to be our leading lady! So please check out the new gameplay on offer and let us know what you think in the comments below.\n\nA strategic dungeon crawler that rewards character switching, elemental counters and crowd control, MetaMorph challenges you to best a series of increasingly difficult dungeons filled with fire imps, vengeful wisps and hulking golems. Solve the \u2018puzzle\u2019 of each encounter by choosing which spirit forms to take into battle and morph between them at will to counter enemies of all shapes and sizes. Plan your attack and react on the fly as you combine strategy with twitch skills to decimate opponents and reclaim your land from the Lords of Death.\n\nAn original title developed by a small internal team at Firefly, MetaMorph: Dungeon Creatures is our first ever action game. Sharing strategy DNA with the Stronghold series of \u2018castle sim\u2019 games, MetaMorph is also our first ever release on Early Access! We'll be working alongside our core community (That's you!) to develop a fun action-strategy game for both Stronghold fans and Early Access gamers on Steam.\n\nLike - http://bit.ly/FFfbook\nFollow - http://bit.ly/ffstwitter\nSubscribe - http://bit.ly/fftubesub", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kuhmv2f9qBA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kuhmv2f9qBA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kuhmv2f9qBA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kuhmv2f9qBA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kuhmv2f9qBA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "MetaMorph: Dungeon Creatures - Rabbit Hero Trailer", "description": "Wishlist MetaMorph on Steam - http://bit.ly/mmdungeon\n\nWe're gearing up for the Early Access release of our new tactical dungeon-crawler by releasing our first character trailer! \u2018Meet the Rabbit\u2019 introduces the game\u2019s main character, a ferocious anthropomorphic warrior rabbit with a split personality and the ability to morph between the physical forms of fallen heroes.
