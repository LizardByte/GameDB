Each level is a screen with simple graphics, where the objective is to shoot humanoid stick figures from a cannon towards the switch, usually a box with the words \"HERE\". Many obstacles are in the way, like ropes, bricks and boulders that react with each doll impact in the simulated physics model. Swirling portals transport the flying figures to another point in the screen. There's no limit of time or to the number of shots available.\n\nThe full version has 150 levels (20 in the shareware version) and three additional music tracks.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ragdoll-cannon", "videos": [{"id": 126128, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2Wle9GdnFgk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wle9GdnFgk", "title": "Ragdoll Cannon PC Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Wle9GdnFgk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
