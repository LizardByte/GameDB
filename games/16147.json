Armed with the most up to date combat equipment, the SpecForce field agents are equipped for any situation.\n\nYou are Logan, a member of the elite SpecForce military unit. Your mission - to battle terrorist factions on the desolate planet of Estrella! But things turn from bad to worse when the local conflict escalates to pan galactic proportions... and you're in the middle of it all!", "summary": "Chrome: SpecForce is a standalone expansion pack for Chrome. The gameplay in Chrome: SpecForce is largely identical to that of Chrome, although it has been streamlined, while the overall difficulty has also been lowered. The player can survive significantly more damage (ostensibly due to wearing Power Armor), healing and ammo items are more common-place, and the control scheme has been condensed so as to require fewer separate commands.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chrome-specforce--1", "videos": [{"id": 64490, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "523aV-HJWvM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=523aV-HJWvM", "title": "Chrome Specforce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/523aV-HJWvM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
