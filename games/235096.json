Mana flows freely, even within its inhabitants, enabling them to utilize the power of all the elements around them. The primary elements which govern the day to day aspects of life and all things good, coupled with the revered and mighty cosmic elements that control the quintessential aspects of existence, enrich their everyday lives. Mankind was able to live peacefully under the First Gods, the very beings created by the Heavenly Emissaries, who created and formed the mighty seven nations we know of today.\n\nTemeris flourished under the harmonious relationships between First Gods and their creations for centuries until each nation and their respective gods had their disagreements. The balance of things soon came asunder as mankind rebelled against the First Gods. Ultimately this leads to the First Gods leaving their creations behind. Thus as mankind liberated themselves from their influence, they seek to forge their own path ahead; to create a world governed by the deeds and exploits of humans instead of that of the heavens.\n\nUnfortunately mankind cannot revel in their freedom and power for long, as an unknown threat known as the Mist appears. A concentrated Nox phenomenon, containing a terrible darkness and untold danger. It spawns deadly threats known by many as the Dread, abominable creatures that consume all living things for no clear reason at all. From this conflict, a renown Lord from the land of Arriane formed the Evermore Kingdom and in turn established the Evermore Knights. It is a collective group of heroes all fighting under one banner. They seek nothing but to maintain peace across all the seven nations.\n\nYou, the player, are a commissioner working and fighting alongside the Evermore Knights. Commissioners are a renowned force to be reckoned with as they are able to endow all heroes with mana. You are tasked to face the Mist and the threats it presents. However, early in your investigation you are thrown into the fray as the Mist begins to rapidly spread across the battlefield. In the confusion, a strange light speaks to you, as you then start to recollect odd memories, changing the very way you see the world. Perhaps there is a grander purpose in store for you, but you can only wait to find out.\nEmbark on a journey across Temeris, uncover the secrets of the world, meet new allies and fight against the all consuming darkness.\n\nWelcome to Evermore Knights.", "summary": "Welcome, Knights of Evermore!\n\nEvermore Knights is a turn-based JRPG that follows the story of a Commissioner tasked with uncovering the source of the mysterious force known as \"Dread\" plaguing the land of Temeris.
