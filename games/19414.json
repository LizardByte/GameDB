The money raised can then go on towards the purchase of items for your mech. Weapon upgrades, better shields, even the opportunity to purchase what's called an Exceed Orbit, smaller robot gun emplacements that hover around your mech, giving you an added boost of fire power in the crunch.\n\n4 player deathmatch modes are also included, where you each pit your supped-up mechs against each other to see who is the last robot standing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
