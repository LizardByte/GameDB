The arenas are cities with buildings, ramps and streets. The mouse is not supported, the game is either played with the keyboard or a joystick.\n\nThe editor allows to build own areas which can be played with other paying customers when the developer approves them. Yes, to play the game there is a monthly fee which has to payed. However there is also a free version which offers two arenas and one tank.", "summary": "Tanarus is an online exclusive action game with tanks. Before the game starts the player has to choose a difficulty setting which affects the available arenas and his human opponents. Then there is the selection of the tank; there are five tanks to choose which differ in speed, armory and weaponry. The last decision to be made is the equipment like canons, rocket launchers or energy guns. The most important choice is the battery because every laser shot and every movement lowers its charge. When the charge is consumed the tank moves with 30% of its normal speed. At the own base serves as a maintenance area, which means the tank can be repaired or completely replaced and the battery can be replenished.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tanarus", "videos": [{"id": 136545, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lK6qdgUTLxw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK6qdgUTLxw", "title": "Tanarus lighting vs lighting and magrider", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lK6qdgUTLxw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
