The first four ultimately connect together towards solving the 5th. Your co-workers are characters from the CSI television series and voice acting is done by the real actors and actresses from the show.\n\nChoose one of 3 levels of difficulty depending upon how familiar you are with the tv shows (and computer gaming in general). Those modes affect how much interactive help you receive inside the game - not from your co-workers, but by way of hotspots and evidence analysis. The game features a tutorial to help with the interface, which is point and click.", "videos": [{"id": 27242, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "zrsWIHZo4Vo"}, {"id": 27243, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "LwlnJfEa7Y8"}]}
