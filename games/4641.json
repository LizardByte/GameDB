Each side called upon powers both arcane and divine, summoning Gods and other beings of immense power, whose contest ultimately destroyed both sides. Cities of the once glorious Empire lay in ruin, and bodies of the dead were strewn across the land. Centuries later, the world still suffers from the shadow of civilization's collapse. Where there once was unity, there are now factions struggling for dominance in the ruined world. Where there was once knowledge, there is ignorance of both science and magic. Where there was once chivalry and honor, there is only pettiness and betrayal. And it is in this uneasy divided land of myth and fable that the player discovers an ancient map offering a hint to the Empire's true past.\nThe player's character has an active role in shaping the plot of AoD, which is nonlinear. The world reacts dynamically to the player's actions. Players can choose from among 7 factions, play them off against each other, or even reject them all. The game is purported to have seven endings, only two of which involve mortal combat.", "summary": "The Age of Decadence is an upcoming pseudo-isometric 3D turn-based role-playing video game for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux by Iron Tower Studio, led by the pseudonymous \"Vince D. Weller\".
