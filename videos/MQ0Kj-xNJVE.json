{"id": "MQ0Kj-xNJVE", "snippet": {"title": "The Sorrowvirus - A Faceless Short Story Trailer", "description": "Free for a limited time, The Sorrowvirus has progressed from a tech demo into a Short Story, and that short story is finally coming out on the 28th February 2019.\n\nWe've remade our trailer once already, but now it's been remade once more to fit the latest visuals. The Sorrowvirus is a supernatural mystery that is loosely connected to Faceless as a whole. Each Short Story for Faceless will explore a different gameplay genre, with The Sorrowvirus being a First Person Story Adventure.\n\nThank you all for your patience so far, and for your impatience also. It's been a long road so far, and we still have a much longer road ahead of us to bring the rest of Faceless to you, but rest assured, we will do so.\n\n\u25ba Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/243240\n\u25ba Facebook: https://facebook.com/FacelessVG/\n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/FacelessVG\n\u25ba Instagram: http://instagram.com/facelessvg\n\u25ba IndieDB: http://indiedb.com/games/faceless", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MQ0Kj-xNJVE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MQ0Kj-xNJVE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MQ0Kj-xNJVE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MQ0Kj-xNJVE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MQ0Kj-xNJVE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Sorrowvirus - A Faceless Short Story Trailer", "description": "Free for a limited time, The Sorrowvirus has progressed from a tech demo into a Short Story, and that short story is finally coming out on the 28th February 2019.\n\nWe've remade our trailer once already, but now it's been remade once more to fit the latest visuals.
