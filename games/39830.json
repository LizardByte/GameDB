And to top that, you have plenty of new moves, counterattacks, powerups, and key combinations to use.\n\nWhereas Cotton 2 was more of a tactical shooter (whenever that is applicable to the game) with its chain combo and life/experience system, Cotton Boomerang is an all-out shooter due to the added moves, different level layout, and generally faster and crazier gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cotton-boomerang", "videos": [{"id": 87968, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9PuwkxgEHUM"}]}
