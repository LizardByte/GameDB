Joined at the waist, you and your partner share a long, wriggling body as you wrestle your opponents for control of the ball. Since you're sharing the same body, you'll need to carefully communicate (or just shout a lot). With every action affecting both you and your partner, PMPY combines the best parts of co-op multiplayer with the worst parts of your last breakup.\n\n- Frantic local multiplayer gameplay in the vein of Sportsfriends or Towerfall.\n- Compete in multiple game types that will test your friendship in different ways, or play around in a sandbox area filled with toys and secrets.\n- Low on controllers? Share a controller with a friend or try controlling two heads simultaneously - a two-player game can be played with just one controller!\n- Accessible yet deep - play it as a noisy party game or hold a fiercely competitive grudge match.\n\nHouse House is a four-person studio based in Melbourne, Australia - http://househou.se/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmbNJETkbw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmbNJETkbw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmbNJETkbw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmbNJETkbw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ztmbNJETkbw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Push Me Pull You - Launch Trailer", "description": "Push Me Pull You is out now on PC/Mac/Linux and PS4!\n\nhttp://pmpygame.com/\n\nPush Me Pull You is an award-winning local multiplayer game about friendship and wrestling.
