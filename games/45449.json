Depending on how you do, you unlock various scenes/events throughout the game and maybe get a happy ending with the girl of your dreams. Along the way, you'll also be juggling your unsuspecting family and friends, including a real life female classmate who might turn out to be a love interest as well if you play your cards right.", "summary": "6inch My Darling is a visual novel romance adventure originally released by KID for Sega Saturn with free for all rating, thus not including adult content.
