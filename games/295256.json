It is a remake of Nuketown which first appeared in Call of Duty: Black Ops. While the original Nuketown went for more of a traditional 1950s theme, the new map is now in a 1960s retro-futuristic Mid-Century modern style meant to represent the \"Home of the Future\" for 2025.\n\nIt was available for free to anyone who pre-ordered the game, purchased a launch copy, or purchased the Hardened edition or the \"Care Package\" limited special edition of the game. It was later made available to download for free to everyone as well as being included in an update for Call of Duty: Black Ops II on Wii U.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii-nuketown-2025", "videos": [{"id": 110532, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "XBTVkIxSx5o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBTVkIxSx5o", "title": "Welcome to Nuketown 2025 - Official Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBTVkIxSx5o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
