stormy night in Donkey Kong Island, Diddy Kong, Donkey Kong's nephew has taken the weighty responsibility of guarding DK's precious banana hoard for one night, as a part of his \"hero training\". DK entrusts Diddy with protecting the hoard until midnight, when he would be relieved, while DK himself goes to sleep as he is tired.\n\nEverything seems to go smoothly in the hoard until Diddy hears some noises. Diddy hears some voices outside and gets scared, asking who's there. King K. Rool, who had commanded his Kremling minions to steal the bananas. Two ropes drop from above and suddenly two Kritters appear. Diddy cartwheels them both easily, but then a Krusha (Klump in the instruction booklet) comes in as backup. As Diddy is not strong enough to defeat Krusha by himself, he is overpowered and defeated by the Kremling. The lizars seal Diddy inside a barrel and then throw it in the bushes.\nDonkey's grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave. Donkey Kong is infuriated, exclaiming that the Kremlings will pay for stealing his banana hoard and kidnapping his little buddy. Donkey goes on to say that he will hunt every corner of the island for his bananas back.", "summary": "Donkey Kong Country is a side scrolling platformer by British developers Rare in 1994. It featured revolutionary pre-rendered 3D graphics that give the game a very unique look compared to most other games on consoles at the time. The two playable characters featured in the game are the titular character, Donkey Kong and his nephew, Diddy Kong. Together the two swing, climb, jump, swim, cartwheel, ride animals, and blast out of barrels on their way to recover their stolen bannanas from the evil King K. Rool and his Kremling army. The adventure takes you through a variety of different environments and levels that continually change up gameplay. Donkey Kong Country also provides plenty of opportunities for exploration with almost every level having a multitude of collectible, shortcuts, and hidden bonus areas.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/donkey-kong-country", "videos": [{"id": 31634, "name": "Longplay", "video_id": "bXHDSA35_2k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXHDSA35_2k", "title": "Donkey Kong Country - Full Game 101% Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bXHDSA35_2k/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 60123, "name": "TV commercial", "video_id": "SbHL8-XkXMA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbHL8-XkXMA", "title": "Donkey Kong Country - SNES Commercial US (3)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SbHL8-XkXMA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62125, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "d4EUEsEM328", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EUEsEM328", "title": "SNES Longplay - Donkey Kong Country", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d4EUEsEM328/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
