Each level is a single screen. The first image that the player sees is a landscape, for example, a forest or a town. The image will then fade into a \"corrupt\" version of the landscape, for example, the trees become rotten and buildings become ruined. Each screen has a \"Qualify\" target that shows how much of the screen must be cleared before the game continues to the next level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cacoma-knight-in-bizyland"}
