{"id": "55nxYkuGggw", "snippet": {"title": "Executioners", "description": "\"MIDGET POWER!!\" Executioners is a 1992 scrolling beat-em-up for DOS that's straight off the pages of schoolboy exercise books, doesn't take itself seriously in any way, and is surprising fun to play. The designers have clearly injected the maximum amount of awesome into every aspect of the game - awesome characters, awesome blood, awesome explosions, awesome jokes, awesome guns, awesome midgets... well, it's just awesome. If you can find it, pick it up - Executioners is great for a laugh.\n\nBTW I'm playing both Executioners simultaneously here, and yes, I totally suck at any kind of fighting game.. :P\n\nThe full version of Executioners can be now be downloaded for free, direct from Bloodlust Software at http://www.bloodlustsoftware.com/executioners.html\n\nYou'll probably need the excellent DOSBox DOS emulator to run it as it was intended.
