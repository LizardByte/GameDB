It is played over 5 levels, each with 5 sub-levels and an end-of-level super invader. \n \nThere are four difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced, and a custom level. The custom level allows you to change various aspects of the game to suit your skill level. Extra bombs, lives and weapons continually fall during the game to assist you in the destruction of the invaders. The question is, are you able to complete all 5 levels on the Advanced difficulty setting?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/javaders"}
