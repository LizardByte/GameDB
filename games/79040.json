The cabinet consists of a woodgrain 35\" x 37\" cocktail cabinet. Two control paddles are mounted on each side of the cabinet, with a horizontally mounted Zenith television diagonally set in the cabinet.\n\nTwo, three, or four players move their paddles to defend their goal area, consisting of openings in the players' walls. Each player starts with four points, and loses one point each time the ball penetrates their goal. If all four points are lost the player's paddle is removed and the goal \"closes\", creating a solid wall and removing the player from the game. The game continues until only one player is left.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quadrapong", "videos": [{"id": 104532, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0kIzedMXvvI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kIzedMXvvI", "title": "Arcade Game: Quadra Pong (1974 Atari)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0kIzedMXvvI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
