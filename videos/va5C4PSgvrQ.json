AWESOME!!!  Classic Game Room breaks out the calculator for Basic Math for the Atari 2600.  All the fun of math with none of the hassles of school.  Basic Math is like the great grandfather to the Leapfrog educational video game system.  Children can learn from this game, it is a children's game (sort of)!   In this game... if you can call it a game... you add and subtract under the intense pressure of a timer.  You could cheat and use an abacus to solve these complex equations though, the Atari would be none the wiser.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360. Xbox Live Arcade XBLA. Problem solving.
