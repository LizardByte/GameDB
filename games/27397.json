Three difficulty levels Easy, Hard and Special are available. Players are able to choose difficulty levels according to their skill so they may enjoy all pieces.", "videos": [{"id": 12342, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "Bh6gQyJHbxI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh6gQyJHbxI", "title": "\u300aVOEZ\u300bTeaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bh6gQyJHbxI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12343, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "cInSMLRcvKo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cInSMLRcvKo", "title": "\u300aVOEZ\u300bGameplay Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cInSMLRcvKo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 12385, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5OhOUAMmiLY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OhOUAMmiLY", "title": "\u3010Nintendo Switch\u3011VOEZ \u30c6\u30a3\u30b6\u30fc\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5OhOUAMmiLY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
