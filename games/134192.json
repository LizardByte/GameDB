Leaving no room for agency.\n\nThe black circle came about as a means for the player to regain space. The soundscape came about in order to give more dimension to the feelings that the visuals were already evoking.\n\nMonad is made with L\u00d6VE, with help and support from that community as well as Louisville Makes Games. It was first exhibited at the Indie Games and Art Social during the AIGA Design week in September 2018.\n\nMonad was recently presented at Bit Bash 2019 at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, and won first place in the \"Physical Interactive Art\" category at the Kentucky State Fair's Design Web Digital and Interactive Art exhibit.\n\nMonad was most recently presented at EGX 2019 as part of the Leftfield Collection.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monad", "videos": [{"id": 36413, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7-NrV1mk0K0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-NrV1mk0K0", "title": "monad gameplay - stereo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7-NrV1mk0K0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
