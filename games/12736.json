Released exclusively in Japan in 2014 for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, it is a spin-off of the Yakuza series, set during the Bakumatsu period of late Edo-era Japan (mid-1800s).\n\nThe game follows Sakamoto Ryoma, a samurai modeled after series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, as he becomes embroiled in political turmoil and seeks revenge for his mentor's assassination. The gameplay combines the brawler-style combat of the main Yakuza series with swordplay and gunfighting mechanics. Players can engage in the main story, participate in side activities, and explore the historical setting of Kyo (based on Kyoto).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ryuu-ga-gotoku-ishin", "videos": [{"id": 22132, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bl-03bcYpas", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl-03bcYpas", "title": "PS4 Ryu ga Gotoku Yakuza Ishin!
