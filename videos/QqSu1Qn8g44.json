Will you make it through the gleaming crystal caves, and through the swarms of enemies inside?

Two different caves with their own diverse cast of enemies and loot can be explored, but many more caves are planned too - alongside a lot more weapons, enemies, aspects, and systems. The aim of the finished game is replayability - no two playthroughs will be the same.\n\nWill you make it through the dungeon and collect all the aspects?\n\nOne year after the 6th devlog, after 2 years in development, Aspect is now on steam!
