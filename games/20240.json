Gamers big and small will get up off the couch and twist, shimmy and shake to 30 songs sung by Nickelodeon friends including theme songs and Nickelodeon hits like \\\"We Did It,\\\" \\\"Al Rescate,\\\" and \\\"Here We Go.\\\" In addition, popular favorites like \\\"Dancing In the Street,\\\" \\\"We got the Beat\\\" and \\\"Rhythm is Gonna Get You\\\" ensure fun for the entire family. Parents focused on increasing their child\\'s physical activity will appreciate the workout feature which promotes heart healthy activity as kids ratchet up the dance action and are graded for their accuracy as they dance with the Nickelodeon gang. And since nobody wants to dance alone, Nickelodeon Dance supports two players on every song, with song lyrics posted at the bottom of the screen along with easy-to-follow visual oriented dance move prompts that players duplicate with their bodies using the Kinect Sensor for Xbox 360.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nickelodeon-dance"}
