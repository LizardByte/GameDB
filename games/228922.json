Our tale takes place generations later in the capital of that fair realm, Lithmore City, where the Church dominates the land whilst mages hide beneath their very noses. In general, the theme is about secrecy, conspiracy, oppression, corruption, and the true definition of evil. We invite you to imagine the horrors of our historical Inquisition with one twist: magic is real. But are mages truly evil? Is the Church really kind? It\u2019s up to you as a player to decide.", "summary": "A free, multiplayer Multi-Used Dungeon (MUD) revolving around medieval religious oppression and the fight against magic in a fantasy world.
