She's looking for a new game master to run her shiny new escape room. Alas, during your introduction you've become trapped inside.\n\nEdaqa's Room is all about puzzles. Search the environment for clues and objects. Turn up the brain power to work through logic logic puzzles. Press buttons, play with plush toys, and have fun! I even built-in a hint system to keep you moving when my design brainwaves don't align with yours.\n\nThis web game is built for multiplayer. Multiple people, I recommend 2-4, enter the same room from their own system.
