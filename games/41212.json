As if that's not enough, the owners of this maze pit you against a friend to see who will escape first. And then the diabolical owners take it one step further and add a cat to the maze mix - forcing you not only to escape first, but escape alive! \n \nIn this Videocart \nMaze: A straight maze run. \nJailbreak: The maze is a grid with hidden passages. \nBlind-man's-bluff: The maze is invisible and no walls can ever be seen. \nTrailblazer: The maze is invisible but the rats leave a trail on their path. \n \nThere are also a few game modes: \nRegular Maze: Two players race each other out of the maze. \nCat and Mouse: The computer controls a cat that chases the mice. There are 4 different speeds for the cat. \nParanoia: Neither mouse can leave the maze until the other one is caught by the cat. \nDouble Paranoia: There's no cat and neither mouse can leave the maze, allowing the players to practice or experiment play modes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 16053, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "ZTWCLs50p0Y"}, {"id": 16078, "name": "VR", "video_id": "GwENgGGdQPE"}]}
