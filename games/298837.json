The story is the original version of the NDS version. The game system also uses NDS's unique functions, and improvements have been made, such as touching the face of the person you want to talk to, and displaying different information on the upper and lower screens.\n\nThe player becomes the scenario writer Masao Ikurumi, and challenges to solve the difficult case with Itsuna Shirasagisu, who works as an assistant under the detective Ryosuke Kibukawa. This time, it seems that we will investigate an incident that occurs in a port town, but the detailed story has not been revealed.\n\nCompared to mobile apps, the operability of NDS has been greatly improved. In addition, it has been released from capacity constraints, and the quality of the graphics has also been greatly improved. It is the first title to be released on a consumer game console, but I also want to pay attention to its high quality.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tantei-kibukawa-ryousuke-jiken-tan-kamen-genei-satsujin-jiken"}
