Having devoted his life to running his hotel, he never made time for family or friends. With no obvious heir, he's hired you to help him choose the right person to inherit the Bellflower. He narrowed his list of candidates down to a small group of people who have strong personal connections to the hotel, but whom he knows little else about. They've agreed to be interviewed by you under the pretense that you're writing a book about the Bellflower Hotel. None of them know what's truly at stake. It's up to you to get to know these people and determine which of them is most worthy of inheriting the Bellflower. This will be no easy task, as the group contains some unique and memorable characters who will make your decision quite difficult. Be careful though, as there may be more to some than meets the eye.\n\nInterview unique and memorable characters through interactive conversations to determine who is best suited to inherit the resort. Ask them questions and follow up by asking about any topics they mention by selecting the topics from a list.", "summary": "A wealthy resort owner is dying and needs you to help him decide who should inherit his estate.
