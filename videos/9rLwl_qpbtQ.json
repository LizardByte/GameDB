The camera is very simple, with one-button operation and, for at least one test family, an easy connection to the computer. Girls can take up to six pictures away from the computer and more if they are connected. No film is required. Instead, after the software is installed, the pictures are uploaded to the computer and saved in a scrapbook, placed into photos along side Barbie, or edited with some basic photo effects. These special effects are very limited. Also, the quality of the pictures is grainy, and there is no flash for night-time photography. Our testers were initially excited about the product, but were disappointed in the end results. Out of the box experience : New Jersey Testers The kids wanted to get started taking pictures right away, so, using a one-month old Packard Bell Multimedia 830 computer, we installed the software (it took 30 MB of hard disk space) and tried to upload some pictures. No luck. After struggling through the documentation for 20 minutes, we finally found info about three menus deep in the software that told us we needed to plug the camera into our COM2 port. To do this, we'd need a converter plug, which wasn't included. So, we installed the camera instead on a two-year-old Gateway Destination (D5-200). This time, the pictures in the camera were imported with no problem, showing up as little thumbnails in Barbie's scrapbook. Weaknesses: The sugary sweet narration is unnecessary, and the software design is clunky and slow. Fortunately, it is simple, so it is easy to figure out.\n\nAge Range: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \nCopyright \u00a9 2000 Children's Software Revue - From Children's Software Revue\nASIN B00000JLR6\nRelease date September 30, 1998\nManufacturer Mattel Media\n\n-- Timestamps --\n0:00 Video intro\n0:15 Game intro\n2:37 Help pages\n31:12 World of Barbie\n40:19 Scrapbook\n42:32 Fun Effects\n43:33 Digital Flipbook\n45:59 Photo tips\n46:38 Exit game\n46:51 Video outro\n\n-- Settings and application information --\nUsed emulator: PCem v16 \nCPU: Pentium MMX 233\nOS: Windows 98 Second Edition\nScreen resolution: 640x480\nOutput scaling: 2x\nScaling: Integer scaling / Nearest\n\n\n\n\n#Barbie #Nostalgia #Children #90s\n\n \u00a0 --\nWebsite: https://www.nostalgiarealm.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9rLwl_qpbtQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9rLwl_qpbtQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9rLwl_qpbtQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9rLwl_qpbtQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Barbie Photo Designer (1998, PC) -  Digital Camera and CD-ROM", "description": "Barbie Photo Designer is a 1998 Digital Camera and CD-ROM game that allowed children to take pictures and instantly edit them.
