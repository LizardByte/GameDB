Malevolent aliens have infected the human organism in a most treacherous way possible, turning young and pretty women into rampaging, violent nymphomaniacs. Only one person can stop the insanity - the attractive secret agent with the codename Lyew\u00e4rd. Guerri\u00e8re Lyew\u00e4rd is a side-scrolling beat-em-up. The gameplay is very simple: the player moves the protagonist through strictly linear stages from left to right, each containing a few types of female enemies that attack the heroine from both sides. The secret agent can punch, kick, and jump. Power-ups such as health-restoring hearts and invincibility appear at set points during the stages, floating in the air. Each stage culminates with a boss battle against a powerful female enemy; defeating the boss leads to a lesbian sex scene.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/guerriere-lyeward"}
