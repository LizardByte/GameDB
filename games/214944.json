As a native of this dimension, you have the power to instantly swap arms and legs with those of any other being; an ability referred to as \"glinching\". Could finding the strongest limbs be the key to stopping Gorm?\n\nGalidor Quest is an online role-playing game based on LEGO's Galidor franchise. Players can choose from a selection of five species when creating their character, with the ability to start with the arms and legs of any of those species. The player character's statistics are improved by solving puzzles, completing tasks assigned by NPCs (which are usually in the form of mini-games that take place in the same level), and defeating other characters in challenges.\n\n\"Challenges\" are duels where the player must guess whether a given statistic is better than their opponent's. If the player guesses correctly, they can choose to glinch their limbs with those of their opponent, which can be useful if the opponent has limbs with better stats; however, if the player guesses incorrectly, the opponent can choose to take the player's higher-levelled limbs instead. There is an inventory system for storing quest items and a total of four worlds to explore.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/galidor-quest"}
