And if we're going to pilot something above our pay grade, we knew we had to go all out\u2014costumes, set, and full power to nerd drives.\r\n\r\nThe game lets you and five of your subordinate friends get behind the consoles of a starship. You'll need someone at the Helm, someone on Weapon Control, an Engineer, a Communications Officer and Science Officer. One player, the Captain, doesn't have a computer of their own, but coordinates each of his officers, making tactical decisions keeping his crew running as a finely oiled machine. Each role is vital to keeping the ship flying in one piece.\r\n\r\nWhile the game has a solid framework, it isn't a full-fledged experience yet. (It becomes much more impressive when you hear it's made by just one guy, though!) Two of the roles--Science and Communications--don't have too much to do. Future releases are slated to remedy that, and there's more gameplay modes and features on the horizon. If you've always wanted to be the captain of a starship and have the friends to run it, I highly suggest you give this game a go. \r\n\r\n...costumes, of course, are optional.\r\n\r\n- Forest\r\n\r\nLINK TO OFFICIAL GAME WEBSITE: http://artemis.eochu.com/\r\nGame Creator - Thom Robertson\r\n\r\nCrew:\r\nCaptain: Forest Gibson\r\nHelm: Zachary Cohn\r\nEngineering: Alexander JL Theoharis\r\nWeapons: Steve Minor\r\nCommunications: Tara Miller\r\nScience: Sara Coates\r\nCamera 1: David Zimmermann\r\nCamera 2: Eli Black-Mizuta\r\nCamera 3: Jon Axell\r\nAdditional Help: Janine Cundy, Justin Hammond\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to Banyan Branch for letting us use their office.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72XhdVqDT1g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72XhdVqDT1g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72XhdVqDT1g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72XhdVqDT1g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72XhdVqDT1g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Artemis Bridge Simulator Gameplay", "description": "Follow me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/forestgibson & http://twitter.com/#!/LaughPong\r\n\r\nThe LaughPong crew got together to try Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator, a game that puts you at the helm of more equipment than you're qualified to handle.
