{"id": "DUiEJa_HLP4", "snippet": {"title": "Atari 2600 Game: Halloween (1983 Wizard Video)", "description": "Info: Video re-uploaded (fixed audio)\nAn action-based horror game based on the horror movie with Michael Myers. This game is based on the original 1978 Halloween film. You play as Laurie Strode babysitting a group of children in the two-story house. You are being stalked by a psychopath named Michael Myers who escaped from the mental health institution has came back for revenge. You as Laurie Strode must protect and take the children to a safe room to avoid Michael Myers and his sharp-wielding knife. The house has blackouts and dead ends that you must watch out for within 16 rooms. But you as Laurie Stroke is not completely defenseless as there is a knife laying around where you can attack Michael Myers to protect yourself. Halloween themed song starts to play as the maniac killer appears and remains in pursuit. You gain points when you attack the manic Michael Myers with a knife and taking the kids to the safe room.\n\nNote: This is an interesting game on the Atari 2600. The game is endless. If you score more than 999,999 points, the score resets to zero as 1,000,000 points becomes a zero score. After I score more than 999,999 points I quit afterwards. \n\nStay tune for the Dos and NES version of A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Amstad CPC and NES Version of Friday the 13th games.\n\nThought I'd upload this before Halloween. So happy Halloween everyone!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUiEJa_HLP4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUiEJa_HLP4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUiEJa_HLP4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUiEJa_HLP4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DUiEJa_HLP4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Atari 2600 Game: Halloween (1983 Wizard Video)", "description": "Info: Video re-uploaded (fixed audio)\nAn action-based horror game based on the horror movie with Michael Myers.
