{"id": "oCeV3UG_wZA", "snippet": {"title": "Lara Croft Tomb Raider : The Last Plague [Full] Walkthrough", "description": "Tomb Raider Level Editor (TRLE) - The Last Plague Full Walkthrogh\n\nLevel By : DHermogenes\n\nStory\nA new plague has arisen in Egypt. Lara Croft along with a team of archaeologists have concluded that the problem is related to the myth of the apofis snake. This creature attracts chaos wherever it is, demons are summoned on the spot and only the Ra God can defeat it. Lara Croft disagrees because she believes that the key to this problem lies in the pest site. She alone ventures into the infected ruins to lure the supposed serpent and defeat her with her bare hands.\n\nWhat an amazing level made by the author. This is second releases and we can see he brought us with such an adventureous experience. In such a wide place in the desert, danger always comes to you if you linger there for too long. You can explore the desert ruins somewhere in Sahara Desert at night. I can say the feeling is quiet, calm but spiritual relaxing. I also love the story of how Lara discover the tower of Babel in history that connects the ground and sky. Nicely done from the author, I look foward to see next adventure \ud83d\ude00\n\nSeeking List :\n\nLevel : Sahara Desert - 1st Visit 0:00\n4:59 Ankh\n6:13 Ankh\n\nLevel : Ruins of Temple of Set 7:57\nNone \n\nLevel : Hall of Thoth 12:50\n16:44 Crossbow & LaserSight\n28:38 Secret #1 - Bronze Shield\n29:19 Secret #2 - Silver Shield\n36:59 Scarab Amulet\n37:07 Desert Eagle\n37:51 RG-6 Grenade Launcher\n40:46 East Star\n40:52 South Star\n41:53 Secret #3 - Gold Shield\n\nLevel : Ruins of Temple of Set - 2nd Visit 42:28\nNone\n\nLevel : Temple of Tefnut - 1st Visit 44:28\n46:26 Ankh\n50:04 Ankh\n52:52 Secret #4 - Bronze Shield\n55:29 Secret #5 - Gold Shield & Glock 17\n55:43 Ankh\n1:04:37 Crowbar\n1:10:42 Scarab Amulet\n1:11:48 North Star\n\nLevel : Ruins of Temple of Set - 3rd Visit 1:12:29\nNone\n\nLevel : Temple of Tefnut - 2nd Visit 1:22:46\n1:23:50 West Star\n\nLevel : Ruins of Temple of Set - 4th Visit 1:25:16\nNone\n\nLevel : Sahara Desert - 2nd Visit 1:28:30\n1:31:27 Ankh\n1:32:23 Ankh\n1:32:43 Ankh\n1:33:41 Ankh\n\nLevel : Ruins of Temple of Set - 5th Visit 1:34:18\nNone\n\nLevel : Paraiso (Paradise) 1:35:30 \n1:50:41 Hourglass\n1:50:51 Hourglass\n\nLevel : Cosmos 1:51:30\n1:58:03 Candle of Time\n1:59:06 Burned Disks *4\n2:01:02 Artifact\n\nIt's time to look into the cause of the plauge!\nhttps://trcustoms.org/levels/3496\n\n#trle #laracroft #tombraider #sahara #egypt #archeology #customlevel", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCeV3UG_wZA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCeV3UG_wZA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCeV3UG_wZA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCeV3UG_wZA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCeV3UG_wZA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lara Croft Tomb Raider : The Last Plague [Full] Walkthrough", "description": "Tomb Raider Level Editor (TRLE) - The Last Plague Full Walkthrogh\n\nLevel By : DHermogenes\n\nStory\nA new plague has arisen in Egypt.
