All of his research about the fabled Candelabra, which is said to have the power to bring peace to the once warring kingdoms, tells him that it is most likely located at Estoscerro, an infamous plateau that is as deadly to enter as it is mysterious. After Han, Hubs and Hekl completed their own adventures and destroyed The Order of the Talon, the king called on each of the them to go to Estoscerro together, in search of this supposedly powerful item, since the party of knights he sent at an earlier time never returned. Will the trio find the Candelabra? What kind of evil lurks in the shadows of Estoscerro? Take command of all three heroes, and set forth on this bold mission to bring peace to the land!", "summary": "Candelabra Estoscerro is a 3D style, action-adventure, dungeon crawler in which the heroes from the games \"The Mad Wizard\", \"The Scarlet Matron\", and \"The Warlord Slayer\" band together in a quest compelled by the king. Exploration within a maze environment while battling enemies and enemy bosses are the fundamentals of the game. Your journey will be complete upon reaching the plateau's top and finding the Candelabra.  \n \nCandelabra Estoscerro is uniquely played with two NES controllers, one in each hand, or with a modified Virtual Boy controller (Similar to SoleGooseProductions' Spook-O-Tron). Diagrams of the controller format are pictured, but further depth can be found in the in-game manual, or available to view on the Sly Dog Studios website.
