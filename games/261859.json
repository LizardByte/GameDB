S.M presents its second title, Admiral, a stunning simulation of global thermonuclear war.\n\nYou play the role of a military general hidden deep within an Underwater bunker. Your mission - to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst disabling their ability to attack your own. Start by launching your subs and bombers in order to control the last nuclear resources of the world and increase your credits...\n\nStark and foreboding, it feels like you\u2019re at the centre of the Cold War even before a nuke has been fired.Refreshingly simple yet bursting with depth, Admiral is enjoyable as both a quick blast as well as subtle strategic epic.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/admiral-battle-for-uranium"}
