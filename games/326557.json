After months of intense work, Deathstroke realized he had nothing to prove\u2014until Brainiac invaded Earth. When Amanda Waller approached him with a blank check to stop the invasion at its source, Deathstroke didn\u2019t need to be asked twice.\n\nIn every dimension the Squad has chased Brainiac to so far, he has already taken control of the Elseworld and terraformed it into his twisted vision. However, this time, something is different. Task Force X is catching up to Brainiac\u2019s interdimensional conquest, and it appears he has only just arrived at this new Elseworld. This Elseworld reimagines Superman\u2019s hometown of Smallville as a medieval village, completely stripped of the advanced technology that empowers the modern-day Justice League. While the rest of the Squad may not think much of this Elseworld\u2014preferring jetpacks and explosives to swords and lances\u2014it seems Deathstroke has been busy making a name for himself in this land of chivalry and swordsmanship.", "summary": "Season of Deathstroke of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League delivers the final content updates for the game, bringing new features and enhancements.
