The protagonists try to understand the connection between the cult and the monsters in typical Resident Evil fashion \u2013 which means, dispatching the enemies and solving puzzles to progress further. Most problems are of \"find a key or other way to open the door\" kind, though some tasks are of more intricate kind.\n\nThe action switches between 3 characters. Demir and Ebru are primarily using hand weapons (though can also perform melee attacks to push enemies away). Inzar excels in magic and martial arts - he employs two blades on his wrists to serve justice to the monsters.", "summary": "Kabus 22 is a horror\u2013action game set in Kadik\u00f6y district in Istanbul.
