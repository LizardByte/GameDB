They also use the player's avatar to represent the character. All games can be played alone or for up to four local players, taking turns. The games can be played individually in Freeplay or as Motion Mix, where three are selected randomly. By playing well in Motion Mix points can be earned to level up. In Freeplay stars need to be earned to open up new levels. Each game comes with two Easy levels and by earning stars Medium (level 3 to 7) and eventually Hard (level 7 to 10) are unlocked. Games also often have multipliers.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/motion-explosion"}
