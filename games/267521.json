Tomb Raider: Legend originally came out in 2006 and was developed by Crystal Dynamics. Legend Demake is a fan-remake developed by Delca using an enhanced version of the TR4 engine (called TRNG). Gameplay and environments are reimagined how they would be like if they were made by Core Design in the late 90's - often referred to as the 'classic' era.\n\nChapter One includes four levels: Croft Manor, Bolivia, Peru, and Japan. The follow-up, consisting of the second half of the game, is in development.\n\nThe Story focuses on Lara's search for her mother and the mythical sword Excalibur. For the demake, the plot has been reworked and simplified in some aspects.\n\nCutscenes are dubbed in French. English subtitles are provided.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-legend-demake-chapter-one", "videos": [{"id": 98240, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nW9kaUDxrOI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW9kaUDxrOI", "title": "The Making of 'Legend Demake' | Tomb Raider Level Editor", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nW9kaUDxrOI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
