Unike its predecessor, it was released for Sega RingEdge hardware for the first time. The game saw a change in its driving physics. Unlike Initial D Arcade Stage 5, a drift gauge and an updated tachometer was introduced to help inform players when they were drifting. The 'Legend of the Street' mode also introduced a \"Rolling Start\" for the first time since the story mode in Initial D Special Stage. The tachometer now informed players whether or not their speed was below the gear range.

Mileages could be used to redeem exclusive cars that were later available in updates.
