In April of the following year, Dancing Stage Fusion was released as an arcade game. Fusion featured new gameplay features such as EyeToy support for the PlayStation 2 release as well as new music from hit pop artists. The arcade version of Fusion was the first arcade machine in Europe since Dancing Stage EuroMix 2 and set a milestone as the first Dance Dance Revolution arcade machine produced by Konami since Dance Dance Revolution Extreme in 2002. The arcade release marked a total game engine upgrade from the old PlayStation-based boards to a new system built on top of an off-the-shelf PlayStation 2. This hardware upgrade would be later featured in the global release of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dancing-stage-fusion", "videos": [{"id": 37824, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1EG6Wm-3A2Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EG6Wm-3A2Y", "title": "\u3010Dancing Stage Fusion\u3011A\u3010EXPERT\u3011", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1EG6Wm-3A2Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
