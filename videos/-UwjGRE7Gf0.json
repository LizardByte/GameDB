The Princess & The Pig DLC resurrects one of four central antagonists from the original Stronghold (2001) in a brand new Crusader Trail, while also introducing a completely new character in the form of the noble Princess. The first piece of downloadable content available for Stronghold Crusader 2, The Princess & The Pig adds seven new missions, two AI opponents, 10 achievements and new castle designs unique to the two extra characters.\n\nThe Princess and The Pig have embarked for the holy lands bringing swords, spears and maces in a journey destined to disrupt the balance of power. Players must fight their way through a new skirmish trail with seven deadly scenarios to tackle, including three new maps. Old faces such as The Wolf, Richard the Lionheart and Saladin also make a return, smarter and more strategic than before. While these new rivals sometimes aid the player in battle, they won\u2019t hold back when it comes to the gruesomely difficult finale.\n\nPlease Note: The Princess & The Pig is downloadable add-on content, requiring the full Stronghold Crusader 2 game on Steam to play.\n\nLike \u2013 https://www.facebook.com/StrongholdCrusaderII\nTweet \u2013 https://twitter.com/shcrusader2\nSubscribe \u2013 http://bit.ly/fftubesub\nStream - http://bit.ly/ffstwitch", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-UwjGRE7Gf0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-UwjGRE7Gf0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-UwjGRE7Gf0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-UwjGRE7Gf0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-UwjGRE7Gf0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Stronghold Crusader 2 - 'The Princess & The Pig' DLC Trailer", "description": "Now Available - http://store.steampowered.com/app/348990/\n\nBlow the horn, bang the drum, The Pig is coming to town!
