{"id": "SEVM4-CvmXM", "snippet": {"title": "Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge - PlayStation 4 Gameplay", "description": "Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge is the third installment in the Tilting Tiles series. Micro Challenge brings an entire new take on the unique puzzle series by adding new player movement options and new terrain tiles. Whether you are a fan of the series or a first time player, this is the perfect place to start.\n\nMicro Challenge is a uniquely set up movement based puzzle game, and your goal is to examine each level and determine the most efficient route possible to collect all items before reaching the move limit.\n\nLike in previous entries your Player Tile can Move, Double Slide, Diagonal Slide, Tilt, and Teleport. Micro Challenge also adds the ability to change sizes.\n\nShrink your tile down to fit through narrow hallways and corridors. Be careful when you are small as there are now towers filled with holes, and if you try to traverse them while in the shrunken state, you will fall to your demise! It costs 1 energy unit to shrink or to grow. This creates an entire new style of puzzle design in which you must determine when it's most beneficial to change sizes in your route planning.\n\nMicro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become \"micro\" but it is ALSO a \"micro\" sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise. It features 20 unique levels and 5 creative multiplayer maps!\n\nNot only does Micro Challenge feature a focused and unique single player puzzle set, it also contains a series first, with the all new Tilting Tiles Multiplayer Mode.\n\nGrab a friend and solve your way through Tilting Tiles Maps together. Both players share a move count, so you must examine the level together and determine who can collect which items more efficiently. Each player is given a different set of problems to solve as well as a different amount of special moves available.\n\nThe unique movement based puzzle experience returns with Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge. Tilt and shrink alone or with a friend, can you guide the tile to victory?\n\nDeveloped by TreeFall Studios L.L.C.\n\n#theforeseenarcade #playstation #playstation4 #ps4 #ps4share #ps4gameplay #ps4games #playstation4games  #playstation4gameplay #tiltingtiles #tiltingtilesmicrochallenge", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEVM4-CvmXM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEVM4-CvmXM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEVM4-CvmXM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEVM4-CvmXM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEVM4-CvmXM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge - PlayStation 4 Gameplay", "description": "Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge is the third installment in the Tilting Tiles series.
