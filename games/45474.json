Although there is no story connection, it is often thought of as the spiritual successor to RayForce, which had similar gameplay.\n\nYou have 2 weapons at you disposal, a vulcan gun and a lock-on missile attack. You can also do 2 special attacks by using the lock-on system in a special way. The graphics are all in 3D, but the gameplay mechanics are in 2D. There are 7 stages, each ending with a giant end boss."}
