Each map brings a new gameplay experience and fresh visuals, with characteristics such as foxholes, tunnels and dense jungles from where the enemy can launch surprise attacks. Also, 15 classic Vietnam-era weapons and 6 vehicles are available from the moment you go online.\n\nAll four multiplayer game modes from Battlefield: Bad Company 2, including the genre-defining Conquest Mode, will be playable in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam. The expansion is integrated with the full game persistence, so no matter what theatre of war you participate in, you will continue to level up your soldier as usual.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battlefield-bad-company-2-vietnam", "videos": [{"id": 119496, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "XgFcJ38-IOc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFcJ38-IOc", "title": "Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam - E3 Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XgFcJ38-IOc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
