As in the other two cases, the graphics of the remade version have been redone from scratch, to match the 2D standard of 32-bit generation consoles. Interior locations are much more detailed, with visible furniture and other items in rooms that were empty or contains just a few objects in the original version.\n\nThe 3D dungeons can now be navigated with smooth scrolling, unlike the \"jumping\" navigation of the earlier versions. The remake also has an additional difficulty level, dubbed \"normal\"; the original difficulty level is called \"hard\". The easier difficulty level also reduces the amount of random battles. Story, dialogues, layout of locations, and general gameplay remain unchanged in this version.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-if-dot-dot-dot--1", "videos": [{"id": 142950, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SeqKU9rqirk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeqKU9rqirk", "title": "Shin Megami Tensei if...(PSX) [Akira Route]: Apaosha [Jap] | Reverofenola", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SeqKU9rqirk/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1291, "name": "Shin Megami Tensei"}]}
