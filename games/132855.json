That makes it one of the longest Kaizo hacks ever made.\n\n-Plenty of custom music, sprites, blocks, and graphics.\n\n-An easy, beginner friendly difficulty level that should be able to introduce players to Kaizo. No more frusturation over not being able to beat something!\n\n-There's a unique ASM gimmick in virtually every level!\n\n-Six themed worlds and one special unlockable level, making it a truly full-length Kaizo hack.\n\n-Ninety-nine lives given in the beginning of the game, so no more game overs (hopefully)!\n\n-A hidden moon in every single level for the completionists out there.\n\n-A difficulty level that can work as a perfect first Kaizo hack, although the hack fits well for players of all skill levels.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 36880, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "q2zOj-K0ois"}]}
