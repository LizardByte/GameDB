{"id": "hHH0Oayw6CY", "snippet": {"title": "Arcade Game: Boulder Dash (1984 Exidy / First Star Software)", "description": "A maze/digging where you play Rockford, who digs feverishly through monster infested caves, as boulders crash down all around him, and to search and retrieve diamonds through 16 mystical caves and five levels of difficulty. You must collect a certain number of diamonds to advance to the next level. You can squash enemies by falling boulders, but you must be careful as they can squash you too causing you to lose a life. Difficulty is increased with many puzzle elements and shorter time limit.\n\nThis game runs on a max-a-flex hardware which is based on the Atari 400/800/800 XL computer system (also known as Atari 8-bit computer)\n\nNote: This game is really damn hard. It took me a while to figure out the puzzle elements to search and reveal the diamonds. The game is endless as each of levels repeat the 16 cave sub-levels. After you beaten all 5 of them, it endlessly repeats the last level so I quit afterwards. Used Invincibility cheat after down to last life and infinite time cheat when close to running out of time.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hHH0Oayw6CY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hHH0Oayw6CY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hHH0Oayw6CY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hHH0Oayw6CY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hHH0Oayw6CY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Game: Boulder Dash (1984 Exidy / First Star Software)", "description": "A maze/digging where you play Rockford, who digs feverishly through monster infested caves, as boulders crash down all around him, and to search and retrieve diamonds through 16 mystical caves and five levels of difficulty.
