It has been re-released via downloading services such as the Wii's Virtual Console and Steam in 2010. It was also included in the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable but it was omitted in PAL version (Sega Mega Drive Collection).\n\nIt is the second game in the Shinobi series released for the Mega Drive, following The Revenge of Shinobi. However, it is not a continuation of the previous game, but rather a loose adaptation to the 1989 arcade game Shadow Dancer. Like in the original arcade game, the player controls a ninja followed by a canine companion. The Secret of Shinobi was well received by critics.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-dancer-the-secret-of-shinobi"}
