Players control Baloo in his plane The Seaduck, except upon entry to a bonus level, where the player then controls Kit on his airfoil.", "summary": "TaleSpin is a scrolling shooter video game based on the Disney television series TaleSpin. The game was developed by Capcom for the NES in 1991 and was ported to the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is essentially a slightly stripped-down version of the game.\n\nThe NES version of the game was included in The Disney Afternoon Collection compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017.\n\nThe gameplay consists of maneuvering Baloo's plane \"The Sea Duck\" through each level, fending off incoming enemies and avoiding obstacles. Items can be collected for extra lives or to add to the total cash score. The plane can be rotated upside to traverse back through the level, but only on horizontally scrolling areas. At the end of each level, the player is required to fight a boss enemy by repeatedly shooting its weak points. After beating a level, the player has the option to buy upgrades for Baloo's plane with the money collected, before proceeding to the next level. In bonus levels the player controls Kit on an airfoil to pop balloons for bonus points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/talespin--3", "videos": [{"id": 3261, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "OAwpIFrZckU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAwpIFrZckU", "title": "TaleSpin - NES Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OAwpIFrZckU/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47197, "name": "Retrospective", "video_id": "VZwo_2GAtfk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwo_2GAtfk", "title": "The Disney Afternoon Collection - TaleSpin Retrospective", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZwo_2GAtfk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
