To make the game the most authentic soccer simulation around, the company has hired a specialist agency entirely focused on the creation of player information and statistics, and has completely overhauled the game engine to compute more realistic action in real time. The team has also focused on the Training system, new Match Tactics choices for handling on-the-field gaming, and Action Zones for detailed looks at who best controls which sections of turf."}
