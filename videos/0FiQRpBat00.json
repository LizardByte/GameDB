CHECK BELOW FOR THE DOWNLOAD LINK\n\nWELCOME TO MY BIGGEST CREATION YET\n\nhttps://nicec00lkidd.itch.io/foxos-fun-schoolhouse\n@Jinx-175 \n\nWelcome to Foxo's Fun Schoolhouse! This is a game I've been quietly working on since April and it's finally ready to be made public. I haven't exactly set a release date cause I'm very busy with school but it will be coming soon, I can promise you that!\n\nI've put literally hundreds of hours into this game and finally releasing it will be such a relief. This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy working on it though! Working on this has been a blast and to be honest it's a little sad to see it end. I will definitely still be releasing updates for this game though, cause I haven't put everything in the game!!\n\nThe first version of the game will include all of the main stuff along with some easter eggs which you can go find! I'd say the average playtime of this (if you're a beginner) is about an hour, and even then maybe you haven't found everything!\n\n- Nicec00lkidd", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FiQRpBat00/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FiQRpBat00/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FiQRpBat00/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FiQRpBat00/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FiQRpBat00/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Foxo's Fun Schoolhouse - Official Trailer (RELEASED)", "description": "THE GAME HAS BEEN RELEASED!!
