Ultraman TV [Psx] - Intro", "description": "Ultraman is a fictional character featured in tokusatsu, or \"special effects\" television programs in Japan. Ultraman made his debut in the tokusatsu SF/kaiju/superhero TV series, Ultra Q: Ultraman: Special Effects Fantasy Series, a follow-up to the television series Ultra Q. The show was produced by Tokyo Broadcasting System and Tsuburaya Productions, and was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) from July 17, 1966 to April 9, 1967, with a total of 39 episodes (40, counting the pre-premiere special that aired on July 10, 1966).\n\nAlthough Ultraman is the first series to feature an Ultra-being, this is actually the second Ultra Series. Ultra Q was the first. A major pop culture phenomenon in Japan, the show has spawned dozens of imitators as well as numerous sequels and remakes, which continue to be popular today.\n\nThe storyline begins in the near future, as referenced from the mid-1960s. In episode 22, \"My Home Is Earth\", it is definitively established that the series takes place in the early 1990s, as a plaque shown at the end of the episode displays the current year as being 1993. Sinister aliens and giant monsters constantly threaten civilization during this period. The only Earth organization equipped to handle these disasters is the Science Special Search Party (SSSP), a special police force with branches all over the world, and equipped with high-tech weapons and vehicles, as well as extensive scientific and engineering facilities. The branch of the Science Patrol that is focused on in the series is located in Tokyo, Japan. Led by Captain \"Cap\" Muramatsu, the Science Patrol is always ready to protect the Earth from rampaging monsters, but sometimes finds itself overmatched. When the situation becomes desperate, Hayata, the Patrol's most capable member, holds the key to salvation in the form of a power-object called a \"Beta Capsule\", which, when ignited, allows him to transform secretly into the amazing, super-humanoid-powered giant from space-Ultraman.\n\nWhile active as Ultraman, Hayata's human body goes into a type of deep coma, reviving only after the threat has been neutralized and Ultraman willingly departs. Victory is never assured, however, as Ultraman's powers\u2014his very life force\u2014comes from rapidly depleted, stored solar energy.\n\nIn this Kids Station game specially designed for young kids the players can play with different Ultramans and play different activities meanwhile they learn about numbers and other things.\n\n\n\nDevice:\nPlaystation Classic\nBleemsync 1.2\nOTG\nSandisk Cruzer Blade 128 GB\n\nCapture:\nEzcap 284 hd video capture", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeeJzSHwPnM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeeJzSHwPnM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeeJzSHwPnM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeeJzSHwPnM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeeJzSHwPnM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Kids Station - Bokura to Asobou!
