It was located in a large conference building situated near a rebel safehouse - the Spare Time Cafe - from which your assault was originally launched.\n\nThe cafe was later raided by combine, and ultimately destroyed. No rebels were present at the time, but something there led the Combine to the Elvet Theatre - a more important rebel hideout. The attack on the Elvet was devastating, causing much of the rebel command structure to be seriously disrupted.\n\nThe second chapter of The Citizen picks up precisely where the first left off. You regain conciousness, and discover the extent of your injuries.\n\nMercifully, help is not far away. But then again, neither are the Combine.", "summary": "Set in and around City 17, \"The Citizen Part Two\" contains the next three chapters of our citizen's story.\n\nAfter the events of the previous two chapters, you find yourself rescued from the grave by rebels, among whom you are now a valuable asset. Taken to a makeshift field hospital, you recover in the hands of rebel medics. But the Combine are determined to crush the rebels out of existence, and the peace can't last long. You will face choices, and how you decide to proceed will ultimately dictate how the story plays out for you. Some choices are less obvious than others, and require you to take initiative where you otherwise might be distracted. One way or another, it's time to take back the city.\n\nPart Two was originally going to be much longer, but was split in half during development. The first half was released as the current Part Two. Later in 2014, Part 2 and 3 were merged into a single part after the final release, and the ending was retconned.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-citizen-part-ii", "videos": [{"id": 132662, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "jmJ6cS-Rqsw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmJ6cS-Rqsw", "title": "Early Teaser: The Citizen Part 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jmJ6cS-Rqsw/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 132774, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "KHT2HiXYdh8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHT2HiXYdh8", "title": "The Citizens Part II Teaser Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KHT2HiXYdh8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 132775, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YmLKWv6_V0M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmLKWv6_V0M", "title": "The Citizen Part II Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YmLKWv6_V0M/sddefault.jpg"}]}
