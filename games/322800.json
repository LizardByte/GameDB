With the Reloaded Edition, the arsenal at your disposal has grown massively. Be creative with your combat or outrun your foes as you enjoy the perks of more than 10 post-launch updates. Good luck out there, and stay human!\n\nIt\u2019s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor \u2014 the last city standing on Earth.\n\nYou quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You\u2019ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human-reloaded-edition", "videos": [{"id": 133508, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "njAOpATG46E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njAOpATG46E", "title": "Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/njAOpATG46E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
