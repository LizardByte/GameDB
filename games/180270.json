After landing in a pile of sand he catches his breath and gets over the shock of what had just happened. He remembers he has a headlamp on his explorer\u2019s hat, which by some miracle is still on his head. He turns it on. Looking around, he can barely make out that he is in a small chamber. At his back is the pile of sand he landed in. In front of him is what looks like a door made of stone. On the floor, a few feet from where he stands is what looks like some sort of switch.\n\nHe rises, walks to the switch, and steps on it. He hears a distinct metallic click, followed by what sounds like a series a flints being struck. The little chamber he is in suddenly becomes illuminated by torches placed high up on the walls. The door in front of him starts to open.\n\n\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d, he wonders.\n\nHis curiosity gets the better of him. He rises and walks through the door. He finds himself in another chamber, significantly bigger than the previous room. This room is also lit by wall-mounted torches, but is substantially more built out with what looks like ancient stone walls and floors. No sooner does he take two steps into the room does the entry door slam shut behind him. Wheeling around, he searches for a way to open the door but finds none. He realizes he is trapped.\n\nOur hero is trapped in a massive tomb complex with nothing but his headlamp and his wits. He realizes that at best he only has a few hours of air before he dies and the only way out is to press forward, hoping that there is a way out other than the way by which he entered!\n\nTo escape, he will have to solve puzzles involving a variety of different types of switches, making use of found objects and more. But that\u2019s not all, he\u2019ll also have to be weary of deadly traps including spikes, flames, trapdoors, bottomless pits, swinging balls, and more!\n\nGuide our hero through the many rooms and levels as quickly as possible and try to discover hidden secrets along the way.\n\nThe game can be played with keyboard or gamepad, though we strongly recommend using a gamepad. See Release Notes included with the game for full description of controls, supported game controllers, game features and how to play.\n\nTomb of Trials is easy to play, but very difficult to complete.\n\nThis game is influenced by games such as Aztec Challenge, Montezuma\u2019s Revenge, Gordian Tomb, Ico, Tomb Raider, Uncharted, and many more! If you liked any of those games, you're going to love this one!", "summary": "A third-person puzzle-action-platformer where players must escape a mysterious deadly tomb by solving puzzles involving a variety of different types of switches, making use of found objects and more.
