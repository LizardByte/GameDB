Think strategically and tactically decide the balance between both attack and defense to succeed. Remember that you cannot repair your base during battle.\nAs you progress and kill all the enemies you will collect experience points, spend these to move onto the next of 5 available ages. Each age has its own unique units, defense levels and special weapons for when it gets heated!\nTry the medium and hard levels for more of a challenge to become a War master!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barbarians-nations-battle-for-freedom"}
