It is a computer version of the classic board game Connect Four. This is a-turn based game in which the player and the computer take turns placing pieces on a board. The objective for each player is to create a line of four of their pieces, the one who accomplishes this first wins the game. The game is entirely mouse controlled. It is played in a window which cannot be re-sized. The game has sound, four levels of difficulty, in-game help screens, and a choice of playing piece, colour and screen background."}
