The dragons are in celebration of a rite of passage for the young dragons and for the Grand Dragon Parade, with the arrival of new young dragonfly guardians for the baby dragons. However, during the party, Ripto teleports in via a portal along with his henchmen Crush and Gulp, disrupting the celebration, intent on capturing the new young dragonflies to weaken the baby dragons. However, his spell misfires and the dragonflies become scattered throughout the Dragon Realms. Spyro is tasked with recovering the realms' new crop of dragonflies.", "summary": "Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly is the fourth game in the Spyro the Dragon series and the first Spyro game to be on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Gamecube. Gameplay is similar to the previous three console games. The only playable character is Spyro, however he can man several vehicles: Hunter's Manta Ray and the UFO's make a return appearance from Year of the Dragon, alongside two new vehicles, the tank and the Spitfire attack plane.\n\nThe game faced development issues that affected the final product, which resulted in being poorly made. Upon release, it was widely criticized for its numerous glitches, long loading times, and choppy framerate, with fans and critics calling it the worst entry in the franchise.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spyro-enter-the-dragonfly", "videos": [{"id": 67666, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5kqZTSPvKdU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kqZTSPvKdU", "title": "Spyro Enter the Dragonfly | PS2 | Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kqZTSPvKdU/sddefault.jpg"}]}
