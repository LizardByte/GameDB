Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time. There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is Hedge Hopper (10 barns), game 2 is Crop Duster (15 barns), game 3 is Stunt Pilot (15 barns), and game 4 is Flying Ace (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 7097, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "1omwJegOAH8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1omwJegOAH8", "title": "Classic Game Room - BARNSTORMING review for Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1omwJegOAH8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
