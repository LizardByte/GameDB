But unlike the original, you can move your paddle up and down as well! The game also features several power ups such as a cannon to destroy blocks and enemies, a ball holder, and a secondary paddle to stop the ball from going off the end of the playfield.\n\nThere are also multiple point-giving items, and some items will make it harder for you to play the game for short periods of time, either by moving the camera downward so you can't see the entire playfield, or by turning your ball (or balls) into smiley faces that can't destroy blocks.\n\nreview mobygames\n\nProgramming:\nCristian Soulos\nAdditional Programming:\nPascal Pochol, Dana M.
