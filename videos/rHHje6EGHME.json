In today\u2019s post, we want to talk about the new architecture system. This system has undergone several changes, which we are excited to share. \n\nYou can now stack buildings atop each other to create more efficient cities. Homes and warehouses, in particular, can be arranged into soaring wooden skyscrapers in various creative combinations. \n\nYou can now also use scaffolding and strategically place stairs to colonize even the most hard-to-reach areas of the map. The new system will put your skill as an architect to the test as you design ever more intricate ways to place buildings and walkways efficiently. \n\nAnd yes, you can use the new modules to build your city on the water! This was one of the most requested features - at the end of the day, it\u2019s a city of beavers, right? \n\nSo, what do you think about the modular building system?
