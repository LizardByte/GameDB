Each of these two characters has 7 unique abilities that players can upgrade, customize and combine with others to create their own visceral style of dishing out death. In a game where any hit is fatal, being able to slow down time to dodge bullets or to become invisible will be key to survival.\n\nIn Harry and Judy working together the true artistry of carnage is revealed; players can annihilate foes with a huge number of devilishly creative combos, such as setting up a Wall of Fire that will imbue passing bullets with the energy of hell and have them explode on impact, or creating a Dark Vortex to suck enemies together and ripen them for melee brutality. Player death will be simply a passing inconvenience in the cycle of creative destruction.\n\nSlay enemies with speed and precision in an over-the-top show of blood and explosions. Play solo or with others, make split-second decisions, dodge bullets, and use weapons and abilities to inflict violence in the most graphic way possible. \n\nComing to PC, PS4, Xbox One\n\n#godstrigger #trailer #april18\n\nSteam - http://bit.ly/Gods_Trigger_Steam - Add to Steam wishlist\nWebsite - http://bit.ly/Gods_Trigger_WebsiteRT\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/omlgames\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/oml_games\n\nSubscribe our channel for more information!\n\nYoutube - http://bit.ly/OML_Subscribe", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TB4gH9oMrZA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TB4gH9oMrZA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TB4gH9oMrZA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TB4gH9oMrZA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TB4gH9oMrZA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "God's Trigger - Special Abilities Trailer", "description": "#godstrigger #trailer #april18\n\nGod's Trigger - Coming April 18, 2019\n\nGod\u2019s Trigger allows players to go on the rampage as Harry, a fallen angel, or Judy, a demon.
