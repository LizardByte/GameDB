The rest of the gameplay is similar to the former seasons: the player walks through the levels, collects items and uses them to solve puzzles. Dialogues are a ring menu similar to Mass Effect where the player only chooses the topic instead of the whole sentence. Unlike traditional adventure games the movement of Sam is not controlled by point & click but by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse in the desired direction (or alternatively with the keyboard keys). Interactions with items or persons are carried out with a single mouse button.", "summary": "This is the biggest Sam & Max game ever! \n \nIn Episode 5, an enormous, scaly, floppy-eared monster is rampaging through the city, and Sam assembles a crack team to stop him!
