Unlock and change personality traits throughout your Sims' lives as they cope with midlife crises, respond to family requests to move in, and more. Self-discovery is a lifelong journey.\n\nSometimes Sims just click. Your Sim might have natural social chemistry with a Sim they meet at a party - or they might naturally clash. Your Sim will now have preferences that determine which Sims they are socially compatible with and which Sims are more likely to become their enemies.\n\nThe bonds between your related Sims are important and complex. As they experience life together, there will be opportunities for both drama and unity that will affect family dynamics and Sims\u2019 relationships with their family members.", "summary": "Strengthen family bonds, make friends or enemies, and discover your Sims' truest selves with The Sims 4 Growing Together Expansion Pack.
