It was released, among other consoles and computers, for the SG-1000 in 1987. It was the last SG-1000 game to be released in card form, and the last to be published by Sega, but it is currently unknown as to whether it was the last SG-1000 game. MSX and PC-8801 versions had been released in 1983 and 1984, respectively, meaning this version is unusually late.\n\nThe game was followed by The Black Onyx II: Search For The Fire Crystal, which saw its original MSX release in 1984.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-black-onyx", "videos": [{"id": 127819, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "t50pWKDsqiE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t50pWKDsqiE", "title": "SG-1000 - The Black Onyx (1987)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t50pWKDsqiE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
