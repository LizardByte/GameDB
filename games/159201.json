You need to help our hero to navigate her ship called the Kim-inator with the primary goal of saving the world from Shego, her villain counterpart.\n\nShego is a female villain dedicated to stopping Kim from getting the Tempus Simia Idol. Shego may come across as lazy, because she likes to spend her free time in her lair reading villain magazines, filing her clawed gloves or even visiting spa resorts. But don't let that fool you! Along the way, her security drones will try and stop you so you will have to use your ship's powerful guns to destroy them, before they shoot you, and damage the Kim-inator!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kim-possible-a-sitch-in-time-episode-3-future"}
