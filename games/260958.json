Mappers of all skill levels and experience were welcome to participate and were allowed to map in any map format, with the entire project being tied together using GZDoom and maps being loaded from a hub level. Mappers submitted their maps to a site created specifically for the project by DavidN, which included a new tool to automatically compile new maps into the project as they were uploaded to the site.\n\nThis project has 209 maps.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rabbits-all-comers-mapping-project"}
