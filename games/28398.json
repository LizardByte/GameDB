Characters in the game are illustrated in the super deformed (chibi) art style. There are two complementary versions of the game: the SNK version and the Capcom version. Each version of the game has a different starting deck and different exclusive cards that can be obtained, but the gameplay remains the same, with card battles resembling a somewhat simplified version of Magic: The Gathering, in which a maximum of three fighters are allowed in each player's field at any given moment and there is no mana to be spent to place them in the field.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snk-vs-capcom-card-fighters-clash-capcom-card-fighters-version", "collections": [{"id": 2688, "name": "SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters' Clash"}]}
