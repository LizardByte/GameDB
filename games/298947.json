It reuses all original graphics, in attempts to remain as faithful as possible to the original version.\n\nNavigate around the maze while steering clear of the Squirms.\n\nYou need to find and eat 200 eggs laid by the Queen Squirm. And like PacMan, if a squirm gets to you, then you will be back to the start.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/squirm--2"}
