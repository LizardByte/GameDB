{"id": "KMNTcG4OvqE", "snippet": {"title": "Amiga Longplay Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers", "description": "http://www.recordedamigagames.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nGame release year: 1995\n\nFor an AGA game it doesn't look that good. It's on 7 disks and yet with all the small characters/sprites and stuff, there's like no background animations... just a couple or something, like lights, no people moving. Also crap sound quality and the music sucks. There's no intro or title music either. But if this is what's required to get the awesome speed this game has, then it's worth it. Compared to the other Street Fighter games on the Amiga, THIS one runs fast and smooth, 50fps, very high playability. Another awesome thing is CD32 gamepad support, 6 buttons can be used, like the arcade versions.\n\nI chose to play with Super Mode 'off', cuz I wanted the bonus levels. With Super Mode 'on' you get to fight against more characters, but the bonus rounds are left out. I just wanted to get through this game quickly anyway, so having it 'off' makes it quicker :P,  ye, I'm lazy... and ye, I suck. Only did a couple of pratice rounds.\n\nThis game runs in 50fps and alot of moves and stuff uses flickering to make the effects. I usually upload 50fps movies in 25 on YouTube to keep it moving/scrolling smooth, but this time it has to be upped in 30, or alot of times stuff will go invicible or just ignore the effects of all the special moves etc. It will of course look like CRAP in 30fps, but it's better than 25. If you wanna see it in super smooth action with everything visible and all effects behaving like they should, download the source video.\n\nI didn't bother centering the screen while fighting, would have to cut the movie in many parts then, bleh. I added an extra fight at the end where I play in max speed.\n\nSo, of all the available Street Fighter games on the Amiga, this is the best one imo, as to me, playability is king. Super Street Fighter II Turbo has CD soundtracks and killer graphics, but it plays like shit and tons of animation and stuff were left out. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMNTcG4OvqE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMNTcG4OvqE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMNTcG4OvqE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMNTcG4OvqE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KMNTcG4OvqE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers", "description": "http://www.recordedamigagames.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nGame release year: 1995\n\nFor an AGA game it doesn't look that good.
