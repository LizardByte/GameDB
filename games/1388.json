He was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat Championship. After his death, the world began to become chaotic. In the middle of the chaos, it was announced that the second Dead or Alive World Combat Championship will be held.\nThe purpose and significance of the tournament changed after Douglas' death. The promoter of the second Dead or Alive Championship, who is fond of conflicts and jealous of the strong, is responsible for Douglas's death. The new promoter, Victor Donovan, is more than a corrupt mastermind, but a man of pure evil. His involvement in the tournament began to bring a sense of terror to the world, resulting in the infamous tengu disaster.", "summary": "Dead or Alive 2 is a fighting game in the Dead or Alive series. The gameplay of DOA2, and all subsequent Dead or Alive games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds.The other defining feature of DOA2, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. In DOA2 many attacks upon hitting will inflict a stun on the opponent. While stunned, the opponent cannot attack, and cannot guard, but they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 42581, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BxokNplKzyU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxokNplKzyU", "title": "Dead Or Alive 2 DC Promo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BxokNplKzyU/hqdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 3755, "name": "Tina"}, {"id": 4981, "name": "Tengu"}, {"id": 4989, "name": "Ayane's Uncle"}, {"id": 4980, "name": "Ein"}, {"id": 4990, "name": "Lesser Ninja"}, {"id": 4988, "name": "Ayame"}, {"id": 4974, "name": "Ayane"}, {"id": 4987, "name": "Genra"}, {"id": 4973, "name": "Jann Lee"}, {"id": 4971, "name": "Gen Fu"}, {"id": 4984, "name": "Lauren"}, {"id": 4982, "name": "Bayman"}, {"id": 4979, "name": "Leifang"}, {"id": 4985, "name": "Hayate"}, {"id": 4983, "name": "Hitomi"}, {"id": 2808, "name": "System Voice"}, {"id": 4978, "name": "Leon"}, {"id": 4977, "name": "Bass"}, {"id": 4972, "name": "Zack"}, {"id": 4986, "name": "Raidou"}, {"id": 2994, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 3653, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j2il47dn13pgw7axkuni.jpg"}, "name": "Kasumi Nakano", "species": 1}, {"id": 4975, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 4007, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm33b.jpg"}, "name": "Ryu Hyabusa", "species": 1}, {"id": 4976, "name": "Helena"}]}
