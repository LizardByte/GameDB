Rank and wealth can be achieved any way you like.\n\nOf course, if you're tired of fighting and boarding enemy ships, you can always invest your collected savings in good real estate. Or do it the other way around - sell all of your manufactures, buy a nice brig and become a pirate.", "summary": "Caribbean! is a mix between an economic strategy game and an open-world RPG, set in the pirate era of the XVII century's Caribbean region.
