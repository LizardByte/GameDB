The game takes place across interconnected screens, often arranged in maze-like patterns, with vertical shafts that required climbing, dropping down, or jumping over chasms. The jump key is also used for attacking, which requires gaining momentum and repeatedly \"bumping\" into the enemy. There are no experience points or any type of currency, but defeating enemies may yield healing potions or better weapons and armor. These items can also be found in the numerous treasure rooms found in the game. The player is given considerable freedom as to which area to explore first, but many areas are initially blocked, requiring the player to procure a key or return with better equipment in order to defeat a stronger enemy guarding the location.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWZ59U_1bwY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWZ59U_1bwY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWZ59U_1bwY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWZ59U_1bwY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sWZ59U_1bwY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Babylon (\u30d0\u30d3\u30ed\u30f3) for the NEC PC-88", "description": "Came also out for:\n\nCommodore 64\nFM-7\n\n\nGame description:\n\nThe country of Babylon was once a thriving community, enjoying peace and prosperity.
