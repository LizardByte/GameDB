Mankind has just suffered one of the most brutal wars it ever faced. While the rest of the world is still rebuilding, a scientist of unmatched genius by the name of Albert Einstein decides to act. With a device he was engineering at a secret research center in Trinity, New Mexico, he travels back in time to kill the person who he sees as the root of all misery: Adolf Hitler. He catches up with Hitler in 1926 and disposes of him without thoroughly considering the consequences, as time will soon tell.\n\nIt's now the 1950s. World War II never happened -- at least, not yet. Germany remains a peace-loving country with close ties to other European nations, now facing increased tensions with Russia under Josef Stalin's rule. In order to realize the glorious Marxist dream he has envisioned, Stalin mobilizes the forces of the USSR. His goal? The conquest of Europe. The nations under threat form the Alliance that seeks to put an end to this madman's nightmare before he can see to its completion. The Great World War II has begun.", "summary": "Red Alert: A Path Beyond is a freeware game based on the W3D engine as was used in Command & Conquer: Renegade which aims to transform the first Red Alert game into a first/third person shooter.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/red-alert-a-path-beyond", "videos": [{"id": 133200, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "05cf2WPJ98w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05cf2WPJ98w", "title": "C&C Red Alert: A Path Beyond - Games Convention '06 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/05cf2WPJ98w/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 133201, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bnf2kUmN-TY"}, {"id": 133202, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LIYmeRC8xNA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIYmeRC8xNA", "title": "Red Alert: A Path Beyond 2.1.1 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LIYmeRC8xNA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 133203, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_ivwaPFzQvM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ivwaPFzQvM", "title": "Red Alert: A Path Beyond - Delta Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_ivwaPFzQvM/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 133204, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4FLfFoOV0kI"}]}
