This version was called \"Teak's Tall Tale Plus.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Plus version had some HUGE technical oversights during development that caused it to barely run on machines running Windows 10, on top of being a technical mess regardless.\n\nThe 2021 version, Teak's Tall Tale Plus Plus, was compiled in GameMaker Studio 2, mitigating some of the technical issues. On top of that, certain visual effects have been redone for optimization. Certain art assets have been replaced, as well. I hope this version's release is a lot more smooth than it was last time!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/meander-forth-teaks-tall-tale-plus-plus"}
