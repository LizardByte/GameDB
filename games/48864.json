It works on a NES and emulators, powerpaks, etc!\n\nThe hack aims to update the game to be more enjoyable today with revised game design and improved graphics, while trying to maintain the original concept and feel of exploration intact. I have tried to keep the level design the same too, otherwise it just wouldn\u2019t be the same game. There are just a few differences here and there, see if you can spot them.\n\nSome of the changes include:\n- Completely new graphics\n- Completely new songs\n- Items are not invisible anymore\n- Warps are now doors you can enter\n- The hud shows important item collection progress\n- Automatically saved progress\n- Some bugs have been fixed\n- Improved performance", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-pitfall-30th-anniversary-edition", "videos": [{"id": 139521, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "U_suBkkKJZk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_suBkkKJZk", "title": "Super Pitfall' 30th Anniversary Edition (NES) Graphical Mod | full game session \ud83c\udfae", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U_suBkkKJZk/sddefault.jpg"}]}
