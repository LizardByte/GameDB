Scoring increses your time, while unneeded taps reduce it. Now hurry up and stay ahead! You get better the more you play, and train your pattern-recognition in real life too. It's a typical game to pass some time in a friendly competition, while sharpening your wits.", "summary": "Brain Pump is a puzzle game: you rotate the blocks to make horizontal or vertical rows, or 4 blocks in a square, to score.
