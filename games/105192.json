It builds on the rich character base from the original work to create a new MOBA experience. The game retains the elegant Japanese aesthetics and original voice talents to faithfully recreate Kyoto in the Heian era. With innovative map designs, a Fog of War mode, and an even larger set of Shikigami skills, players are in for more fun and greater challenges as they battle to reign supreme. The paid amulet system is now replaced by a free Onmyodo system. This levels the playing field. Players from all over the world are connected, and the all-new 3v3v3 Battle Royale will provide players with a fun and novel MOBA experience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/onmyoji-arena", "videos": [{"id": 30889, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "o2KCGQc3CSM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2KCGQc3CSM", "title": "Onmyoji Arena PV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o2KCGQc3CSM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
