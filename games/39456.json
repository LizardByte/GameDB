If one player is playing the game alone, another one cannot join him or her on this area, and if either player dies on it, they will not be able to continue - also, if one player was playing alone and enters his or her initials on the game's high score table after losing his or her last life and not inserting another coin to continue in time, dying on the Challenging Area, or clearing the Challenging Area, the other player's score will always be given as 7650 (Namco's goroawase number, even though, unlike in Toy Pop, Cosmo Gang: The Video, and Lucky & Wild, both scores are not combined).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nebulas-ray"}
