In the event you\u2019re detected, run to escape the immediate danger quickly, but running is limited to the amount of stamina you\u2019ve got, so use it wisely. The animatronics also evolve as the night progresses, which means you\u2019ll need to adapt if you want to survive.\n\nFreddy Fazbear himself is your most dependable ally, acting as a guide and protector through the Pizzaplex, giving you shortcuts, insider tips, and warnings about the challenges you\u2019ll face. You can also hop inside Freddy\u2019s oversized birthday-cake-hatch, allowing you to hide and march around undetected. You will need to be thoughtful about how and when you use Freddy because he\u2019s only got so much power and requires frequent stops at recharge stations.", "summary": "Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games loved by millions of players from all over the globe.
