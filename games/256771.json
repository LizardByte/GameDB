This conflict, spurred on by colonial ambitions and the infamous destruction of the USS Maine, was decided at sea in two short and brutally decisive engagements at Manila Bay and Santiago de Cuba. With no ability to support their troops abroad, Spain admitted defeat within just five months.\n\nThe war took place during a period of unprecedented changes in naval technology and doctrine, with stark differences from one ship to the next. Both sides suffered from a variety of unforeseen challenges, be it from lack of experience or preparedness. In the end, the numerical, qualitative and home-field advantages carried the day for the United States.\n\nBut what if events had turned out differently? In addition to the two historical and rather one-sided battles, this game also depicts many hypothetical situations in which commanders made different decisions at key moments or had more resources to work with. Spanish soldiers fought gallantly even with their serious handicaps. When given better tools and tactics, perhaps they could have changed the course of history?", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/naval-campaigns-spanish-american-war"}
