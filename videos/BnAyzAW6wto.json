Very excited to announce this new test build for Neyyah, a first person point n click adventure puzzle game, influenced by the original Myst and Riven games, available to wishlist now on Steam at https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289720/Neyyah/.\n\nThe main purpose for this particular test build was to implement the menu UI into the game - for the first time. Quite exciting ... This includes the save/load functions, the options menu (including enabling or disabling transitions, movement animations and a hotspot hint system - all showcased in this video), and a new game and quit game function. It depicts a scene in the game called the Felitsu Island Walkway, which was originally called Marble Island Walkway, beginning it's developments in 2018.  I have released a few little test builds over Neyyah's development period (such as the 2019 Spore Docks  Island test build, available to watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX779NCAGEM&t=132s and the Watch Tower test build from late last year, available in a commentary video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o_9rLmzRUI&t=2009s), but this new one really feels like Neyyah is becoming a proper game now, with the added menu features - and inventory features too!\n\nAbout Neyyah:\n\nNeyyah is a first-person point-and-click adventure puzzle game, an archaeological investigation, set within a collection of remote almost abandoned islands, separated by a series of complex portal machinery and laced with the fingerprints of two very intriguing cultures.\nUpon waking up from a strange dream, you find yourself transported to a place called Olujay, where you meet Vamir, who sends you to Neyyah in the hope you will be safe there. For reasons you will discover upon your many explorations, Vamir needs you for a matter of great urgency.\n\nA wrong must be righted. A civilisation avenged. A secret revealed.\n\nYou end up on Neyyah with only a small amount of knowledge given to you by the frantic Vamir on what you\u2019re supposed to do when you\u2019re there.\nThings don't go as planned. In order to return to Olujay and reach Vamir, you will have to explore Neyyah \u2013 linking together the mechanical contraptions, rusted levers and blue plasma portal systems scattered throughout the bizarre landscapes, as you learn about the cultures that have shaped Neyyah.\nNot everything is as it seems, and as you wander further into Neyyah's ancient heart, your discoveries will lead you to uncover the very truths behind the fate of Earth itself ...\n\nI started work on Neyyah in July 2018 and it's been an amazing journey so far. Feel free to follow the progress on the following social media links:\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/DefyRealityEntertainment\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/NeyyahGame\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/defyrealityentertainment\nI also run a Patreon which helps support the game development full time, plus it opens a whole new world of exclusive behind the scenes content to fans, and enables me to connect with the Neyyah audience at a much deeper level. From $1 a month, patrons have access to all written content, plus name on the end credits of the game, and access to showcase footage such as this, with extras - such as the commentary / designer insight into the build which I'll be releasing to Patreon very soon! There's also some great special offers that come up where patrons get to win prizes, and the tier levels offer rewards such as signed desktop artwork, audio/video calls, signed paintings, special edition physical copies of the game and more!
