They turned to their ally and pressured the mayor to inform Britain of what has happened. The British Military immediately took action by storming the island, isolating roads, buildings, and people to try and quarantine everything before things get even more out of hand. Within a week the island was officially labelled as being Quarantined nothing is to get in or off of the island. The elimination squad hired to quarantine the island went under the code name Dead Sector.\n\nThe British Press began to search the island for clues to findout what happened and how all of this had come about. It had become quickly realized that this was no ordinary island and that many of the citizens of the town had mentioned that seeing military personnel on the island was very common. This island was being used for the development of Biological Weapons and the military were using people as there lab rats. The British Military began to pressure there Parliament to ban anyone from going to the island entirely, even blow it up if if it must be done.\n\nThe British suspected that the Russian Government may have instigated the scientists in-charge of this project by bribing them to look other way.....Money, its always money. Once a person becomes infected by the virus it quickly spreads through the blood stream causing genetic mutations. The cells start to form giant boils and tumors throughout the body. The populace of the island has been forcibly divided by the military into two groups, Infected and Non-Infected. Those who are infected remain in a quarantined room constantly monitored. If the infection persists to get worse they are often killed. Those who are Non-Infected are under tight surveillance and are fed very little.", "summary": "The year is July 18th, 1993, off the coast of Britain to the North East, there is an island that had a dark secret. A terrible epidemic had started to occur only, but a few months ago. A horrendous and violent infection had began to spread all across the island attacking anything or anyone in it's path with tremendous speed and savage force leaving few survivors in it's wake.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
