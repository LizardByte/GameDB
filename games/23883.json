Cliff and Linda Beaumont along with their children Sally and John moved to Shady Hollow to open a coal mining operation. The woods outside of Shady Hollow were known to be rich with coal, and being in the coal business, the Beaumonts\u2019 saw this as a great opportunity.\n\nSeveral months after their arrival, their daughter Sally went missing. For weeks, the towns people searched the woods and the coal mines but all they would find is a shoe belonging to Sally by the Hollow Creek. Most believed that Sally must have fallen into the creek and drowned while others believed it was the curse of The Hollow Creek Witch.\n\nA year later, both Cliff and Linda Beaumont grew ill and soon died. It was rumored that the loss of their daughter was too much for them to handle. John, being the sole remaining member of the Beaumont family was taken to an orphanage.\n\nAbout thirty five years later (1975), John, now a grown man was approached by another mining company looking to buy the rights to the Beaumont Coal Company. The coal company was abandoned after the death of his parents so John agreed to sell his share of the company. On the morning of March 15th, 1975, John and two miners would travel through the woods to take mineral samples at one of the more lucrative mining sites in Shady Hollow. John would be the only person to return from that trip.\n\nAfter several searches, the two miners were found. What the police saw would haunt them the rest of their lives. John Beaumont was immediately arrested for the murders and spent his remaining days in the Shady Hollow Mental Hospital.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, 5 indie film makers travel to Shady Hollow to do a documentary about the disappearance of the two miners in 1975 and the Beaumont family. After arriving, they soon find out that the townspeople of Shady Hollow don\u2019t welcome outsiders and are resistant to speak about the troubled past of the town.
