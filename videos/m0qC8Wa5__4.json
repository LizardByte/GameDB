Starting out on a quiet corner in a small town, job offers soon start pouring in from iconic cities around the globe where it\u2019s up to you to guide rude pedestrians, impatient drivers, and the occasional meteorite along before road rage strikes. Sound easy? Think again! This chaotic VR game throws in monsters, (un)natural disasters, and up to 4 non-VR friends in (couch) party mode! \n\nTraffic Jams\u2019 couch party mode unites VR and non-VR players in a frenzied action multiplayer experience that is both competitive and cooperative in nature. Up to 4 non-VR frenemies can turn up the heat as they work together to unleash chaos on the crossroads. With an array of possibilities at their fingertips, the mobile players can cause crashes, distract the VR player with annoyances such as bees and zombies and even break out the occasional meteorite - all while the VR player desperately tries to maintain order.\n\nTraffic Jams is releasing on Oculus Quest, PlayStation VR and major PC VR headsets in September of this year. \n\nFor more news about Traffic Jams, find us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and subscribe to the newsletter at trafficjams-vr.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m0qC8Wa5__4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m0qC8Wa5__4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m0qC8Wa5__4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m0qC8Wa5__4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m0qC8Wa5__4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Traffic Jams VR | Multiplayer Trailer [PEGI]", "description": "#SteamGamesFestival #TrafficJamsVR #VertigoGames\n\nSteam Games Festival - Get the Demo!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1301930/Traffic_Jams/\n\nCas & Chary gameplay video: https://youtu.be/lB_4-au4S6A\n\nIn the world of Traffic Jams all traffic lights have gone out and you are the only one who can keep traffic flowing in the face of outrageous events and flagrant road rage.
