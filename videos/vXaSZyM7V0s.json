{"id": "vXaSZyM7V0s", "snippet": {"title": "Genma Taisen: Harmageddon (PC-8001) Longplay", "description": "Genma Taisen, also known as Harmageddon, was the name of a series of novels from the 70s that saw a variety of adaptations across all forms of media. This game by Pony Canyon, however, is based on the movie from 1983 and serves as an interactive romp through key moments of the movie.\n\n\nFor most of the time you just have to press y for yes and n for no to make certain decisions. You also gather a party of several \"psychic warriors\" that use psychic powers to fight against the evil minions of Genma (just think of Genma as anime Galactus). Therefore, you often have to select a certain party member to take specific actions or to fight a battle. \n\n\nHowever, the game is very strict and there seems to be only one way to finish this. Any deviation from these choices, no matter how small it may be, will result in a game over and you will have to try the game again. This was a bit annoying since loading took quite a while and redoing all of these scenes and choices again became quite the chore after a while. Sometimes you could even have ruined your playthrough by an earlier decision without even noticing much later in the game!\n\n\nThere were supposedly some more versions of this game available, on the PC-8801, FM-7 and MZ-2000. Unfortunately, I can't find them online so I can only play and show off this version of the game. And this might even be the worst version since the developer even admitted so more or less during the beginning of the game when that wall of text slowly scrolls up. It basically says that the PC-8001 can not display the pretty graphics that were drawn for the other, slightly more advanced computers. So this version had to be gimped, but it was slightly altered and made more challenging. Figuring out the right way to beat this game was indeed quite challenging and took a lot of trial and error, but it was quite satisfying. Still, the game is ultimately very short and unfortunately even leaves out some cool moments from the movie.\n\n\n#retro #harmageddon #genmataisen", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXaSZyM7V0s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXaSZyM7V0s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXaSZyM7V0s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXaSZyM7V0s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vXaSZyM7V0s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Genma Taisen: Harmageddon (PC-8001) Longplay", "description": "Genma Taisen, also known as Harmageddon, was the name of a series of novels from the 70s that saw a variety of adaptations across all forms of media.
