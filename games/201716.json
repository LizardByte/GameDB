After successfully completing each level, they are rewarded with a little fact about owls.\nThe Parliament School for Owls is very serious about the Buddy System. Every Owl has a buddy, and is not allowed to come in from recess without them. Your job is to help the Owls find their buddy and get in for lunch! Learn about Owls, watch the seasons change and see how quickly you can send the Owls home. Can you earn 3 stars in every level? Every 25 levels the seasons change from Spring to Summer, Fall and Winter. They can earn up to 3 stars per level depending on how quickly they clear the screen, and go back as many times as they wish to retry. \u2028\u2028", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/owls"}
