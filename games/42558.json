Game modes include an Exhibition mode, an All Star game, a Pennant Race, and a Watch mode.\n\nWhile Exhibition mode can be either a one or two player affair, the All Star game is strictly for two players to compete in. When playing, batting and pitching are both done from a behind the batter viewpoint.\n\nThe pennant race involves 6 teams playing each other throughout a season consisting of a number of games chosen by the player.\n\nWatch mode lets the player watch two computer controlled teams play each other.\n\nOptions include either having automatic or manual fielding, having errors and/or wind on or off, and being able to either skip or watch opponents pennant games. There is also the Cold Game option, which lets a baseball game end when a team is winning by the chosen amount of runs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/extra-innings"}
