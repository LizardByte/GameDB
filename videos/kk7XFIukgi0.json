You must do whatever it takes in order to survive this hellish, grotesque prison you are trapped within lest you become the next victim of the dangerous creatures inhabiting this horrifying island. You will have to remember, however that trying to survive the monsters\u2019 ambushes and attacks may be of course the player\u2019s primary objective, but even more importance should be placed on finding a way out of the cursed land before the player\u2019s time finally runs out.\n\nGreenlight: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=927704896", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kk7XFIukgi0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kk7XFIukgi0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kk7XFIukgi0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kk7XFIukgi0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kk7XFIukgi0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nightmare at the lighthouse Greenlight trailer", "description": "The game will take you to an unknown island as you assume the role of a young ingenious mechanic traveling there in order to repair an old malfunctioning lighthouse, but that however would not be as easy as one would assume.
