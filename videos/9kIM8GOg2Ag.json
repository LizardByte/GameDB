The game was to be published by Tengen, presumably in 1990.\n\nIn this video, I start off with a drive around the speed course. Then, at 4:20, I reset and take a couple of laps on the stunt course. Don't worry, I did wreck so that you can see the smashed windshield. \n\nIf you've played the SNES version of Race Drivin' (https://youtu.be/CKfkZCvdqqY ), I wouldn't think you'd expect much out any attempt at something similar on the NES. The 16-bit sequel that THQ published in 1992 is one of the console's worst games thanks to its inability to maintain anything higher than 3-4 frames per second. Until the fan-made patch that finally fixed the game was released last week (after 29 long years!), it was an unplayable trainwreck, slathered in poo.\n\nBut much to my surprise, even in its incomplete state, this NES conversion of Hard Drivin' is an amazing effort. If you'd like to read more about the game's development, there is an interview posted on The Lost Levels with Mark Morris, a programmer who was working at Domark at the time.

Talk about an impressive-to-see game on the NES! The elevation of the road changes, you can jump ramps and go through loops, there are other 3D cars on the road with you, and the best part - it actually runs at a playable framerate!
