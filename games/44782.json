Each \"floor\" of the tower has an EXP total that the player must reach in order to advance. If the player defeats all of a floor's opponents without meeting the goal, one final opponent will appear. If, after defeating this extra opponent, the player still fails to meet the goal, Arle is booted from the tower and the game ends. The EXP goals vary from version to version; for example, Super Puyo Puyo Tsu requires twice as many points to clear the first floor as the arcade or Mega Drive versions.", "summary": "This game is a Japan-only port of the second game in the Puyo Puyo series originally made for the Arcades by Sega. It's based on the Sega Saturn port, but featuring a modified version of Remix's Practice mode that incorporates the Saturn version's previously-exclusive Beginner characters. Starting with this port, Minako Ozawa replaces Mami Inoue as Arle's voice actress.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-2-ketteiban", "videos": [{"id": 89896, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "c-yVNc6Xkdw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-yVNc6Xkdw", "title": "Puyo Puyo Tsuu Ketteiban (PSX) - Normal Mode Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-yVNc6Xkdw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
