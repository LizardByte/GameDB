VB is a cancelled remake of the 1983 arcade platformer Mario Bros. intended to launch alongside the Virtual Boy in August 1995. The game was first unveiled at Shoshikai Software Exhibition 1994 alongside the Virtual Boy itself, Space Pinball (then known as Pinball VB), and Teleroboxer. Screenshots from the game would appear in various magazines until July 1995. Its last appearance was in issue 13 of EGM\u00b2, where the game was mistakenly referred to as the actually released game Mario Clash, which is likely what Mario Bros. VB evolved into.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
