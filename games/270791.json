The protagonist is a high-school student, who also happens to be the brother of Haru Okamoto, the main love interest in Ribbon. Like in most other games in this series, the story revolves around the main character's effort to have sex with every female character, including school mates and colleagues in part-time jobs.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to the one in Ribbon or in the previous Bangai-hen: the player proceeds through still screens, typically depleting the available menu commands (verbs and object sub-menus) until a new command appears or an event is triggered. Like in most other games in the series, there are multiple dead ends and possible actions that lead to premature end of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tenshi-tachi-no-gogo-iii-bangai-hen"}
