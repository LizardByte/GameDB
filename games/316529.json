This port replaces the dice, cards, and written rules with a Nintendo Game Boy or your web browser, but you'll need to bring your own pen and paper.\n\nIf you've never played a solo RPG before, it can seem awkward at first, but go with it; it can be really rewarding. For more info on solo RPGs and how to play them, Dicebreaker made a great guide.\n\nIf you wish to support this game, please consider donating to the original project.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alone-among-the-stars"}
