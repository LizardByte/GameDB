The game is offered \"free-to-play\"; charging gamers for downloading extra content, aircraft or scenery. \n \nIn July 2012, Microsoft ceased development of the game permanently to re-align its \"long-term goals and development plans.\" The core game, which includes the Icon A5 aircraft and the Big Island of Hawaii scenery area, remains free to download. It can then be expanded with additional downloadable content (DLC) from the integrated Games For Windows Marketplace on Xbox-Live . \n \nMicrosoft closed the Xbox.com PC Marketplace on August 22, 2013. Previous items purchased are still usable, and the Flight software may still be downloadable, but no items can be acquired through the marketplace.", "videos": [{"id": 35545, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "JjmAGvBzxKY"}, {"id": 35546, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "ndAl9tXJad4"}, {"id": 35547, "name": "Overview Trailer", "video_id": "Dc3oycoR5lQ"}, {"id": 35548, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "uLe0YOyU1vw"}]}
