Changing the world, one explosion at a time.\n\nAs a member of the Turbotz Research Intern Program (It's a TRIP) you'll be monitoring virtual tests of Turbotz being used to destroy Antroids. The test requires substantial power to operate and can be run longer if the Antroids don't cause it to overheat.\n\nHowever we have substantial data on the effects of basic Turbotz on basic Antroids. The more you alter the subjects the more substantial the research that can be done. Perform well enough in a testing area and we may even reach a breakthrough!\n\nThere is a lot of work to be done and research can be used to open up new testing environments. It's staggered so that you dear intern can learn to respect their power before the most devastating Turbotz are unleashed on the most ferocious Antroids", "summary": "Turbotz Testing 20XX is a tower defense game infused with clicker gameplay and rogue-lite elements. Join the Turbotz Institute in researching the explosive potential of turret robots by testing them under diverse conditions and parameters.\n\nCollect research, unlock new elements to experiment with, and push the limits of existing turbotz through dynamic transformations. Discover the countless varieties of antroids and the creative ways to obliterate them!\n\nChange the world\u2014one explosion at a time.\n\nTwitch Integration: Connect with Twitch to enable full audience participation in a 'Twitch Plays'-style experience with advanced customization options. Decide how viewers can interact\u2014whether through structured voting or pure chaos.\n\nViewers can join the side of the Turbotz or the Antroids, with their chosen allegiance displayed alongside their username.
