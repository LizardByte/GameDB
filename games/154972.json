As it turns out, there is.\n\nAfter receiving an unassuming dream catcher as a gift one day, Riza soon finds herself following a character she thought she\u2019d made up through a mysterious nexus realm and into a parallel world, where she is supposedly one of seven \u201cDreamers\u201d of legend. She gets what she\u2019s always wanted\u2013an adventure, and a greater purpose\u2026sort of. The problem is, no one seems to know exactly why the Dreamers are there, just that it means something very, very bad is coming. It\u2019s up to Riza, her new werewolf guardian, Luna, and the assortment of companions they collect along the way to unite with the other Dreamers, and figure out why they were summoned\u2026before it\u2019s too late.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
