As a single hero or a group of adventurers, it is your mission to descend the depths of his abode, confront him in his hellish lair, and destroy him forever. Whether you will simply meet your doom in the dungeons as many have before you or rise to victory against the Baron and his hellspawn is ultimately up to you.\n\nBarony is a 3D, first-person roguelike with cooperative multiplayer that brings back the cryptic and intricate designs of classic roguelikes such as Nethack and melds them with RPGs like Ultima Underworld, System Shock, and Daggerfall. Challenge is the calling card of this hard-boiled dungeon-crawler.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IGoKEvWyHPc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IGoKEvWyHPc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IGoKEvWyHPc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IGoKEvWyHPc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IGoKEvWyHPc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Barony: Cursed Edition - Trailer", "description": "https://www.gog.com/game/barony_cursed_edition\n\nBarony tells the story of an undead lich named Baron Herx, who terrorized the town of Hamlet in a previous life and is now holding out in a vast subterranean complex known as the Devil's Bastion.
