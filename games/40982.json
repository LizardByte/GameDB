The player can move with 8-way joystick and control 3 buttons - one to hit, another to fart (toxic gas from your butt) and another to launch timed bombs.\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy enemies, collect objects & power-ups, solve puzzles and defeat the final bosses. We lose a life when we lose one of the three hearts with which we begin.\n\nWe can choose a male (Gukjung) character who strikes with his head and a female (Guksoon) who strikes with a mallet.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/burglar-x"}
