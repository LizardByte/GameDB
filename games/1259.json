Your character's vehicle may be a little cart, trike, or box, for example. Weapons include rockets, Salty Balls, Cheesy Poofs, the beloved Cow and even an Anal probe. All of the voices are also included, making it feel more like the real cartoon than a rally game. You can also play an all-on-all 4 player mode.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 859, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4c_8vGh4DO8"}]}
