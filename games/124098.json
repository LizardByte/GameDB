Both loved each other, but the villagers didn't like their relationship, and the mermaid had to leave. The young man sailed looking for her, but he didn't return. This story is told by a young boy to the protagonist as a young girl in a lighthouse next to the beach. She doesn't talk due to her shyness, but the boy asks her if she's a mermaid and promises her that they'll meet again.", "summary": "Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side: 2nd Season is an an enhanced port to the Nintendo DS featuring additional content from the Playstation 2's \"Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side: 2nd Kiss\".", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tokimeki-memorial-girls-side-2nd-season", "videos": [{"id": 76319, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "qs424N3I_Jo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs424N3I_Jo", "title": "[Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side 2nd Season] Playthrough - Part 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qs424N3I_Jo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 105211, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-Uf2Vk1RaYk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uf2Vk1RaYk", "title": "Nintendo Switch\u300c\u3068\u304d\u3081\u304d\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb Girl\u2019s Side\u300d1st Love,2nd Season,3rd Story \u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Uf2Vk1RaYk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
