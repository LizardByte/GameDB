After months of hard work, I am happy to present this Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red ROM hack with all 151 Pok\u00e9mon replaced by Kirby characters. From classic enemies like Waddle Dee and Whispy Woods, to the more obscure like Tornadon and Brobo, every single one has a full unique moveset, stat spread, abilities, typing, Pok\u00e9dex entry, and everything else!\n\nMassive shoutout and thank you to the developers of Hex Maniac Advance. Without it, I would've never been able to make this.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nXozi7V0Ado/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nXozi7V0Ado/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nXozi7V0Ado/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nXozi7V0Ado/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nXozi7V0Ado/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pok\u00e9mon Puffy Pink ROM Hack Trailer", "description": "Download the game patch here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uJPFnEnRMw3-g6NLi-haz2k_sYOXyxWa?usp=drive_link\n\nWelcome to Pok\u00e9mon Puffy Pink!
