It is easy to play, non violent, and fun. The game features a charming turtle in its mission to save the bay where it used to live, from the invaders' attack. \nThe story behind this game is really thrilling. The turtles lived happily on their island, until one day they were invaded by dangerous octopuses that got there to take over the bay. They caused a lot of destruction, killing almost all the turtles. And one of the few survivors, is back to the bay to take revenge. \nThe goal of the game is to restore the piece in the bay, by destroying all of the octopuses you meet on your way. To do so you have to guide your turtle with the mouse, the keyboard or joystick, and make it touch the octopuses while they are still in their eggs.
