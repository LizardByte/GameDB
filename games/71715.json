The X-Men are realistically modeled complete with their mutant powers (the Wolverine clone, for example, will not stay down, imitating the original). In multiplayer game, you can take on the role of any of the X-Men for mutant deathmatch action in five original maps including the X-Men mansion.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-the-ravages-of-apocalypse"}
