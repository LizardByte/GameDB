This leads them on a wild romp through six different areas to snatch different things such as a popcorn machine and a TV for themselves. There are several mini games as bonuses in the game.\n\nAll through the game, they try to take these things while avoiding the Sniffer, (Dwayne the Verminator), who tries to defeat them by using mind-controlled vermin he has captured as his \"henchmen.\" At one point, many animals, including weasels, badgers, and even Vincent the bear are controlled.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
