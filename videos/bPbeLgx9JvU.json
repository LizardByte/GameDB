Shoot. Score. Master the vertical combat.\n\n3D MOVEMENT FREEDOM\nRun, jump and double jump to get yourself into position, wall jump to evade incoming harm, pull yourself up with the grappling hook to get the high ground or grapple-swing around corners to surprise your enemies.

Shotguns and grenade launchers? You got them. Rockets? Let them rain! Your VR dream is to become a turret with massive firepower? Go with dual miniguns! Double handed weapons have both primary and secondary fire modes letting you choose the perfect reaction for any situation. By the way you always have your melee weapon - the energy blade - on your side. You know, for slicing cake.\n\nPlay the game any way you like, use the grappling hook with a weapon or dual wield any weapon combination. Mobility versus firepower. Your call.\n\nDid we mention that you can also summon an energy bow and shoot an arrow any time?\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nMultiplayer is the heart of the Tournament. Starting individually or with your friends, matchmaking will find you worthy opponents and let you fight in various game modes on engaging, stylized maps which were created with verticality in mind. The currently available game modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture Point and Mutant.\n\nDuring multiplayer you will visit a plethora of carefully crafted arenas, both outdoors and closed space maps for your all-terrain grapple experience. From sci-fi factories through cave excavations to Japanese temples or Greek monuments and more. You'll certainly find some maps to your liking.\n\nBots: Feel free to play with bots to master your skills or have some light-hearted fun.\n\nPRACTICE RANGE\nYeah, we have this too for 3D training purposes. With drones... with hats. You can try all the weapons in sandbox mode here.\n\nCUSTOMIZATIONS\nCustomize your character to your liking with crazy hats and accessories.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bPbeLgx9JvU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bPbeLgx9JvU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bPbeLgx9JvU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bPbeLgx9JvU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bPbeLgx9JvU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Grapple Tournament VR - Alpha Trailer", "description": "Oculus Quest: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5133055276721830\nSteam VR: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384320/\nJoin Discord: https://discord.gg/A4fUKDC\nOculus Rift: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/3542930235728652/\n\nGrapple Tournament is a VR Arcade Shooter for adrenaline-packed vertical combat.
