{"id": "XZQfCpGHVRw", "snippet": {"title": "Hazardous Course 2 in 1:21:22 (100%)", "description": "This here's been something I've wanted to do for quite a while. A speedrun of the Half-Life mod Hazardous Course 2 by Richman.\n\nBetween all practice runs and just learning the maps, this run has been in production for about 12 hours total as a conservative estimate since around the start of July 2019. Is the end product perfect? lol no. I made quite a load of small mistakes and even a couple of bigger mistakes that cost me quite a bit of time. The run can definitely go sub-1:20 but I probably won't be the one to do it. Nontheless, I am very pleased with how this run came out. Enjoy!\n\n\nTechnical Information\n\nMod: Hazardous Course 2 (For Half-Life)\nMod Author: Richman\nYear of Release: 2012\nTimer Start: On load of hc2a1.\nTimer Stop: When player control is lost as the ending scene starts.\nFinal Time: 1:21:22.376\nTools Used: Bunnymod XT (by YaLTeR)\nRun Category: 100% Scripted\nExtent of Scripted Play: Autojump and Bhop Cap Removal, that's it.\n\nThis probably wouldn't be accepted to any leaderboards, by the way. I forgot to record demos and I forgot to cap my framerate. Oops. Still an unofficial World Record anyway, right? I can't find anything faster that doesn't involve save-warping. Perhaps I'll do something more official one day, claim a spot on a leaderboard. That said though, I mostly do this for fun and for my own satisfaction. I don't take speedrunning super seriously.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZQfCpGHVRw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZQfCpGHVRw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZQfCpGHVRw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZQfCpGHVRw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XZQfCpGHVRw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hazardous Course 2 in 1:21:22 (100%)", "description": "This here's been something I've wanted to do for quite a while.
