The story is linear, unavoidable and (hopefully) thought-provoking. You experience his perceptions, fall under the consequences of his decisions, and meet everyone who didn\u2019t change him.\n\nGameplay is minimal, and serves only to move from one part of the (admittedly) text-heavy story to the next. The game fiercely attempts to be worth it.\n\nActual Sunlight is not appropriate for children. It features mature themes and an adult-workplace amount of profanity. And it does so immediately.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/actual-sunlight", "videos": [{"id": 5814, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0qsdIveYJ0Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qsdIveYJ0Y", "title": "Actual Sunlight - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0qsdIveYJ0Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
