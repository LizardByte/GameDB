After completing the main storyline, there are additional missions to carry out with the Justice League to unlock 5 extra characters within the Batcomputer. Minikit pieces collected will unlock a new character (one for each), Red Bricks unlock abilities in the Extras menu and Sound Bites (introduced in this game and consist of blue musical notes) contain mini-vocal dialogue from certain characters.\n\nThe Touch Screen for 3DS and DS consoles is utilised to select characters, choose the character's current abilities and to choose a character to play as at anytime (only used for Free Play), while the action takes place on the Top Screen. In contrast, all the action takes place on the PS Vita's single screen.\n\nThe handheld versions also save current level progress made and can be accessed at any time from the Load Game screen.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lego-batman-2-dc-super-heroes--1"}
