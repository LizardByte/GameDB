Little now is known of that time, other than that it reshaped the earth and brought magic into the world. The time of the Singularity was brought to an end by a cataclysm known as the Schism, an event that separated magic from the Runiverse, sending it to a realm called the Elsewhere, and with it, the wizards of the Singularity. For many centuries following the Schism, all seemed well; humanity moved on and some remnants of magic remained to aid in the rebuilding of society.\n\nBut all was not well. Something was growing along the edge of reality, eating away the Runiverse, bit by bit, a plague known as the Absence; a creeping fog that swallowed not just the land, but all memory of what was once there.\n\nNow, the world is on the brink. The Absence has nearly swallowed the whole of the physical Runiverse. Nearly all has been forgotten. What is remembered is fragmented and unreliable. But there is still hope.\n\nWith a little help from the few remaining mages in the physical world, a window from the Elsewhere has become a door to the Runiverse. The wizards of the past who were once banished must return magic to the world in order to restore the memory of what was, and push back the Absence.", "summary": "Forgotten Runiverse is a grand fantasy MMORPG full of magic and wonder based on the lore of Magic Machine's Forgotten Runes Wizard\u2019s Cult NFT Collection.
