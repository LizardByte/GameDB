Shame Legacy is developed by Fairyship Games and Revenant Games and takes players on a terrifying journey set in a cult-occupied village.\n\nMeridiem Games will be responsible for designing, manufacturing, and distributing the special boxed Shame Legacy - The Cult Edition, which will be available in specialist stores across Europe this summer. The special edition will include a specially designed case with a unique design as well as a metal postcard.\n\nIn Shame Legacy, you attempt to survive the chase of enraged cultists using stealth and escape mechanics. Meanwhile, an eerie danger looms over\u2026\n\nWaking up confused in a 19th-century equivalent of an anger management convention, you quickly realize that: 1. A hunt is taking place, 2. You\u2019re the prey they\u2019re after. The legacy of your family seems to have caught up to you, but maybe not in the way you'd expect. Apparently, an inheritance doesn't always mean fancy yachts.\n\nIf you hope to get to the bottom of it all, you\u2019ve got to move silently and avoid contact. The villagers are all over the place, looking for you. And they're damn fast if they see or hear you... Your mental ability will come in handy when solving puzzles. So will your cane, which also serves as your defense weapon to fend off attacking villagers.\n\nGetting detected isn\u2019t the end of the world if you\u2019re fast enough and can keep your nerves in check. Having just woken up, the village doctor would have some harsh things to say about your health status and stress resistance. If you find yourself close to the edge, there's always relief to be found. Disclaimer: This isn't a drug commercial.\n\nShame Legacy will be hitting the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on May 30th, 2023.\n\n#ShameLegacy\n\nVisit Our Site: https://aggrogamer.com/\nRead Our News: https://linktr.ee/aggrogamer\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Aggrogamer/\nFollow On Twitter: https://twitter.com/AggroGamer\nFollow On Instagram: https://instagram.com/AggroGamer", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rX-FyDVOBeE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rX-FyDVOBeE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rX-FyDVOBeE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rX-FyDVOBeE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rX-FyDVOBeE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Shame Legacy \u2014 The Cult Edition", "description": "Meridiem Games has teamed up with publisher Destructive Creation to release a special boxed Cult Edition of the first-person horror game Shame Legacy for PlayStation 5, scheduled to release in June.
