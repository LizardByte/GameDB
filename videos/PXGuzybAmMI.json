Before setting off, you will purchase and customize your Landship, recruit crew members with their own backgrounds and skills, trade supplies and materials, and take on contracts. Once you venture into the March, you must manage your crew's daily lives, witness their evolving relationships and stories, and defend your moving home in tactical landship battles as you explore the vast uncharted territories.\n\n\u25b6 Follow us on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/strangers_gamestudio/\n\u25b6 Follow us on X https://x.com/strangers_games\n\u25b6 Join the community on Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/TrailblazersGame/\n\u25b6 A game crafted by Strangers https://strangers.dev\n\n*Reveal Trailer Credits*\nAnimation: Jean da Ros\nArt & Trailblazers Logo: Adrien Cantone\nMusic & Sound Design: Vincent Borcard\nEditing: Jean da Ros, Adrien Cantone & Arnaud Gattlen\nVoice-Over: Bethan Dixon Bate, Tom Schalk, Abigail Paige Wahl\n\n\u25b6 Wishlist now on Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671300/Trailblazers_Into_the_March", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PXGuzybAmMI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PXGuzybAmMI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PXGuzybAmMI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PXGuzybAmMI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PXGuzybAmMI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Trailblazers: Into the March - Reveal Trailer", "description": "\u25b6 Wishlist now on Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671300/Trailblazers_Into_the_March\n\u25b6 Join our Discord https://discord.gg/q88CFh8m6t\n\n*Trailblazers: Into the March* is a roguelite colony-sim that integrates tactical combat with the emotional journey of procedural characters.
