Horse Racing (US) or horseracing (UK) is an equestrian sport that has been practiced for millennia. It is inextricably associated with gambling. The common sobriquet for Thoroughbred horse racing is The Sport of Kings.\n\nHorse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: \"flat\" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2008 generated a world-wide market worth around US$115 billion.\n\nJapan conducts more than 21,000 horse races a year in one of three types: flat racing, jump racing (races over hurdles), and Ban'ei Racing (also called Draft Racing).\n\nThere are a total of thirty racetracks in Japan. Ten of these tracks are known as \"central tracks\", where most of Japan's top races are conducted. Races at these ten tracks are conducted by the Japan Racing Association (JRA), which operates under the oversight of the Japanese government. The remaining twenty tracks are operated by municipal racing authorities and run under the affiliation of the National Association of Racing (NAR). Two tracks, Sapporo Racecourse and Chukyo Racecourse, run separate meetings under either JRA or NAR jurisdiction.\n\nPower Stakes Grade 1 is the second game in Tose Software game series featuring the new data of the new season over the previous game. The game again features the 3d engine to watch the race in different camera angles that the player select in the game main menu.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/power-stakes-grade-1", "videos": [{"id": 43075, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "z2-BBcAiyfo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2-BBcAiyfo", "title": "PlayStation - Power Stakes Grade 1 (1997) - Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z2-BBcAiyfo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 43076, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "HP3xeb9BNtg"}]}
