The planet does not offer its last inhabitants more than toxic and radiated wastelands and anything which has not died already turned into an abnormal and horrifying mutation. The remains of humanity have sealed themselves into last bastions of life and technology. Neocron - a city surrounded by massive walls and regulated by the strict laws of the CityAdmin and their Copbots - tries to stay alive in this dying world. Meanwhile, an old enemy rises again: The almost anarchistic Dome of York, Neocron's opponent in the Ceres wars, shows up again. Is a new war inevitable?", "summary": "Neocron 2: Beyond Dome of York is a 2004 video game which is a follow-up to 2002's Neocron. Originally slated to be an expansion pack Neocron 2 was released separately under a new publisher, 10tacle Studios AG.\n\nNeocron 2 features a large persistent world and massive multiplayer gaming. Divided into two factions, Neocron and Dome of York, and separated by the vast radiated wastelands between the cities, the players try to build a career in one of the many industrial and military organizations. There are various player classes offered, including different types of fighters, PSI powered monks and hackers. The game allows free exploring of the world, NPC missions or engaging in PvP-combat, using an Egoshooter-like interface for gameplay and fighting.\n\nNoteworthy features, amongst others, are the Hacknet (a network similar to the matrix of the pen&paper-game Shadowrun) which allows skilled hackers to travel the whole game-world through a great number of network nodes or attack enemy bases and the usability of driving and flying vehicles in the wastelands.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neocron-2-beyond-dome-of-york", "videos": [{"id": 80545, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ulM-5z9Jxqw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulM-5z9Jxqw", "title": "Neocron 2: Beyond Dome of York | Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ulM-5z9Jxqw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
