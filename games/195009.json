Our minds love challenges, and Spingram goes the extra mile to challenge players' gray matter. The goal of the game is to reconstruct the pattern presented in the preview by rotating the blocks in any direction. To align the trace perfectly you will need to examine the position and orientation of the original. If you are in trouble, you can always start over or undo the last move."}
