On the Master System, the top speed is lowered, and much of the road-side scenery has been removed, and there appears to be fewer racers on the track at any given time. While the track layouts are broadly the same, hills are less pronounced on the Master System, and take longer to complete due to the aforementioned speed issues.\n\nAll digitized sound has been removed, as has the rev counter in the HUD. The Game Gear port is much the same as the Master System conversion, but has to reduce the size of its HUD further in order to fit all important details onto the screen. This also means less of the road is visible to the player.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/road-rash--4", "collections": [{"id": 1043, "name": "Road Rash"}]}
