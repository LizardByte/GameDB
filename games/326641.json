It\u2019s an indescribable sadness, a love just beginning to bloom. It becomes an invisible pain that pierces the heart. And that\u2019s what makes up life: a cyclical series of highs and lows.\n\nTachibana Sai was born without the ability to feel pain in his heart. He spends his days eliminating any seeds of malice that sneak up on his sister, the one person he treasures, without drawing attention to himself.\n\nSick of the never ending monotony he lives through, he chances upon a meeting with Benio Matsuri, a young girl whose aloof demeanor resembles that of a beautifully crafted doll.\n\nFor the first time in his life, he encounters a heart piercing sensation that of falling in love.\n\nOn the edge between day and night, in a twilight world where the dead and living mingle, stands an apartment building called Maison sans Nom, which is home to a group of boys and girls.\n\nA ruthless boy who knows no pain in his heart. A lonely girl without any friends. A friendly girl who struggles to make connections. A prickly, ambitious girl who is keen to be of help. A boy who loves his own cute self above anything else. A mess of a woman who tries to solve everything through brute force. And a boy with a tender heart who knows no pain in his body.\n\nThis ill-assorted group of residents, hands stained with blood from battling the supernatural Maledicts, shall encounter the hearts they never knew and begin nurturing their souls.\n\nThe human heart is hut a vessel for pain.\n\nTo protect this pain akin to love\u2026 To gently break the world apart, piece by piece\u2026 Even if it means abandoning humanity. That\u2019s why the heart is but a vessel for pain.\n\nFor life blazes brilliantly, while the heart goes around in an endless cycle.", "summary": "Industry veteran Yukito Urushibara and prolific illustrator Saine join forces for the first time to craft a stunning tale about a group of young people in an eerie world of endless twilight.
