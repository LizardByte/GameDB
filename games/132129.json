Versus mode allows competition between two players; in a friendly game, the computer AI chooses an opponent for the team selected by the player; the \"Open\" mode is a tournament in which players can assign controllable teams to themselves and to the AI. The game itself can be set on \"Action\", \"Simulation\", or \"Auto\" mode, with varying degrees of realism. Pitchers and batters are controlled from a third-person view, while baserunning is viewed from an overhead perspective.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-pro-yakyuu"}
