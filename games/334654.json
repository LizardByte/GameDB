Their movements are wrong\u2014unnatural, almost inhuman. Riley barely makes it inside, but it\u2019s too late.

Strange, distorted voices echo through the halls. Her captors aren\u2019t normal. Their bodies are mutated, their behaviors erratic. As she fights her way through the facility, she meets Charlie, a smooth-talking, tech-savvy survivor who\u2019s been trapped here far longer than she has. Together, they push deeper into the facility, uncovering horrifying experiments and a truth neither of them is prepared for.\n\nRiley eventually finds Tina, alive but traumatized, locked in a research chamber. Their reunion is short-lived as a full-scale outbreak erupts\u2014their captors, now fully monstrous, turn on each other as the entire facility collapses into chaos. Fighting through hordes of creatures, they escape into the night, sprinting into the unknown.\n\nThey emerge into a vast, endless cornfield, thick with fog.

As they reach the light, everything changes.\n\nThe bunker was only the beginning. The real nightmare is just about to begin.", "summary": "A quiet evening turns into a nightmare.
