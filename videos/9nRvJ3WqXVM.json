As the sun sets and the twin moons rise, luminescent flowers shine while sleek birds glowing with mystical patterns weave ever-changing shapes across the sky. And then, minute by minute, you realize that something miraculous is unfolding before you. All of it builds to a glorious and mysterious climax -- and you can only witness all of this thanks to the Impossible Travel Agency, a transporting VR experience for anyone who loves music, beauty, and dreams.\n\nThis is a narrative experience in VR lasting six minutes. Once you've taken the trip, you can customize it by using your own music and setting the duration to match your favorite album or playlist. The environment will react to your music and the story will adjust to your new duration for a transporting experience with the songs you love.\n\nITA supports the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets. It also supports the use of tracked motion controllers for both VR platforms but controller usage is optional. You may sit, stand, walk around, or just lie on the floor and look up at the stars.\n\nThe Impossible Travel Agency will be available in September 2016 on the Oculus Store and on Steam.\n\nFollow us on,\n\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/holospark\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/holo_spark\nIndieDB: http://www.indiedb.com/company/holospark", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nRvJ3WqXVM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nRvJ3WqXVM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nRvJ3WqXVM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nRvJ3WqXVM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9nRvJ3WqXVM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Impossible Travel Agency Trailer", "description": "Learn more at: http://www.impossibletravelagency.com/\n\nAvailable now on the Oculus Store: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1079392225455443/\n\nAnd on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/460990\n\nTravel to a distant world pulsing with life in this beautiful VR experience set to music.
