Produce can be exported or used as ingredients for inmate meals.\n\nRoom to Grow:\n\nThree outdoor rooms facilitate farming: Fruit Orchard, Farm Field and Vegetable Allotment. But that\u2019s not all, players can recruit staff Farm Workers, build a Pantry to store produce, and construct a Shed to house farming-related items.\n\nBest Buds:\n\nInmates who enjoy nature\u2019s beauty can grow flowers and other plants recreationally. Gardening affects inmates and gives them a positive recreation activity.\n\nTrouble is Brewing:\n\nWith new crops comes new contraband. Prisoners can now secretly grow herbs in the fields and swipe kitchen ingredients to brew Booze. Fields can also become Gang Turf, so keep your guards on alert!\n\nA Greener New Deal:\n\nPrisons get an eco-friendly makeover with Solar, Wind, and Solar/Wind Hybrid power sources. Excess power created by these sustainable methods can be sold back to the grid using the Power Export Meter.", "summary": "Prepare to get your hands dirty Wardens!
