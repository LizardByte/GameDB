The pursuit of the truth pushes Sherlock to the verge of madness, and it\u2019s the only story that Watson will never publish.\n\nTaking place in 1884, The Awakened lifts the curtain on how Sherlock and John, mere roommates at the time, became the world-famous crime-solving duo.", "summary": "Experience a nerve-racking Lovecraftian adventure, rebuilt from the ground up with modern graphics and gameplay.
