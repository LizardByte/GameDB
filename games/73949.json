The PS2 edition uses a recolored DDRMAX2 engine with an aqua blue background complemented with star motifs instead of black and gray, while the PS edition uses a recolored DDR 4thMix engine. Also, the PS edition omits freeze arrows and full motion videos.\nThe PlayStation 2 edition has 29 songs: 8 licenses, 16 Konami originals (of which 14 are also on Dancing Stage SuperNova for arcades) and 5 Bemani crossovers (of which 4 are also on Dancing Stage SuperNova for arcades). The PlayStation edition only features 15 of these songs: 5 licenses, 8 Konami originals and 2 Bemani crossovers.\n\nAll licensed songs, with one exception, are exclusive to Fever. Both Fever releases include \"All That She Wants\", \"Cool for Cats\", \"One Step Beyond\" and \"Virtuality\" (by VBirds). On the PlayStation 2, these songs feature their music video, except for \"Cool for Cats\". The \"Virtuality\" music video notably shows the VBirds members dancing on flying dance pads to the rhythm of the arrows shown on screen.[3] The PlayStation 2 version also exclusively features \"Come On Eileen\", \"Teenage Kicks\" (with its music video) and \"The Boys Are Back in Town\". \"Wannabe\" was once exclusive to both Fever releases, but it was later included on Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dancing-stage-fever", "videos": [{"id": 37823, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "e_Pn1d9ulUw"}]}
