the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences. Geodia\u2019s self-titled \"Baron\" has devised a plot to mine the world\u2019s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.\n\nThe stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron\u2019s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron\u2019s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work with Geodia\u2019s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she\u2019s to face the Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it\u2019s too late.\n\nOur hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down the Baron\u2019s Digsites before it\u2019s too late...", "summary": "Sparklite is an action-adventure set in the whimsical and ever-changing land of Geodia.
