Something terrible left its eons old slumber and the reality as we know it, collapsed. The town of Arkham was pulled to somewhere not from this world and its residents are in the shadow of absolute terror. As a survivor of the catastrophe you should investigate the strange occurrences in the city and survive the rising darkness physically and mentally, if possible...\"", "summary": "\"Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones\" is a supernatural horror roleplaying video game which takes place in the strange worlds of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Stygian will draw the player into a bleak journey from a ruined Arkham to the very depths of the Abyss.\n\nThe gameplay experience promises a mix of rich role-playing and turn based tactical combat in an authentic illustrative 2D graphical style.\n\nIn Stygian, you'll be able to create your character from scratch with a robust selection of archetypal backgrounds with different origin stories, attributes, skills, traits and lastly belief systems which determine how your character replenishes lost sanity, also presenting unique dialog choices.\n\nThe narrative of the game is strongly connected to the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In your quest, you'll use the haunted violin of Erich Zann to lure a fiendish deity and convince the poor wretched protagonist of \"The Outsider\" to join your party among many others.\n\nThe heavy burden of fighting a desperate battle with forces beyond recognition will haunt you to the end of the game. Physical combat will be scarce and difficult, spellcasting will have deep and dangerous consequences, sanity loss will leave its marks on characters as mental illnesses and sometimes the best solution will be running away from the terrors that lurk in the night.\n\nStygian embraces the original themes of pulp and weird fiction, incorporating them into the computer roleplaying genre, promising a fresh (or putrid from another perspective) breath of air for roleplaying fans.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stygian-reign-of-the-old-ones", "videos": [{"id": 29212, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "o-YaWAaJVd8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YaWAaJVd8", "title": "Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones - Release Date Trailer [Lovecraftian RPG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o-YaWAaJVd8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9216, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SgAEAbBpbVM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgAEAbBpbVM", "title": "Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgAEAbBpbVM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 9217, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "M2-ivhhpEtE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2-ivhhpEtE", "title": "Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2-ivhhpEtE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
