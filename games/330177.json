A good strategy, therefore, is to build up strength on the upper, easier levels by killing monsters and collecting gold before progressing downwards.\n\nAfter the instructions have been displayed and the final part of the program has loaded, there will be about a 10 second wait while the game is set up.", "summary": "A 3D graphical adventure in which you must find the Doctor and give him ten bags of gold to pay for your transport off of the moonbase. You will not be able to pick up the bags of gold if there is a monster in the room with you. In an emergency, you can take a Hulk pill which doubles your strength for five seconds and allows you to walk through the walls (at a cost of 100 strength units). There are many friendly and unfriendly monsters in the adventure and you will soon learn which ones to fight and which ones to avoid.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/escape-from-moonbase-alpha", "videos": [{"id": 139420, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "NLZ3XcjW2lk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLZ3XcjW2lk", "title": "Escape from Moonbase Alpha for the BBC Micro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLZ3XcjW2lk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
