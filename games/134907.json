It was developed by Other Ocean Interactive and published by SEGA. The object of the game, like others in the Super Monkey Ball series, is to get AiAi, MeeMee, Baby or GonGon to the goal.\n\nThe game is similar to both Super Monkey Ball: Touch and Roll and Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz: the game engine, monkey sprites, sound effects, and a few stages are reused from Touch and Roll, whereas the world theming and music are from Banana Blitz. Almost all the stages are original however.\n\nThere are five continues of six lives, totaling 30 lives altogether.\n\nThere are five worlds, and each world has two sets of ten stages.\n\nIf you collect all the Bananas on a stage without falling off, you will earn a crown. Earning a crown on every stage in a set unlocks an Extra Stage.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-monkey-ball--1", "videos": [{"id": 37307, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wOc1xoitFJc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOc1xoitFJc", "title": "Super Monkey Ball - iPhone Game - [1]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wOc1xoitFJc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 85302, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "6hgnrOW5SkA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hgnrOW5SkA", "title": "WWDC 2008 News: Monkeying around on the iPhone", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6hgnrOW5SkA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
