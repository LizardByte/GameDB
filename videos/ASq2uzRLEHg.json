{"id": "ASq2uzRLEHg", "snippet": {"title": "Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1996 versus-fighting game for the Sega Saturn, Street Fighter Alpha 2.\n\nPlayed through as Ryu on the hardest difficulty level. This video shows the best ending... which for whatever reason includes a poorly scanned, blotchy image of Sakura in the midst of a rosacea breakout. There are also a couple of funny Engrishy-moments in the dialogues with Akuma.\n\nAt 25:59 I show all of the bonus illustrations that you can access from the main menu.\n\nI'm not sure what else to say about Street Fighter Alpha 2 that I haven't said already on my videos of countless other ports of it, but I can tell you that of all of the first-wave home ports of the game, this is by far the best one.\n\nThe graphics are extremely close to those of the original arcade game's - compared to the PS1 port, the animation cuts have been kept to a minimum,  making it substantially smoother, and the sprite-based intro is far, far better than the badly-compressed FMV of the PlayStation game. The faster loading times are pretty nice too. Granted, the sound quality of the effects and voices takes an ugly hit thanks to the Saturn's lack of hardware support for compressed audio, but it is a worthwhile compromise considering this version's advantages. \n\nIt has been awhile since I last did a Street Fighter game, and SFA2 is one of my favorites, so I thought I would pull it out again for another refresher. I am playing this on the game's hardest setting, but like the SNES and PS1 games, this one's difficulty level is far lower than Street Fighter games are generally known for. I did pull off a few good custom super combos, though. \n\n__\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ASq2uzRLEHg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ASq2uzRLEHg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ASq2uzRLEHg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ASq2uzRLEHg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ASq2uzRLEHg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Capcom's 1996 versus-fighting game for the Sega Saturn, Street Fighter Alpha 2.\n\nPlayed through as Ryu on the hardest difficulty level.
