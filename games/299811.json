Sure, Greta was old, but not old enough to die without an apparent cause. She didn\u2019t take pills, had no medical problems, and had no recent surgeries.\n\nWinter creeps into the small town of Trenton, Alaska. The roads are blocked with snow, and the wind carries an icy dagger.\n\nDr. Grayson, the town\u2019s new resident doctor, examines Greta's corpse. Some bruising. Slight burn marks on her legs \u2013 it could be frostbite. Hidden under Greta\u2019s hair are five crescent-shaped wounds. None are severe enough to have been the cause of death, but the marks are fresh and bloody. There has to be a connection.\n\nWas Greta murdered? Or is there something else going on in Trenton? Some people in town have been acting weird, and a strange song is singing in the wind. Or is that just madness?\n\nDr. Grayson must find whatever killed Greta Tanner and stop it from killing anyone else.", "summary": "The Sleeping Sickness is an interactive short story that allows the player to guide the main character's actions.\n\nEach day, the player chooses where Grayson investigates. The player\u2019s choices will lock and unlock future locations, change dialogue, and alter the story. Choices matter in The Sleeping Sickness.\n\nWhile The Sleeping Sickness includes sounds, graphics, and interactive sections, it focuses on the story.\n\nThe game is designed to play like a choose-your-own-adventure book and is an excellent choice for horror fans, avid readers, and lovers of creepy pastas.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sleeping-sickness", "videos": [{"id": 112664, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5H0QZkHkPFE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H0QZkHkPFE", "title": "The Sleeping Sickness Horror Story Game Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5H0QZkHkPFE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
