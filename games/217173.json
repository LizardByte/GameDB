Bureaucratic hell, specifically.\n\nYou'll need to explore the office, searching for hidden details and secrets. The Devil also has many locks for all of his important files, which you'll need to access if you want a chance to escape. Solve puzzles, riddles, and other secrets - but make sure to put everything back before The Devil returns!\n\nYou'll only have a limited time in his office, so make sure to leave no trace - or he'll take notice, and take countermeasures for the next time you have an appointment with him. Will you be able to sneak past The Devil and escape from hell?", "summary": "You're trapped in hell for all eternity - at least, that's what the paperwork says. Can you escape by snooping around the private office of The Devil himself?
