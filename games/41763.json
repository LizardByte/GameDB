But the actual games will display the same as the original releases. The second disk contains just King's Valley, and can be started directly by booting with the disk instead of going through the menu on disk1.\n\nCompared to the original releases, these games have enhanced SCC+ music, when used with the 'SCC+ Sound Cartridge' from the Konami game 'Snatcher' or 'SD Snatcher'.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/konami-game-collection-vol-1", "collections": [{"id": 8323, "name": "Konami Game Collection"}]}
