Match shapes and colors to save villagers and end the global winter in another crazily addictive puzzle game from Alexey Pajitnov. Click ice blocks of the same shape to eliminate them and click blocks that are the same shape AND color to rack up even higher scores. Use power-ups to break blocks, blow up tricky sections, or melt entire ice waves. The intensity builds over 60 levels as the avalanches gain speed and complexity. Juggling two boards at once pushes the player.\n#tetris\nSystem: Windows Vista\nGraphics Card: HD 6450\nSound Card: Asus Xonar D1\nCapture card: AverMedia Live Gamer HD2 (GC570)\nSoftware: OBS Studio", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3fyboq5shS0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3fyboq5shS0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3fyboq5shS0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3fyboq5shS0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3fyboq5shS0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Alexeys Dwice (2006) - Level 1 - Tetris Remake - eGames Galaxy of Games", "description": "Alexeys Dwice Level 1\nTetris Remake Game from Alexey Pajitnov - eGames Galaxy of Games\n\nFrom the creator of Tetris in a world frozen by a new ice age, players must stop avalanches of frozen blocks from burying villages from across the globe.
