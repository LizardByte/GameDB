They were proposed to by many men.\n\nHis elder 2 daughters took time to consider these proposals. But his youngest daughter Belle, who loved to read books, didn't care about men. People said, \"she is beautiful, but weird\".\n\nThe merchant's family had a wealthy life. However, one day, the ship loaded with products disappeared. Since then, their life completely changed.\n\nAfter a little while, when they started getting used to their poor life, the merchant received news that the missing ship had been found. The merchant decided to go to get his property back.\n\nThe elder 2 daughters were happy that they would regain their wealthy life. They asked their father to bring jewels and precious stones.\n\nMeanwhile, the wise and beautiful youngest daughter asked him to come back safely and to bring a rose.\n\n---------\n\n\"I accepted you to my palace and saved your life. But you stole my rose which was more precious to me than my life. You are ungrateful. You should repay me with your life.\"\n\nThe merchant immediately said sorry and begged his life and explained that it was just to please his daughter.\n\nThe Beast told him to sacrifice his life, or give his daughter.\n\nThe merchant went home and held his beloved family tight. And then he began to tell them what had happened to him.\n\nHe said to them that if his family was protected by his sacrifice, he would be happy.\n\nThe youngest daughter felt guilty because she had asked for a rose.\n\nThe youngest daughter said,\n\n\"I will go to the Beast's palace. I have an idea.\"\n\nThe terrifying Beast might eat me.\n\nOr I might lose my virginity.\n\nMy life from now on might be as a slave\u2026\n\nBut I do not want to lose against him.\n\nI will let him fall in love with me.\n\nI can definitely have mental superiority over him.\n\nBelle was thinking if he loves her, he won't do something bad to her.", "summary": "\"Beauty and the Beast\" is the famous animation film.\n\nThe original long story was written by French novelist, Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve.\nLater, the shorter version was rewritten by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont.\nAnd this is the origin of the story which we know today.\n\nIn this app, I changed the story dynamically based on the story written by Beaumont.\nI hope you enjoy the story in the special version.\n\nIt depends on the player, if the Beast changes back to what he was, the Prince.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beauty-and-the-silent-beast", "videos": [{"id": 71368, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FLcnjgYUtL4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLcnjgYUtL4", "title": "\u7f8e\u5973\u3068\u6c88\u9ed9\u306e\u91ce\u7363", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FLcnjgYUtL4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
