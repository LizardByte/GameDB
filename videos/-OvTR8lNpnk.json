The game's toward the end of development, with only a couple of things left to make, and many things left to finalize.

While it takes inspirations from classic titles like Sonic the Hedgehog and Megaman Zero, it has its own identity by giving the player access to a full platform fighter moveset, time-stopping and skill-based power scaling that can unleash an even stronger form for those who can earn it!\n\nAlso for some additional context: if you're seeing people mention FNF (Friday Night Funkin'), this is because I made an FNF mod back in 2021 to help make people aware of Advent NEON's existence (that, and it was just fun to do). However, the game did already exist and was announced well before then, but that FNF mod became one of the largest sources of traffic toward the game's demo at the time. \"That guy from FNF\" is kind of a recurring joke in the comments of anywhere I post because of this lol\n\n#CryoGX #gamedev #indiedev", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-OvTR8lNpnk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-OvTR8lNpnk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-OvTR8lNpnk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-OvTR8lNpnk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-OvTR8lNpnk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Advent NEON: 2024 Trailer", "description": "Here's an updated trailer for Advent NEON!
