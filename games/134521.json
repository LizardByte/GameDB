This project started out as a showcase of my work in environment design, I wanted to create a realistic, densely forested scene using photoscanned 3d assets that could run smoothly in real-time. The environment was created in Unreal Engine 4 with heavy reference to photos taken at the location, You'll encounter rocky riverbeds, dense forest paths, vast farmland and distant hills, a lot of which resemble the appearance of the real valley in NZ.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 36907, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YySFdYvXhqQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YySFdYvXhqQ", "title": "Wakamarina Valley, New Zealand UE4 Recreation", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YySFdYvXhqQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
