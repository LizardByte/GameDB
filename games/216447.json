Try it, and see how high you can score. The goal is to group five or more flowers of the same color together. Once the flowers are grouped, your score increases, and the grouped flowers disappear to make room for more maneuvers. After each turn, more flowers appear on the board and your task becomes more difficult. The game is over when the board completely fills up. Enjoy the game!"}
