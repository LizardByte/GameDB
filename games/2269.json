As such it features very similar content, reworked to be a portable experience. Monster Hunter Portable does not features Minegarde Town from Monster Hunter and Monster Hunter G, and was focused around local multiplayer rather than online. As such, the game was completely rebalanced to be more friendly to solo players. The game features a single new monster that was not in the series prior, Yian Garuga.\n\nThe game revolves around the player completing quests and gathering materials to upgrade their equipment in order to advance. The more rare the items and equipment, the stronger the main physical aspects of the character will be. Unlike other hack 'n' slash games, this game requires planning and skill in order to overcome large monsters instead of brute force. There are many weapons which the hunter can use to bring down the monsters, these are sword and shield, great sword, dual swords, hammer, lance, bowgun and the heavy bowgun. Each requires a variety of items to create which are acquired by completing quests, and collecting the spoils carved from monsters or found on the ground.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-hunter-freedom", "videos": [{"id": 17267, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "mcthwus5w5k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcthwus5w5k", "title": "Monster Hunter Freedom Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mcthwus5w5k/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8708, "name": "Monster Hunter Freedom"}, {"id": 2948, "name": "Monster Hunter"}]}
