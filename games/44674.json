While other PlayStation 2 football titles are happy to concentrate on national and international teams, here the beautiful game is taken right down to grass roots, allowing you (if you wish) to seize control of a local team.\n\nYou do that as part of the best feature in the game: the career mode. Here, you really can go from the very bottom to the very top, and it adds a challenging long term goal to the proceedings. It's just one example of where the game differs from the opposition, and there are plenty more. For instance, you can also try and blatantly blag a penalty by diving in the area. You can get penalised for handball. You can even take it online and test your skills. In short, there's plenty going on.", "videos": [{"id": 55492, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GqtCmRWJb9s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqtCmRWJb9s", "title": "This Is Football 2004 ...
