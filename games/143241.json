It is the beloved city of the sun god, Ereal, said to be raised as a monument to his victories over the eclipsing moons.\n\nAs the beacon of civilization in the world of Midlight, Iridine fights an ongoing war against anarchy and lawlessness. Thieves dart through the crowded streets. Bandits prowl the swamps and forests of Iridine's Republic. Cinerans are barely kept at bay by the Legio and concerned civilians.\nNo one remembers who built the Harbor of the Moons. No one can say when Moonfall took place, when the first purplish-black storms appeared, roiling through the moonlit countryside in furious silence. No one remembers just how old the inner city really is, nor to what ends of Midlight its folk were scattered.\n\nAnd, the sages say, the veil between life and death weakens by the day \u2013 that Ravan, the Comforter of the Dead from ages forgotten, has gone mad \u2013 that he stalks the heavens once more, seeking to bring the destruction of Moonfall to Midlight.", "summary": "This fully text-based roleplaying game takes place in the realistic-fantasy world of Iridine, The Eternal City inspired by Roman history. TEC is wholly immersive and well-worth the investment of getting started.\n\nJoin for the chance to explore the vast gameworld, complex combat and non-combat mechanics. Stay for the unparalleled community and immersive roleplay. For the right person and the right price, Iridine offers the chance to become anything: gladiator, merchant, acolyte, hunter, bandit, legionary, entertainer, explorer, thief, and so much more.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-eternal-city"}
