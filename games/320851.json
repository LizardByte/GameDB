The port gives access to the developer console which was disabled in the original arcade version, therefore making multiplayer possible through the use of console commands.\n\nThe game requires the screen resolution to be at least 1360x768, as the position of most of the user interface elements was optimized for the arcade machine's resolution and cannot be changed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/half-life-2-survivor--1", "videos": [{"id": 130796, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "u2S2mhsZ1OI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2S2mhsZ1OI", "title": "Half Life 2: Survivor Ver2.0 on PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u2S2mhsZ1OI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 130797, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "U5HlmcOQaKI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5HlmcOQaKI", "title": "Half-Life 2: Survivor Ver2.0 - Battle Mode Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U5HlmcOQaKI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 130798, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "WIYAoMKgFhM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIYAoMKgFhM", "title": "Half-Life 2: Survivor Ver2.0 - Mission Mode Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WIYAoMKgFhM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
