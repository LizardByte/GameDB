It is really slow, weak, and annoying to use. Your base isn\u2019t much either. To advance, you will need to repair your base so you can produce higher tier modules, up to tier 6. For example, a higher tier armor will result in more health for you, a higher tier engine will make you faster\u2026\n\nBut to achieve this, you will need to go out there and get some mobenium. Mobenium (chemical symbol Mb) in this universe is something like iron. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t use just iron. You can salvage it off the evil tanks, which you can call for a fight with the wave button. They start off the same as you, but beware - they are thieves, for any upgrade you buy, they will be able to use it as well. And there\u2019s gonna be quite a lot of them.\n\nSo, the question is, can you make it? The end goal is to reach tier 6 on every part, but it becomes endless after that. It won\u2019t be an easy journey\u2026", "summary": "A top-down tank game about surviving enemy waves.\n\nFirst proper game by Eggs & Chickens, made for a school project.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mobenium-2d"}
