The world was aghast with this discovery and it became even more concerning when scout teams came across a mysterious force, preventing people from getting too close. Those who went to examine it said that the force was like an invisible wall and there was no way around it, therefore, making further investigation difficult.\n\nSpiritual events and sightings have also dramatically increased since then. It got to the point where people began to hold festivals to honor the dead and the mythical creatures. It wasn't long until it became a new worldwide sensation and there was not a single day where spiritual events weren't on the news\n\nOur heroine, Maya (19), was busy earning her living so this kind of event was of little importance aside from adding an exciting spice into her life. But then her world crumbled when a Goddess came and announced that her family would die in a car accident in the near future.\n\nThe Goddess offered Maya a deal: She would alter her family\u2019s fate in exchange for closing the Bermuda Crater. In order to do so, Maya would have to go to a place called The Forgotten Isles, find what caused it, and look for a solution.\n\nIf she agreed, three men would accompany her, acting as bodyguards. Apparently, they each have their own circumstances and a wish to be granted.", "summary": "A fantasy adventure, mystery, drama & romance otome visual novel (GxB) with strong Indonesian flavour.
