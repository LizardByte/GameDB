{"id": "6ioZX3rskJM", "snippet": {"title": "Motor Toon Grand Prix (2) Game Sample - Playstation", "description": "Original Air Date: December 21th, 2009\n\nThis is the sequel to the Japan-only MTGP, and was released in the U.S. as Motor Toon Grand Prix (though it's MTGP2 in Europe). After the creators of Gran Turismo made the first game, they decided to give the formula another shot a couple years later. This was one of my all-time favorites during my childhood and I was stunned when I couldn't rent the game anymore. It didn't help matters that the game in the U.S. is actually rare, so I was estatic when I found it not too long ago. It is vastly superior to the original in practically every way. Seriously. Better course design, more playable characters, mini-games that are actually fun, numerous power-ups, cool FMVs, a better soundtrack, vastly improved physics. The only thing this game lacks that I would've cared about at all from the original is the small character bios, but that's what manuals are for.\n\nThis game got mixed scores in magazines from what I recall, but I actually think it's quite impressive for a racer of its kind in 1996. It was the first competent cartoony Playstation racer to fight against the big N's Mario Kart (released a few months before Mario Kart 64) and one of the first to go 32bit and 3D (I don't even count the original, which is practically a straight-up racer). The character designs are done in the same somewhat familiar Susumu Matsushita style you've come to expect from the artists of Adventure Island, Elfaria, Monkey Magic, etc. It's a shame they don't make games in the MTGP series anymore.\n\nThis video shows the opening and a few races. Enjoy.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ioZX3rskJM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ioZX3rskJM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ioZX3rskJM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Motor Toon Grand Prix (2) Game Sample - Playstation", "description": "Original Air Date: December 21th, 2009\n\nThis is the sequel to the Japan-only MTGP, and was released in the U.S. as Motor Toon Grand Prix (though it's MTGP2 in Europe).
