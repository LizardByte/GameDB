These four characters are based on relatives of mine (two grandmothers and two great-grandmothers). The game is inspired aesthetically by Mystery House, developed in 1980 by Roberta & Ken Williams. But whereas Mystery House is a mystery story about greed and murder, A House in California is more like an Imagist poem about family and memory.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-house-in-california"}
