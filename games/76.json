It is a single-player only game that BioWare co-CEO Ray Muzyka describes as a \"spiritual successor\" to the Baldur's Gate series, though it is not based on Dungeons & Dragons rules or the Forgotten Realms setting. It utilizes a new BioWare-developed engine named Eclipse.\n\nThe designers incorporated origin stories for each race and some classes in the game. For example, a dwarf who is a member of the noble caste will begin the game as part of the royal family in one of the dwarven cities, while a dwarf commoner will begin on the streets of the city. Origin stories provide an introduction to the game world and hours of gameplay. People that the Warden meets during the origin story may reappear throughout the game, some of whom may be adversaries.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 2963, "name": "Sacred Ashes", "video_id": "VaZXJQIHgEA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaZXJQIHgEA", "title": "Dragon Age: Origins - Sacred Ashes Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VaZXJQIHgEA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 2964, "name": "Story Trailer", "video_id": "4k81SFkhFG4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k81SFkhFG4", "title": "Dragon Age: Origins - Story Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4k81SFkhFG4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 2965, "name": "Violence Trailer", "video_id": "cfSAlyiI1mc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfSAlyiI1mc", "title": "Dragon Age: Origins - Violence Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cfSAlyiI1mc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1893, "name": "Oghren"}, {"id": 1892, "gender": 1, "name": "Morrigan", "species": 5}, {"id": 1894, "name": "Sten"}, {"id": 1887, "name": "Duncan"}, {"id": 1886, "name": "Alistair"}, {"id": 1891, "name": "Loghain"}, {"id": 1896, "name": "Zevran"}, {"id": 1888, "name": "Flemeth"}, {"id": 1895, "name": "Wynne"}, {"id": 1889, "name": "Arl Howe"}, {"id": 1890, "name": "Leliana"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
