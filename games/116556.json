In Abnormal your character has asthma and therefore you have to keep looking for inhalers as you run out of breath from physical activities or from the horrors in this mansion. In addition to that, Abnormal features the ability to instantly switch between two different time periods in the mansion you are exploring which will come in handy for puzzle solving. \n \nAbnormal will feature optional support for Head Mounted Displays such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive which will immerse you in the heart of fear.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/abnormal", "videos": [{"id": 25730, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "__NUw0wHIq4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__NUw0wHIq4", "title": "Abnormal Gameplay Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__NUw0wHIq4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
