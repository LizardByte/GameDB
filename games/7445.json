You must build a shelter to protect yourself from both the elements and the dangers that the island presents as well as tangle with everything from the wildlife to the islands natives. With beatiful graphics from Crytek's CRYENGINE, you will find yourself immersed in this intense sandbox survival experience. \n\nEngross yourself within the single-player story: as the last survivor of a boat lost in a storm, you find yourself washed up on the shore of an island untouched by modern society. With a lush and beautifully detailed tropical island and fleshed out underwater corals, you will find yourself experimenting on how to survive the multiple threats each environment throws at you. \n\nIf surviving alone is too much of a strain on your mental state, become the victim of a plane crash in an alternative cooperative story - struck down by the same storm - with up to 4 players with a different outcome to the single-player finale.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}]}
