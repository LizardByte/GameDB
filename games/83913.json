A young apprentice of Xerxes gets the opportunity to leave the peasant life and take a stab at gold and glory by challenging mythical figures and gods. The gameplay is based on anagrams. Games start with a mix of six letters used to construct words of different length. Letters are selected by moving an arrow-shaped cursor. When a word is formed, points are awarded, a meter fills up, and new letters appear on the tablet. \n \nNext to the story mode, the three game modes can also be played in the Quickplay mode: \nClassical: find as many words of different length as you can before time elapses. \n6-Letter Challenge: find the 6 letter word in a given number of tries. \nEvolution: find words of specific length before time runs out. \nWhile playing, players can earn bonuses that provide additional time or freeze it, guess a word for the player, or shuffle the letters. The player can also receive penalties from his opponent. These empty the bonus gauge, mirror the letters or even hide them. Bonuses become available by discovering the six-letter word multiple times, and penalties arrive when it takes too long to form a word. \n \nThere is a high score screen for each mode and a tutorial explaining the basics. The game offers sound effects and music, along with an overview map in the quest mode, and pre-game screens where the opponents offer some pearls of wisdom.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/1000-words--1"}
