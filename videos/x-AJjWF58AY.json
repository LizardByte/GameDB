We've been working on that for a while now, we sure hope you're going to enjoy it!\n\n--\n\nUncertainty is the root of all fear...\nWander across the halls, explore each room and every corner of the house in search of an escape route. Uncertainty will keep you on toes as you explore the creeky and noisy house and each crack, each silent breath from a window and each small event will drag you closer to death.\n\nYou are not alone...\nFear is your worst enemy, dark entities are attracted to it. Remain calm and escape terror at all cost, or you will come to realize the distant moanings coming from farther in the house aren't so distant after all.\n\nHistory is never forgotten...\nMany terrible things happened in this house. Brutality and violence stain every room, telling stories of a dark past, unveiling the truth behind the curtain. A truth so disturbing you wish you could join the families that died there years ago, but even death won't help you leave this dreadful place.\n\nThe many faces of death...\nWhat would you become if you couldn't even recognize yourself in the mirror? Each death has its visage. How will you face them?\n\n--\n\nIf you want to know more and be kept up-to-date about this great game:\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SadSquare-Studio-1511336265823792/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SadsquareStudio\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/117910075717307420185/posts\n\nAlso take a look at the Visage website: http://sadsquarestudio.com/pages/visage.html\n\nIf you want to know a little more about the team behind the scene, visit us at sadsquarestudio.com.
