It was also the first game in the Project Diva series to be released in the West. Like the original the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids, most notably the virtual-diva Hatsune Miku. The game retains the same basic gameplay mechanics from the series albeit with several new changes, most notably the addition of the \"Star\" symbol to the game's existing symbols of cross, circle, square, triangle and arrows. The \"Star\" symbol represents the \"Scratch\" move where instead of pressing the face buttons as usual, players rub the screen or flick the analogue stick, depending on which system is being used. \"Chance Time\" has been modified from previous installments, with each successful beat filling a star shaped gauge on the bottom left of the screen. When filled, it triggers a final scratch symbol that, if successfully scored, will change the outcome of the scene. Another new mechanic is the \"Technical Zone\" mechanic. When it occurs during a song, players must maintain an uninterrupted combo within that time limit for bonus points.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hatsune-miku-project-diva-f", "videos": [{"id": 5225, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TNXb7Ko6G_s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNXb7Ko6G_s", "title": "Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA f Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TNXb7Ko6G_s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 5226, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "WBxVhAZZN58", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxVhAZZN58", "title": "\u3010PS3&PS Vita\u3011 \u521d\u97f3\u30df\u30af -Project DIVA- F OP \u300cODDS&ENDS\u300d", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WBxVhAZZN58/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
