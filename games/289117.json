You are the commander of the first Mars mission and have to land the spaceship safely on the landing platform built by robots.\n\nYou only have a limited amount of fuel. So that your spaceship doesn't break down, the speed when it touches down must not be more than 1.99998.\n\nYou control the spaceship with the joystick on the right and left in joyport 1. To ignite the braking rockets, press fire. Remember you can only do one thing, steering or brake!!!\n\nGood luck comander", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marslander"}
