While the Kingdom of Freesia advocates for a policy of human and monster equality, Luxuria is a bastion of staunch human supremacists, and the local monsters are being horribly oppressed.\n\nLilia and Sheryl want to help the monsters to escape, but Lilia is the only one who can safely delve into the Luxuria Hole to find the equipment they'll need to bring their plans to fruition. Meanwhile, somebody has to earn money so they won't get punished when taxes come due every morning. It's up to you to help the two heroines explore the mine and earn their keep if they're going to escape this prison city!", "summary": "In the trade city of Marigold, a spirited woman, Lilia, sets off on her grand adventure.
