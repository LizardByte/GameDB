This was a first test video, so both of us had never played it before, and the first reactions were that it looked rather nice. The controls were a bit confusing, we werent really sure if at times we were controlling half our characters. The main problem we faced in 2 player mode though, was the fact that as each of you got better, the harder it was to actually hit the ball, in fact...near impossible! Hopefully single player mode wont face this issue, as apart from the terrible sound effects, Homerun doesnt seem a bad game.\nIll be posting a single player video soon, in the meantime please subscribe to my youtube channel for more retro gaming videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\n\nHome run was a Phoenix Games release and was recorded by SHLIMPOLE & WIGGY G on a sony PS2 console using the Hauppauge HDPVR2", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nK-6smOGVto/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nK-6smOGVto/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nK-6smOGVto/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nK-6smOGVto/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Homerun PS2 Gameplay ( 2 Player ) [ Phoenix Games ]", "description": "Here's a 2 player video of Homerun by Phoenix Games on the Playstation 2.
