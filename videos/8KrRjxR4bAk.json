If you mess up click the Panic button at the bottom of the screen to restart the Stage\r\nStage 12 (stay low) -- you cant jump so just keep moving left (the door is already open)\r\nStage 13 (left right march) -- alternate the left and right arrow keys to move across the screen (the door is already open)\r\nStage 14 (one leap of faith) -- you can only jump one time\r\nStage 15 (time to refresh) -- refresh your browser. The game will let you return this stage from the main menu\r\nStage 16 (keep hitting it) -- repeatedly hit the button to make the door open (5 times)\r\nStage 17 (worried about nothing) -- the stage is normal\r\nStage 18 (collapse) -- run/jump to the very right of the screen (just short of the spikes) and fall through the floor to the exit (dont worry about the button)\r\nStage 19 (stuttering) -- works normally just with annoying slowness\r\nStage 20 (Do you remember?) -- everything is white so go by memory\r\nStage 21 (Inbetween gravitii) -- green stripes make you float and orange is normal) so jump from orange\r\nStage 22 (Mimes folly) -- there is a barrier to the right of the button to the bottom of the screen so dont go that way. Instead, go to the top block and fall down\r\nStage 23 (center keyboarder) -- use the F to go left, H to go right, and T keys to jump\r\nStage 24 (UPPERCASE) -- go to the end door and hold the caps lock key to open it\r\nStage 25 (When it feels like it) -- the door opens randomly so just wait for it\r\nStage 26 (Or is it) -- the door is not really there so just run through it\r\nStage 27 (credit page) -- go to the menu (button all the way on the left bottom corner of your screen) and then click Credits.

Just move about the screen normally.\r\nStage 29 (closing shop) -- once you click the button, the door will close quickly so go as fast as possible\r\nStage 30 (no sweat) -- the screen will be black so just go from memory\r\nBe proud -- you made it!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KrRjxR4bAk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KrRjxR4bAk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8KrRjxR4bAk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "This is the only level Walkthrough (1-30)", "description": "@ all!
