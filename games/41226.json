Only a certain number of letters can be tried - every incorrect guess will add an element to a drawing of a man being hanged at the gallows. The player loses if the drawing gets complete, due to his missing attempts at finding the letters in the secret word. \n \nThe game contains 64 game variations of this basic premise for either 1 or 2 players, with or without a score. Variations include: \nThe computer selects the word to guess; \nOne player comes up with a word for another player to solve; \nThe player is given one of the letters in the word to help him get started; \nThe game will tell the player he guessed the right letter but will not say where it belongs in a word; \nThe player isn't told how long the secret word is; \nThe player has to guess the letters and their location in the word; \nThe player has to solve an anagram.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/videocart-18-hangman", "videos": [{"id": 16086, "name": "VR", "video_id": "pknOBxkYN4M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pknOBxkYN4M", "title": "The Channel F Files VideoCart 18 Hangman Gameplay!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pknOBxkYN4M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
