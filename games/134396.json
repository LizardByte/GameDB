Sadono orchestrates a suicide bombing and follow-up attack on the U.S. embassy in Dili, capturing a number of U.S. military and diplomatic personnel including Douglas Shetland, an old friend and comrade of Sam Fisher.", "summary": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is a stealth video game developed and published by Ubisoft Shanghai and Ubisoft Milan, while Ubisoft Montreal, developer of the original Splinter Cell, was working on Chaos Theory.
