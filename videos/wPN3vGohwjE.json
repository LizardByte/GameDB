They are watching you too.\n\nA spot the difference -type of puzzle horror game where you have to monitor cameras in a haunted house and report anomalies. You are a test subject who has no choice but to finish this job. Can you survive the night?\n\nMidnight Monitor: Anomaly Watch is a game that will keep you on your toes and make you question your reality. You are a test subject who has been forced to monitor cameras in a house that is rumoured to be haunted. Your job is to spot and report any anomalies that occur in the house, such as moving objects, disappearing items, electrical glitches, camera errors, and much more. But be careful, the anomalies are not only watching you, but they are also trying to stop you from reporting them. \n\nSome of them are harmless, but some of them are dangerous and can harm you or end the game.\n\nThis Modern House is owned by a father and his daughter, but there are some oddities strewn around. The house has a mysterious and dark history, with secrets that you might uncover as you play. Unity's State of the Art dynamic lighting system supports the ability to make the anomalies as striking, scary and as dynamic as possible.\nOther features:\n\n- 14 different types of anomalies (with more planned!)\n- A dynamic lighting system\n- Over 230 different anomalies\n- 4 different game modes that change the difficulty and the style of the game: normal mode, dark mode, black and white mode, or hard mode\n- Mix & Match game modes for varied and thrilling challenges!\n- An addictive stat tracking system that keeps track of your total playtime, anomalies reported, total anomalies, and more!\n- Future updates planned (Neighbourhood Watch, seasonal content, content updates & more!)\n\nThis is the very first game that I\u2019ve ever made. I am a solo developer from the UK who created this game out of a love and passion for this type of game. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.
