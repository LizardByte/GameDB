The game is based on the PSY song \"Gangnam Style\", which was at the time the most viewed YouTube video of all time. In the game, you play as a school girl who is equipped with a bow and arrow and your goal is to break the vase on top of PSY's head.\n\nOn December 14th, 2012, the game was reworked into a completely different game called Gangnam Dance School. This was due to the developer fearing the title and setting on the game was too similar to the Sandy Hook Massacre.\n\nFor the following 10 years, the game was considered lost media, until it was later rediscovered on June 18th, 2022 by computerdude77. The game is now downloadable again on the Internet Archive.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gangnam-style-massacre", "videos": [{"id": 74581, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "l2McfwJGzsg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2McfwJGzsg", "title": "Gangnam Style Massacre - iPhone & iPad Gameplay Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l2McfwJGzsg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
