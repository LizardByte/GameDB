With nothing left to lose, she harnesses the strength of the silent man she calls Arkuma, who unleashes his wild nature upon revealing he's on no better terms with the police.\n\nThe girl's wish for peace and the beast's disdain for her kind clash as they join forces to topple the institution that wronged them. Can these ideals persist and coexist, or will Koraki and Arkuma's revolution spread even more corruption in its wake?", "summary": "A fantasy visual novel featuring intense action at every turn, following the struggles of a bear trapped in the body of a man.
