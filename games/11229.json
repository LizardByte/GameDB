Earthsiege 2 is set in the Earthsiege universe, which contains its predecessors Earthsiege (1994) and Battledrome (1995), as well as the action game Hunter Hunted (1996), strategy games MissionForce: CyberStorm (1997) and Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars (1998), simulation Starsiege (1999), and first-person shooters Starsiege: Tribes (1999), Tribes 2 (2001), Tribes Aerial Assault (2002), Tribes: Vengeance (2004) and Tribes: Ascend (2012).\n\nAs a simulation, Earthsiege 2 gives players the opportunity to pilot massive bipedal war machines known as HERCULANs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short). Set in the 26th or 27th century, Earthsiege 2 features advanced weapons and technology for waging war. Earthsiege 2 takes place across North America, South America, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the moon.\n\nEarthsiege 2 features a more advanced engine than Earthsiege, increasing the game's maximum resolution to 640*480. Additionally, the game features much more detailed terrain than its predecessor. Earthsiege 2 has 3D rolling terrain rather than the flat landscape of Earthsiege. Furthermore, video briefings and debriefings, along with included squadmate voices, add to the atmosphere of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 4497, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "ugQUwJyEHAE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugQUwJyEHAE", "title": "Earthsiege 2 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugQUwJyEHAE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36364, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BqILPYigsfk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqILPYigsfk", "title": "Earthsiege 2: playthrough pt. 01 of 45", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BqILPYigsfk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
