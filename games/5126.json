During the war all forms of chemical and biological weapons have been used, poisoning the planet, and the troops of both sides must live in enclosed cities and only venture into the outside if wearing protective gear known as a \"bio-suit\". The Southers have, through genetic engineering (done by the so-called \"gene genies\"), developed a race of warriors who are immune to the deadly atmosphere and will therefore be superior troops, the Genetic Infantry. All of the G.I.s were made immune to all toxins, diseases, and acids (except for one). The Souther High Command deploy their secret weapon in an airborne assault, but a traitor has betrayed the secret of the G.I.s to the Norts and they are massacred during the drop. This is known as the Quartz Zone Massacre.\n\nRogue, apparently the only surviving G.I. (until he meets Venus Bluegenes), goes AWOL in order to track down the Traitor General responsible and avenge the rest of the G.I.s. Along the way he thwarts numerous Nort schemes, destroys some of Nort-land's highest personnel, such as Grand Admiral Hoffa and Sergeant-Kaptain Natashov.\n\nAll G.I.s possess a biochip implanted inside of the skull that contains their personality traits, memories and consciousness. After a G.I. dies his biochip can be inserted in a slot in another G.I's equipment or weapon, enabling him to control it. The biochip can later be placed into a new body, allowing the fallen G.I. to be reborn. One quotation is \"we're genetic infantry \u2013 even when we're dead we don't escape from war.\"", "summary": "Intense 3rd-person action on the battlefields of Nu Earth - a poisoned planet where a seemingly endless war rages between the Norts and the Southers. A futile struggle on a hostile planet with no clear end in sight!\n\nBut there are tales of a lone warrior. A man who can appear out of thin air and take out whole platoons, then disappear back into the shadows to which he belongs. A man who knows no allegiance but to his own mission and is hell-bent on revenge. He is the ultimate soldier, the last survivor of the massacred Genetic Infantrymen...\n\n...the Rogue Trooper!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rogue-trooper", "videos": [{"id": 13666, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kIAYuXhKyZ8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIAYuXhKyZ8", "title": "Rogue Trooper trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kIAYuXhKyZ8/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 63635, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "C_AFKnLXDQ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_AFKnLXDQ0", "title": "RGO: Rogue Trooper PC HD Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C_AFKnLXDQ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 63636, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "2PUqMe9FdQ4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PUqMe9FdQ4", "title": "Rogue Trooper Game Intro Cutscene", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PUqMe9FdQ4/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3111, "name": "Rogue Trooper"}]}
