All of the game's activities are based around setting up and managing a circus with twelve puzzles and activities in total. Each one introduces a new concept based around logic or maths with an adjustable difficulty level. Skills include spatial reasoning, perceiving patterns in size, order or time, or manipulating variables to influence the tricks of the circus acts. The game saves progress for the solved puzzles automatically. Up to 200 circuses can be started as new profiles.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/math-circus-act-1"}
