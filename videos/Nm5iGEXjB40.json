Recently, she made two important realizations about herself. One: she's deeply in love with her adventurous best friend, Allison Goleta. (The feeling was mutual.)

It follows the stories of Melody, her girlfriend Allison, and their friends Claire (a sarcastic, rule-bending witch) (she is also trans) and Jodie (a dependable, somewhat motherly knight). Over the course of their journey, our inexperienced heroes will meddle with forces beyond their control and find themselves responsible for the fate of their hometown.
