Today, developers Big Bad Wolf give us insight into their reimagining of the narrative-adventure. In this video \u201cRethinking Narrative Adventure\u201d, they explain how they innovated on the genre, twisting the classic formula with original mechanics, and their ambition of giving true weight to each and every one of the players\u2019 decisions throughout the game.\n \nBegin your journey with Louis de Richet on Lord Mortimer\u2019s private island and try to discover your mother\u2019s fate \u2013 before it\u2019s too late. Joining you are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests \u2013Richet\u2019s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.\n\nIn a new twist for the genre, the core of THE COUNCIL\u2019 gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character\u2019s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean \u2018game over\u2019, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player\u2019s adventure.\n\nRichet\u2019s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skillswill have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover THE COUNCIL\u2019s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.\n\nTHE COUNCIL\u2019s first episode, THE MAD ONES, arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC March 13. The complete season will include a total of five episodes, with new episodes releasing regularly in 2018.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QEldooNZyx8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QEldooNZyx8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QEldooNZyx8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QEldooNZyx8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QEldooNZyx8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Council - Rethinking Narrative Adventure", "description": "Now available : http://www.thecouncil-game.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/TheCouncilGame\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/TheCouncilGame\n\nTHE COUNCIL releases March 13 \u2013 developers give us insight into their reimagining of the narrative-adventure in a new video\n\nNarrative Adventure game THE COUNCIL is set for the release of its first episode, THE MAD ONES, on March 13 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
