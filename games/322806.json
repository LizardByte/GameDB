You drop and position fruits strategically to set up merges, managing space to prevent the container from overflowing. The game challenges you to plan your moves carefully as larger fruits take up more room, and it rewards progression with higher-level fruits. The goal is to keep merging while avoiding game over and reaching the highest fruit size possible.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fruit-merge"}
