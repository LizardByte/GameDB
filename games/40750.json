Two of the games in this collection won first and second place in the 1K competition: Cave 1K won the category, and Splatform came in second place. All three of these games offer addicting gameplay that will keep you coming back for me! SWOOPS! contains a menu that allows you to select which game to play, as well as a \"3-Athlon\" mode that allows you to play all three games in succession.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
