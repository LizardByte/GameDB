It\u2019s crazy to think that our little fan-game from 10 years ago would evolve into the official game of the series, it's been a real dream come true. \n\nWe want to thank everyone for their patience, there\u2019s so much going on behind the scenes. We thought it would be important to get everyone up to speed on some of what we\u2019ve been working on. \n\n\nSingle Player\nFirst, we would like to announce that Puppet Master: The Game will be releasing in OPEN BETA on March 1st of 2023! I know, sadly we won't be releasing this year like we said in the announcement trailer, but there\u2019s a good reason for that!\n\nCome March 1st, Puppet Master: The Game will include a new game mode called Toulon\u2019s Journals. A single player sandbox mode where you can complete challenges, fight bad-guys, earn experience points, and best of all, find lost pages of Andre Toulon\u2019s.\n\nThe Journal pages act as an audio log that you can discover in the game\u2019s environments. Finding one allows you to hear Andre Toulon as he recalls his History with the puppets all  while while you play. You\u2019ll also be able to listen to them at your own convenience outside of the game once they\u2019ve been unlocked.\n\nToulon\u2019s Journals were written by Nat Brehmer, author of Puppet Master Complete, a Franchise History. Let me tell you, that Nat did an amazing job honoring the History of franchise while adding some fun new details about the Puppet\u2019s past. We can\u2019t wait to share what he has written with you when Toulon\u2019s Journal releases next year.\n\n\nBot Support\nAnother feature we have been working on is adding Human BOT SUPPORT. This will allow you to play all of our Future Human vs Puppet game modes as either a Solo or Coop experience. \n\nThat's it for me, thank you for your support, Happy Holidays, stay safe!\nOh and Wishlist Puppet Master: The Game on steam!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BZHr1-oMCE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BZHr1-oMCE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BZHr1-oMCE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BZHr1-oMCE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5BZHr1-oMCE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Puppet Master: The Game - DEV VLOG - 12/13/22", "description": "#puppetmaster  #asymmetrical  #horrorgaming #multiplayer \n\nWISHLIST TODAY!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/17...\n\nFOLLOW US!\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/PuppetMasterTG\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/Octobergames\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/octobergame...\n\nJOIN OR DISCORD\nhttps://discord.gg/aqAMKHP\n\nIt\u2019s been an amazing honor to work with Full Moon Features.
