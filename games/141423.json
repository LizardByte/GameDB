The Storm King was supposed to be in charge of the West Land, blowing the leaves from the trees.\n\nThen suddenly the Storm King got the idea that his job was to blow everything away - absolutely everything, no matter what anybody said. He ignored Sugar's protests, and blew her three friends to the far reaches of Angel Land.\n\nSugar must now travel to different lands in order to free her friends, pausing to help anyone else who may have had their things blown away as well. Finally, she must confront the Storm King to show him the consequences of his actions.\nFeatures\nMost worlds have their own collectables. These are found all over any given world.
