As you play, the app serves as a sort of referee and rulebook, freeing up the players to concentrate on devising strategies to crush their enemies and give grief to their friends on the other side of the table. Thus, Golem Arcana combines the tactile fun of a tabletop game with the accessibility of an online game.
