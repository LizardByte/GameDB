However, unlike normal roguelikes, the HP system, experience system, levels, UI, and almost everything else has been reimagined to fit the theme of the game. And most of all this is the first roguelike to offer an enjoyable experience for even casual players. But this game has many layers, and even roguelike veterans will have something to look forward to in the diverse systems this game has to offer. The same combination of words will always create the same spell, so tell your friends about the spells you discover and use the knowledge you've hoarded to beat others in time attack mode. There's all sorts of ways to play!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-magical-high-school-girl", "videos": [{"id": 18853, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "QyfRgsd85dY"}, {"id": 18854, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Mhs1gws42w4"}]}
