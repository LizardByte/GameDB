Tall buildings cover every available space. The air is thick with smoke and poisonous chemicals. Parking is a nightmare. \n \nThe Collosotropolan leaders have decided the simplest solution is to invade the neighbouring country of Mungola. They don't anticipate much of a struggle - Mungolans are simple, earthy types without much love for industry. In fact, Mungola's entire defence force consists of a single squadron of fighter planes - the venerable F-27 \"Platypus\". \n \nWhat possible threat could a few antique aircraft be to the mighty Collosotropolan Battle Fleet...? \n \nTo the Mungolan people the venerable F-27 \"Platypus\" is their last best hope for freedom!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
