It has been nearly two years since Cello Aufiero and her mother moved to Amorina, yet despite the city's charm, Cello has yet to begin to feel at home. Like a tourist, it seems there is no place for her, and it's hard to make friends when you are only passing through. One day, her teacher assigns the class a project, based on one simple question: \"What is the true spirit of Amorina?\" It's a simple question indeed, but it feels impossible for an eternal tourist like Cello. Luckily, a pair of classmates comes to her rescue. Through this simple assignment, can she find true companionship? Or better yet, her true home?", "summary": "A short visual novel about home and friendship.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cerulean", "videos": [{"id": 36242, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OFgTns3Ymas", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFgTns3Ymas", "title": "Cerulean Trailer [SuNoFes 2015]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OFgTns3Ymas/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
