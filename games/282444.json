This game serves as a retelling of Towelket 5, with a primary focus on the Bomb Maidens from the earlier entries. The narrative takes a slight twist to introduce new plots and characters. As a spin-off of the main series Towelket One More Time, it references elements and features characters from the previous entries. It is suggested to play at least Towelket 1 and Towelket 5 to fully understand it.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/towelket-0-maiden-bomb-invaders"}
