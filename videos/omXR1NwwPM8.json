There are many bets available and they are explained from time to time in the interval between one quarter and the other of the games: it is in fact possible to shoot in elevation, crush to the basket, fake the shot, fake a dunk to end in lay-up or to pass the ball to a partner, conclude a successful rebound with a tap-in, fade-away, make an alley-oop, use a partner for a pick and roll and more.\n\nThe game is centered on the NBA play-off with teams that recall the real NBA teams of the time for social colors, aesthetic and qualitative characteristics of the players, and for the sake of rights the teams only present the name of the city (for example the Golden State Warriors are present under the name of Oakland and the Utah Jazz as Salt Lake City) and no NBA play-off has ever presented exactly the 16 teams present in the game.\n\nThere are five players per team (unlike other time titles which had fewer players) indicated in their roles and which have the typical characteristics of their role (for example the point guard is low and fast, the shooting guard is fast and skilled in the shooting from distance, the center is big, slow and in the phase of crushing or rebounding it has the upper hand on the opposing guards pushing them). Each player of each team has a general assessment of his ability visible when choosing the team in the form of a colored bar.\n\nA game is divided into four quarters and if at the end of a quarter you are not in the lead the game ends and you have the possibility, with a new credit, to continue with the fourth (or extra time) next.\n\nThere is also a commentary on the match in English in which the commentator names the teams and has a set of comments used for individual actions, from blocking to three-point shooting, from alley-oop to fade-away shooting.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/InsertCoinArcad", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/omXR1NwwPM8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/omXR1NwwPM8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/omXR1NwwPM8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/omXR1NwwPM8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/omXR1NwwPM8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Run and Gun Arcade", "description": "The game involves the use of a multidirectional control and three buttons through which a vast range of solutions is available for each stage of the game: with the A button in attack (possession) a basket shot is made and in the defense phase (ball to the opponent) an attempt is made to stop or try to capture a rebound, with the button B in the attack phase you pass the ball to the companion indicated by the cursor (while the game you control has a brightness greater than the teammates) and in defense you try to steal the ball from the opponent, with the button C in attack you move the cursor of the companion to whom to pass the ball to another companion and in defense you change the player from to check.
