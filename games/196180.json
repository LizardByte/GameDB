You\u2019ve been living in this tiny fantasy countryside, a very relaxing environment, but suddenly something unusual happened. You wake up one day and all the animal farms are now floating like little islands in the sky! The paths were shuffled and the baby animals were spread. To fix this, slide the blocks to rebuild the broken paths. So you help moms unite the families again and bring the farms back to land. As you progress solving the logic puzzles, have the great feeling of uniting families and see your land farm expand. There is no time limit or resources to manage, so you can calmly just focus on solving the puzzles while listening to a soothing soundtrack and animal sounds.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/floating-farmer"}
