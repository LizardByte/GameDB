OSIRIS makes that one look like pac-man.\n\nOSIRIS contains incredible new monsters, textures, graphics, and sounds (326 new sprites!). Loosely (very loosely) based on the movie \"STARGATE\". Designed to be DIFFICULT, with serious thought applied to gameplay, lighting, architecture, immersion, and theme.\n\nGameplay will be best on ULTRAVIOLENT in single-player or co-op modes. Provision for deathmatch is not included. OSIRIS is NOT so huge as to slow your machine to a crawl, but faster machines will, of course, play better.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/osiris--2"}
