Is also known as Rescue From Atlantis.\n\nAtlantida is the last ship built by engineers from the first Somerset era. A ship of such characteristics was never built for its safety and for the power of its armament.\n\nBut now, this incredible interstellar spawn finds itself in enemy hands, deep in the ocean. There, they have been preparing a large-scale offensive to seize Earth, the first enemy target in their quest to conquer Somerset, and later the Universe.\n\nSo that this does not happen, you have been chosen, for your bravery and your great gifts of skill.
