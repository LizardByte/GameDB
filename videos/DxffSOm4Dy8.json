This time some sort of spells practice, I hope you'll enjoy it :)\n\nFirst half of spellcards isn't very hard. Next half should be more fascinating I think. Anyway, it's worth to try it by yourself. I really would like to know how far you can go. Can you master all the levels? Maybe... Good luck ^^\n\nSome basics:\n- There are two characters to choose - Reimu and Marisa - with two different shottypes. For each character history and \"capture points\" are counted separately. What are these capture points? I'll explain it soon.\n- There are 24 enemies to beat with 3 spellcards each. Every enemy has one unlockable spell - you unlock it when you successfully beat three previous spells. There are also 8 Extra Spellcards, which you can unlock by getting certain amount of capture points.\n- What are these capture points? Well, every spellcard is marked by level. The first three Rumia's spells has levels: 1, 3 and 5. If you beat them all, you gain 1+3+5=9 points. So, you gain more when spell level is higher - simple, isn't it?\n- Level/Difficulty of attacks are increasing with every next character. Last characters are a real challenge. Upcoming Extra spells aren't giving us mercy too, and you'll see why...\n\n-----\nDownload link to this awesome script: http://www.bulletforge.org/u/shijimi_nono/p/spellcardcollection\n\nFor more fan-made goodies - check out Touhou Fangames List! http://bit.ly/FangamesList\nPatreon - thanks for your support! https://www.patreon.com/CreepyNinja_\nDiscord - Fanworks 'n Chill https://discord.gg/wBVwcxU\n\nEnjoy!
