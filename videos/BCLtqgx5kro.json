Another Game Boy game with no complete walkthrough on YT. In this video I use track 1 for music and Shapes as a stone set.\n\nIshido is a card puzzle game where you have to place 66 cards in a 96 array. The goal is to maximize your score by placing all cards on tiles and, especially, by making 4way-connections. Of course there are specific rules you have to follow in order to place cards next to each other to win (I won't explain the rules here as they are quite lengthy). There are 5 modes to play with (Solitaire, Tournament, VS Computer, VS Player 2 and VS Link). Unfortunately, Solitaire and Tournament seems to be exactly the same as there is no story or actual tournament and after winning/losing a game you can either start a new game or end it. Even though there is only a single game you can play, there is an ending screen if your score is high enough. Note that the higher the score the more fireworks you see on the ending screen.\n\nThe main drawback of this title is that it is strongly based on luck. The cards are shuffled at the start of the game and you have to be really lucky to have the appropriate cards near the end that fits the 4way patterns you have created with the initial cards. Consider yourself lucky if you manage to make more than 2 4way-connections.\n\nGraphics are very basic but it's expected for such type of game. Music is good with a decent variety; there are 4 tracks to choose from (track 4 is formidable, heard it so many times). Gameplay is ok with responsive controls. No hint/pounch used. No death run (death=not see the ending screen).\n\nIn short, if you like card and/or board games, it's worth a try.\n\nFor a longplay showing Solitaire mode go here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzOl5nCWEFU\n\nFor a longplay showing VS Computer mode go here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTGOY47b0kg\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame is played by me in one go.
