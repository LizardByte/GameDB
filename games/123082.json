He is mostly interested in pretty girls, in particular the lovely Mika, with whom he is even ready to discuss books just to get her attention. One day, a beautiful woman appears in front of him out of nowhere. She says that she is Venus, the goddess of love. She comes from a world called Cal, the eternal world populated by lovely girls. She tells the hero that soon he will be needed in that world... and disappears. Was that a dream? Or will our hero really travel to the magical world of Cal and encounter dangers he hasn't even imagined before?", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cal"}
