Plasmania (http://www.mobygames.com/game/apple2/plasmania) was an action game published by Sirius software in 1983 for the Apple ][. The player controls a nano spaceship inside a patient's body and needs to destroy the virus before the it destroys the patient. I always wonder whether this game has an ending, so I played the game with cheats, only to find out it keeps repeating itself. I eventually turned off the cheats after saving 10 patients.\n\nHope you enjoy the longplay!\n\nPS: The hit point is saved in memory address 0x0090.
