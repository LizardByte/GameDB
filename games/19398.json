Although A.D.A.M. gained control over his own actions when he was disconnected from the central network, he's got one serious problem: He's only able to move in a straight line.\n\nWhile exploring countless underground rooms, A.D.A.M. learns how to use the environment to his advantage. By seizing control of other robots, he's able to venture deeper into the heart of the factory to discover the true nature of his mission.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is based on a simple ruleset, A.D.A.M. is a very challenging game. It requires the player to think ahead, plan tactics and recognize patterns of movement and timing. At the same time, thanks to multiple routes and difficulty levels, A.D.A.M. is suitable for all skill levels.\n\nBy introducing new mechanics, enemies and environments along the way, the games ensures that the player must adapt his/her mindset frequently to solve puzzles and dig deeper into the mysterious plot.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adam"}
