You have some control over the animas during a race, and the higher the anima's stats, the easier it is to control. They also need to rest, as you want their mood to be good when they have to race. During the \"final strecth\" of the race (shown in green on the race bar), you can't control your anima and it is up to them and their respect for you to be motivated to run their fastest and to get in a good place at the race.\r\n\r\nYou visit numerous places, have a \"girlfriend\", buy things and can raise various types of anima, but the game still feels a little shallow after a while due to the relatively slow pace of the game.\r\n\r\nIt's decent for the type of game it is and it has pretty decent visuals for a Dreamcast game.
