However, I didn't nuzlocke it. I just played it regularly and oh boy this was still challenging.\nThis Elite 4, wasn't as bad. In fact, if you have the right amount of tools saved for the very lastt, it's fine considering you have limited resources to work with. In this E4 you need to play 2 single and 2 double battle as rules and you can choose which two to single and double. I doubled first twocz those doubles were fun with the VGC knowledge I had. The rest as easier then, So this team of Dragapult, Sneasler, Mega-Beedrill, Urshifu-S, Rillaboom and Alakazam kade it fun.\nMusic: GlitchXCity.\n#pokemon #pokemonscarletandviolet", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvKsvBjuZ2o/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvKsvBjuZ2o/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvKsvBjuZ2o/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvKsvBjuZ2o/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvKsvBjuZ2o/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Pokemon Run and Bun-Elite Four & Champion (BEST TEAM???)(New Hardest ROM Hack)", "description": "It is a new hardest Pokemon Emerald GBA ROM hack with insane difficulty, made by nuzlocker Dekzeh for nuzlockes.
