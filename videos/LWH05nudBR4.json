{"id": "LWH05nudBR4", "snippet": {"title": "Azmar Quest (Text-Based RPG) Demo is Now on Steam with a new Trailer!", "description": "The Azmar Quest Demo is finally available!\n\nSteam announcement for the Demo: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3474140/view/511824774162284804\n\nAzmar Quest Steam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3474140/Azmar_Quest_Old_School_RPG/\n\nYou can play through the first 2 Chapters of the game and get a taste of what's to come in the full game!\n\nWhat is Azmar Quest?\n\nAzmar Quest is a text-based RPG, with turn-based battles and old-school vibes. The single-player main story should last at least 20 hours, then there's a lot of additional content! And if you play online, you can also fight in PvP and play Dungeons. Choose your class and let the adventure begin!\n\nDemo Limitations:\n\nPlease note that the demo has the following limitations:\n\n\u2022 Only the first 2 Chapters are available. The first chapter is mostly designed to introduce you to the game.\n\u2022 Only 2 Extra Missions are available.\n\u2022 The maximum level is 10.\n\u2022 Most extra game modes (2v2 battles, party-based 3v3 battles) are inaccessible because they require a higher level or specific points in the story to unlock.\n\u2022 You can only play in single-player mode. You cannot sign in to play online, so you don't have access to PvP battles and online events, and you can't queue for a Dungeon.\n\nThanks for trying Azmar Quest! As a solo-developer, I hope you enjoy the demo!\n\n#steam  #rpg  #indiegame  #pcgaming  #azmarquest", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LWH05nudBR4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LWH05nudBR4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LWH05nudBR4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LWH05nudBR4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LWH05nudBR4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Azmar Quest (Text-Based RPG) Demo is Now on Steam with a new Trailer!", "description": "The Azmar Quest Demo is finally available!\n\nSteam announcement for the Demo: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3474140/view/511824774162284804\n\nAzmar Quest Steam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3474140/Azmar_Quest_Old_School_RPG/\n\nYou can play through the first 2 Chapters of the game and get a taste of what's to come in the full game!\n\nWhat is Azmar Quest?\n\nAzmar Quest is a text-based RPG, with turn-based battles and old-school vibes.
