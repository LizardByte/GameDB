It is largely based on the PlayStation port while lacking its FMVs and having a decreased screen resolution, and down-sampled music and sound effects to meet the specifications of the device.\n\nThe WonderSwan Color port introduces a number of graphical enhancements to character sprites and backgrounds by providing additional details and color shading. The original character portraits were replaced with new, smaller portraits. Also, certain boss sprites were changed to those featured in the Japanese Easy Type version of the Super Famicom game.\n\nThe game features a revamped difficulty different from both the original and the Easy Type versions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-iv--5", "videos": [{"id": 105322, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "dOo11KFJfKo"}]}
