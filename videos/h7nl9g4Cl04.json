{"id": "h7nl9g4Cl04", "snippet": {"title": "Mean Girls DS (2009) - Full Playthrough", "description": "[PLEASE READ]\n\nThis is the full playthrough of the lost Mean Girls game for the Nintendo DS and all of this would not be possible without the help of LM community member and programmer TOMYSSHADOW \n\nThis game was full of so many bugs, and required several restarts, a patch, and a lot of debugging and patience but we managed to pull through. After all this, I can tell that the game required a lot of bug testing and wasn\u2019t at all ready for a release before it was ultimately pulled from release. All things considered, I managed to finish the games to 97%, with the other 3% being a few more hidden stars, and 3-4 rumors that are unlocked from higher scores (which was hard to get with the limitations). In order to complete the game I had to reset it a handful of times and replay multiple different missions, so this footage has all been spliced together to be more coherent. I took a few notes of some issues with the game we encountered below:\n\n1) There was the initial infinite loop error that occurred around 14 minutes into the game after completing the first mini game\n\n2) After patching the game and passing this bug, the infinite loop would randomly be present after other mini games. It then became an issue of the game using too much memory and the only way to get passed this was to reset the game and start again from the most recent save point. But this issue came up on several different occasions, and when it did, sometimes the autosave didn\u2019t work (which meant certain missions had to be replayed over and over)\n\n3) After the game was patched, it could only be played in No$GBA and wouldn\u2019t run in Desmume or other emulators, so I was unable to rotate the screen during the prompts (which made stuff a little more difficult)\n\n4) There was a point in the game after visiting Regina\u2019s house, where the chapter repeats itself and the game crashes. After the game crashes, the save progress went from 45% to 0. This happened 3 times until there was no crash on the 4th attempt.\n\n5) Chapters completing and repeating resulting in the game crashing\n\n6) Normally, after completing a mission, the player will see a notification showing them that it has been completed, but as I ventured further into the game, this notification would be delayed, and I\u2019d find myself searching empty areas of the map until the chapter completion prompt showed up\n\n7) Glitched out sprites and dialogue boxes\n\n8) Certain minigames required the stylus. The Jingle bell Rock Dance Mini games specifically, only worked efficiently on the Nintendo DS. Through the use of an emulator, using the mouse or a tablet stylus for the  mini game yielded poor results as it had difficulties picking up the mouse and pen pressure. (I couldn\u2019t find any way around this in the No$GBA emulator, so please excuse the poor performance during those 3 sequences, I now hate the Jingle Bell Rock LOL)\n\n9) Character sprites appeared in locations of the map where they shouldn\u2019t have been (ie. Characters like Janis and Kevin frequently were found in the background of different locations but you could not interact with them)\n\n10) There is little to no background music, and when there is, it plays very choppy on both the Desmume and No$GBA emulators. This was tested on a Nintendo DS and the audio  quality slightly improved\n\n11) Sometimes you'd receive a game over even if you got a high score and a congratulations if you got a low score, and at times, mini games displayed upside down. the game feels very unstable\n\n12) There's a weird flashing during the fireworks mini game at 1:20:00\n\n13) Why did they make Janis even meaner in this game LOL\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWatch the original Girl Games of Lost Media Docuseries here!\nPart 1 - https://youtu.be/D8ZUR2De15s\nPart 2 - https://youtu.be/_bQVTurDGPY\n\nContact/Press:\nbobdungaofficial@gmail.com\n\nIf you\u2019d like to support my work and be up to date with new videos, please follow my socials!\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Bobdunga92/\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/bobdunga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bobdunga92\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bobdunga92/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Bobdunga", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h7nl9g4Cl04/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h7nl9g4Cl04/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h7nl9g4Cl04/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mean Girls DS (2009) - Full Playthrough", "description": "[PLEASE READ]\n\nThis is the full playthrough of the lost Mean Girls game for the Nintendo DS and all of this would not be possible without the help of LM community member and programmer TOMYSSHADOW \n\nThis game was full of so many bugs, and required several restarts, a patch, and a lot of debugging and patience but we managed to pull through.
