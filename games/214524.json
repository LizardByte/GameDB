Travel back in time to ancient Arabia during the \"Days Of Ignorance\" and shadow the Prophet Muhammad as he struggles to enlighten his pagan contemporaries. Having been granted a glimpse of the true nature of reality, he beholds mankind to have gone astray and seeks to reunite them with their creator. Follow in his footsteps across 20 unique locations and become his most trusted companion as his destiny gradually unfolds. It doesn't promise to be easy, however, as a disbelieving public and an oppressive Quraysh regime seek to stifle his fledgling movement. Featuring over 100 authentic storylines and scriptural references for further reading, \"The Making Of A Prophet\" is a timely reminder of the definition of Islam."}
