The tunnel takes on many different forms, and the shooter has a special \"superzapper\" that enables it to kill all enemies present in the tunnel.", "summary": "Tempest is a 1981 arcade game by Atari Inc., designed and programmed by Dave Theurer. It takes place on a three-dimensional surface, sometimes wrapped into a tube, which is viewed from one end and is divided into a dozen or more segments or lanes. The player controls a claw-shaped spaceship (named Blaster) that crawls along the near edge of the playfield, moving from segment to segment. Tempest was one of the first games to use Atari's Color-QuadraScan vector display technology. It was also the first game to allow the player to choose their starting level (a system Atari dubbed \"SkillStep\"). This feature increases the maximum starting level depending on the player's performance in the previous game, essentially allowing the player to continue.\n\nAn official port was released for the Atari ST. An official port that bears the Atari logo was released by Superior Software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron in 1985, and another by Electric Dreams for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1987. Versions for the Atari 2600 and 5200 were in the works in Atari, Inc. during 1984, and unfinished prototypes exist for both of them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
