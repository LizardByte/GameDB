We also added dedicated quality assurance testers to our team, which has allowed us to really stress test data and multiplayer and has already proven to be worth the cost ten times over.\n\nLutari\n\nThe second moon of Theseus Prime is Lutari. Lutari is positioned very close to the Theseus Prime ring system, giving a beautiful look at the \u201chot Jupiter\u2019s\u201d rings. Similar in appearance to our own moon, this world features reduced gravity, strange \u201cMoonshrooms\u201d and is rich in rare minerals.\n\nInfinity Terrain\n\nWe also added back in our \u201cinfinity terrain\u201d system and improved it greatly. Added first to Lutari, the infinity terrain will generate in all directions at huge distances, completely removing any end of the world. We optimized the system from previous versions and improved the visuals to allow for parallax mapping and detailed shader system, the same shader system on the primary terrain area, which gives a nice cohesive look.\n\nAll the other locations will be getting the Infinity Terrain in future releases.\n\nMoon Mantis\n\nThe first discovered Lutarian is the Moon Mantis, which appears to be some sort of predator that roams the surface.\n\nThe Moon Mantis takes advantage of our new IK Creature Animation system which allows math drive IK for traversal and feet planting while using expressive key framed animations in the attack sequences. We\u2019ve had a lot of players ask for this, which has also been on our roadmap, and now it\u2019s here. Other creatures will be receiving this animation treatment as we go.\n\nMoonshroom\n\nNot completely desolate, there seems to be a strange iridescent shrub called a Moonshroom on the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nChanges to Slipping\n\nThe controversial and much debated foot sliding mechanic has been tweaked in this version. When attempting to jump at the highest peak incline the slip now has a very small chance of causing a suit breach. The sliding duration has been drastically reduced to allow for quicker interaction after sliding.\n\nUser Interface Transitions\n\nSomething we\u2019ve always wanted to add in and finally had a chance. We started with some nifty zoom transitions when going from menu to menu.\n\nLots of fixes and improvements\n\nHuge focus on furthering the data stability since our change to the cloud file system. Countless bugs were fixed this week around these features. We also fixed party member ownership, building, and other control issues.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C3Rrhffr9GQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C3Rrhffr9GQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C3Rrhffr9GQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C3Rrhffr9GQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C3Rrhffr9GQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Osiris: New Dawn - Lutari", "description": "Explore Lutari, Moonshrooms, Moon Mantis, Infinity Terrain, and lots of Stability fixes.\n\nhttps://www.osirisnewdawn.com\n\nWhile half our team focused this week on data stability and multiplayer, the other half focused on adding a new moon, creature, and lots of polish and bug fixes.
