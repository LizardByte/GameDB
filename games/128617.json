This was a week long project that started from the 3 hour game jam with the theme: Rain.\n\nIt's an experiment in trying out a different art style that would suit my skills.\n\nIt's also a personal game, where I tried to figure out my own personality and translate that into different aspects of the game. Something like a journal, in interactive form. Enjoy the experience."}
