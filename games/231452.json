One of such people was Acretia, a very skilled and cold-hearted sorceress, who signed up for a guild managed by Tehrin. She wished to attain greatness beyond human comprehension from doing so.\n\nTehrin allied with other top-rated guild leaders. They sent her to complete one of the most difficult missions no one has ever completed... However, many years passed since that day without Acretia returning to the guild's headquarters.\n\nYears after that, a highly-praised sorceress, Arvena, noticed a very violent mana flow disturbance; almost every magician on the island is losing their powers and lives from it. Tallanar, the protagonist, however, is unaffected...\n\nHe was called to Tehrin's office to discuss the matter. Tehrin asked him to investigate the issue and help save people from death. Tallanar agrees to take this job, but in return asked for the release of his friend, Telthos, from prison. Both heroes travel through the land of Tulneau searching for the person responsible for such mayhem...", "summary": "Spellzone is an RPG where the player controls a team of heroes who explore Tulneau Island. While this game uses a standard turn-based battle system, some tactical approaches may be required in order to defeat enemies.\n\nMost in-game action takes place in the forest areas of Tulneau island, but you will also travel through deep underground passages, mines, rural areas, and cities.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spellzone"}
