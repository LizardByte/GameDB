In this top-down multiplayer action game, up to 4 players will team up to rid the city of the waves of undead that now occupy it. They will have a roster of characters to choose from, each featuring a unique set of skills and backgrounds, from the compassionate (but not overly so) Sister Abigail and the cheerful innkeeper and zombie slayer Runolf, to the sardonic bounty hunter Rose and the escaped werewolf (and man\u2019s best friend) Varag. Teamplay and great reflexes will be the key to survive in this fast-paced, challenging title.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 23951, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pGJKbqugGPs"}, {"id": 26431, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "NWLrzHlu9ZE"}, {"id": 28677, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "oheCJX5rQpA"}, {"id": 33712, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5zHBQp073Jo"}]}
