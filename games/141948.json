The London he knows and loves has been thrown into absolute chaos. \n \nInitially thinking that Luke may have simply been pulling his leg with a harmless jest, the professor cannot help but recall the terrible events that occurred the previous week... \n \nThe start of which was an unveiling ceremony of mankind's first time machine, attended by many prominent figures from throughout the nation. \n \nDuring a demonstration, the time machine went out of control and engulfed the audience in a terrible explosion. \n \nSeveral of the attendees mysteriously vanished into thin air, including Prime Minister Bill Hawks. \n \nUnable to shake the feeling that the time machine's explosion may somehow be connected, Professor Layton and Luke set off to the location mentioned in the letter, a clock shop on Midland Road in Baldwin, embarking on what might be the biggest mystery they have ever encountered."}
