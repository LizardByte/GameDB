This time around, the evil Gangrene gang is causing trouble in the city and it is up to Buttercup to battle through the town and stop them. Since she is known for her physical strength, Buttercup uses it throughout the game to destroy enemies and anything else that gets in her way. Of course, all this fighting can wear on a girl, but the power-ups scattered throughout the levels will help aid the fight. Along with the power-ups, there are collectable items hidden in the game as well. After collecting these items you can trade them with the other two POWERPUFF games via link cable. Help Buttercup save the day in POWERPUFF GIRLS: Paint the Townsville Green.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/powerpuff-girls-paint-the-townsville-green"}
