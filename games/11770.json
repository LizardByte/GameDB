The game will retain the primary gameplay of its prdecessor whereby the game has 10 tiles, arranged in a 3x3 grid with the middle column having a 4th tile at the bottom. Each of these tiles has a hiragana Lyric on them, when indicated you are required to flick the tile in the indicated direction. Unlike its predecessor though, the game will feature vocaloids other than Hatsune Miku including Kagamine Len, Kagamine Rin and Megurine Luka as well as duet songs whereby two vocaloids would sing together for a song. The game will also include a new \"Extreme\" difficulty mode, which will provide players with a difficulty between the \"Hard\" Mode and \"Break the Limit\" Mode of the original.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/miku-flick-slash-02", "videos": [{"id": 5230, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bFNB3m9Ig-c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFNB3m9Ig-c", "title": "\u3010\u30df\u30af\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\uff0f02\u301160\u79d2\u30d7\u30ed\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u516c\u958b\uff01", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bFNB3m9Ig-c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
