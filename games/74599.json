Players can experience chilling encounters and tension evolving from the game play. There is no tips, or help given to players. They must survive by instinct. Every decision you make matters, the smallest mistake can be lethal. If you perish, you lose everything and must scavenge once more with only your hands. Fight the zombie population by yourself or with friends, but other players can be friendly or enemies without you knowing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/perfect-dead"}
