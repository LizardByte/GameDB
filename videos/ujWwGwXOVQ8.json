Released in late 2005 and more than a full year after the original PS, it is a modest upgrade with an additional playable character, several gameplay tweaks and balance corrections, and new enemies. Take to the skies as Parity, Xlala or Queenty and razzle dazzle with hocus pocus because... well, why not?\n\nI have little idea what's going on in this game because it's not clearly outlined in any fashion, but digging up info from the Wayback Graveyard suggests that Crane House has a thing for Gothic concepts and that our heroines are a form of demon busters and vampire hunters. The game consists of five stages and can be cleared in 15-20 minutes with a scoring system familiar to most shmup fanatics where enemies can be defeated to score collectibles that can be pulled towards the player (if you stop shooting temporarily) or grabbed manually if you don't wish to let go of the trigger. Each character is fundamentally different and utilizes four main abilities (regular shot, rapid shot, mana abilities and different bombs) and you can also dash in a pinch although it can't be used in quick succession. The titular Parity can ultilize lock-on abilities (which can be spammed and almost seems unintentional) while Xlala is the most difficult character to use and uses a powerful close-range saber you can swing around. \n\nQueenty, on the other hand, is a newcomer and is in a league of her own as she can only be described as 100% broken; while her main shot has the most narrow area of effect,  she has the unique ability to summon various spirits that steamroll enemies in almost any given situation. Her serpent spirit is also good at absorbing bullets and as if this wasn't enough, her bomb has her stopping time like a boss. She has to manually wait to shuffle through the various spirits she has which takes time, but it's not nearly a big enough con given all of her pros.\n\nI suppose it's worth mentioning that the higher difficulties have better multipliers which ties into greater scoring potential and the soundtrack composed by Jun A. is rather nice. The visuals are also quite nice overall though a few assets look a little bare or unfinished. It's a lovely little game made by just a few people at the end of the day but I recommend more seasoned shmup fans look elsewhere for a challenge... even without a clear visual of your hitbox or using Queenty, the bullet patterns are pretty easy to dodge and the other characters are more than capable of clearing the game without incident. There is only one death in this video and it is only to illustrate that the dash mechanic has a cooldown and can't be spammed in rapid succession. This is a video going through the game.
