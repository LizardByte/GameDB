But two years later, what he realized inside the company would change his whole life. The technology developed in this place was not for the benefit of people. People were being slaughtered here for the brutal pleasure of other people. Frank immediately quit his job as soon as he realized this. In the later part of his life, he tried to expose this company.\n\nBy 1996, Frank was still working on exposing this company. The most important thing he found; was the discovery of 3024 ports (slots) that could infiltrate the company. But he will not be able to continue this because he has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. For this, he uploaded all the documents he obtained to the internet and hoped that someone would reach them.\n\nIn 2002, these documents were found by a hacker with the nickname anonym52. In 2022, anonym52 put the documents Frank obtained until 1996 and the documents they have obtained so far on Frank's Computer Online website. They could now complete Frank's unfinished mission. But anonym52 would not be able to undertake this big mission alone. For this, they need 3024 more people.", "summary": "Can you run, swim and use a shotgun without your eyes? \u2014I'm looking for 3024 people is an alternate reality game whose story spans from 1974 to the present.
