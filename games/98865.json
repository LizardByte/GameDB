It has gone by many other names, including the dots and boxes, game of dots, boxes, squares, dot to dot grid, and pigs in a pen.\nThe game plays really well for children, and yet can be played quite seriously, if you want to exercise the brain cells. At the simple level, the winner appears to be a matter of chance; at the analytic level, the winner will probably be the first one who can analyze the end game correctly.\nAll you do (on your turn) is to join two next-door dots on the grid, drawing a line and trying to complete a hexagon. Each time you make a hexagon, you must take another turn. If you fail to make a hexagon, the other (or next) player then takes his turn to draw a line.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lines-and-hexa"}
