Control the blue Pimmons, the wild Amazons, or the insectoid Sajiki and create your kingdom on the planet Lukkat.\n\nDirect the fate of a whole nation and make them control the planet. Be a founder of cities and ensure their growth and prosperity. Your nation requires not only food, it also wants to be kept in good mood through pubs, theatres, circuses and orgy dens.\n\nPush forward research and trade. The correct diplomatic strategy protects you from sudden attacks. But to be prepared - fighting will be inevitable."}
