A game also known for being a 3-button game that has 7 different weapons.\n\nI THINK it is something about time traveling...and a god...and a diamond thing...IUNNO! SHMUP + JAPANESE DEFINITELY EQUALS NO PLOT!\n\nGameplay involves chaining enemies of the same color to score high. Chaining and scoring is integral to powering up your weapons so you don't timeout on a boss. New to the Saturn version is, well, Saturn mode. lol It is pretty much a \"Story Mode\", complete with savefiles for people like me who suck at this game and suck at scoring overall. It pretty much goes through all of the stages from the Arcade version (so that means Stage 2 and Stage 4 paths) and adds a few new bosses. Saturn version also has Arcade mode.\n\nThis longplay plays through Saturn Mode first while neglecting chains and sucking at scoring while missing pretty much every goddamn dog imaginable. After scrubbing it through Saturn Mode, I play through Arcade Mode on Path 2 while attempting to chain badly.\n\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wue0F5YyeEQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wue0F5YyeEQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wue0F5YyeEQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wue0F5YyeEQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wue0F5YyeEQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Saturn Longplay [150] Radiant Silvergun (JP)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Tsunao\n\nShmup by Treasure.
