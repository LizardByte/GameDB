Given your company's status as a small internet startup competing in a crowded space and with limited investor funds, you must make your employees work overtime -- however, the extent of your forced overtime can affect the health and productivity of your employees, as well as the plot. As your company bleeds money, though, remember that there are no happy endings here, and all of your employees -- including you yourself -- end up scarred and changed by the company and its draconian work policies.", "summary": "A Blessing for the Herd is a morality tale about China's \"996\" system of overworking employees, aimed to expose the societal and cultural structures behind the \"996\" system. Take control of a fledging e-commerce startup, manage investor funds and employees, and grow your customer base -- but be warned, pushing your employees to the edge can have devastating consequences. As the company expands, the stories of you and six other employees intertwine, as you work overtime to fulfil impossible investor expectations.", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shechu-de-fubao", "videos": [{"id": 95055, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BB6NArI-FeI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB6NArI-FeI", "title": "\u300a\u793e\u755c\u7684\u798f\u62a5\u300b\u6e38\u620f\u5ba3\u4f20\u89c6\u9891", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BB6NArI-FeI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
