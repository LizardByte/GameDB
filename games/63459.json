The boss for this stage is a Kraang, and the princess, based on Zelda, is Raphael.\n\nLevel 2 apes Super Mario Bros. and has Fishface as the boss. This Peach-like princess is Michelangelo.\n\nThe final level plays similar to classic TMNT games and has a distinct Star Wars homage atmosphere. The boss is a Darth Shredder and the princess is a Leonardo Leia.
