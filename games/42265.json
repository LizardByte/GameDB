Super F1 Circus Limited was quickly created to take advantage of this recent development.\n\nWith the exception of the use of actual drivers/team names, there is no significant difference between this version of the game and the earlier Super F1 Circus. The series would see a proper sequel on the Super Nintendo, with enhanced graphics and additional features, with Super F1 Circus 2 in 1993.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-f1-circus-limited", "collections": [{"id": 3209, "name": "F1 Circus"}, {"id": 10236, "name": "Super F1 Circus"}]}
