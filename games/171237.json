The Movie mode presents a dramatic reconstruction of a series of events that could have taken place in Ancient Egypt. The Discovery mode describes Ancient Egypt culture, religion and history.\n\nIn the Game mode you will follow Harold Peabody - dreamer, adventurer and optimist - on his quest for the hidden tomb of the mythical Pharaoh Ankh-Re. After finding a way to open the door to the pyramid, the player has to explore the pyramid, find useful items and overcome various obstacles. Stepping on the wrong tile or opening a wrong door may result in the untimely death of the hero. To avoid traps and decipher clues the player has to consult an \"English-Hieroglyphics translator\" found early in the game.\n\nSecrets of the Pyramids is a short, inventory-based adventure game with a simple interface (with a \"look\" and \"use\" icon). The player can only save one game at a time (by pressing the S-key). The game comes with a soundtrack and some sound effects; comments are shown in message windows that pop-up (no voices).", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/secrets-of-the-pyramids"}
