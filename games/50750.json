Each new game generates a new world, and it is yours to develop: Dig and build anything, anywhere! \n \nAll machines have been carefully modelled down to small details. They all have opening doors and hatches, switches that control fully simulated systems, and have realistic physics models. You climb into and onto the machines, watch battery and fuel levels, follow realistic procedures that mimic the real machines. Our goal is to make you think of these machines as your own.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/machine-world-2"}
