In response, an enraged Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on the tiny nation of Serbia, which caused a complex web of alliances across Europe to be triggered. With Russia entering the conflict, the Austro-Hungarians drew up hasty plans for an invasion intent on knocking \"little Serbia\" out of the war quickly so they would be able to transfer forces to counter the Russian advance on the Eastern Front. However, the first invasion of Serbia would fail miserably, followed by a second invasion that ground to a halt, and then a third invasion that, with victory seemingly within grasp, would also end in a humiliating defeat for the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Those three defeats would pave the way for a German intervention which would finally see the total conquest of Serbia a year later. The little known Serbian campaigns would serve as inspiration to the allies as Serbia defied all odds and stood against the might of the Central Powers.", "summary": "Operational wargame from John Tiller's First World War Campaigns featuring the battles for Serbia in World War I.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/serbia-14", "collections": [{"id": 3245, "name": "First World War Campaigns"}]}
