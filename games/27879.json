Alpha 5 and Zordon introduce themselves to the teens and a re-imagination of the first episodes coronation of making the teens rangers tends to happen. The team is sent out to fight off the Putty Patrol again; they now have the ability to morph to their ranger forms. Along the way they encounter the Mighty Minotaur, the Knasty Knight, Madame Woe, and Twin Man as a sub-bosses, the Tenga Warriors who replace the Putty Patrol when Lord Zedd replaces Rita later for failing to defeat the Power Rangers.\n\nAs towers appear in the city, the rangers and their megazord destroy the towers and fight off the mega monster forms of Sepenterra, King Sphinx and Goldar no less. Tommy (brainwashed as the Evil Green Ranger) fights the rangers but eventually joins the team. Lord Zedd is defeated and the power rangers celebrate their victory.\n\nKing Sphinx, a monster from the 4th episode of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, is a boss in the game.", "summary": "Power Rangers: Mega Battle is a 2D sidescrolling beat 'em up arcade game.
