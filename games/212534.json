Will you fight to survive Skynet\u2019s unceasing assault, or will you help bring about the end of the self-destructive creatures that thought themselves the masters of the world?\n\nAs members of the human Resistance, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Skynet\u2019s primary core is down, but secondary protocols have been activated all across the globe, and they are as determined as ever to destroy humanity. So, protect what\u2019s yours at all costs!\n\nIf you join the forces of Skynet, though, you have one goal. Your systems are damaged, your forces depleted, but your mission is clear: eliminate the human race. Rebuild what was destroyed, bring your core up to full capacity, and bring war to the world once again.\n\nWhichever side you choose, you\u2019ll need to sustain your war machine. Build up infrastructure to help gather resources, mobilize units, and research new technologies.\n\nTechnology and research can turn basic infantry into powerful combatants. It will take the most cutting-edge tech to overcome your foes, so explore an advanced and customizable tech tree to make sure your edge is fit to cut with.\n\nYour forces will also need guidance. Your Leaders have sophisticated skill trees you\u2019ll need to master if you\u2019re going to get the most out of every soldier and combat unit.\n\nThe human resistance has fractured while Skynet\u2019s forces override each other, constantly trying to gain an advantage. So, your natural allies could also be your greatest enemies. Take your forces, gather those who can truly aid you, and crush your foes on the field of battle.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/terminator-genisys-future-war", "videos": [{"id": 107733, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qLkqJVln9ns", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLkqJVln9ns", "title": "Terminator Genisys: Future War - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qLkqJVln9ns/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
