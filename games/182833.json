While you browse through locations you meet Valtiel, who tries to open a gateway to the second part of the map for you. In order for him to do it, you must collect bunnies scattered all over the map. The more bunnies you pick up, the more monsters come at you. When you pick up all bunnies, you run to the final door and the second part of the game begins. During the final run to the end, Alessa appears and shows you the direction you should go towards the end. The events of this game happen after Silent Hill 3, when Heather tries to leave Silent Hill but for some reason, she must go back to it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/silent-hill-2-dot-5"}
