Visit the Festival of Thieves, battle a ghost, escape from slavers, gamble your fortune at the Halls of Vlada, drink at the tavern, worship strange Gods, and much much more. Will you uncover the secrets of the city, overthrow the Council, destroy an invading army, or leave Khar\u00e9 to burn?\n\nFrom legendary designer Steve Jackson, co-founder of Lionhead Studios (with Peter Molyneux), and Fighting Fantasy and Games Workshop (with Ian Livingstone), and designed and adapted by inkle, the app uses inklewriter technology to tell your journey in real-time, shaping the story around your choices. The text itself changes based on how you play and what you do. In combat, the action is described on the fly based on how you play.\n\nFeaturing original illustrations by John Blanche and maps by Mike Schley (Wizards of the Coast).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sorcery-2", "videos": [{"id": 71424, "video_id": "EB2zYM91Skk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB2zYM91Skk", "title": "Sorcery! 2 for Android official trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EB2zYM91Skk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
