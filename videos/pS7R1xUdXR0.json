The graphics got all the praise they were due when it first came out (no doubt, it's a great looking game), and once you have the controls down,  it's nowhere near as hard as people make it out to be.  It's ridiculously frustrating when you fall through platforms or slide out-of-control into a pit, but after awhile you get a feel for these thing and compensate.  It's certainly not an impossible game. \n\nAnd for anyone that hasn't read the manual and still claims it's legendarily hard, the key to everything is to hold down when you want to bounce off of something.  If yout don't hold down,  you just land on it and take damage.  Think of it as a butt bounce trigger. It works on both enemies and items. That's the secret to not getting a game over in two seconds.\n\nI don't particularly love the game,  but it can be fun.  It definitely is not the worst game on the Turbo, either.  I'd personally nominate Tale Spin for that honor.  That's a true trainwreck in every sense of the word. \n________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pS7R1xUdXR0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pS7R1xUdXR0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pS7R1xUdXR0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pS7R1xUdXR0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pS7R1xUdXR0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Darkwing Duck (TG16) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of TTI's 1992 platformer for the TurboGrafx-16, Darkwing Duck.\n\nPlayed on normal mode. \n\nHaving just recently played this again, I think it gets a bit of a raw shake.
