Thanks to your immense support, I am about to cross the finish line with version 1.0. Although there are a few more days of polishing, this does not imply that the launch is the conclusion of our journey. I will definitely continue exploring ways to enhance the gaming experience and simultaneously expand our universe with my next project, \"EON Trooper\". In this project, players will immerse themselves in an entirely new dynamic where stealth and explosive action will be the real protagonists.\n\nWhat can you anticipate from version 1.0?\n\nI have expanded the lore by introducing interactions with the enemies. Each one of them, endowed with unique personalities, adds greater depth to the antagonism, making each victory even more rewarding!\n\nThe experience system has also been revamped. Even though the amount of experience gained has been slightly reduced, I have incorporated a new system of \"killstreaks\" that provides experience bonuses and encourages strategic combat. How far will you go? Assassin? Devastator? Get ready to find out!\n\nIn addition, I have included 11 new weapons, thus completing the entire arsenal and unlockable elements in the game.\n\nI've also made numerous adjustments to the gameplay, including aspects such as damage, mission duration, the number of enemies. These changes may not be evident at first glance, but they are focused on achieving the perfect balance. Also, I have introduced a new design for the logo and several user interface elements.\n\nThis journey has been an astonishing experience, full of learning. It hasn't been an easy road, but I always found in you the most solid support to move forward and make this the beginning of my career. There are still many adventures to come!\n\nThank you so much to all of you. Now, back to work!
