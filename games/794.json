You start with a rusted scout ship and a handful of credits in your pocket It isn't much, but the universe is there for you to explore in search for profitable opportunities. Become a patient, law-abiding merchant, a smuggler far away from the normal space lanes, a pirate preying on the weak, or a professional mercenary hunting down criminal scum. Or just do whatever suits you at the time. At the end of the day, it's all about money and survival. Mostly money.\n\nAre you determined enough to forge your own destiny?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wing-commander-privateer", "collections": [{"id": 184, "name": "Wing Commander"}]}
