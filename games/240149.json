The longer your path, the more resources you acquire. The more resources you acquire, the more turrets and traps you can buy and upgrade to hold of the many mobs of Minecraftia! With 4 dispensers to buy, and 4 traps to lay down all in which can be upgraded you can defend your way on Survival Island, Dungeon and in the Nether! Hint: You can get to the end if you play long enough! Thanks for taking time to play the game, please leave some of your finest critique... Love, Adam, Lewis and Billy! Still not satisfied?
