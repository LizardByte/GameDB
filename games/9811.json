It's a deceptively straightforward skill that involves dexterity, acute awareness, multi-tasking and tactical positioning. You'll have to strategize, solve and fight your way through multitudes of enemy installations to achieve your coveted goal.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cubetractor", "videos": [{"id": 8414, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3Ks3e_gvjtg"}]}
