So he uses Pato to destroy the house of a streamer called ORIGE in the middle of a stream, which prompts a close friend of ORIGE called Gahbye to go to his house to see what happened, ORIGE says he recognized who destroyed his house as Pato before he flew away, and asked Gahbye to alert people on their discord server.\nAfter that, a follower of ORIGE called JC, calls his friend Mateus, who knows about a superweapon that can destroy Pato, Mateus says that it's in Pietro's house, so they go there, to find out that Pato destroyed it too, and that Pietro fled the city afterwards. So ORIGE shows up and tells JC and Mateus to go to the Temple of Origens so they can use the tracker in the temple to locate Pietro, who should have the superweapon, but halfway to the temple, Pato shows up and injures Mateus, leaving JC to go to the temple on his own. After getting there, he uses the tracker to find Pietro, who had fled to the brazilian state of Cear\u00e1, and goes to his provisory hut, only for him to say that the superweapon wasn't created yet. So Pietro prompts JC to go to the house of Jo\u00e3o Natan (aka Jhonatan), to get the final piece of the superweapon, while Pietro goes and rescues Mateus, so JC goes to Jhonatan's house, gets the piece, but on the way back, Pato shows up again and destroys it, so JC comes back empty-handed. Luckily Pietro has a weaker, but working backup, so they go back to the temple to track Pato, and find out he's coming for them. So ORIGE, who came to the temple with them, grabs the superweapon and defeats Pato, who then turns into Sr. Confi\u00e1vel, who turns out to be dream, another one of ORIGE's followers, so they defeat dream too, and the game ends.", "summary": "3D story game", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/origens-story-mode"}
