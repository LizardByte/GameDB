Only his boss, mentor, and best friend Frank is there to help him get over his grief.\n\nThe mod begins with a wake up call from Frank ordering Jake to come down to the station.\n\nAn armed group of highly trained soldiers have taken control of a hospital and all its personnel.\n\nBut Jake will soon realize that this is more than just a hostage situation.", "summary": "Underhell is a Source Engine game developed by the Underhell Team in collaboration with We Create Stuff. Underhell Chapter 1 requires ONLY Source SDK Base 2007 installed. No Source game is required.\n\nUnderhell is split in 3 different zones.\n\nThe first is \"The House\". Each new chapter will have its own version of The House with different puzzles, mysteries to discover, and diary pages of Jake's late wife to be found.\nThe second is \"The Dreams\". With each new version of The House will come a set of dreams. They can be accessed by sleeping in the bed during the night.\n\nDreams will give you bits of information about the story. They are very different from the rest of the game in both their narrative and gameplay, and focus mostly on exploration and solving puzzles.\n\nThe Dreams are not bound by earthly rules and have a few twists to them that will challenge the player.\n\nThe third is \"The Chapters\" where the main storyline of Underhell takes place. You can access a chapter from The House, and when it is completed, you are sent back to The House.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/underhell", "videos": [{"id": 28993, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "z1ihwoGVijE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ihwoGVijE", "title": "Underhell Chapter 1 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z1ihwoGVijE/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 119777, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "j5_nfI-jadk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_nfI-jadk", "title": "Underhell September 1 2023 Livestream", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5_nfI-jadk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 118093, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vJuw8uuG2Jc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJuw8uuG2Jc", "title": "Underhell Chapter One Waiting Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vJuw8uuG2Jc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
