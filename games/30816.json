It's a virtual reality game on SteamVR(HTC VIVE). Though the game is highly inspired by such great games like Minecraft and Besiege, it's specially designed for VR equipment, in which there are a fully developed physical system and more importantly an open-source product called Blockly provided by Google to allow players to design and run programs in the game. Because only the game's first part was developed and now all its function is not more than a voxel version Tilt Brush. And the upcoming first version of our game will only contain these contents.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/7d-game"}
