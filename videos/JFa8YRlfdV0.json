Not so much a longplay, Just a 5 stage run as i dont believe there any special ending after completing all 5 routes. Not on spectrum. I used to load this game up for its soundtrack more then anything else. The game is ok, but its abit slow and the traffic can be devilishly evil and swerve directly into you on a straight just to make sure you cant win. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JFa8YRlfdV0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JFa8YRlfdV0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JFa8YRlfdV0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "ZX Spectrum Longplay [012] Outrun", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nSpectrum 128k.
