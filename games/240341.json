Eat the arrows to jump. Be careful not to hit your tail, don't fall off the edge and watch your speed!\nEarn powers by watching videos. Use your powers in the game to control your speed, collect more dots and shorten your tail.\nSnaky Squares can only turn 90 degrees left or right. Tap the the side of Snaky's head to turn in that direction.\nIf Snaky is heading down and you want to head up you will need to turn twice. You can tap to the right of Snaky to turn once and head to the right, and then tap a second time above Snaky to turn and head up.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snaky-squares"}
