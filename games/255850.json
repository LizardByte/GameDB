Unknown enemy forces have attacked and turned your country into a WarZone! Using a red laser based heads-up display (HUD), your tank gives you see-through armor capabilities, while allowing you to pilot from a remote fortified location. Your objective is to stay alive and hunt down enemy AI powered sentry towers, tanks, and helicopters.\n\nYou navigate your tank using your onboard radar and compass. Two primary weapons are at your fingertips: a machine gun and a BFG. Use your machine gun wisely or it overheats. Your BFG packs a bigger punch but takes time to reload. Aim carefully and always be on the lookout for enemies that are constantly hunting you!\n\nGood luck commander.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/virtual-warzone"}
