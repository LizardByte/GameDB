The game is around 2 MB in size and works on all versions of Windows. You can just double-click on the asteroids.exe file to launch the game.\n\nThe game can be controlled using the arrow keys to maneuver the spaceship and space bar to fire at the asteroids. As you hit any asteroid, it splits into multiple smaller asteroids. You can shoot these smaller asteroids as well and they will further divide into even smaller ones. Another thing that you will notice that the smaller asteroids move faster and are harder to target.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/asteroids--6", "videos": [{"id": 63462, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Nr26ZHexD6s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr26ZHexD6s", "title": "Asteroids by PJ Crossley (PC remake)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nr26ZHexD6s/sddefault.jpg"}]}
