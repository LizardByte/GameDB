Nia is someone who can heal emotional scars. We all experience pain from breaking up, deaths, loneliness, failure, and more. The hurt consciousness locks themselves in their rooms and become trauma. 'Nia' is here to open these doors and heal the broken hearts.\n\n# A threat to the Soul World\n'Nia' has always lived in the peaceful part of the Soul World. She senses danger approaching her world when a storm tears through the Soul World. Play as 'Nia' and go on an adventure to save the crumbling Soul World.\n\n# Go on an adventure to save the Soul World\nEach stage in the Soul World will change based on the emotions. Typically you can freely change camera perspectives as you explore your emotions, but certain emotions will lock your perspective, or flip and tear apart the screen. Because of this, the camera perspective, character movement, types of puzzles, and your playstyle will change depending on the emotion.\n\n\u200b# A unique exploration experience of the Soul World\nWe strived to express human emotions through visual graphics. Each chapter is based on unique emotions and are displayed through the color scheme or camera perspectives. We worked hard so that the player can feel the game's uniqueness and charm at a glance.", "summary": "Go on a trip to heal the mysterious and beautiful world of the soul.
