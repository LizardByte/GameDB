{"id": "53raVps2oFw", "snippet": {"title": "Bomberman Pinball (Mobile) Gameplay", "description": "18:20 Devil Board\n\nBecause every video game series has one, its pinball!\n\nReally not much to say here. The music for this one is not bad and it takes a while to focus on the ball. There's just something unnatural about the way it moves that it takes some adapting. You may have noticed in the description at the start of the video it mentions a Devil and a Bingo board. I played forever and I couldn't get the damn Bingo. You have to line up all three icons on the roulette and it was quite annoying. To reach the Devil Board, simply hit Black Bomber twice then fly in the hole.\n\nA simple game but nothing unique here really. Of course as much as pinball has been spammed over the years, it doesn't surprise me.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/steamyjimmy", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/53raVps2oFw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/53raVps2oFw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/53raVps2oFw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/53raVps2oFw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Bomberman Pinball (Mobile) Gameplay", "description": "18:20 Devil Board\n\nBecause every video game series has one, its pinball!\n\nReally not much to say here.
