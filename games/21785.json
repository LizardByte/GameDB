Players control the eponymous bear as they use various things to earn \"nasty Points\", with extra points being given for random missions.\n\nThe game is set on a paradisal island where teddy bears live in harmony. The main character, Naughty Bear, is a shabby teddy bear who has a tendency to be mischievous, which earns him the dislike of the other bears. Like the other teddy bears, he does not speak but instead conveys his emotions through a variety of sounds and facial expressions. His actions are influenced by an unseen narrator with a demeanor reminiscent of that of a young children's television show host.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
