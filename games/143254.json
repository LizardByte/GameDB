The game hasn't real story and has quite a simple game play - the player controls a red space ship, flies straightforward, avoid obstacles and shoot enemies in various locations (mostly mountains with space background). The enemies are in many types, shapes and colours - spaceships, \"molecules\", geometric figures, etc. If a spaceship flies too slowly, then it has a tendency to fall down.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/excalibur--1"}
