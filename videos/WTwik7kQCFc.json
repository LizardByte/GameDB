The LaserActive plays proprietary LaserDisc formats that contain video, audio, and data that is interpreted and executed by swappable modules.  While digitizing and recording normal LaserDiscs is possible with the right equipment, and emulating normal games for most systems is possible today, emulating the LaserActive in a way that processes the data along with the AV is currently impossible and may never be achieved.
