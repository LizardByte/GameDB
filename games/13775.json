In an old theme park, now condemned and abandoned because of numerous disappearances which happened there, you meet Mephistopheles, the Devil himself. Mephistopheles is not your typical red devil; he is instead a charismatic, charming and mysterious man. From there, your quest begins. The Devil asks you to help him: he had a quarrel with God (or the Boss, as he calls him) about whether or not 7 souls who lived here during the 1930 Depression era should be condemned.\n\nYou have to investigate on their lives in the past and find evidences of their acts: the decision will be based on your findings. During your inquiry, you will discover the dark side and the worst of the human nature. These seven lives were touched by temptations, lust and greed, and you'll have to understand how they can lead to crimes.\n\nThe whole game is composed of 3D rendered environments in which you can rotate to 360\u00b0.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-seven-games-of-the-soul", "videos": [{"id": 24027, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "WgQ_-b677b0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgQ_-b677b0", "title": "Faust - The Seven Games of the Soul 1999 PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WgQ_-b677b0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
