You don't have enough money to rent an apartment or book a hotel room. There is no safer place that you can think of than the monastery. That is where you grew up so that is the first place that you thought about. So, you went there with your back pack. However, you didn't see what you want to see. There are no people in the monastery. Seems like they moved out or something. The monastery looks so old to what you can remember. You went inside the place to reminisce the good times and who knows, maybe there is a clue about where they move. But now that you can't get out, looks like you have to find hints that can help you to unlock the door. \n \nThe good news is, there are items in the room that you can use as an escape too. But even with that you still have to use your logic to escape. Old Monastery Escape is the newest room escape game by Ainars for Escape Fan.
