Unfortunately, every time a bounty is near, something goes wrong: the last case was particularly painful, involving Mail bravely cutting off the head of a famous criminal - only to realize that his body escaped without the head. Mail tried at least to sell the head in the nearest town, but discovered that the local tavern was full of these heads stored in a basket. But not all is lost: Mail reads a poster that promises a big reward for someone who catches an evil wizard who terrorizes the land. Sounds like just the job Mail was looking for!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popful-mail"}
