The story is inspired by Polish legend of Master Tvardovsky and other Slavic legendary heroes. Gamers will be able to meet the good outlaw Yanosik and many other well known characters.\n\nThe game is a Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure based on gameplay solutions classic for the genre such as solving puzzles, mini games, finding and collecting hidden objects. The goal of the game is to discover the Sorcerer\u2019s evil plan and defeat him in a direct combat. Moral choices are a novelty for the genre introduced in Eventide 2. All decisions the gamer makes throughout their play-through will impact the way the story evolves and the game\u2019s ending.
