The Pavers goal is to create a road so difficult that the other players fall too far behind and get eliminated, while the Racers aim is to be the first to catch up with the Paver. To create more exciting and difficult tracks, the Paver can pick up powerups in the surroundings, including narrow roads and obstacles.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/velocity-stream"}
