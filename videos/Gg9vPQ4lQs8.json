Teddy has been with Lydia from the very beginning. At least Lydia can\u2019t remember living without him. Or playing without him. Lydia has never adventured nor found crickets from the nearby playground without him. Lydia loves Teddy. And Teddy loves her back.\n\nRecently they\u2019ve had difficulties sleeping. Lots of loud and strange sounds coming from downstairs. The grown-ups are having their own adventures there. Every night, all the time.\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s the Monster. Hiding in the shadows, always there, where the eye can\u2019t see. Grown-ups said that the monster isn\u2019t real, that it\u2019s all just imagination. But the grown-ups are wrong. The monster is real, although Teddy keeps telling that it isn\u2019t. He keeps telling that everything\u2019s going to be all right.\n\nTeddy will always be there, watching Lydia. Keeping the monster at bay. Making sure, that Lydia sleeps through the night.\n\nBut this time the sounds are louder than usual.\n\nLydia is a story game in the vein of To the Moon. The game is all about the atmosphere. Spectacular gray-scale graphics with a hint of color and dark, ambient original soundtrack set the tone for the melancholic story. The game is short, about 1-2 hours long emotional journey to the depths of the imagination of a small child.\n\nCan you find the monster?\n\nMusic is from Lydias OST.\n\nFor more info, follow Platonic Partnership on social media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PlatonicPartnership/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PlatPartShip\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/platonic_partnership/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gg9vPQ4lQs8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gg9vPQ4lQs8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gg9vPQ4lQs8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gg9vPQ4lQs8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gg9vPQ4lQs8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Lydia - Trailer", "description": "Lydia is available on Steam, Nintendo Switch and PS4.\n\nOn Nintendo Switch and PS4, Lydia is published by Nakana.io.\n\nLydia on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/629000/Lydia/\n\nPS4: https://store.playstation.com/fi-fi/product/EP6161-CUSA30456_00-9837676363342608\n\nLydia is a sweet little girl and she loves her Teddy very much.
