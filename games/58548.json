Unlike the original, Terra Cresta II skipped the Arcade and was released on the PC Engine.\n\nThe game uses a distinct power-up system where the player is acquiring additional modules for their spaceship. These modules can be configured in two ways: one configuration has them connected directly to the ship, increasing its firepower, where the second has them separate from the central ship to increase their coverage. Before starting, the player can choose which direction the ship modules will fire in and the positions they take around the central ship when separated. Through this system, the player can fine-tune the amount of coverage their bullets will reach.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/terra-cresta-ii-mandler-no-gyakushuu", "videos": [{"id": 53258, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rVu2_SL--zc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVu2_SL--zc", "title": "PC Engine Longplay [138] Terra Cresta II - Mandler no Gyakushuu", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rVu2_SL--zc/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2143, "name": "Cresta"}]}
