Worms can be played by 1-16 players at the same time - it\u2019s a turn based game so you`ll only need one machine - but prepare to be at odds with your loved ones, get ready to shout abuse at your best friend and be willing to exact unadulterated terror on those who plot to hurt your worms.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/worms--3", "videos": [{"id": 80372, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "c7nm648EfD4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nm648EfD4", "title": "Worms\u2122 - PlayStation\u00ae3 Launch Trailer, downloadable from PlayStation\u00aeNetwork", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c7nm648EfD4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 80373, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pAbzeZPr2f0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAbzeZPr2f0", "title": "Worms\u2122 Trailer - for Xbox 360 via Xbox LIVE Arcade", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pAbzeZPr2f0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
