The game differentiated itself from Squaresoft's fighter by allowing up to four players fight at once. Interplay had licensed TSR's Forgotten Realms universe in order to include many Dungeons & Dragons mechanics including weapons, spells, magical items, and other powerups. The game never saw retail release, and while the reason was never given by Interplay, it can be assumed that it had something to do with Wizards of the Coast purchasing the Dungeons & Dragons property from TSR in 1997.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
