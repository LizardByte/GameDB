To emphasize how middle of nowhere this is, there isn\u2019t even a convenience store here. I don\u2019t have a cell phone and despite having some rather good laptop computers, I have no way to connect to the internet. All that\u2019s here is a large dormitory the likes you\u2019d see at a hot springs resort and a school that looks like it\u2019s on the verge of closing down. There\u2019s a farm that\u2019s closed and fields with ripening winter vegetables. In the distance you can see snow capped mountains and the beautiful, clear waters of the sea.\n\n\u2026and out in the distance stood a tower of unimaginable height who\u2019s purpose was anyone\u2019s guess which stretched into the depths of the sky.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a fantasy, or something out of sci-fi or even a mystery. With all that going on, the only intent was to spend some peaceful days with these four girls but that was totally not what was about to happen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make this place a harem for him!\u201d\n\nWait, when you say harem, uhm\u2026 well\u2026 Huh????\nI wondered what she meant by that as she took off her clothes and the events of that summer unfolded\u2026", "summary": "A Certain Situation.
