As well as the ability to break some of the environmental objects down to move faster, which, in turn, opens up a lot of strategic possibilities.\n\nYou can customize your squad by recruiting new companions with multiple specializations, skills and weapon preferences. Missions and battles will be just as diverse: Command your warriors to besiege enemy settlements or defend yours, protect your order's churches, escort civilian wagons, lay siege to enemy castles, aid your allies, and capture new technologies to upgrade your castle.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 72971, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "Bw17Qvfl7w0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw17Qvfl7w0", "title": "Stones Keeper King Aurelius - Launch Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bw17Qvfl7w0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
