Following a power plant accident, the vast energy shield that separates the Chromian colonists from the indigenous life-forms - the Scay'Ger - suffers a total shut down, allowing contact between the two races for the very first time. A human virus has not infected the Scay'Ger, mutating them into violent, blood-thirsty monsters. As commander of a squad of elite space marines, only you can stop the vicious attacks and evacuate the remaining colonists before all is lost. \n \nThe battles in this turn-based tactical game are not waged in open fields, but fought within the dark and complex industrial buildings of the colony city; Scay Hallwa. You'll enjoy the unique challenge of leading your men through various alien scenarios, never knowing what's around the next corner or behind the next door. \n \nIncubation also features a real-time 3D environment and with detail and features never seen before in a game of this genre. The action can be viewed from the eyes of the individual soldiers, from the attacking aliens' perspective, or from any external position thanks to the complete camera freedom offered by the stunning graphics engine. All the events in the game are fully animated, as are the actions and movements of all the characters; giving them an incredibly lifelike apperance and a host of realistic mannerisms. They walk, rest, run and fight - all in glorious 3D.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/incubation-time-is-running-out", "collections": [{"id": 1224, "name": "Battle Isle"}]}
