Both of you will build shops, cafes, bars, cinemas, museums and many other locations by dragging them onto the city map. Your goal: lure as many citizens as possible into your buildings through strategic building choices and placement, then start earning big cash from your customers to build even more and better buildings! But don't forget to secure your buildings... or you might find them burn down to ashes thanks to monsters, meteors and other types of dangers awaiting you in big city life.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-bucks"}
