During the game, players spread their influence across Westeros through a combination of strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and military might. As one of the Great Houses, will you conquer with force, forge alliances, rally your townsfolk, or cunningly coerce your way to the Iron Throne?\n\nBased on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game \u2013 Digital Edition allows up to six players to play online, or a single player with up to five AI opponents to play locally. The game is set after the death of King Robert Baratheon and allows each player to assume the role of one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms in an attempt to assault King\u2019s Landing and claim the Iron Throne.\n\nTo be declared ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, you have 10 rounds to use diplomacy and warfare to your advantage to control as many strategic areas of the map.\nConquer with care as your resources are scarce and your troops are not expendable. Muster your army, plan your orders wisely and seize strategical lands with your Footmen, Knights, Siege Engine and ships.\nDuring the turmoil of a battle, use well-known characters from your house to take the upper hand and vanquish your enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/a-game-of-thrones-the-board-game-digital-edition", "videos": [{"id": 41344, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iiFer-BSePw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiFer-BSePw", "title": "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game - Digital Edition \u2014 Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiFer-BSePw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
