The balance in the galaxy has been restored as transgalactic corporations have been deported to the outskirts of the galaxy and deprived of their power.\n\nThe Empire, just as before, continues to fight against the Aliens. As a rule armadas of battleships aren't used in such conflicts. Small maneuverable squadrons that can attack and retreat quickly are better suited for this type of war. This means that the famous Star Wolves team is back in action!\n\nStar Wolves is a 3D space RPG with deep strategy and tactical elements. The game thrusts players into a world of freelance space hunters during a time of war for the all-powerful Empire. Human space pirates, rogue AI computers that rebelled against humanity and Aliens roam space in search of easy prey and planets to conquer.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/star-wolves-2", "videos": [{"id": 5353, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "undfZBmy0EY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=undfZBmy0EY", "title": "Star Wolves 2 Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/undfZBmy0EY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
