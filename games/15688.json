The Centipede moves across the screen and when it reaches the other side it moves down one place and moves back across the screen. You control a spacecraft at the bottom of the screen shooting the Centipede whilst moving left or right, as well being able to move forwards and backwards a short distance. Shooting the Centipede a number of times splits it into two and the other parts split into two when shot a number of times.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bug-blaster", "videos": [{"id": 109972, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mCww6Gda94Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCww6Gda94Q", "title": "bug blaster C64 1983 alligator software COMMODORE 64 1983 ANTHONY  crowther  VIDEO GAME", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mCww6Gda94Q/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
