Using lost technology found within Sagoth's ruins, and supplies left across the planet, he's created a robotic army superior to anything the federation can muster. You're going alone, using a bipedal mech based on what little of Geisel's research has been intercepted. It's time to reclaim your lost bases, eliminate the scientist's legions, and uncover the secrets lying beneath this world.\n\nJuushin ROGUS combines turn-based strategy, side-scrolling shooter action, and a light RPG layer into one accessible story. Managing and moving between your military bases, which automatically produce new units you can distribute, is crucial to success. Defending or attacking a base leads to action-platforming combat, where you jump, shoot, and fly across a battlefield full of limited replenishing enemies. As you destroy foes, your mech levels up over time, acquiring new weapons, aerial boosters, and even pilot bodyguards later on. To win, you must claim the final base and defeat Geisel in his lair\u2014but it won't be easy.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/juushin-rogus", "videos": [{"id": 83247, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "JuVjFxiW5OI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuVjFxiW5OI", "title": "\u7363\u795e\u30ed\u30fc\u30ac\u30b9 for PC-9801 (1988)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JuVjFxiW5OI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
