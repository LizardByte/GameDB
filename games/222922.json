Shing encounters a travelling pair of siblings, Kohaku and her brother Hisui. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Shing accidentally shatters Kohaku's Spiria Core, the source of her emotions. Now, the trio must embark on a journey to make Kohaku's heart whole once more.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
