After 1,000 years, the dragon got to break this barrier and causes the chaos again.\n\nIt was then when the Daimyo commanded her best swordsmith, Katamune, to forge the legendary Katana Dragon using the barrier\u2019s fragments. This allows that the young samurai Cideyasu faced the dragon, bringing an end to it evil reign\u2026 or that is what they thought. That\u2019s how Katamune and Cideyasu went from history to legend.\n\nThanks to their effort and sacrifice, peace now reigns in Sogen, but the day that our young ninjas, Shin and Nobi, will finally be able to perform their first mission, unexpected things will happen. Turning a simple mission to deliver a gift into a real adventure. Suddenly, people around there, including their Sensei, will be transformed into ghosts by a curse. However, they don\u2019t seem to be affected by it, making them the only ones that can find out what it\u2019s happening.\n\nFor that reason, they will be embarked on a journey with their ghost Sensei. They will tour all Sogen\u2019s lands, meeting any village, town, island or mountain that conforms to it. But it will not be an easy way, because the curse that is plaguing their people is also affecting the Gokais, which are more savage and aggressive, losing their friendly nature. So there are a lot of enemies that they must defeat in their journey. But perhaps, if they can find the five elemental gods they will get a way to return their people to normality.", "summary": "Katana Dragon is an action-RPG adventure and dungeons exploration, where you play as the ninjas Shin and Nobi in their quest to end the curse that hangs over Sogen.\nLearn ninja skills, upgrade your Dragon Gems, equip the Cursed Seals and level up.
