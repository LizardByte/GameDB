This game is one of my favorite games on the Playstation 2. Here are a few you need to know.\n\nNote 1. As usual i always level up off screen between resting. When i go wake up i show you the skills/Spells/Trait that was earned from leveling up via skill points.\n\nNote 2. I got every Mini Medal (115) and every treasure but that required lots of backtracking i didn't get them in the exact order believe me i did alot of it.\n\nNote 3. I did not do the casino but i should have shown that off to see how the games are played. But  the prizes are the point of playing mini games.Since it's not part of the main story line i chose not to play them. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXft9do42KQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXft9do42KQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXft9do42KQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PS2 Longplay [090] Dragon Quest VIII Journey of the Cursed King (part 1 of 5)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Valis77\n\nHere we go!
