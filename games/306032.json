In each challenge, the player must complete a total of 15 rhyming words to either help Rhymo catch a falling star, save creatures from a dying planet, or reach his spaceship. Each challenge contains 2 different difficulty levels. At the easier level, the player must type the two words that rhyme. At the harder level, the player is given a word with the first letter missing, and the player must choose 2 of 5 letters that will complete this word. As the player successfully answers questions, they get closer to their goal of helping Rhymo.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rhymos-falling-star"}
