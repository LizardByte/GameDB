A land of mysticism and steel against steel. Advanced technology has changed the once traditionalist society, thrusting it into a great technological revolution. The balance of the world, and the two gods who oversee it, have been frozen in time. A consequence of their own quarreling. In their absence, the war they left behind has fallen into a destructive and fruitless stalemate. Now, in the world's darkest moments, the only hope for the future is the Samurai: individuals given great powers by ancient beings, whether they be benign or malicious. But will it be enough to pull the world from the brink of ruin? Or will everything Return to Zero?", "summary": "Perfect your skills in a team-focused arena fighter, mastering the various skills and strengths of powerful Samurai. Discover everything the world of Edo has to offer. From ancient mystical ruins to technologically marvelous capitals, become enraptured in the vast history of conflict that has shaped the world. More than swordsmanship and ancient powers, the Samurai have conflicts both deeply personal and with the state of the world. Become invested in an eclectic cast and bear witness to the journeys they take to change both themselves and the world of Edo.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 41341, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "z_aP6iQIhvw"}, {"id": 41342, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "06PYlgD0Yy4"}, {"id": 42152, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SBFAgzznDOE"}, {"id": 69298, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Y9IA-OP-bi0"}]}
