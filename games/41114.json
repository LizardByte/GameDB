There are 5 skills sections on tough mountain terrain, and 4 relatively smooth time trials. Hazards such as sand dunes, logs, rocks and gullies are out to stop you. You'll have to wheelie to clear the rocks and before hitting jumps, angling the bike so as to aim for the same slope as the land, and make sure to land on the back wheel to avoid falling. Any infraction loses you one of your bikes - you start with 3 but get a new one after successfully completing a stage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moto-x-simulator"}
