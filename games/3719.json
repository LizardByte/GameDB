The game was advertised as featuring eight games: seven short subsections with the same basic gameplay, and two minigames. Kirby Super Star sees players take on the role of Kirby, who can float around the screen, inhale blocks and enemies and spit them out. By swallowing certain enemies after inhaling them, Kirby can copy their abilities and use them as his own, becoming able to perform a wide range of attacks. A unique feature of the game is the addition of helpers. When Kirby is in possession of an ability, he can choose to transform it into a helper character which can be controlled by a second player or the computer AI.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kirby-super-star", "videos": [{"id": 87934, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "6sZHIDzPo6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sZHIDzPo6g", "title": "SNES Longplay [640] Kirby Super Star (US)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6sZHIDzPo6g/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 87935, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6XnGBggXXVs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XnGBggXXVs", "title": "Kirby Super Star \"T.M.K. - Too Much Kirby\"(Super Nintendo\\SNES\\Commercial) Full HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6XnGBggXXVs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
