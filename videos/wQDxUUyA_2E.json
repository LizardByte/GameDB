{"id": "wQDxUUyA_2E", "snippet": {"title": "Demolition Racer - No Exit | Dreamcast | Longplay Walkthrough No Commentary", "description": "(Partial?) Longplay of Demolition Racer - No Exit, released for the Dreamcast in 2000, as an enhanced port for the system. This being the PAL version with anomorphic widescreen hack added in.\n \nA game of my childhood, an action racing game, focusing on scoring points for destruction of enemy cars, with a few modes to play, including splitscreen multiplayer. It's got much enhanced graphics compared to Demilition Racer on Ps1 and PC. Overall, the idea probably comes from Destruction Derby games, released in the sam generation of consoles, also focused on arenas and destruction.\nHere I've managed to finish two leagues, with much difficulties as visible. There are a few more modes to see, but I didn't see the point to hammer myself endlessly with grinding the scores just to get 2nd place or 3rd. I feel like it does the game justice, quick 2 hours longplay of basic maps and rules.\n\nGraphics are, of course, up to Dreamcast's standards, so for the time absolutely awesome, especially in the VGA 480p mode. Awesome music, fitting fast cars and mayhem. Widescreen is a big plus, much wider Field of View. Nice little game, perfect for quick fun, although it gets repetitive and grind-y in the long run.
