In the far future, a demonic invasion throughout all of time has been triggered as a result of humanity's actions. With the timeline shattered and paradoxes cropping up, the game follows multiple characters in different time periods as they deal with the resulting challenges and conflicts. As fate's weaves fall apart and the timeline fractures, the incarnations of reality decide to intervene. To preserve fate and destiny, Death himself must become mortal and enter the human realm to fix things.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/weaves-of-fate"}
