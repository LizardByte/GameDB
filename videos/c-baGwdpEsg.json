I play through both games one after another. The first is standards bowling using elves as pins, the second is shuffleboard using elves as pucks.\n\nI think the major problem with this title is that it was a port of a browser-based Flash game with very little substance added to justify a retail release. It's certainly not bad for a Flash game, but a physical release (no matter how cheap) really needs more than 5-10 minutes of content. Some of the voice clips are pretty funny, though, and a couple were pretty unexpectedly raunchy which helped things :)\n\nMy recommendation: try it out, enjoy it for a few minutes, and then don't bother with it again. Preferably for free through the web app.\n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-baGwdpEsg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-baGwdpEsg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-baGwdpEsg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-baGwdpEsg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-baGwdpEsg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Elf Bowling 1 & 2 (GBA) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Ignition Entertainment's 2005 Game Boy Advance Christmas-themed, elf-studded bowling and shuffleboard extravaganza, Elf Bowling 1 & 2.\n\nOkay, maybe extravaganza is a bit much.
