The title is a Kinect motion-sensing based title for the Xbox 360 and was released via the Xbox Live Arcade service in North America on February 1, 2012. Happy Action Theater is based on an idea that Double Fine's founder, Tim Schafer, had on devising a game that Lily, his two-year-old daughter (at the time), could play with. To this, the open-ended game is a collection of eighteen different modes that allow multiple players to interact in unique ways through the Kinect cameras and motion-sensing in an augmented reality shown on the console's display, such as playing in a giant virtual ball pit or walking through simulated lava.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 34901, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "UfCutx5qeyk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfCutx5qeyk", "title": "Double Fine Happy Action Theater Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UfCutx5qeyk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
