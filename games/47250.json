Each character's English name is noted in parenthesis where applicable.", "summary": "Puyo Puyo (1992) is an enhanced version of the 1991 MSX2 and Famicom Disk System game of the same name. The game was developed for the Sega System C-2 arcade hardware and ported to a variety of consoles.\n\nPuyo Puyo is a puzzle game in which the player matches four or more \"Puyo\" of the same color together. This game is the precursor to an identically-titled arcade release.\n\nPuyo Puyo contains three modes: Endless, Mission, and Verses. In Endless Mode, players match Puyo until the top of their well is filled. If the player chooses, either a giant 2x2 green Puyo or Carbucle will periodically help the player clear space on their board. Mission mode gives the player several challenges to complete, such as clearing a set amount of Puyo or clearing all Puyo of a certain color. Verses mode allows players to battle each other.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo", "videos": [{"id": 89661, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "G48JMe7Y5Rw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G48JMe7Y5Rw", "title": "Puyo Puyo (1992, Arcade) - 2 of 2: EN Version (Hardest)[1080p60]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G48JMe7Y5Rw/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3350, "name": "Puyo Puyo"}]}
