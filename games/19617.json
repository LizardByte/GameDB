One second your Exemplars are knocking a drake out of the sky and the next you\u2019re commanding your team to block right before a magic spell hits to reflect it back at your foes. In between battles, you make split-second decisions that change how the game unfolds. Will you blackmail a prince for a speed buff? Or stand up to a warmongering governor instead of resurrecting a fallen party member? Each choice you make bestows a different power-up and permanently changes the world.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fallen-legion-sins-of-an-empire", "videos": [{"id": 8582, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "qew5EZ3fbzU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qew5EZ3fbzU", "title": "Fallen Legion - First Glimpse | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qew5EZ3fbzU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 15096, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "rWjTVLIXWvQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWjTVLIXWvQ", "title": "Fallen Legion: Sins of an Empire (PS4) launch trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rWjTVLIXWvQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
