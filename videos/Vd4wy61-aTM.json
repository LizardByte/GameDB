These will be opened with a Flashpoint program such as Flashpoint Core to test whether the game/animation works. \n\nIf they work, several files such as gameplay screenshots, text file containing the launch commands etc. are required to be placed into a ZIP file and uploaded to the relevant section of the Discord page, where they will be vetted by the experienced team there, and if successful, will be added to the newer Flashpoint version.\n\nIf you wish to help curate games, pls watch this video first in the link below, which will teach you how to curate the games you\u2019ve found before submitting them for approval. Again, if you are still unsure, the folks at Discord will be able to help you!\n\nCuration Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA9fbL4YplM&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nQ4) According to the Game Master List, this game should be in Flashpoint but I can\u2019t find it!\n\nA4) If you\u2019ve downloaded Flashpoint Infinity, take note that it doesn\u2019t contain all the games in the Game Master List. For example, if the game you\u2019re looking for is a Shockwave game: at the main screen of the program, you will see a section called \u201cUpgrades\u201d. Click the download button for \u201cOther technologies\u201d. For Flashpoint Infinity 6.1, it is about 900 MB. Once that is done, restart the program and the Shockwave games will appear.\n\n\nQ5) I want to play this game, but it\u2019s neither in Flashpoint nor the Game Master List!\n\nA5) This means that game has not been added to Flashpoint yet. If there are games you want to be in Flashpoint, you can either wait for it to appear in later versions, or put up a request using the link in Q2. Note that to edit the Google Doc file, you need to request permission first. \n\nEven if you have been granted editing privileges, pls check whether the game you want has already been requested before. Do not search by the specific name only. For example, if you are looking for the game \u201cScooby-Doo: Horror of the High Seas Episode 1 \u2013 The Ghost Pirate Attacks!\u201d, try searching \u201cScooby Doo\u201d, \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d, \u201cGhost Pirate\u201d etc. \n\nThis is because some game websites name them differently (e.g. Tom and Jerry: Food Fight is aka Tom and Jerry: Food Free-For-All). Curators who tested the games may also name them differently (e.g. the Scooby-Doo game mentioned above was named as \u201cScooby Doo Ghost Ship Episode One\u201d).\n\n\nQ6) Hey, this game isn\u2019t from the Cartoon Network websites!\n\nA6) Though some games came from other websites (e.g. some Scooby-Doo games originated from Warner Bros website), the cartoon characters in these games have appeared in Cartoon Network before, and are therefore included.\n\nIf you have more questions, check out Flashpoint\u2019s FAQ page: http://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/faq/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vd4wy61-aTM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vd4wy61-aTM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vd4wy61-aTM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vd4wy61-aTM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Ye Olde CN Games - Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi: Puffy Treasure Island", "description": "Some diamonds are hidden in rocks and are released using the electric guitar (0:55).
