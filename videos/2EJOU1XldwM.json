With beautiful graphics, a rich soundscape and non-traditional gameplay elements, Book of Travels is a new way to experience an online RPG.\u201d \u2013 MMORPG\n\nAbout Book of Travels\n\nReady your pack, grab your walking stick and step into a world of mystery and legend. Craft a unique character and immerse yourself in the enchanted lands of Braided Shore. Set your own goals and adventure alone or together with Travellers you meet on the road. Book of Travels is a serene adventure that sets you adrift in a fairytale world without the restraints of linear missions and plotlines.\n\nBook of Travels is all about the journey, not the destination. Explore the wilds and visit the cities of the Braided Shore peninsula. Wander deep into the layers of this hand-drawn world, stumble upon its hidden places or unravel its many mysteries. There is no overarching goal and no real beginning or end, but for mortal characters the stakes can be high.\n\nBraided Shore is a vast and intricate world, but meetings with other players are few and far between, so your chance encounters will be something special. Choose to collaborate with other players or to survive alone.\n\nBut take note: This is a game for wayfinders and wanderers and your route is not predestined. Instead, it will be up to you to play in your own style and to shape your own journey. Whichever way you choose to travel, you\u2019ll soon be adding your own chapters to Book of Travels.\nRoleplaying and individual playstyles\n\nPick one of 20+ Forms in a detailed character creation sheet that focuses on personality and identity rather than stats and classes. The game allows you to play in a style that matches your character and set your own personal goals. Are you a danger-seeking adventurer, a stoic practitioner of magic binding, or a carefree tea drinking gambler?\n\nYour travels will present you with randomly occurring events making your story unique and each session different from the last. Peel back the layers of diverse plotlines and discover a deep fairytale world.\n\nAn intricate and unique world that draws inspiration from old-world fairytales, Eastern mythologies and early industrial eras. Intricate event chains unlock items, characters, deep world secrets, and hidden gameplay features and tricks.\n\nLearn to use a unique set of symbols to communicate with other players. Unlock new symbols as you encounter new features and places (e.g. you\u2019ll gain the symbol for \u201ccity\u201d only after you\u2019ve visited a city). The limitation in communication lays the foundation for a friendly multiplayer experience.\nInnovative RPG systems\n\nDefine your character by unlocking and mastering 300+ abilities, magical skills and passive feats that will have a huge impact on your character and open different experiences of the game. Gain experience in numerous ways: by exploring, being courteous, gathering and trading. Battles can be rewarding, but you will learn more in defeat than in victory.\n\nExperience a unique game view perspective \u2018painted\u2019 in a richly detailed art style. Click to walk like old school RPGs, but in scenes with 3-dimensional depth.\n\nExplore the indie games from Might & Delight here:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/developer/mightanddelight/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2EJOU1XldwM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2EJOU1XldwM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2EJOU1XldwM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2EJOU1XldwM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2EJOU1XldwM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Book of Travels\u2019 new release date for Early Access revealed: 11 October 2021", "description": "Explore Book of Travels in Early Access: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1152340/Book_of_Travels/\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for an immersive, relaxing MMO to play, Book of Travels might be right for you.
