Earth has become a better place since we, as a furniture company, have overthrown the governments. We are proud to be the biggest furniture company in the universe. And we would like to thank all citizens of earth for your help accomplishing this!\n\nBirdo, an alien birdlike species hired to deliver our furniture throughout the universe, had to make a crash landing on Uranus. As Birdo crashed, an emergency signal was received by us. We can assure everyone that we will not stop trying to bring Birdo home! We have sent out ships filled with furniture to help Birdo reach the evacuation ships 10km high in the sky.\n\nDue to the crash landing Birdo cannot move on his own. But because we implanted a chip inside his brain, he can be controlled by a certain group of citizens! If you have what it takes, then join us and take control of Birdo. Help him move towards the evacuation spaceship and come home safe.", "summary": "Play as Birdo in this infinite platformer. Jump on the falling furniture to reach new heights, but don't get squashed or eaten by the monster!\n\nMobler is created by a student game development team consisting of 9 people.\nWe would love for you to help us by downloading, playing and leaving a review!\nThis will help us greatly.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mobler", "videos": [{"id": 27804, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8Bslm-X5zR4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bslm-X5zR4", "title": "Official M\u00f6bler Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Bslm-X5zR4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
