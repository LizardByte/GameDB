He is not a protagonist in our story, but just look at him - he\u2019s scrappy and funny, talks to himself, likes music and long walks behind the bar. In a word - he is quite mad, but as mad as he is, he\u2019s the one you come to for help. Help? What happened? You didn\u2019t hear? Apparently there is this thing called Halloween. I know, I know, it sounds stupid. But there\u2019s candy involved! Now I have your attention. The city of Dern is ostracized from the Halloween community. Everyone around you seem to know something about it, but you\u2019re a boy, nobody is going to tell you. In this step away from the classic HO gaming take things into your own hands and find out whatever happened to Halloween.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/evil-pumpkin-the-lost-halloween", "videos": [{"id": 7080, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "dHVXz6s8djI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHVXz6s8djI", "title": "Evil Pumpkin - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dHVXz6s8djI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
