He loved Carrot Marx's philosophy, helped the poor, was well-liked and respected, but the sun's rays turned him into a monster.\n\nHe has manipulated red vegetables with his hatred of others, blaming the disaster on vegetables with different colored skin. He commissioned scientists to create a cruel variety of GMO PEPPER and began to conquer the world.\nIn a short time, he has taken over the world in a brutal and cruel way, calling himself emperor and ordering the enslaved vegetables to work for the red empire.\n\nThe oppressed vegetables have formed an \"underground\" organization in which the boldest, strongest and craziest vegetables are selected.
