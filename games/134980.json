You need an alarm to help you to stop playing!\n\nYou must throw disks of the tower to the blue or red wall based on colors of the disks and do not let the tower reach the top! but it might not be simple after all. Basically, you should just touch the left or right side of the screen to direct disks to the same color side. However, there are not just blue and red disks! There are a lot of special disks such as Golden Disk which gives you double score, Black Disk which makes the tower completely black and you can throw the disk anywhere, and Frozen Disk which slows down the speed of the crazy tower!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/orbis-throw-them-all"}
