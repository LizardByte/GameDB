Hide in the shadows and wait for the right moment to strike, get a vantage point and pick your targets off with ranged weapons, or bring the fight straight to your opponent in an up close and personal confrontation, the choice, is yours!\n\nFrom release three mercenary factions are available: Reiklanders, Middenheimers and Marienburgers each with different traits and play styles. Each represents one of the factions pitted against each other in a brutal civil war over who should sit in the throne as Emperor. Can you harvest more Wyrdstone from Mordheim than your rivals to fuel your master\u2019s war effort?", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 13959, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9_IbR1uu57c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_IbR1uu57c", "title": "Mordheim: Warband Skirmish | Launch trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9_IbR1uu57c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
