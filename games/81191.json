But it was not always thus.\n\nThere was a time when the ancient kingdom of Nehekhara stood as a crown of human civilisation; a golden age when its cities shone with majestic splendour, its armies conquered entire nations and its kings ruled as gods among men. But this realm was razed millennia ago by the treacherous sorcery of reviled Nagash: in a stroke, the living perished and the dead rose from their tombs.\n\nDeath is no barrier to glory for the Tomb Kings however. In unlife, they will see the empire of Nehekhara restored to greatness!", "summary": "Rise of the Tomb Kings is a Campaign Pack DLC for Total War: WARHAMMER II that introduces a brand-new race to the fold from the Warhammer Fantasy Battles world: The Tomb Kings.\n\nRise of the Tomb Kings does not contain a supplementary story campaign, but instead 2 additional Legendary Lords for a total of four, with their own skills, traits, quest-chains, legendary wargear and situational challenges.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/total-war-warhammer-ii-rise-of-the-tomb-kings", "videos": [{"id": 17578, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IpWqKme-g_4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpWqKme-g_4", "title": "Total War: WARHAMMER 2 - Tomb Kings Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IpWqKme-g_4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
