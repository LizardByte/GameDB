The Bob-Ball decided to clear up brick blocks (which have been floating at the sky for too long), with the help of the magical bar. However, someone has set a timer on the Bob-Ball without any reason, so the Bob-Ball can't be breaking the brick blocks forever.", "summary": "A Bob-Ball (which is type of Bob-Omb) found a paddle that can move on its own, and decided to have fun with the paddle. However, he didn't realize that somehow a timer is set on the Bob-Ball.\n\nIt's a Breakout-clone, but with a timer. Once you run out of time, the Bob-Ball explodes and the game ends. There is six powerups and high scores. High scores are the only thing that is for replay value however, so you probably won't play this a whole lot if high scores aren't your thing.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bob-ball"}
