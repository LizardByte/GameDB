This version of solitaire is what generally is called Windows Solitaire, or what some people think Solitaire just is as a general term (when the truth is that Solitaire is a huge genre of games just as wide as FPS is).\n\nBig Klondike features 1 Draw, 3 Draw, Random shuffles and Winnable shuffles. You can choose to have the Timer enabled or not if you prefer a relaxing experience.\n\nOur Winnable shuffles are originally Random shuffles which our custom coded solitaire bot has play tested to ensure is actually possible. We ship the game with 50,000 known Winnable shuffles for both 1 Draw and 3 Draw variations. The 1.0.0 version of our solitaire bot was made to not be too incredibly clever, so all Winnable shuffles are guaranteed to be possible below 200 moves. Though a Winnable game is guaranteed to be possible, that does not mean you will always win it first time as sometimes moves can be made in ways where the game becomes bricked - impossible to finish in that state. If that happens you can Retry that same game and go for different moves to beat it!\n\nIn Big Klondike, cards can be dragged or clicked to move them to possible moves. Right click is also supported.\n\nOnce a game is deemed as mostly complete, Big Klondike will show a button to Auto Complete the game and move the rest of the cards into place in the foundations.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/big-klondike-classic-solitaire", "videos": [{"id": 87781, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jAnCGeMWlcM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAnCGeMWlcM", "title": "Big Klondike - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jAnCGeMWlcM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
