As a result of that every character has now access to an individualized job list of 21 out of total 31 jobs (freelancer is NOT available) while each job level now has a permanent impact on a character\u2019s stats. For example klutz Bartz can not be a chemist and Lenna hasn\u2019t it in her to go Berserker.\n\nMore dynamic battles are achieved via !Brave, !Def and field elements. Move a future turn to now with !Brave or take two turns at a later point with !Def while modifying the field elements to your liking with each skill or ability used. Changed field elements affect damage, healing and status effect chance.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-5-void-divergence"}
