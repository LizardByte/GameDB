Inventors worldwide pay heavily for that technology, which is where a smuggler and industrial espionage agent such as yourself can really clean up.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bureau of Orthography has taken a serious interest in your activities lately. Your face has been recorded and your cover is blown.\n\nYour remaining assets: about eight more hours of a national holiday that's spreading the police thin; the most inconvenient damn disguise you've ever worn in your life; and one full-alphabet letter remover.\n\nGood luck getting off the island.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/counterfeit-monkey"}
