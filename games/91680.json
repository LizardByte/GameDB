In this game, multiple players, using a combination of the television screen and Game Boy Advances, search for members of Tetra's pirate gang to gain stamps from them, as many as possible within a given time limit. All action takes place on the Game Boy Advance used by each player, with the television screen showing a basic map, and Tetra narrating the action.\n\nThe game was first intended to be a remake of BS Marvelous: Time Athletic, but changing the franchise to Zelda. Assets based on BS Marvelous were found in the final game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-navi-trackers"}
