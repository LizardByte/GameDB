After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate. Secret Agent was the last Data Age game to be completed, but the crash forced them out of business before it could be released.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/secret-agent--2"}
