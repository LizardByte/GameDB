Take control of a cute animal in a tank and blast through your enemies with your bullets and bombs!\n\nGrab some nearby friends or play solo in this top-down, twin-stick shooter game! Choose a cute animal character to pilot your tank as you make your way through each level. Your tank will have unlimited bullets to use at your disposal for each mission, but you'll also find useful mine and missile pick-ups along the way. Levels are divided into several missions, and if you lose all your lives before the level is complete, you must start it back at the beginning! Discover new locations with each level, and perhaps some scary beasts to slay as well!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tank-quest", "videos": [{"id": 46453, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "bC_sMgMkZxs"}]}
