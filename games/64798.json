A festival competition for creating a short movie is going to be held on February, next year, which will give plenty of time for the same protagonist, Haruto Kawai, to both make the movie and meet new girls. In this fan disk sequel, the story focuses only on three different girls: Asuka Hina, Mahiro Sendou, and Akina Ichijou. This game also lets the player experience the story from the perspective of two other characters besides Haruto. The gameplay itself does not stray from the usual recipe of altering the story by selecting different choices that present themselves on the screen at key moment in the storyline.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}]}
