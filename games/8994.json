To be sure, the Court's ministers are interested only in surpassing Portugal's maritime strength and controlling commerce to and from the Orient. They do not know of your real motives. But no matter. The expedition is yours to command, and you feel certain that adventure beyond all imagining, and riches beyond all dreams of avarice, are in your grasp.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
