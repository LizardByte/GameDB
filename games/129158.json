It commonly has been mistaken for Extreme Ghostbusters Video Game for GBC(Gameboy Color). The half-human/half-demon Count Mercharior has kidnapped Roland and Garett, two key members of the Ghostbusters team. The remaining team members, Eduardo and Kylie, immediately set off to find them, determined to capture the ghosts who have come to invade the city. The game was a combination platform and shooter game with some races, using a top-down perspective. There were 12 platform levels and four regions. It is especially interesting that the ghosts in the game can be either blasted by the proton gun or trapped.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/extreme-ghostbusters-code-ecto-1", "videos": [{"id": 33435, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Oyyrn7nWvvQ"}]}
