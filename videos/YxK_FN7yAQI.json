Based on the movie your set in a world where werewolves (or lycanthrope) and vampires are at war amongst themselves to take control of the night.....awesome.\nFor a game published by Blast! i wasnt really expecting much, but it turned out to be a half decent game. The camera angle was too far away in co-op mode, it was hard to see any detail at all. The controls as wiggy g just pointed out were quite bad, no backward movement meant running away from enemies just to turn to shoot them, and also the aiming was practically non existent. \nTo be honest i thiink multiplayer mode takes away some of the games playability. I have not yet played single player, so i think a long play video is going to need to be done before i can fully make my mind up about this one. It was engaging, and levels were full of action, but wether it just becomes a monotonous continual cycle accross every level is yet to be known.\n\nPlease check out my other retro videos, and if you want to see more of this game sooner please leave a like, and a comment to let me know.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YxK_FN7yAQI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YxK_FN7yAQI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YxK_FN7yAQI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YxK_FN7yAQI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Underworld: The Eternal War PS2 Multiplayer Co-op Gameplay ( Blast! ) Playstation 2", "description": "Heres a co-op video where me and Wiggy G test out the Blast! game called UnderworldThe Eternal War.
