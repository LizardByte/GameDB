Expedition is the tabletop sensation that spawned three successful Kickstarter campaigns, global distribution through Target and other channels, and a fanbase of thousands around the globe. While their market is divided into the segments of board games, dice games, role-playing games, and card games, Expedition spans all these categories, drawing fans from each. Mega Cat Studios & the Expedition team took that one step further with the world\u2019s first NES cartridge-guided Dungeon Master. \n \nOur collaboration created an exclusive, highly collectible video game cartridge that expanded the play experience and enabled new forms of brand activations and deeper engagement for Expedition fans.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/expedition--1", "videos": [{"id": 42970, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "W-8K-cnTuN0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-8K-cnTuN0", "title": "Expedition NES Trailer - Mega Cat Studios Video Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W-8K-cnTuN0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
