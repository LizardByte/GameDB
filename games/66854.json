There are three different kinds of mini-games found in this game; Mazes, Puzzles, and Sequential Memory/Matching Games. There are 5 different mazes to choose from, all with their own gimmicks. The main goal in the maze mini-games is to get to the flag, but each mini-game involves a different way to do so. One is simple movement, one is following arrows, one is a specifically colored path, one involves picking up all the fish food before reaching the flag, and one has X or O spaces on the maze. There are two different puzzles to choose from; a slide puzzle and a jigsaw puzzle. There are bad penguins that should be avoided in both puzzles. There are 4 different matching/memory games to choose from. One is simply matching fish, one is remembering the correct pathways by color, one has you turn the pages of the book to find an object, and one has you match the colored shapes in order. There are 2-3 difficulty levels depending on the mini-game, and it primarily focuses on teaching problem-solving and logic skills.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pepes-puzzles"}
