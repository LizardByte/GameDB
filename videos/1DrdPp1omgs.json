It shows a possible continuation of the series; showing possible events after Banjo Tooie. It features a new area of the original Grunty's Lair, called the Hidden Lair. The goal is to have 9 worlds in the end. The hack aims to be close to vanilla in terms of feeling and charm. This is a BK hack, not for Banjo Tooie, so keep in mind that moves from that game are not present here.\n\nDifficulty lies a bit above the vanilla game; obviously because we assume most people who play it will have played BK as well. However, it should still be relatively easy to beat. 100% can be quite tricky; many of the tokens and honeycombs are hidden quite well! Have fun!\n\nCheck this thread if you want to play the demo yourself: https://sixtyforums.com/showthread.php?tid=91\n\nDirect download of demo patch: http://www.mediafire.com/file/uvlq11rt07p32bd/BKTheHiddenLairDEMO1a.xdelta/file", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1DrdPp1omgs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1DrdPp1omgs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1DrdPp1omgs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1DrdPp1omgs/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1DrdPp1omgs/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Banjo Kazooie The Hidden Lair - BK Romhack - World 1: Harvest Hills", "description": "For those who don't want to or cannot play the demo themselves; here is a 100% playthrough of the first world of the Hidden Lair in its current state (things might change for the final release).\n\nBanjo Kazooie The Hidden Lair is a passion project by me and Oldum77.
