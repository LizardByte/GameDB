The user can follow either the boys\u2019 story or the girls\u2019 story. Both stories intersect for the conclusion. In the boys\u2019 story, the user is accused of stealing another boy\u2019s bike. At issue is the truth and honor. The girls\u2019 story revolves around a sleepover party where all but one is invited and the consequences of being nice or competitive are explored.\n\nThe purpose of the game is to show what\u2019s really going on in a couple of common schoolyard conflicts and to challenge the user to think about the consequences of\nimpulsive action. The game presents a non-linear approach to problem solving that reveals to the user the cause and effect of different strategies of conflict resolution.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sir-basil-pike-public-school"}
