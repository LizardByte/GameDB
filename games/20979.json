A fossil park is hosting a large-scale tournament in which competitors enter vivosaurs created from dinosaur fossils into competition. Fossil Fighters from all over the world battle their vivosaurs against one another to find out who will be crowned champion.\n\nPlayers excavate and clean fossils. New giant fossil rocks (containing complete dinosaur fossils) and odd fossil rocks (which are two-sided) add to the fun of the cleaning process.\nOnce the fossils have been cleaned, they can be revived into Vivosaurs, which players can then arrange into teams for battles. The better the fossils have been cleaned, the more powerful the Vivosaurs are in battle.\nStrategy is key in battles. Players must put forth teams of three vivosaurs, then rotate their positions to maximize their power advantage over opponents.\nNew \u201csuper evolver\u201d vivosaurs evolve into new forms with the help of gold fossils.\nPlayers can compete in matchmaking battles or upload their best team to see how it fares against others. Players can also download additional vivosaurs and events.\nUsing DS Download Play, one player who has the game can link up wirelessly with up to three other Nintendo DS owners within range and cooperate to expertly clean fossils together.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fossil-fighters-champions"}
