To calm him down, his mom reads him a bedtime story about a magical island where lost and abandoned items go. Still angry, he declares himself to be abandoned, too.

Your main goal is to complete a series of dungeons with the help of your toy friends. \nAlthought, it is a quite simple game it does a decent jon in using the DS stylus. t's easy to direct the young hero around the screen, and for the most part the controls do not add unnecessary challenge to the existing puzzle and platformer elements. The presentation is not great for sure, the polygonal graphics could be quite better. The audio design/game's soundtrack is easy on the ears but nothing exceptional. No tracks really stand out.\nAll and all, it's a funny (and short) experience, especially for those who like fast pace action games.\n\nIn order to understand and enjoy the game, you must have a basic understanding of the Japanese language. \nIt's not import friendly.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ElaMmMa3IQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ElaMmMa3IQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0ElaMmMa3IQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Nintendo DS : Hottarake no Shima: Kanataa to Nijiiro no Kagami (JPN)", "description": "Hottarake no Shima: Kanataa to Nijiiro no Kagami (\u30db\u30c3\u30bf\u30e9\u30b1\u306e\u5cf6 \u301c\u30ab\u30ca\u30bf\u3068\u8679\u8272\u306e\u93e1\u301c) ~translated as Oblivion Island: Kanata and the Rainbow Mirror  ~ is an RPG that developed by Climax Entertainment and published by Bandai Namco back in 2009, exclusively for the Nintendo DS handheld system and the Japanese market.\n\nThe game is loosely based on the anime \"Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror\" as they share the same world but different story and characters.\nKanata's (main hero) mother will have to work during his school's annual sports festival.
