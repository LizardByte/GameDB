In fact, this version, now dubbed 'Long Road Ahead', is pretty much exactly the one we graduated with.\n\nWe are uploading it here in order to clear our heads, re-process our development and design processes that led us to this version, and to gather feedback. We hope that all of this will help us with development of the new version of Northbound, so please let us know if you liked it.\n\nIf you are interested, please follow us on Twitter for updates on the current state of development.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/northbound-long-road-ahead"}
