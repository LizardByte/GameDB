The game was noted for its ragdoll-like movement when Zoids were hit back or killed. In this game, the Battle Mode is limited to only one set, meaning that no matter what character the player chooses, the battles are all the same. That said, the Battle Mode features characters and Zoids from Chaotic Century, New Century, and the Zoids VS story lines.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zoids-vs"}
