Your heroes are the castle defense, last and best hope against a rush of enemies.

Just like random dice rolls decide the fate of battling armies, here you must depend on Lady Luck to win and prevail! Assemble a deck of powerful tower defense heroes!\n\nIt's TD... but with a competitive twist! Rush against your best friends (or worst foes) - the first one to complete the castle defense wins! In a way, it is a real time PvP defense - what few TD games have!\n\nProtect your kingdom! Clash with mighty enemies and fearsome bosses, unleash magic and steel upon your foes in battle!\n\nUse your turret defense resources wisely - like in good base defense games, the smartest general wins!\n\nCollect, defend and dominate! Rush Royale - Tower Defense is here!", "summary": "Rush Royale is a tower defense game where the towers are replaced by mighty warriors and wizards!
