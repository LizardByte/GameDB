They would then be transformed into a dragon after leaping into the sky.\n\nAccording to legend, the carp compete at a yearly competition to leap over the falls, and those who succeeded were immediately transformed into dragons, and fly off into the sky. The transformation would take place at the Dragon Gate where the Yellow River flows through a split in the mountains.\n\nThe silver carp is native to China, and is renowned for being a great jumper. The player can collect Qui by interacting with lotus flowers to extend their jump and tackle the upstream battles to reach the Dragon Gate.\n\nWatch out for mudslides, vines, and obstacles such as rocks and fallen branches when navigating the river, using small ponds to move past these environmental barriers. Enemies such as Longnose Gars and Cranes might make this journey challenging for you, but luckily you have an ally, a friendly toad who will help you along the path to destiny.", "summary": "Dragon Gate is a top down platformer following a koi carp scaling the Yellow River.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-gate"}
