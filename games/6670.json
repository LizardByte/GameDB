The levels, rather than being linear, feature some platform elements, and the enemies in the first levels are no longer bank robbers or hit-men, but soldiers and robots instead. And the setting is no longer your typical American city, but a futuristic megalopolis.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
