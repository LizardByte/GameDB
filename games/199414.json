That can't happen. I can't sweat. There isn't anything to sweat. I'm scared. This has to be an illusion... or does reality not matter in this place?\n\nLithium is a FPS-RPG hybrid building on traditional Doom gameplay with leveling and upgrades, also featuring mechanics such as an inventory system, deadlier enemies, monster mod and multiplayer compatibility, and a sci-fi story shrouded in the supernatural, inspired by games like EYE: Divine Cybermancy, Shin Megami Tensei, and the Touhou series.
