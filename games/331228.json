While he's in captivity, Dr. Eggman performs a little brain surgery on Tails to implant a mind control device inside his head (obviously). Of course, Sonic and Knuckles set off to rescue Tails, and the rescue is successful. But they are yet to find about about the mind control device. Dr. Eggman \"sends\" them a little message through Tails stating that they must find and hand over all seven Chaos Emeralds to him if they wish to have the mind control device removed. Will Sonic comply with Eggman's request or will he turn his back on his friend?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-slash"}
