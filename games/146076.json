However, their beat-em-ups were not among their best. Kabuki Z is one of them. Developed by Kaneko of Gals Panic fame/infamy, it can best be described as a \u201chack-n-slash\u201d. The intro sequence gives a good idea of the game\u2019s content: a man commits seppuku, and behind him our samurai hero with his katana. The samurai chops his head off while the rice paper doors close, the resulting blood spurt splashing over them and forming the \u201cZ\u201d in the \u201cKabuki Z\u201d title.
