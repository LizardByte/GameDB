The game consists in a series of six encounters in which the players alternate the roles of cat and mouse (three times each). The winner is the player with most points at the end of the series.\n\nThe only player to score is the mouse. He does so by eating the cheese pieces scattered through the room. To eat, the player controlling the mouse has to press and hold the \"action\" button. The longer the button stay pressed, the more it eats. If the mouse eats for a certain amount of time, it will grow bigger than the cat and will be immune for a short period of time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-mousing-cat"}
