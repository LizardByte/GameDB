The game consists of controlling a small frog-like creature which jumps from one lily pad to another, trying to collect dots in four colors symbolizing grocery goods, currency transactions, progressive taxes and adventures and to reach a certain pad in the right-top corner of the screen. The lilies, symbolizing the ever-changing laws and acts in the USSR, constantly shrink and disappear only to appear in other places. Higher levels also feature one or more evil creatures called \"bureaucrats\" which follow the frog and try to eat it. The frog dies if the lily pad on which it is standing disappears, if the player moves it to a place where there is no lily pad, or if it is caught by a bureaucrat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
