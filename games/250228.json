This inferiority complex drives his attempt to alter the course of history to be seen than more than just a \"meme character\". Luckily, after finding a time stone, the crocodile is able to embark on this adventure of altering the past.\n\nThis adventure includes 9 rage-inducing levels, jam packed with difficult jumps, engaging boss battles, and captivating cutscenes.\n\nThis game is for god gamers only. It is very difficult, and is intentionally rage inducing, but it is much more fair than the previous installment of King K Roller (which I recommend you do not play).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-k-roller-2"}
