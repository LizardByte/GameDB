Stages take place in all weather conditions such as rain in both the day and night. Damage is accurately re-created, even down to broken headlights which the player must of course preserve to see during night stages. Rally Trophy was considered by many people to be the Grand Prix Legends of rally driving, due to its focus on historic cars, and the physics models of the cars (with no traction control or driver aids) being relatively realistic and challenging for its time.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 16979, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EWOAmpQkg9g"}, {"id": 16980, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "DxoDiUxAPdc"}], "characters": [{"id": 6990, "name": "English Voice Actor"}, {"id": 6991, "name": "German Voice Actor"}]}
