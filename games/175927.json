The port was released in October 2003 in the United States, Europe and Australia as one of the handheld mobile launch titles.\n\nSonicN is nearly identical to Sonic Advance in terms of core gameplay. Several features however, are removed from the port or adjusted to it due the technical limitations of the handheld mobile.\n\nNew features:\n\nThe unusual screen size of the N-Gage consists of a resolution of 176x208 and an aspect ratio of 11:13, which is smaller compared to the Game Boy Advance's 240\u00d7160 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio. Because of this, the game is somewhat tricky to play due the narrow screen view. However, the game features separated letterboxed 4:3 mode with scaled-down graphics that the player can both enlarge or shrink by pressing the # key, as this can be only done when the player has entered the level.[1]\nThe player can adjust the sound volume of N-Gage anytime by pressing the 0 key.[1]\n\nChanges:\n\nSeveral sound effects are low-pitched or softened.\nThe Tiny Chao Garden and multiplayer modes are completely removed from this port.\nSome music tracks from the Sound Test are removed, although it should be noted that Sonic Advance already did not include every music track on its Sound Test as well."}
