One day, when he held a sword he found in the storehouse, he lost consciousness. When he came to, he found himself in a place he did not recognize. He met a girl who introduced herself as Oda Saburou Kuon Nobunaga. She held out her hand to a stunned Kensuke and asked him to become her husband and accompany her on the road to national supremacy.\n\nThey traveled across the country, racking up victories in this period of social upheaval. However, there was one enemy they could not defeat: the oni. These man-eating, blood-drinking beasts soon took over all of Japan, plunging the country into hell. However, Kuon and Kensuke vowed to continue fighting, issuing a written appeal to all the influential lords: \u201cSamurai who are not afraid of even the oni, gather under me and let us save Japan together!\u201d", "videos": [{"id": 52316, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "r6CBTddS6qE"}]}
