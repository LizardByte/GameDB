A young woman on the brink of its extinction, she is the final hope for humanity in a world that treats her like a virus. Asha grows up living in defense. With her father by her side, they survive the apocalypse by trekking through the wastelands of the Himalayan region.\n\nHer father teaches her everything he knows about how to survive in this new world. Hunting, scavenging, and fighting her way through each day, all with a kind heart and steely determination. Ever the mentor, her father injects a final hope for humanity in his daughter: his life\u2019s work, the last human settlement, the biodome called Oakenfold. It will launch into the stars with the last remnants of humanity aboard, ready to start anew.\n\nAsha, now a young woman, is alone. While they embarked on one of their many journeys to the power plant, her father, and the rest of their collection team, perished in a biocide attack, where he protected Asha from getting stabbed by shielding her with his own body. Though the death of her father is painful, Asha must continue the mission the two of them had set out to complete: to retrieve the last of the fuel-packed crates to power up Oakenfold\u2019s systems.", "summary": "Oakenfold is a clever turn-based strategy roguelike, but with a twist! The TimeScrubber lets you rewind time and plan out your ideal path to victory.\n\nOutsmart the Biocides wrecking our planet in this roguelike adventure. Manipulate them, shove them, drown them, crush them, have them attack each other... No matter how you do it, keep your precious cargo safe at all times!\n\nIt's your last chance to escape our inhospitable planet.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/oakenfold", "videos": [{"id": 76199, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2N7CENNa0LI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N7CENNa0LI", "title": "Oakenfold Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2N7CENNa0LI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
