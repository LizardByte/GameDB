Only in this way can the mind of Numerus acknowledge its lifelong error and find peace. Clues to the whereabouts of the formula can be found scattered throughout the city. Along the way, various mathematical puzzles must be solved, for example, to open locked doors. Thus, to free Mathica, certain mathematical knowledge about geometry, equations, numbers, probabilities and combinatorics is required, which can be acquired in the knowledge part of the game.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mathica", "videos": [{"id": 82715, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vlD_SENYprc"}, {"id": 82716, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZB9khrJqyqU"}]}
