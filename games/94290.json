What makes it different from the original is the use of computational fluid dynamics to drive the environment. To use this as a weapon in the game you shoot plasma from your paddle to push around the fluid. This will in turn affect the movement of the ball. You can also suction fluid into the paddle. By doing this, possession of the ball can be controlled by the player. When the ball is sucked into the paddle, the ball can be blasted across the screen in full speed.\n\nWhen starting a game, you have ten lives. You will lose one every time your opponent scores. The game is level based. For every score you make you will get to a new level. For each level the game gets more difficult, and the ball gets more reactive to the fluid, and there more unpredictable.\n\nThe game can be played in both single and multiplayer (on the same computer). In addition to this, there is a sandbox mode, where players can play around as they wish with the fluid dynamics.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/plasma-pong", "videos": [{"id": 75932, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "yGJO5bydch4"}]}
