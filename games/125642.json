Specific rings, amulets and unique items will still add additional sockets or gems to the new skill gem menu.\nActive gems can have up to 5 support gem sockets based on the gems item level with available sockets linked by default.\nA new gem class, currently called meta gems, will allow both active and support gems to be socketed on them, curse on hit and cast on crit support gems would be changed to these meta gems.\nJeweler and Chromatic orbs will now be used on active/meta gems to customize the available support sockets and fusing orbs will be removed from the game", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/path-of-exile-2", "videos": [{"id": 31207, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9OosC1E8TVM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OosC1E8TVM", "title": "Path of Exile 2 Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9OosC1E8TVM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 31217, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "V2VRRSVgCL4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2VRRSVgCL4", "title": "Path of Exile 2 Gameplay Preview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V2VRRSVgCL4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 78724, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JCDIBA2Icls", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCDIBA2Icls", "title": "Path of Exile 2 Trailer 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JCDIBA2Icls/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 78725, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "jVRADmjzsss", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVRADmjzsss", "title": "Path of Exile 2 Gameplay Walkthrough 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jVRADmjzsss/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 91350, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DSLL8IIDkWY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSLL8IIDkWY", "title": "Path of Exile 2 - Official Ngamakanui Teaser Trailer | Summer Game Fest 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSLL8IIDkWY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 91762, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "FYXbEEzMZUE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYXbEEzMZUE", "title": "Path of Exile 2 - Official Aggorat Teaser Trailer | PC Gaming Show 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FYXbEEzMZUE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
