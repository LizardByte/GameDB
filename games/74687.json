The series is revived with graphics that are reminiscent of the beauty of the Azuchi Momoyama period. In addition, not only have the battles evolved from turn based to real time, but we have included 7 non-Daimyou forces that played a large role in the times: Imperial Court, the temples and shrines, navy, independent cities, ninja groups, land owner class and the Bakufu. Players play as one of the powerful Daimyou and fight to unify the entire country.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nobunagas-ambition-ranseiki-with-power-up-kit"}
