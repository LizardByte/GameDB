The design choices in the game harken back to gaming\u2019s arcade classics! \n\u2022 A Varied Combat System \u2013 With a dearth of different weapons and abilities at the daydreamer\u2019s disposal, she will eradicate aliens with energy, homing, ray, helix, and flamethrower blasters, and melee mutants with her whips.

From fuzzy turtles to vicious weasels, pets will offer invaluable support in varied forms to the daydreamer.   \n\u2022 Frightening Bosses \u2013 If normal aliens, mutants, robots, and bugs aren\u2019t bad enough, the bosses of Daydreamer: Awakened Edition are truly terrifying to behold. The disturbing Mr. Smiles, the repulsive Grimeboy, and ferocious, but still kind of cute, Rabies Rabbit are just some of the creepy boss monsters brought to life in the game. \n\u2022 Numerous Improvements \u2013 Since this is the Awakened Edition, that means there are a multitude of improvements and additions to the original release. Besides gameplay tweaks and balancing, there are now more difficulties, enhanced controls, improved combat, a ranked mode/leaderboard for the competitive, world map function, a brand new ending, and much more. \n\nWebsite: http://www.atlus.com/daydreamer", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWBfF2-xgHQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWBfF2-xgHQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWBfF2-xgHQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWBfF2-xgHQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hWBfF2-xgHQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Daydreamer: Awakened Edition Teaser Trailer", "description": "Daydreamer: Awakened Edition is the story of the last human who rouses from an eternal sleep to an unfamiliar Earth, since Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago.
