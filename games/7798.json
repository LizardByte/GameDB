Teke! Asmik-kun World), this game was never released outside Japan. Like its predecessor, the game is an excellent example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien and Space Panic. \n \nIn the game, Asmik-kun has to build a \"road\" from the entrance to the exit in each level. An enemy has come to kidnap the children on a certain world and the \"roads\" are intended for the children to be rescued and escorted safely back home.[3]", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
