{"id": 42148, "name": "Doubleback", "slug": "doubleback", "summary": "The player controls a dot on a black background, on which objects begin to appear randomly. If the dot crashes into an object, the player loses a life. Some objects, such as roller skates, move about; magnets even track and follow the player. Others, such as skulls, merely clutter up the screen and serve as obstacles", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doubleback"}
