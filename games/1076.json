The mustachioed marvel immediately jumped into action and sped off toward the fire. The moment he left her side, the princess vanished!\n\nWho\u2019s behind Princess Peach\u2019s disappearance?

The game features a solo story mode with Mario or Luigi, a two-player wireless game Mario Vs. Luigi, as well as a minigame mode for up to four players. The gameplay of New Super Mario Bros. is very much like that of the classic 2D platformers, mostly Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3, and substantially builds upon them to create gameplay both classic and contemporary. As the game is on DS, the touch screen allows players to store an additional power-up and view the distance still to go in a level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/new-super-mario-bros", "videos": [{"id": 34877, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Zy41U69D6Lc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy41U69D6Lc", "title": "New Super Mario Bros.
