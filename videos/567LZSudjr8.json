If you are followers of our project you should pay attention to the following things in the video:\n-The new Kurpfalzring track, based as we have said on the old Hockenheimring, as you know much longer than the current one.\n-The new tire model, which behaves in a much more realistic way than the previous one, showing much more consistent temperatures and degradation, in addition to allowing different compounds (in the video is SOFT: S on the tires widget)\n-A new HUD with a much more current design, with new Widgets and customizable (Ctrl+8)\n-New skins for MPA12 robots\n\nIf you want to know all the new features that we have developed since the release of the last official version, and you want to download an experimental version of the game with all these changes go to this link on our website:\nhttps://www.speed-dreams.net/en/development-news-2023-09/\n\nMUSIC: Voltaic by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n#OpenSource #SpeedDreams #SimRacing #Development #Indycar #Hockenheimring", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/567LZSudjr8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/567LZSudjr8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/567LZSudjr8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/567LZSudjr8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/567LZSudjr8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "SPEED DREAMS - A MPA12 Race in Kurpfalzring", "description": "Something almost impossible is to see an Indycar race (MPA12) in Europe, but even more impossible is when this race takes place at the old Hockenheimring, or as we call it at Speed Dreams, Kurpfalzring... although let's be honest, it would be something worthy to see, right?\n\nThe fact is that in the last few months we have been developing a lot of new things in our project, and we thought that a good way to show them to you would be by mixing them all in this video.
