The result is an amazing logical puzzle game which is fun for kids, adults & people of all ages! With 150 levels, ranging from easy to some really hard & difficult challenges, you have to develop an abstract strategy to move your token around the board in order to \u2018flip\u2019 all the pieces to your side! The board is your world & there is something wrong with it. Many states have changed sides. But they can swing to any side. As the ace Diplomat, it is your job to restore the order. Every step that you take, can win you some states & turn some against you. Make the right moves & flip everyone to your side. Strategize & chart a path across the board; moving, jumping & flipping states as you attempt to solve the 150 different levels! Go ahead & take up the challenge. Can you collect all three stars on each level?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fliplomacy", "videos": [{"id": 60855, "video_id": "0v_0sKrtlX4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v_0sKrtlX4", "title": "Fliplomacy - App Preview (Multiple Grids Showcase)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0v_0sKrtlX4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
