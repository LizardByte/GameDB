L. Stine Goosebumps: Escape from Horrorland.\n\nRecorded directly from a Windows 95 PC. This was a pretty neat game that my parents got for us as kids. Someone requested a playthrough of it, and I still have the original discs, so I figured why not?\n\nI had forgotten how much fun this actually was. I had also completely forgotten that it has Jeff Goldblum playing Dracula, acting kinda pervy with the 12 year old girl.\n\nI loved the books as a kid, and the game was a pretty entertaining, surprisingly high budget interactive movie with some hilariously bad costumes. Hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed reliving the memories of it :)\n\nFor my playthrough of the followup to this game, Goosebumps: Attack of the Mutant, follow this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vQ0qBVhjME\n____________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWEqm8EYWRU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWEqm8EYWRU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWEqm8EYWRU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWEqm8EYWRU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kWEqm8EYWRU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Goosebumps: Escape from Horrorland (1996) PC Playthrough- NintendoComplete", "description": "A beginning to end playthrough of DreamWorks Interactive's 1996 Windows 95 game, R.
