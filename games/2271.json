Players take on the role of a hunter and are sent to explore a settlement within the Monster Hunter universe, completing quests on their journey to seek and slay monsters whilst improving their skills and earning equipment upgrades. With many challenging monsters and over 200 quests the latest edition to the series is set to be the most expansive offering to date. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate utilizes the functionalities of the Nintendo 3DS system to provide players with a truly intuitive hunting experience. The touch screen feature allows players to quickly access in-game books, weapons, field maps and mini games whilst the high quality graphics 3D visuals of Nintendo 3DS powered by the latest iteration of Capcom's MT Framework deliver a unique and stunning world for players to explore. Taking advantage of the portability of Nintendo 3DS, players can exchange their guild card that contains all their hunter's information with other players via StreetPass. Players can experience the world of Monster Hunter alone or in four player local play using Nintendo 3DS. Finding nearby hunters to adventure on quests with is now even easier via the local Nintendo 3DS search feature. Wii U players will be able to enjoy the hunt with Nintendo 3DS players via a local wireless connection. Gamers that own both a Wii U and Nintendo 3DS can take advantage of the inter compatibility of save data between the two consoles, taking the hunt from the living room wherever they go.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "videos": [{"id": 1314, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "z648qIBejT0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z648qIBejT0", "title": "Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z648qIBejT0/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 17280, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EI75zyCLCG0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI75zyCLCG0", "title": "Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate - New York Comic Con 2012 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EI75zyCLCG0/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 17281, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7uzafxEHbG0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uzafxEHbG0", "title": "N3DS\u300e\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc3(\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4)G\u300f \u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7uzafxEHbG0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
