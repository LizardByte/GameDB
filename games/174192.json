After solving the puzzle, Loremaster appears on an overhead screen, and quickly establishes that Subject 67 is a human-demon fusion, and is the 66th subject in the 6th experiment batch. However, Lucifer, now a maid, corrects her, saying that said subject died yesterday. Loremaster, disappointed, decides to dismiss it and sends 67 to the next area.\n\nSubject 67 moves through the puzzles with relative ease, and Loremaster continues to comment on his progress, revealing herself as an angel with a demon disguise, although this is not the case. Loremaster also notes her extensive knowledge of all sin in recorded history, to which Lucifer adds that whenever Loremaster sees anything mildly suggestive, she still acts like a thirsty adolescent, and Loremaster replies to Lucifer to not mock her without permission. Of course, Subject 67 still acts aggressively towards both Loremaster and Lucifer, telling the former that he would take everything from her, starting with \"that smug demon maid.\" to which Loremaster replies she cannot give away her \"best girl\", but instead replies she will give him apple pie, which he accepts.\n\nSubject 67 moves on to the final phase, a giant robot resembling the skeleton guards. He eventually defeats it, and Loremaster is ecstatic. Though the apple pie was already eaten, she quickly gets her baker, Justice, to make some more pie. Loremaster talks with Subject 67 over pie, and states that there is much to learn from him, as he is the most stable result of Loremaster's experimentation.\n\nAfterwards, Lucifer prepares a suit for a reluctant Subject 67, and despite his protests, tells him it looks good on him. She then goes on to explain that, due to Loremaster's lack of knowledge of Subject 67, he can be useful to Lucifer regaining her crown and control over Hell. She tells 67 to think about what she said, and finally remarks that 67 reminds her of a man she once knew, and that she wonders how he is doing.", "summary": "Chapter EX: Examtaker is a bonus chapter, following the Abysstaker Ending of the main story.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/helltaker-examtaker"}
