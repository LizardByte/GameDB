The object of Pepper II is simple enough, all you do is zip closed sections of the maze and they will become filled with color. Zip in all the sections of the maze and it's complete. However, if you backtrack you might unzip your path, so be careful! Each stage has four mazes you must complete to move on, but you can move from maze to maze by using the exits located at the top, bottom, and sides of the screen. And don't forget about the bad guys trying to take you out all the while. If one touches you you're toast! You can fight back by zipping sections of the maze closed that contain power-ups that will make you invincible for a short time or clear the screen of all the baddies. The game keeps getting harder as you progress to higher stages.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pepper-ii"}
