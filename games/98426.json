The beautiful ocean which surrounds the island and the charm of its historic Western-style streets draw in many visitors. In October, the streets are decorated in Halloween decorations in preparation for Kidai Gakuen\u2019s founding festival. \n \nThere is a jewel kept at the school which can grant any wish. Every year at the festival when the \u2018orb\u2019 is displayed to the general public, there are many plans to steal it. However, all attempts have been thwarted by voluntary security groups of townspeople and students. Takuto is the leader of one of these groups, who all have special powers bestowed upon them by the jewel\u2019s magic. Together with his trusted friends, he protects the jewel and the festival. \n \nHowever, this year is different. His role as the leader is only a fa\u00e7ade; he is only awaiting his chance to steal the jewel for himself. He had planned for this moment for three years, in order to resurrect his late imouto.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 31301, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "D01X25YYIl0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D01X25YYIl0", "title": "11gatsu no Arcadia OP Sub.
