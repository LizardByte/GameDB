It draws inspiration from the works of Junji Ito and games like Silent Hill, with the story focused on the eerie and the bizarre. The story is about Namie who has just moved into a new house, one that was rented for a too-good-to-be-true price. It seemed like a good idea at first - nice house, low price, fully furnished, quiet neighborhood\u2026 but when she comes across a locked room on the second floor, she starts to realize there's more to the house than what she was told. Why is that room locked? Why did the previous tenant leave the house so suddenly, leaving his things behind? And what's the deal with the windowless house next door?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
