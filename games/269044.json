Over eons, your species recovered its technology and secretly grew in population. Returning to the stars, the Ranokk thrived once more.\n\nThough always wary of encountering the genocidal Accretions, the Ranokk \u201cCore\u201d leadership decided that it is now finally time to interact with the many other species that formed the Galactic Union.\n\nYou will personally lead the military escort accompanying the Ranokk emissaries as they make the momentous journey to the seat of the Galactic Council. The Ranokk will hide no more.\n\nBut an insidious force lies at the heart of the Galactic Union, plucking strings and moving pawns from a position of near complete secrecy. A force that the Galactic Union calls the \u201cAncients\u201d. You will find that these enigmatic creatures know of the Ranokk \u2013 and they intend to finish what they started when they heralded the Ranokk apocalypse millions of years ago.", "summary": "Aurora Nova is a Roguelike deckbuilder with a hint of rpg elements.
