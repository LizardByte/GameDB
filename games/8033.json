In hectic, side-scrolling mayhem, you take control of everyone's favorite little brown mouse Jerry and work your way through five danger-filled levels in an attempt to free your kidnapped pals from the clutches of Tom. Collect as many golden items as you can as you open doors leading to a wide variety of challenging mini-games (eight to be exact). Complete slide-style puzzles, engage in a creamy pie-throwing contest (try to hit Tom in the face), and even water ski! You'll have to climb slippery poles, crash through obstacles, and make death-defying jumps in order to gather together your friends. Be careful to avoid jumping fish and creepy spiders if you want to succeed in the frantic, quick-reflex, button-pounding platform party of TOM AND JERRY IN MOUSE ATTACKS!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-and-jerry-in-mouse-attacks", "collections": [{"id": 3779, "name": "Tom and Jerry"}]}
