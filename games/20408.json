The premise of the game involves participating in the filming of action movies; instead of the usual lives the player character's attempts to succeed are measured by \"takes\". The player-controlled B-Movie star shoots his way through multiple themed sets, filled with cardboard enemies and obviously fake environments.\n\nThe game features five movies, all spoofing different movie genres, such as Horror and Westerns. Throughout these movies the protagonist is tasked with defeating enemies, freeing the civilians and putting on the best possible performance by activating motion-based power-ups. The player can shoot into the floor to send out a shockwave to vanquish all enemies on the screen. It is also possible to spin on the spot to slow down time and get a more accurate shot. Shooting into the sky activates Rampage, a powerful machine gun.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-shoot", "videos": [{"id": 71973, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-4JsUM3-n70", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4JsUM3-n70", "title": "The Shoot E3 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-4JsUM3-n70/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3653, "name": "Head Shot"}]}
