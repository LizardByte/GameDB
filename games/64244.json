It is playable at many websites, including, as of 2010, the official Nickelodeon website.\n\nThe game uses more 1987/2007-esque appearances for the Turtles, but most other characters take after their 2003 counterparts.\n\nEach Turtle has his advantages. Leonardo and Raphael are more effective in fighting Foot Ninja, while Donatello and Michelangelo are efficient in battling machines/robots. Leo and Don have long-range weapons, and Mike and Raph have stronger weapons.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-double-damage", "videos": [{"id": 48435, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7UP44--VBt0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UP44--VBt0", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Double Damage (Flash Game) - Walkthrough (No Commentary)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7UP44--VBt0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
