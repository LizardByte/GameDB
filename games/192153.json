The Baron, in control of this area, sends an Interceptor to restore order. The sentinel does not expect the robots to hide a secret affecting the fate of the whole planetary system. As time passes, the distinction between good and evil fades. The player's task is to restore order eliminating rebels and their leaders.\n\nThe rulers of the planetary system try to maintain peace and suppress the first symptoms of smoldering disturbances. But on one of the minor colonized planets, a rebellion ignites. The Barons cannot let the fragile peace of The Union collapse and allow the return of the conflagration of war.\nIn the system, Interceptors are the law. It is their duty to ensure that the rule of law is always upheld.\nThey exist to prevent another war. Despite the fact that they had previously fought on the other side of the barricade, they were able to unite. Even Barons take their strength into account.", "summary": "Take part in an atmospheric sci-fi horror game and stay alive in the last stronghold, the Cathedral.
