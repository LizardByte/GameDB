It includes new characters, transformations, skins, techniques, and stages that can be classic, from Dragon Ball, Z and GT, or new, from Super. New latin spanish voicelines and texts, menus, descriptions for characters, subtitles, and renders are also included here as some extra details. There's also new missions for Ultimate Battle mode. The most notable change it's that now there are more detailed and epic damaged skins, when you recover from an strong attack you will have your clothes very destroyed with almost all characters.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-ball-z-the-legacy-of-tenkaichi"}
