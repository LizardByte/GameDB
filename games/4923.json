Master each character's distinct moves while exploring caves, riding a pterodactyl, avoiding a rampaging Tyrannosaurus rex, running atop a ball of ice, and more. Those having difficulty during certain sequences can receive tips from woolly mammoth Ellie as well as possums Crash and Eddie. In addition to the single-player campaign, Ice Age 2 offers eight competitive mini-games supporting up to four players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 69542, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "bWM-10dy3ZI"}]}
