These terrible terrapins transformed the peace loving Mushroom People into stones, bricks, and ironically, mushrooms, then set their own evil king on the throne. In the wake of the ghastly coup d'etat, the beautiful Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin and despair.\n\nIt is said that only the daughter of the Mushroom King, Princess Toadstool, can break the evil spell and return the inhabitants of Mushroom kingdom to their normal selves.\n\nBut the King of the Koopas, knowing of this prophecy, kidnapped the lovely Princess and hid her away in one of his castles.\n\nWord of the terrible plight of the Mushroom People quickly spread throughout the land, eventually reaching the ears of a humble plumber. The simple, yet valiant Mario vowed to rescue the Princess and free her subjects from King Koopa's tyrannous reign. But can Mario really overcome the many obstacles facing him and become a true hero?", "summary": "Bowser has once again taken over the Mushroom Kingdom, and it's up to Mario to put an end to his sinister reign. Battle Bowser's vile henchmen through 32 different levels - all taken directly from the 1985 classic! Then move on to collect special Red Coins and Yoshi Eggs in the Challenge Mode. Or face off against a friend and race through 8 competition courses in the all-new VS Mode! This time there's a lot more to do than just save a Princess, so get ready for a brick-smashin', pipe-warpin', turtle-stompin' good time!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-bros-deluxe", "videos": [{"id": 46786, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7WpIRAEfnrg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WpIRAEfnrg", "title": "Super Mario Bros Deluxe   Game Boy Color   Retro Commercial  Trailer   1999   Nintendo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7WpIRAEfnrg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46787, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "V3FAsFHYQ2c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3FAsFHYQ2c", "title": "Super Mario Bros.
