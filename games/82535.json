You control where you go. Your Wyvern is nimble and maneuverable--not just in the air and on the ground, but on walls and ceilings too. Guide the Wyvern by seizing the reins and directing him towards your enemies, which your Wyvern will trample and bite!\n\nYou are a wyvern-riding lich wielding proper magic. You get to kill dudes with both your wyvern and your magic. Four elements that can be combined for up to 20 spells!\n\nDon't want to ride a dragon?
