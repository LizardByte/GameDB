This game came before GHOST SIX. This time the one who shrinks is Sumire... alongside with his sister, Kikyo. This playthrough only has END 1/TRUE END, which requires to not miss any doors presented in each train car. END 2 will be uploaded later as a bonus part.\n\nOverall, without spoiling, there are really some theme similarities in both this and GHOST SIX, and I like each different tales and interpretations of them. While most of their characterization is similar like the other game, this one made me even more sad, than GHOST SIX, but both can be dramatic, and both games are really amazing. It's also very effed up as well, especially about Sumire in this game (I hope that's not the case in GHOST SIX tho. If it is tho, well I guess it's still effed up.) Still as always, even tho this is made in a different RPG Maker engine, the art style of this game, as always is so absolutely amazing! Combine with the music, and it really have the rainbow emotion vibes, and also has some melancholy as well. The translation on this one, holy hell, it has the quality that SHTDN also had, and really flavored the characters to their perfect tastes, even culturally as well. I can only say, it's absolutely gorgeous. I guess the only issue was the near end tho, the dialogues confused me, as I feel like some of the dialogues was meant to be spoken by the other, instead of the character shown who was saying it. Nevertheless, I still kind of understood what's going on there. I enjoyed this game, like GHOST SIX, and I kind of invisibly cried.\n\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy!\n\nHymeji on the Side of the vids by @/anya_nightmares", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQmKSnRLa5U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQmKSnRLa5U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQmKSnRLa5U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQmKSnRLa5U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gQmKSnRLa5U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[Totally Normal Train Ride to Rebirth.] GRAVE OF TR\u00c4UMEREI [TRUE END/END 1 RUN] (No Commentary)", "description": "=Game link: https://graveoftraumerei.carrd.co/\n=Commentary Version: https://youtu.be/anU6doxJ1lk\n=GHOST SIX (v. 1.03):\n -No Commentary: https://youtu.be/DJ-VX2RCK2Y\n -Commentary: https://youtu.be/kk1XmUvMC1c\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 - content warnings\n0:05 - intro\n0:11 - game start\n1:55 - First Train Car\n39:38 - Ghost Door (Requirement for True Ending || missing locks you to END 2)\n48:39 - Second Train Car (warning brain suckage)\n1:15:59 - Bear Door (Requirement for True Ending || missing locks you to END 2)\n1:31:02 - Last Train Cars/Train Stopped\n1:39:05 - Rabbit Door (Requirement for True Ending || missing locks you to END 2)\n1:56:01 - Beach\n2:17:48 - Ferris Wheel\n2:33:40 - Rebirth\n2:36:16 - Tsutsuji and Sumire lore (warning, certain portion is bugged, you may need to interpret who's actually saying things.)\n2:58:46 - Aftermath of Rebirth of Sumire and Kikyo (END 1)\n3:02:42 - game end to outro/end screen\n\nFrom the collab devs of GHOST SIX, is the other game of theirs, with the same two characters, Tsutsuji and Sumire, in a different tale to tell/AU, GRAVE OF TR\u00c4UMEREI.
