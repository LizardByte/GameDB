Lara is now in a quasi-3D overhead environment, as opposed to the 2D-platformer view of the previous handheld versions. This view proves helpful while Lara runs, jumps, shimmys, and shoots around. Although there is lack of a save feature, there is a password system which lets you restore back to 'almost' where you left.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 53119, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_gAJKM8-cgs"}]}
