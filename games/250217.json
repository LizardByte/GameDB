The theme for this year\u2019s gamma was \u201cone button games\u201d. So we decided to give it a go and do a two player version of The Amazing Flying Brothers.\n\nYou play as the infamouse flying brothers as they try to perform the flying trapeze act. The game is a two player coop game. Your job is to get as big of a score as you can.\n\nControls:\nPlayer 1: Left shift.\nPlayer 2: Right shift.\n\nThe game is a one button game, so no more then one button per player is needed. Tap on the button to release your grip. Holding down on the button will cause you to speed up or slow down. If you press down, when going down you\u2019ll accelerate. If you press down when going up, you\u2019ll slow down.", "summary": "A two player version of The Amazing Flying Brothers.\nYou play as the infamouse flying brothers as they try to perform the flying trapeze act.
