Only Princess Zelda can rescue him. Her journey will be difficult, filled with many challenges and mysteries. Armed only with the advice of the wise court astronomer Gaspra, and the guidance of Shurmak, Zelda must set out on her journey deep into the uncharted southeastern region of Hyrule, known as Tolemac.\n\nBefore she begins, Gaspra warns her that the only way to save Link is to collect the seven Celestial Signs that Ganon has stolen, and that she must overcome one final obstacle: Ganon himself. Once she succeeds, she gains the knowledge and strength to rescue Link and brings the magical land of Hyrule into the Age of Lightness.", "summary": "In the 1990s Nintendo made a deal with Philips to develop 3 Zelda titles. The first 2 were side scrolling platformers, similar to Zelda II, and the third was a traditional top-down action adventure game.\n\nZelda\u2019s Adventure looked interesting and it would be fun to play on a portable system. The Game Boy was chosen because of the existing Zelda games on the system.\n\nThe game sticks to the aesthetics of Link\u2019s Awakening, but also incorporates some features from Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.\n\nThis is a complete port of the CDi original and was developed in GB Studio, with a few modifications.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zeldas-adventure--1", "videos": [{"id": 88941, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "QQlDruNjbno", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQlDruNjbno", "title": "Zelda's Adventure - Game Boy Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QQlDruNjbno/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88942, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "pWZLL7rfomw"}]}
