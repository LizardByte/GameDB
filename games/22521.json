On each level, the eyes of the hawks in the status panel flash to indicate the direction to travel in to find a puzzle piece. Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level. \n \nThe player has a choice of four different weapons. The basic pistol had unlimited ammo but did little damage. The machine gun had a faster rate of fire, the laser did more damage and most powerful of all was the rocket launcher - but all three soon ran out of ammo. \n \nThe game features parallax scrolling backgrounds and large numbers of enemies (including large rhinos, triceratops and gorillas).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
