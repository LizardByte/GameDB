You find yourself sucked into a black hole that warps you far away. The world you know so well is gone. It's as though there were a huge explosion. All around you asteroids appear on fire. You feel great pain and pass out. You wake up in a strange room with an unearthly creature looking down on you. You sense the beginning of a great adventure but will you ever be able to get home?", "summary": "The Quest: Asteroids is an expansion to The Quest, a beautifully hand-drawn open world role playing game with old school grid-based movement and turn based combat.\n\nAfter enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and adventures.
