Now Loki is plotting revenge and searching for a possibility to sneak back into Asgard and pay Odin back. Out of spite, he abuses our four human heroes--Sigurd, the Frank, Hatschi, the brave Saracen, Bjami, and Crya--with his intrigues and traps. Embark on adventures and quests to help your allies wrest free from Loki's insidious machinations, whether it's a plague of serpents or the demon wolf Fenris dropping by for a rather unexpected visit. Ensure the health and safety of your people as you start with but a humble town and work your way up to a large city. Cultures 3 offers the best combination of strategy and adventure!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cultures-northland", "videos": [{"id": 32322, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "DeXQMDH4_M8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeXQMDH4_M8", "title": "Cultures Northland Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DeXQMDH4_M8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
