The technology of virtual-reality has taken a quantum-leap, and as a result, the concept of \nE-sports changed drasticaly. Several countries started to arranged annual activities using the revolutionary \nHi-Finesse System. However, the biggest and most anticipated competition of them all is about to take place in Vancouver, Canada. The students at Canadian Academy for Interactive Arts Development (CAIAD), will be battling against each other in a gigantic glorious virtual war utilizing all their own in-game creations. You play as Lisbeth Dille, \na player for the upcoming Virtual-Reality Game Championship (VRGC). But meanwhile, the city is struggling with a political issue that might affect her life.\n\nNOTE: \nThis is only a 15-20 minutes long prologue. \nIt does not feature the championship.\nMy game is not great, my game might not be good at all, but i sure have learned from feedback how to improve my skills in this field. I hope that you will give this game a chance, and perhaps give me feedback wich makes me better in making games in the future. Since this game is my first game, thus not the best, and since it has a very untraditional design that many will propably hate, we chose to not charge for this game. It will be free to download and play.\n\nFEATURES\n- Visual Novel conversations with western cel-shaded visuals \n- A softcore sci-fi with a realistic and achievable depiction of near-future VR \n- Experimental untraditional game \n- Challenging shooting segments \n- Hybrid orchestral soundtrack\n\nTHF2D was among other reasons, born out of the wish for 2D indie-games that offered other visuals than the retro style. The game was developed using modern HQ cel-shading 2D visuals.\n\nThe score was composed utilizing Hollywood softwares such as Vienna Strings and cutting-edge sound design packages to provide a colourful soundtrack ranging from AAA-orchestral music, electronical and some lower quality tunes. Whether we have succeeded in making a worthy product or not........is entirely up to the audience to decide.", "summary": "NOTE: \nThis is only a 15-20 minutes long prologue. \nIt does not feature the championship.\nMy game is not great, my game might not be good at all, but i sure have learned from feedback how to improve my skills in this field.
