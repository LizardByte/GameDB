The goal of the game is to blow up the enemies that you see in each level. As Mario, you have access to several types of bombs. You can upgrade your bombs in the game as you gain experience. You'll start with smaller bombs that are used for the mediocre enemies before seeing the larger bombs that are meant to do significant damage to the larger enemies, especially those that come toward the end of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bomber-mario", "videos": [{"id": 89005, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "6LiyOWvx0G8"}]}
