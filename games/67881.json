With your help he must make his way to a valve on the far side of the screen and turn off the uncontrolled flood.\nNavigating these increasingly overrun floodplains requires tilting your device to slosh the water around but it's not as simple as tipping all the water over to one side of the screen and then dashing across the silt, though. The levels are built up of colour-coded bridges, which are activated by pouring the water into the similarly coloured area of the screen.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/waterways"}
