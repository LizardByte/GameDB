The game is set in the medieval fantasy world Castalia, and involves battle for dominance between various kingdoms and provinces. Combat is handled in a RTS fashion, with the player- and AI-controlled forces moving on an overhead battle screen and executing commands in real time. The battles occur between medium-size parties led by individual characters with unique attributes and personalities. These leaders also receive experience, level up, and learn magic spells in a RPG fashion. The game's structure and pacing are also reminiscent of an RPG rather than an RTS: there is no base-building or resource management, and the missions involves completing fairly linear stages that consist chiefly of combat and plot-advancing dialogue.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magus--1"}
