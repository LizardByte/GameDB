In addition, extra content and features are packed in including new costumes, new endings, and all the DLC from the PS3 version.\n\nOne year after the events of Atelier Totori: The Adventurer of Arland, the story begins in Arls Kingdom, a tiny nation in the far northwest of the Arland Republic. The quaint kingdom lacks the highly developed machinery and alchemy of the larger nation, but is nonetheless poised to join the Republic. However, many obstacles must first be overcome.\n\nTo minimize criticism from opposition parties, Arls proposes a development project to increase its influence. To begin, a number of skilled adventurers are dispatched to Arls from Arland, including the alchemist Totori Helmold, the star of Atelier Totori. Meruru, Princess of Arls, maneuvers to become Totori\u2019s apprentice with aspirations of becoming an alchemist in her own right.\n\nMeruru\u2019s quest is to develop her kingdom before Arls becomes part of Arland. Enlisting the help of her friends, Meruru will synthesize, explore, build, and battle her way to making a bigger and better kingdom.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atelier-meruru-plus-the-apprentice-of-arland", "videos": [{"id": 78996, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "j5sh1vhgRJo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5sh1vhgRJo", "title": "ATELIER MERURU PLUS: THE APPRENTICE OF ARLAND (E3 2013) TRAILER", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j5sh1vhgRJo/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 2520, "name": "Atelier: Arland"}]}
