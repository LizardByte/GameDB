Duplicate your position with a single button and press it again to switch between your two selves at any time, no matter how far.\nYou can use your other self to activate switches, mislead enemies and block projectiles. Sometimes, even tunnel through walls. As you progress, new components will require you to find new ways to advance \u2013 using both intelligence and skill. It's a huge maze filled with deadly puzzles.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/quantumleaper"}
