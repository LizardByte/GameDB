The controls are supposed to be \"true to life\", yet are just quite horrible. It would take some serious practise to become good at the game, yet its that irritating i doubt anyone ever gave it the chance. \nIm not really going to say a lot about the game due to it being bad, the video actually makes it look a lot better than it really is. \nIf your into flight games with fiddly controls then this may be of intrest to you. But if your looking for some fast gaming action, then id pass ths one up.\n\nPlease check out my other videos", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i3PK4of2JeI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i3PK4of2JeI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i3PK4of2JeI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i3PK4of2JeI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "RC Sports Copter Challenge PS2 Gameplay (Xicat interactive) Playstation 2", "description": "In ths video we check out RC Sports Copter Challenge by an unfamiliar company to us called Xicat Interactive. \nThe aim of the game is to fly your RC copter around tracks and obstacle courses, which is a lot easier said than done.
