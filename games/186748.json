The game is all about hitting the targets behind your opponent's back.\n\nAt the centre of the court, there is a magnetic field. If the ball comes close to one of its centres it changes direction.\nPatrick Polly has learnt to use this to his advantage. A tip is that you do the same.", "summary": "The Patrick Polly Swooshball Challenge is a game with a mix of Pong and Tennis.\n\nThe game concept is based on a major commercial campaign by Candelia, one of the leading candy manufacturers in Scandinavia. Released as freeware, people had to send in 5 scanned barcodes from bags of Polly in order to receive the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-patrick-polly-swooshball-challenge"}
