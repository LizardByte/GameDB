There's a map screen, that shows the world split into a grid of squares, each representing one screen. Four of the squares have numbers in them, which represent bosses. When you defeat a boss, you get an item which gives you a new ability: winged bots that allow you to jump, flippers that let you swim, etc. \nThe game plays pretty well, and the controls are well designed, using only the directions and two buttons. The first button uses your weapon, some kind of blowgun that shoots bubbles, and when held down, allows you to select an item, via a Secrret of Mana-Esque ring menu. The second button uses the currently selected item.\nAfter a boss, you'll  end up meeting a crazy-eyed witch who sells you stuff. \nThe game it's pretty fun,  recommended.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4lqsjPAW7U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4lqsjPAW7U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4lqsjPAW7U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "[x68000] Silkroad 2 - Longplay", "description": "Silkroad 2 is a RPG game for windows and sharp x68000 by sprite team.\nThis is the version 1.00 for the sharp x68000.\n\nYou play as a young monkey girl with a red bow, and you explore some nice  places (countryside, caves, temples, desert...).
