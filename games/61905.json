The final game in the series released for that platform, PachiPara 14 once again simulates a handful of Sanyo's Umi Monogatari line of pachislot machines, specifically the CR Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa MTA and SAD models. It is also the last game to feature the long-running PachiPro F\u016bunroku subseries as an open world RPG; while the name went on to reappear in the series 3DS' installments starting with the first release of PachiPara 3D: Taikai Monogatari 2, it transitioned into a predominantly visual novel genre in the wake of series producer and longtime Irem developer Kazuma Kujo leaving the company in March 2011 to form Granzella.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pachipara-14-kaze-to-kumo-to-super-umi-in-okinawa"}
