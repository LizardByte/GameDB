You build a small settlement along a newly constructed imperial road. You attract new inhabitants to the city by building a harbor and a forum. As your tax revenue increases, you begin to mine raw materials and construct new buildings to meet the needs of the population. Baths, theaters, gladiator schools, slave markets, etc. not only serve to keep your inhabitants entertained, but also to provide them with work. Import marble and other raw materials from distant regions and build monumental temples and palaces!\n\nAs a skillful governor, you will quickly catch the eye of the senate or the emperor. They will assign you new provinces to colonize. As you increase your private fortune, you will eventually be able to afford to become a senator. From then on, you will also become involved in political intrigues. Of course, you can also start your own intrigues, perhaps with enough money and power to reach the highest title: Emperor of Rome.", "summary": "Be part of important decisions within the Roman empire.
