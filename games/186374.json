It\u2019s a platformer that has your character jumping, punching and cursing every time he scrapes his knee.\n\nOn the fence between being amusing and downright inappropriate\n\nFrom a graphics standpoint, AVGN: Game Over can\u2019t be argued with because it is a fan-made game that aims to be anything but serious, but seriously offensive. It uses a retro look with old\u2019school gameplay that work well together and with the rest of the game concept.\n\nIn every level you\u2019ll be punching goombas, Kirbys and a whole lot of characters from popular platformers and not only. In the standalone games, some of the future punching bags are evil characters, others are heroes but in AVGN: Game Over they are all categorically victims.\n\nThe game pushes forward a sense of useless violence that is backed up by a good deal of verbal abuse that just isn\u2019t right. At times cursing a bit can be funny but I\u2019m not sure that this game has that thought in mind.\nDrop the F bomb, literally\n\nThe game is meant to reflect The Angry Video Game Nerd who has made a name for himself for openly bashing games that he considered to be bad. Presentation was everything and that\u2019s also obvious in the game. There is a lot of cursing and to recharge his life essence, he drinks beer just like in real life.\n\nAs a game, AVGN: Game Over is...something. Having repetitive gameplay is an understatement because you can finish the game just by using a single move and the constant \u2018F***\u2019 shouts get annoying after a while.\nIf you\u2019re the kind who easily gets frustrated, don\u2019t play this\n\nTo wrap it up, AVGN: Game Over is not something worth recommending. As a game, it\u2019s barely decent and its \u2018charm\u2019 solely revolves around the use of trash-talk and downright indecent language.", "videos": [{"id": 62945, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "QZEpR6TvBRk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZEpR6TvBRk", "title": "AVGN Game Over World 1- 8 Playthough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QZEpR6TvBRk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
