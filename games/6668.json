Besides the usual gameplay mechanic of finding objects from a list by clicking on them, the game has adventure portions where the player must collect and use objects to escape from a room. These sections follow the simplified puzzle patterns of the recent Azada and Dream Chronicles games.\n\nAfter each chapter, the player has to search the previous adventure levels for 10 instances of a certain object. 12 precious artifacts have to be collected throughout the game. The game keeps a score based on accuracy, time, object value and the use of hints.\n\nThere are some mini-games: paintings work like jigsaw puzzles that have to be reassembled, and scales have to be stabilized by shifting weights until they reach equilibrium.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/escape-the-museum"}
