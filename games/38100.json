Don't you just love 'em? Classics like Tetris, Puzzle Bobble, Klax....and then there's Blodia. The concept behind Blodia is very simple: 1-You have a screen of pipe-work. 2-There is a ball travelling down the pipe. 3-If the ball drops down a gap in the pipe you have to start again. That's it. So what this all amounts to is you frantically sliding the tiles around block-puzzle style to keep that cursed ball bearing on track. God forbid that you think the ball is moving too slowly, you can even push a button to speed the damn thing up, but you have to wonder why you would ever want to do that. \n \n(from the PC Engine Software Bible)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blodia"}
