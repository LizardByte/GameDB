The next morning, when the terrible deed was discovered, a great sorrow settled over the land. \n \nNo longer did people go merrily gallumping about. No longer did minstrels sing the happy songs of the realm. And worst at all. not a single smile could be found on the faces of the children. They all stayed in the shadows listlessly mumbling to themselves. \n \nOnly the wizard of the royal court was not hopeless. For in reading the ancient text, he discovered the spell of the magical, musical. shoes. When the King was told the colors might be restored through this spell. he sent for Cedrick. his bravest subject. \nWhen Cedrick put on the magic shoes. wherever he stepped. color and music burst forth. Armed With the shoes. Cedrick went to the tippity, toppity most cloud and saw where the darkened rainbow was and. with a mighty hop. launched himself upon it.
