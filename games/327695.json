A race of demi-humans has emerged, threatening the existence of humanity. The 15th human Emperor, named Sigmatoro J. Salzstein, calls Duke Erich B. Zweiss, and explains to him the mission: recover ancient crystals from the demi-humans, which alone can save humanity. But the Duke should be careful: who knows what challenges await for him among the demi-humans, outside of the safe walls of the capital city Berlin?.. Crystal Quest is a puzzle game with adventure elements - the Duke's top-down movement and the ability to access different locations to tackle different puzzles. The locations are marked on the world map as towers and caves; in each one of them, a sexy demi-human will offer a challenge to the good Duke.", "summary": "The puzzles include a tile-matching memory game and a timed top-down maze sprint (find the exit before the time runs out). In each subsequent area, the difficulty of these puzzles increases, and the amount of clothes the demi-humans wear after a puzzle has been solved decreases.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crystal-quest--3"}
