The game features several dance stages, similar to games such as Space Channel 5 and PaRappa the Rapper. It also introduces a new ELLENA system used to render the game as well as a new exclusive character featuring the same name (Ellena Stevens, the protagonist of the original Broadway Legend Ellena featuring Park Jin-young). One or two players can dance to a variety of J-pop tunes by using the controller buttons to copy their opponent's moves. Based on how well a player copies the moves, Nuisance Puyos are sent to their opponent. The player loses if their health bar drops to 0, or if they have Nuisance Puyos on their side of the screen.", "summary": "Puyo Puyo DA! is a Dance Dance Revolution based game for the Dreamcast with Puyo Puyo characters.
