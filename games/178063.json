The hero also rescues Zelda from a monster attack and escorts her to Hyrule Castle. After the hero's quests in the dungeons are completed, he or she and Aginah meet up with Zelda in the castle and proceed to study the unusual tablets. Aginah concludes that they should travel to his elder brother's house in Kakariko Village to search for clues to deciphering the markings. Unfortunately, Aginah fails to discover anything important about them, so implores the hero to travel forth and collect more of them from the dungeon monsters. After obtaining two more tablets, Zelda suggests they travel instead to Link's House to obtain the Book of Mudora, which may be able to translate the text. While Aginah searches the house, Zelda calls for the Fortune Teller to divine the location of the book, while the hero continues to search for the tablets. Aginah does eventually locate the book, upon which point he and the hero meet with Zelda at the castle.", "summary": "The third part (week) of BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-zelda-no-densetsu-inishie-no-sekiban-dai-3-wa", "videos": [{"id": 57316, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TVIhSbN5Qwk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVIhSbN5Qwk", "title": "BS\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\u3000\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u77f3\u76e4\u3000\u7b2c3\u8a71", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TVIhSbN5Qwk/sddefault.jpg"}]}
