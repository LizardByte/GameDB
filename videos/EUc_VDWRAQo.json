The players control their Sims, as they interact with their virtual surroundings, engaging in various different activities and forming relationships in a manner similar to real life. Like its predecessor, The Sims 2 does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. They do, however, have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can have good or bad effects. There is also a wide-range of cheats to be used. All Sims age, and generally live up to sixty five Sim days, if the controller treats their Sim well.\r\n\r\nThe Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims, the simulated human characters, to age through six stages of life and incorporating a more powerful 3D graphics engine. As of July 2007, the base game has sold more than 13 million units worldwide, making it the 2nd best selling PC game of all time, only behind the original The Sims.
