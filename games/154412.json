Collect chunks of metal to grow yourself, leap into the water for an explosive jump, or barely graze past a whirring saw with just a sliver of body remaining. Coupling traditional platformer mechanics with these new interactions, Alkali brings a novel twist on a classical genre.\n\nThe game also contains a fully fledged level editor, where anyone can get creative and make interesting and fun levels for others to play. Using the same tools that were used to create the Alkali's campaign, you can explore fun gimmicks or create difficult masterpieces as you wish.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 51778, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "o0dxGJelDcA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0dxGJelDcA", "title": "Alkali Alpha Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o0dxGJelDcA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
