Two human players can compete head to head, or a computer can control the second player, as the kids race dirt bikes through increasingly difficult obstacle courses whilst collecting power-ups. The dirt bikes can jump and lean and the player needs to take advantage of the bike's abilities in order to avoid being thrown clear.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stunt-kids"}
