He informs them that he has discovered that a weapon of great power is being held by the Empire on a base on Mustafar. He cannot personally go in search of it because his position has been compromised, so he sends the four guests \u2014 taking on the role of Rebel operatives \u2014 in his place.\n\nGuests then enter an Imperial transport, joined by K-2SO and the ship's pilot, Athex. The team proceeds to Mustafar through hyperspace. The Imperial base is not happy to learn of the ship's arrival, and demands the ship land for inspection.\n\nAfter infiltrating the base with the aid of a hover platform, the four Rebels find a rack of blasters, only to have their presence detected. After escaping the facility, the Rebels are trapped outside, where they have to contend with attacking Stormtroopers and hostile beasts from the planet's surface.\n\nEventually they're able to find their way back into the facility, and discover the weapon mentioned by Captain Andor: an ancient lightsaber of unknown origin. The Rebels are then ambushed by even more Imperial troops, but thanks to some quick action taken by K-2SO they are able to escape with their lives, and make the jump to hyperspace.", "summary": "Under the orders of the budding rebellion, your team will travel to the molten planet of Mustafar. Your mission is to recover Imperial intelligence vital to the rebellion\u2019s survival. Alongside the pragmatic droid K-2S0, your team must navigate through an enemy facility walking into danger at every turn. Disguised as stormtroopers, grab your blaster, solve puzzles, and fight giant lava monsters in an effort to fulfill your team\u2019s orders.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 37339, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xbrIJdu6Gn0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbrIJdu6Gn0", "title": "Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire - ILMxLAB and The VOID - Immersive Entertainment Experience", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xbrIJdu6Gn0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
