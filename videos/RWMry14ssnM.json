The player takes on the role of a new recruit to the futuristic firefighting organization of the title, and must explore locations where various emergencies have taken place, extinguishing fires and rescuing survivors.\r\nThe game is set in a futuristic society in which fire is one of the few major hazards remaining. The Burning Rangers are an elite group of firefighters who have been formed to help cope with such emergencies. The core members of the team are Chris Parton, Big Landman and Reed Phoenix; as well as two new recruits, Shou Amabane and a woman called Tillis. The latter two are the only characters playable initially, although the others may be unlocked through the use of a password feature. Other major characters within the game include Iria Klein and Neal Belmondo, and there are many cameo appearances from Sonic Team staff including Yuji Naka and Naoto \u014cshima.\r\nThe game is notable for its random level generation system, which is unlocked after completing the game once. This makes the game ideal for replayability. To help the player find their way around these unfamiliar stages, a navigation system was included - at any time, the player may radio back to Chris, who will provide helpful information about nearby hazards and objectives. In a technical sense, Burning Rangers is also notable as one of the few Saturn games to have transparency effects (the fire effects). The Saturn did have hardware support for transparency, but it was limited to 2D objects and was overly CPU intensive. Given the complex multi-cpu architecture of the console, true transparency was rarely used in commercial games, Burning Rangers being one of the few that used it.[citation needed]\r\nReleased in early 1998 to mixed reviews and a dwindling number of Saturn owners, to date the title has not received a sequel. However, the game has been referenced numerous times in many other games made by Sonic Team including Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Universe.\r\nThe game's characters were designed by Hiroyuki Ochi. Sonic Team have stated in interviews that they intended the silhouette of a Burning Ranger wearing their \"Burneer Unit\" jet-pack to resemble that of an angel.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RWMry14ssnM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RWMry14ssnM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RWMry14ssnM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RWMry14ssnM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RWMry14ssnM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Burning Rangers Intro (Sega Saturn)", "description": "This game still needs a remake - it was awesome in its day. enjoy.\r\n\r\nBurning Rangers is a video game developed by Sonic Team for the Sega Saturn.
