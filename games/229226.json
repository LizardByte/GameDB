To make progress through the dungeon and reach the next dungeon levels, the player has to find keys to unlock doors and find buttons which opens up formerly inaccessible sections. Typical fantasy monsters roam the dungeon, often blocking your path. Killing them gives XP, which is needed to further improve your characters attack and defense values.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dungeon-crawl"}
