In a top-secret lab, brilliant scientists (aka players) are working hard to destroy the HEB - huge and incredibly evil bacteria infecting everything it comes into contact with and threatening the world\u2019s existence.\nThe objective of GravityLine is to lead a very dangerous bacteria through an infected object without bursting its bubble, and to destroy it once and for all in a special chemical mixture. If you burst the bubble, the bacteria (or as we call it - HEB - Huge Evil Bacteria) will spread and your mission will fail! HEB is very vicious, and extracting it from the infected objects can be really tricky - we hope, for the sake of the world, that you'll be able to complete this mission. If not - HEB will spread and all hope is lost! Good luck!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gravity-line"}
