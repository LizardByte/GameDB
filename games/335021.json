A group of rebellious pixels has scattered the world's colors, causing imbalance and disruption. Pixel54's mission is to recover these colors to restore order and bring stability back to his universe. Along the way, he will face traps, solve puzzles, and overcome various enemies, all of which challenge his skills in a series of demanding encounters.", "summary": "Pixel54 is a 2D platformer game that will take the player into a pixelated world full of adventures and challenges made of jumps and fights to overcome every enemy and obstacle. The game is based on 30 sequential levels (10 \"worlds\" of 3 levels each) and two different possible endings. In the game you have to collect all the ten colors (starting with a simple white you should reach red, green, blu, etc...) avoiding enemies, overtaking enigmas and fighting bosses. Collecting colors is mandatory to reach the next levels and to use some active elements inside the worlds (the player can switch between the colours so that the character will be able to use the element of that same color). The player is required to avoid traps and to be able to move around a world where everything may do harm or result in a game over. There's a shop system where you can buy powerups after having collect enough in-game coins. There are 5 levels of difficulty (from very easy to impossible), two languages (italian and english), an extra item you can buy in the shop after completing the game, original musics (made by the developer) and 3D prerendered sprites. A cheats system is provided. You can purchase the official guide (but it's italian only) to master the game and to learn the codes for the cheat system. A Windows computer is required in order to play but someone managed to run it on Linux. RTX20xx with at least 3 GB VRAM is reccomanded. You can download the game for free: it has been released on itch.io and no payment is required (you can donate though naming your own price).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pixel54", "videos": [{"id": 142734, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "kpaY-9zBI5E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpaY-9zBI5E", "title": "Pixel54 Gameplay Mondo Bianco (White World) FULL!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kpaY-9zBI5E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
