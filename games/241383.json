Give it a try on SA-Sonic and be surprised! (NOTE: Bind \"Center Camera\" to a comfortable button, you might prefer it over manual camera turning!)\n- A fleshed out super form, custom NiGHTS moveset, many easter eggs, and deep-rooted mechanics hardcore fans will instantly recognize!\n- A custom Adventure menu for cosmetical and accessibility options!\nAfter around a year of work, Adventure Sonic (AKA SA-Sonic!) is complete! SA-Sonic heavily alters the game's physics to resemble Adventure 1 and 2's, whilst scaling everything to still feel good within an SRB2 context.\n\nSonic has more turning control and air resistance like in Adventure, and much stronger interactions with slopes! SRB2 normally encourages you to stay airborne to keep your speed and zoom over obstacles, but SA Sonic is instead at his fastest on the ground!\n\nAdventure Sonic supports all control styles! (strafe, standard, & simple) Normally SRB2 prioritizes keyboard+mouse, with controllers being a massive self-induced handicap. But SA-Sonic was designed with a controller-play in mind, as that's what comes to mind for us when we think \"3D Sonic platformer\". The primary goal was to make Adventure Sonic control naturally for both casual players and SRB2 physics loyalists both. Here's hoping we achieved that goal!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-robo-blast-2-adventure-sonic", "videos": [{"id": 107495, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "61S61gF3ez4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61S61gF3ez4", "title": "Sonic Adventure 2: SRB2 Edition - Sonic Robo Blast 2 Mod Showcase", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/61S61gF3ez4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
