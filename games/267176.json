Billions of planets, creatures, plants. All came from the Dawnshards.\u201d\n\nIn the universe, six Worlds have discovered the existence of the Dawnshards:\n- Court of the 7 Vessels\n- Army of Darkness\n- Golden Wings Order\n- Ancestral Lodge\n- Progeny Beyond Time\n- Lost Eden\nThese Worlds are now fighting each other to get them, as they wield the power of creation. Each World seeks this power for a specific purpose, hidden to the other Worlds.", "summary": "Dawnshard is a multiplayer fantasy card game for pc and mobile devices.
