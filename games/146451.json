Iason must single-handedly eliminate them and save his homeland.", "summary": "Argo is a role-playing game set in a pseudo-3D continuous world. The player explores the environments from a first-person view. It is possible to try to talk to any encountered character, as well as attack anyone. Most battles take place within the exploration area and involve a fairly simple turn-based exchange of attacks. However, occasional fights against larger monsters take place on a separate screen, have an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective, and require the player to move and attack in real time. Experience points and gold are awarded for defeating enemies. It is necessary to feed the protagonist; when his condition is \"hungry\" food also restores a portion of his hit points.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/argo--1"}
