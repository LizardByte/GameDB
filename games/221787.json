Now they live again, forced to hunt down specters just to keep their new bodies charged with the energy now fueling their second chance at life. Any joy they may have had at living again is soon stifled by the dispassionate employer that treats them as disposable combatants with no concern for the unnatural libido and arousal caused by their new bodies' reaction to stressors.\nCan these ordinary people estranged from violence cope with the murder they must now inflict to survive and endure the flames of lust now burning within? Will they ever truly return to their normal lives, or will their return remain a superficial farce?", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-days--1"}
