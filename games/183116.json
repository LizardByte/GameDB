But what was once scarce then came in overwhelming abundance. The unbearable heat of the drought melted the glaciers of Valkenheim and as a result, the water levels rose dangerously. Torrential rains and violent winds fell upon Heathmoor, with no end to the storm in sight.\n\nThe tempest had a devastating effect on the landscape, with flooding and landslides becoming the new norm, and both Horkos and Chimera fought to survive the sudden climate change. With the home they once knew overrun with water, warriors found themselves out of their element. All except the Vikings, for whom the storm had brought about rebirth\u2026 and an opportunity to reign supreme.", "summary": "Year of the Covenants: Season 3, named \"Tempest,\" is the nineteenth season of the ongoing Faction War. Warriors prayed for an answer for their parched throats during the drought... and it was answered. But, the answer these warriors received from their gods was much more than simple rain, but a roaring storm, ready to wipe all who remained unprepared.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 60654, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "u8QTgUv9zf4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8QTgUv9zf4", "title": "Y5S3 TEMPEST Launch Trailer | FOR HONOR", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u8QTgUv9zf4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 60655, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VyyiS45x2BY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyyiS45x2BY", "title": "For Honor x Dead By Daylight Crossover | Halloween 2021 Event", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VyyiS45x2BY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
