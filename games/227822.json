Gameplay is similar to the game Popils.\n\nThe story behind the game is that Leonardo won a ticket to travel on the Titanic's maiden voyage. There he met the girl of his dreams, Kate. However Kate was rich and Leonardo was poor and worse, a thief. Their love was forbidden.\n\nThe game consists of a series of fifty puzzles in which the objective is to get Kate & Leonardo to meet. Kate is usually on top of a parapet or trapped behind a wall shouting 'Help' and the player must guide Leonardo to her. To solve these puzzles Leonardo can climb ladders and, with his mighty fist, he can smash bricks. Smashed bricks disappear and the bricks above them will fall down to take their place. Some bricks are hollow and cannot be smashed, others will explode.\n\nThe game also features teleports, which the manual assures were a common feature on the original Titanic, enemies to deal with, and two lengthy platform sequences where Leonardo must traverse the length of the Titanic.\n\nPasswords are used to enable games to be restarted at later levels.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pussy-love-story-from-titanic"}
