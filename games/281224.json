When it is your turn, you are shown both a side-view of the lane as well as a view of the pins. The controls allow you to position yourself across the lane, then when ready, to step towards the foul line and release the ball towards your targets. On release, you may choose to hook the ball to the left or right. Stepping across the foul line results in a zero score for that throw. Otherwise, you will see the ball travel up the lane, and then switch to an \"expanded view\" of the pins as the ball arrives. Pins are reset after each strike, and if there are no pins standing after the second throw, you are awarded a bonus throw, allowing up to 30 points per frame for a total of 10 frames. There are both one and two player game options.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-bowling", "videos": [{"id": 111695, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZksLkZXswJQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZksLkZXswJQ", "title": "3D Bowling (Emerson Arcadia 2001)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZksLkZXswJQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
