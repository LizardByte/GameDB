In this game, players have the option to control characters such as Wolverine, Colossus, Iceman, or Nightcrawler as they navigate through twenty-five stages in a traditional side-scrolling beat-'em-up format. The objective is typically to locate the exit within each level, which can involve scrolling from left to right, top to bottom, or navigating labyrinth-like designs. Enemies are defeated using various punches, and each character differs in their attack range and damage output. Additionally, each character possesses a unique special attack and individual abilities. For instance, Colossus can smash specific materials, and Wolverine gradually regenerates health over time.\n\nInitially starting as Wolverine, players later gain the ability to switch between characters at any point in the game. Each X-Man also has a power bar, replenished by collecting blue symbols, which can be utilized to temporarily increase the damage dealt during gameplay.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-the-official-game--1"}
