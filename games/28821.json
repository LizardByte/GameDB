Online multiplayer, extra long storyline, special ops, many unique weapons.\n\nNew York City has become the epicenter of the world's most terrifying zombie outbreak. What's needed is a hero with the grit and skill to take on the undead and find out who or what catalyzed this cataclysmic event. Start the story with one of five unique characters that are elite members of the task force called in to do the dirty work on the streets of the Big Apple, known simply as the Wolfpack. As part of a private military organization designed to find, track, and eliminate any and all threat, you will dig deeper into the streets, subways, sewers, and back alleys of New York. In so doing, you'll uncover a plot more heinous and nefarious than anyone expected. Good thing you're packing a lot of firepower.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/unkilled", "videos": [{"id": 13801, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "EFoTkiE5brw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFoTkiE5brw", "title": "UNKILLED launch trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EFoTkiE5brw/sddefault.jpg"}]}
