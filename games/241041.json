Try a wide variety of combinations and raise them to be the strongest dragon.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/g-mode-archives-44-dragon-x-dragon", "videos": [{"id": 109529, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "h2UyoPlxEAM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2UyoPlxEAM", "title": "G-MODE\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u30b944 DRAGON\u00d7DRAGON\u3000\u7d39\u4ecb\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h2UyoPlxEAM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
