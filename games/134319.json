James suspects that the events of the 2000 Goldman case have not ended. A sudden earthquake rocks the room, collapsing the basement walls and trapping the agents.\n\nSeveral days later, while awaiting backup, James' PDA goes off; hordes of creatures appear on the security cameras. James and Kate arm themselves and escape. In a classified information room, they uncover a plot to fire nuclear missiles worldwide within 24 hours' time.", "summary": "The House of the Dead 4 Special is a two-player attraction based on The House of the Dead 4. The game makes use of two 100-inch screens, one in front of the players and another behind, as well as a five-speaker sound system, giving the impression that enemies are attacking from all directions. The seat shakes when zombies attack, and players are blasted with air whenever they take damage. The seat automatically rotates to face the players towards whichever screen zombies are attacking from. The game also features a new addition of a life bar. As the players are hit the life bar diminishes. If the life bar is reduced to zero the game is over. There are no continues. The PlayStation 3 port of The House of the Dead 4 Special is unlocked by completing The House of the Dead 4 for the first time. However, it uses lives rather than the life bar and allow players to continue.\n\nThis game features a side story in The House of the Dead plotline, taking place shortly after The House of the Dead 4, with Kate Green teaming up with Agent \"G\" to destroy the zombie infestation at its source, leading them to confront the Magician, a boss character who returns after having been obliterated in the first two installments. This game only features two bosses, Justice (Type 0053) and The Magician (Type 0), whom \"G\" and Kate encounter in a room of a building (which \"G\" believes it to be the source of the zombie infestation, and the building's interior is similar to the EFI research facility in The House of the Dead III). In the end, players have to blast a button with a grenade.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-house-of-the-dead-4-special", "videos": [{"id": 36644, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KjHJ6DF_jzs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjHJ6DF_jzs", "title": "The House Of The Dead 4 (Special): Full Playthrough HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KjHJ6DF_jzs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
