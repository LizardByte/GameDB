Hero is an Indie game released in 2004, made by Daniel Remar. Hero strives to recreate the feeling of old action exploration games - you get no map of the game worlds, so you may have to draw your own. It has six levels, eight different MIDI songs, and some bonus features after you beat the game, including an extra difficult level. The game is rather short, but older people may find that it gives them that familiar retro feel.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
