Analogue players can pick up where their finished save files left off, and new players can start fresh in Hate Plus.\n\nA dark visual novel about transhumanism, cosplay, cake-baking, and the slow patriarchal erosion of freedoms taken for granted.The story so far...\nI can't believe it! My mission was supposed to be routine data recovery on an old derelict generation ship, but instead, I ended up rescuing an adorable AI girl who grew up in a tremendously patriarchal Neo-Confucian society? And now she's discovered a bunch of messages left by the mysterious Old *Mute... and wants me to uncover with her the slow enactment of a regressive political program that caused her society to regress to Joseon Dynasty social mores?!\n\nI wasn't expecting this at all! I thought the three day trip back to Earth would be peaceful and lonely and not at all filled with reading about tragedy!\n\nAnd so began my hateful days...", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "videos": [{"id": 14121, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KAgT6lGwTiY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAgT6lGwTiY", "title": "Hate Plus trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KAgT6lGwTiY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
