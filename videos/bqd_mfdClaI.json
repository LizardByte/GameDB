Fans flock from all four corners of the globe to watch robots duke it out.  Competitors rent a bot and send it against a series of other bots.  If their bot falls, they lose.  But if their bot wins, then the competitors will gain fame and glory (and maybe even a sponsorship) beyond their wildest dreams!  You are the latest competitor to challenge the arena.  You are randomly assigned a rental bot and head to your post.  Maybe you\u2019ll become the newest champion of the arena.  Maybe you\u2019ll fail miserably.  Maybe you\u2019re just here to listen to the goofy robot voices.  And maybe you\u2019ll get a new friend out of the deal.  Who knows!\n\nGet your bot and go forth!\n\n    \u2022 Turn-based interactive fiction singleplayer battle royale.  Try saying THAT three times fast!\n    \u2022 Customize your robots\u2019 movesets!\n    \u2022 Fully voice-acted robots!\n    \u2022 Fight your way through five encounters!\n    \u2022 Come out on top...or get sent to the junkyard!\n    \u2022 Featuring photography from Unsplash.com\n    \u2022 Featuring sound effects from Zapsplat.com\n    \u2022 Featuring voice acting from text2speech.org\n    \u2022 Featuring music by Alexander Nakarada\n\nNOTE: this game was made for a 48-hour game jam.
