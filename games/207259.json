It is here that Tasuku trains, expecting the next rise to come generations later, but now as signs of the Dark Reign are uncovered with their nation still unprepared, Tasuku finds himself thrust into a battle that will determine the fate of the world.\n\nCan two people find hope for the future with an outlook so bleak? Is it possible for friendship to turn into intimacy on the eve of humanity's destruction? Can love save the world?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 71398, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "go56n6eUjEI"}]}
