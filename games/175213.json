It includes offline solo (vs. AI) or group play, a tutorial, and online async multiplayer through GameCenter.\nFealty is a tactical territory control game in which each player controls an identical set of units. These units are placed across the map, turn by turn, and at the end of the game they each claim area. Each piece claims a different type and amount of area, and some have special bonus abilities that happen when they are placed.
