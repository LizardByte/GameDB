It shares many elements with the PC game of the same name, but that version has an isometric-style map and a full 3D view for the fishing sequences. Just like the original game it is a fishing simulator that allows the player to access a free fishing mode or to participate in a fishing tournament. First, equipment needs to be bought. It consists of lures, rods, reels, lines and boats. Better items can only be acquired by winning money in tournaments."}
