She does this by throwing rainbow stars at them, and must use this ability to pass through walls in order to reach the exit door of each stage. Green walls can be shot through, while purple walls are solid and will block Maho-chan's exchange stars. There are a total of 50 stages, most of which have a very strict time limit, but the player can choose any stage to start or continue from.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/irekae-maho-chan", "videos": [{"id": 94021, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CLlZx1ivK1M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLlZx1ivK1M", "title": "[XNA] \u3044\u308c\u304b\u3048\u307e\u307b\u3061\u3083\u309320100614.wmv", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CLlZx1ivK1M/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
