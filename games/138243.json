You have been saved by a mysterious group of people and they helped teach you how to survive in this new reality. Though it was tough, they taught you how to fight, craft necessary items, and survive out in the wild.\n\nBut you should never underestimate a zombie horde. They broke into your home, and though you fought tirelessly, it was hopeless from the start. Now, you are alone once again.\n\nBut at least you are alive, and with all the knowledge that you have, you can start anew once again. Use your skills to craft tools for both survival and defense, get your own farm going, and go out to scavenge and save lives. Zombies will come for you eventually - all you can do is prepare yourself and your home, so be sure to have your defenses ready and your machine gun turrets fully armed. The zombie apocalypse is a tough thing to overcome even if it happens in a cute pixelated universe, but don\u2019t lose hope just yet! With dozens of crafting options, you can turn your home into an indestructible fortress, set up your own food production systems, and venture out into the zombie infested wilderness to gather valuable loot and survival gear, and save as many people as possible.", "summary": "The zombie apocalypse is a tough situation to overcome, even if it takes place in a cute pixelated universe!
