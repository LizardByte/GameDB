This is the official reveal trailer for our multiplayer co-op game, currently in early access and alpha stages. Developed by a solo indie developer, InoLab Trials is still heavily under development, with exciting new content planned.\n\nIn InoLab Trials, you and your friends take on a series of unique trials, each offering different gameplay mechanics and challenges. While the game is designed to feature multiple trials, the current alpha version includes two: Rise Up, a challenging platformer trial, and Maze Shift, a cooperative maze-solving experience.\n\nAs we continue to develop the game, your feedback and support mean the world to us! Add InoLab Trials to your Steam wishlist to stay updated on new releases, improvements, and additional trials.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Steam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205320/InoLab_Trials/\n\ud83d\udd17 Discord channel: https://discord.gg/MB2Ee8f2Hs\n\n\nBG Music: Superhero Trailer - Arct Sound - https://pixabay.com/users/arctsound-27113883/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oJt3gVzGo-A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oJt3gVzGo-A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oJt3gVzGo-A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oJt3gVzGo-A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oJt3gVzGo-A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "InoLab Trials \u2013 Official Reveal Trailer", "description": "\ud83d\udd17 Steam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205320/InoLab_Trials/\n\ud83d\udd17 Discord channel: https://discord.gg/MB2Ee8f2Hs\n\nWelcome to InoLab Trials!
