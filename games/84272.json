Patrons order specific, colored potions that must be prepared and served in sequence as they are requested.

Using the mouse, the player will click to seat the patrons, prepare potions, pick them up, serve them to customers, and collect magical orbs left behind by patrons as payment. Along the way, using the magical orbs as currency, Daphne will restore the Inn, gaining various ways to cope with the increasing demand, as well as dealing with hazards such as dragons stealing potions before they can be served to patrons.", "summary": "Playing as Daphne, the unfortunate hostess ensnared by the enchanted Mystic Inn, you serve all of the patrons in order to get magic to upgrade the inn.
