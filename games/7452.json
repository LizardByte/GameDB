This sequel continued on the \"eat the dots/avoid the ghosts\" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.\n\nLike her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ms-pac-man", "videos": [{"id": 23953, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "c4n_6NFYvLY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4n_6NFYvLY", "title": "Ms. Pac-Man (1982) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c4n_6NFYvLY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
