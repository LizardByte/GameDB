It's a modified version of PvZ2 with the main selling point of fast-paced actions. In fact, if we were to consider the original game as well, then this would be what PvZ Brutal is to the main game. And this is a forewarning response: Zombie in this mod spawns at a excruciatingly alarming rate, more than enough to overwhelm you.\n\nOther than just the action, mechanics have been removed, tweaked or even reworked to serve various purposes. Plant Food as well as level-up system for plants are no longer in the game, leaving any subsequent mechanics associated with such to behave differently. All upgrades, plants and sprouts are purchasable with in-game currency, eliminating the predatory microtransaction tactic.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/plants-vs-zombies-2-into-the-storm", "videos": [{"id": 99949, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "a_192gA3SJ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_192gA3SJ0", "title": "Into the Storm Announcement", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a_192gA3SJ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
