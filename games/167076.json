He wakes up after a crash landing in an unknown location and is told by a being known as Hama that he must travel through nine worlds created by various human emotions known as the Emotion Worlds and defeat the Emotion Holders of the worlds to gain their emotions for himself. The game focuses on dungeon crawling, puzzle solving, and turn based combat. Experience comfortable yet unsettling surreal visuals and meet strange or completely normal characters.\n\nAlmari is equipped with a writing utensil and various kinds of stationery to write words that will be used as his attacks. However, Almari does not learn these attacks by leveling up, and instead must find them throughout the Emotion Worlds.", "summary": "Almari is a black comedy surreal horror JRPG inspired by Yume Nikki, OFF, Mother/EarthBound, Undertale, the Legend of Zelda series, and the Shin Megami Tensei series.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/almari", "videos": [{"id": 54415, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lX4nXm3yfJs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX4nXm3yfJs", "title": "Almari Trailer (Extended version)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lX4nXm3yfJs/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 124720, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Oy0OBwvKwFg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy0OBwvKwFg", "title": "Almari Trailer (Mother Direct 2021)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oy0OBwvKwFg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
