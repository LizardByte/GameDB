Be faster than a blink of the Eye!\n\nZero Reflex has 20 levels which differ in both design and mechanics. Each of the 20 levels changes its speed and amount of danger for the player depending weather played in Normal, Hard or Nightmare Mode. Try to survive for as long as possible by moving the pilot to avoid everything flying around you. Each level lasts for 30 seconds.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 6530, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "t_ATNC4MIvM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ATNC4MIvM", "title": "Zero Reflex - Launch trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t_ATNC4MIvM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
