You follow the crew of the Pegasus Kai class ship Il Nido as they clash with a force of Neo-Zeon remnants commanded by a hawkish Haman Karn loyalist named Gerald Sinclair.\n\nSinclair\u2019s mission is to hunt down the representative of a moderate Neo-Zeon faction that seeks to make peace with the Federation: the late Karn\u2019s own younger sister, Serrana Karn.
