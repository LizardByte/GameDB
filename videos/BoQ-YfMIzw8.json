Back in 2011 a friend of mine passed away, his name was Kyle Carter, the only reason why I'm talking about him right now, is cause I recently got something from him. Today Is my birthday and as I usually do, I check my mail-box in case anyone sends a gift, such as my parente Who live fare from me. I found a kind of gift box that was sent by him. At first I thought that it was just a prank, but no one here knows about what happened to him, I mean I moved away from my country after the accident. Wanna know what happened? Well, I don't really know what happened, I kinda find it hard to talk about. I was going back home while I saw the door of Kyle's house open. I tried searching for him since I had to give him back some stuff he gave me for work. I went into the living room and what I found was... terrifying. He was laying on the floor, dismembered. I had to move away from my own country, that accident destroyed my reputation, I got fired from my dream job at SEGA. Even if the judge knew that I was innocent, everyone thought that I was the murderer. Now, back to that something that I found in my letterbox. There was my old SEGA Genesis and a cartridge called \"Memories from the past\".I still haven't played it, I just finished mounting that cartridge, oh wait, it is loading, I didn't think that that would've worked, wait, is this a Sonic Th\u0334\u0343\u031a\u030b\u0310\u034b\u030a\u0302\u030f\u0342\u034c\u034e\u032d\u032b\u032c\u0359\u0349\u035c\u031d\u0355e\u0337\u0344\u030d\u030b\u031a\u0306\u0304\u0313\u033f\u0315\u0339\u035c\u034d\u0329\u033a\u0319\u0317\u0354\u033c\u0320 \u0337\u0303\u0312\u030e\u0356\u034dH\u0337\u0302\u034c\u032b\u0331e\u0338\u035d\u034c\u0302\u0312\u0305\u0305\u0359\u0321\u0332\u032f\u0318\u0325\u0345d\u0338\u0308\u0304\u0309\u0304\u0326\u034e\u032ag\u0335\u035b\u0301\u0342\u0306\u0311\u035d\u0352\u034e\u032a\u0320\u0359\u0320\u031c\u032b\u0318\u0320\u031de\u0338\u0351\u031a\u034b\u033d\u0308\u034a\u0306\u0309\u0345\u0332\u034e\u034e\u035a\u0320\u0325\u0345\u034e\u0320h\u0338\u0313\u0341\u035a\u032fo\u0334\u035b\u0300\u035b\u031a\u030c\u031e\u0327\u0321\u0319g\u0337\u0360\u0316\u0329 \u0337\u0315\u031e\n\nGame: https://gamejolt.com/games/TDW/895172", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BoQ-YfMIzw8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BoQ-YfMIzw8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BoQ-YfMIzw8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic.EXE Re-Take (The Devil Within)", "description": "This game was made by the same person that made Afflicted.ME\n\nHello guys, my name is Tom Lewis.
