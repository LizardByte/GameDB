The game seemed like a major turning point in the series. Rather than focusing on realistic battles, the game introduces four comical characters who are out on a crusade to kill as many Nazis as possible during World War II with whatever weapons they can get their hands on.\nIn August 2012, it was announced that the game would no longer bear the Brothers in Arms name and become its own IP. Randy Pitchford has gone on record to say that he never wanted this game to be a Brothers in Arms game but got pushed by Ubisoft to attach it to a recognizable brand. They agreed to let the public decide by showing it at E3 2011 and the reactions clearly indicated that press and fans did not feel Furious 4 should be a Brothers in Arms title. Furious 4 was then to be re-revealed at Gearbox Software's Community Day on September 25, 2012.\nIn 2015, Randy Pitchford said in an interview that Furious 4 \"is not a thing anymore,\" and that elements of it has been turned into what is now Battleborn."}
