Strangely this one is voiced in English but all text parts are in Japanese.\n\n This game starts off ok, but soon becomes very repetitive (as do most rpg games HA!). In this game you attack planets/sectors and gain completion percentage each time you complete an area. The levels are quite short but soon become deadly later on. You also gain weapon xp for each kill you make on the three weapon types. In order to replenish your shield you need to win rounds so it makes sense to do the easy levels so that you can gain more shield than you lose. The problem being that you lose completion percentage as your fleet falls back :S\n\n I have completed the game on both normal and expert modes, although I will only submit Expert as Normal took longer as you earn less xp I think in that mode. I Start off trying to show all the planets and killing the boss ships, or at least the ones it would let me kill as I think I was progressing to fast as the game expects you to level up on the easier levels. It doesn't take too long to show all the levels and unlock all the logs and its at this point the game comes to a stand still. for 2 hours or so I am stuck in a repetitive loop of playing levels over and over again to level up my weapons and shield before the completion percentage start to move up again. Once it does start moving again, it does not take long to complete the game.\n\n Apart from a screen full of enemy projectiles to avoid in Expert mode, the other major difference is that the camera will move annoyingly while you fight. The annoying aspect of this is your movement doesn't turn with the camera so it really ends up screwing around with your controls making it difficult to manoeuvre where you want. On my Normal run, I was able to easily level up my rocket weapon which does mega damage and makes quick work of the bosses. On Expert with all the projectiles flying around, it is impossible to get up close with the rockets so I mostly levelled up the basic shot/spread weapon.\n\n From around 1h30mins all bosses have been defeated and log entries played, there is not much else to see. from this point on my progress percentage gets stuck for a while as I upgrade weapons. once completion has reached 100% I fight on the last planet one more time to unlock the ending.\n\n Finally, this game comes on 2cds. Its one of the few games that allow 2 player co-op via 2 connected playstation's and although I have not tested it, the 2nd disk seems to have more data on it, so maybe there are some 2 player specific cut scenes in that mode. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grAE4Y8jF5M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grAE4Y8jF5M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grAE4Y8jF5M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grAE4Y8jF5M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [319] Meta-Ph-List Gamma X 2097", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: MadMatty\n\nJapanese Shootemup with rpg elements.
