Teleport to a chosen location and be the last one standing to clear your sentence. Keep an eye on your oxygen meter and use the tools at your disposal, but most of all, stay away from the curse.\n\nCurse:\nIf you receive the curse, your goal is to get rid of it before it consumes your soul. You are now the hunter and must catch one of your fellow prisoners. Lie and confuse others to approach them, or go for the chase and outrun your victim. The curse has given you otherworldly abilities that let you leap far in the air, see others through walls and hear their heartbeats. Use those to your advantage and don't stay cursed for too long.\n\nGhouls:\nDeath isn't the end. The curse has now consumed your soul and you can now take on the forms of different ghouls to torment the remaining prisoners. Crawl, fly or run, different ghouls will give you different ways to traverse the environment and attack the prisoners. Figure out each ghoul's best strategies and work with the cursed prisoner to spread as much chaos as possible.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/forecursed", "videos": [{"id": 132644, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "ftA5iN0EtZg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftA5iN0EtZg", "title": "Forecursed Official Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ftA5iN0EtZg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
