There are eight playable characters (including unlockable characters), with either one or two representing each anime (for example Doremi and Aiko from \"Ojamajo Doremi\" and Potpourri from \"Fushigi Mahou Fan Fan Pharmacy\" are playable characters). \n\nMagical Chaser serves as a sequel to DAKKEN's previous \"Magical Heroines PLUS\", forgoing a larger cast of playable characters in favor of a more recent game engine (2D Fighter Maker 2nd, in comparison to Magical Heroines PLUS' 2D Fighter Maker 95), better graphics, and also more game modes. These game modes (which include a Survival game mode, where you try to defeat an endless amount of opponents), as well as unlocking final boss character Bibin (she is locked behind a password only shown once Story Mode is cleared) and an update to the base game could be applied via patches provided in the game's files.\n\nSince this playthrough has already unlocked Bibin, this password screen is not shown here - the password needed to unlock Bibin is \"punimoe\", which must be typed first before applying the unlock patch .exe.\n\nhttps://doujinstyle.com/?p=page&type=2&id=748", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BgSZeOXmrqw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BgSZeOXmrqw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BgSZeOXmrqw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BgSZeOXmrqw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Magical Chaser ~Stardust of Dreams~ Story Mode (Doremi)", "description": "\"mahou shoujou fighting game\"\n\nCreated by doujin circle DAKKEN, \"Magical Chaser ~Stardust of Dreams~\" features characters from five different (relatively obscure) majokko (read: \"little witch\", an archetype of the magical girl genre) animes.
