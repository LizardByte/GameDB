{"id": "kg_hEY_hy9U", "snippet": {"title": "Sundog : Frozen Legacy - Atari ST (1985)", "description": "\"SunDog: Frozen Legacy\" is a space trading and combat simulator video game developed by FTL and released for the Atari ST in December 1985.\n\n00:00 Title Screen\n00:30 Creating character\n02:00 In the ship\n02:55 Exploring the city \"Drahew\"\n09:15 Travel with the Cargo on the planet\n12:23 Exploring the city \"Darvilton\"\n15:00 Into space\n19:50 Land on the planet \"Hell\"\n20:20 Exploring the city \"Sheol\"\n\nThe game begins with the player assuming the part of Zed, a young man who has been enslaved in the glass mines his entire life. His uncle, Brock Dor-Cede, died leaving Zed his ship, the SunDog. Zed has the chance to earn his freedom if he can fulfil his uncle's outstanding contract to start a colony for a religious order. With little to go on, the player begins on Jondd in the SunDog.\n\nThe player begins the game with a top-down view of a spaceship, a quick inspection of the ship finds many systems damaged and several destroyed components. A quick visit to the city's Commodity Exchange finds some goods belonging to the SunDog's captain (now Zed). Zed's bank account holds a few thousand credits (money). Zed's uncle made a contract with a colony to supply them with various goods throughout their settlement. With nothing else to go on, the player must find the colony and attempt to fulfil Zed's uncle's contract.\n\nThe cities in SunDog vary in size, though all appear to be neatly laid out. They contain ship parts shops, hotels, gun shops, restaurants/bars and banks. If the player wanders about on foot for long, they'll eventually encounter others. Some are beggars, some are hawkers trying to sell him items, but most are thugs who'll attempt to mug him. If the player has taken appropriate precautions (and is a good shot), he can sometimes turn the tables on the hoodlums. With the use of bluffs or threats, sometimes he can avoid getting mugged without the use of a gun.\n\nThere is no set route the player must follow to win the game, but a typical route would have the player first finding the colony on Jondd, the planet the player starts on. The player can do this by taking the SunDog's cargo pod, which can be used like an all-terrain vehicle when detached from the ship. Exploring the continent, the player will eventually find the small colony. \n\nhttp://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-sundog-frozen-legacy_s10275.html\nhttps://www.atarilegend.com/games/games_detail.php?game_id=2843", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kg_hEY_hy9U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kg_hEY_hy9U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kg_hEY_hy9U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kg_hEY_hy9U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kg_hEY_hy9U/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sundog : Frozen Legacy - Atari ST (1985)", "description": "\"SunDog: Frozen Legacy\" is a space trading and combat simulator video game developed by FTL and released for the Atari ST in December 1985.\n\n00:00 Title Screen\n00:30 Creating character\n02:00 In the ship\n02:55 Exploring the city \"Drahew\"\n09:15 Travel with the Cargo on the planet\n12:23 Exploring the city \"Darvilton\"\n15:00 Into space\n19:50 Land on the planet \"Hell\"\n20:20 Exploring the city \"Sheol\"\n\nThe game begins with the player assuming the part of Zed, a young man who has been enslaved in the glass mines his entire life.
