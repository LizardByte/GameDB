Bootlegger: Moonshine Empire is a 150,000-word interactive novel by Drew Morrison. It\u2019s entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.\n\nUse your business acumen, political smarts, or vicious instincts to forge the path to glory. After landing in rural Pennsylvania, the onset of Prohibition means there\u2019s a massive market for white lightning, rotgut whiskey, and bathtub gin. As you try to forge a life for you and your sister, you\u2019ll build your bootlegging operation from a few friends in a barn to a massive distribution network, selling whiskey near and far in the hopes of securing either personal security, or national notoriety.\n\nProhibition won\u2019t last, and the bootlegging market will dry up when the 18th Amendment is repealed. Where will you stand, when liquor again flows freely? Will you be a celebrity of New York nightlife, a notorious politician, or a legendary gangster?", "summary": "Make your name as a whiskey-runner, a politician, or a gangster as you quench thirsts from rural Pennsylvania to the New York City nightlife!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bootlegger-moonshine-empire"}
