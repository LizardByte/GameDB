It's been two years since since the worldwide release of Kemono Tea, which turns the people who drink it into anthropomorphic animals. Society is still adjusting to the idea of real-life furries, but that doesn't mean you can skip your day-job.\n\nLeonardo Bianco is a barista at a struggling caf\u00e9. His boss feels like hopping on the furry train might be just the thing to attract customers to the floundering business. Via a connection at another local business (which some returning readers might recognize), Leo and his co-workers are offered a chance to try transforming themselves. The tea works as advertised, but for Leo, there's more changes he didn't anticipate.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/coffee-buns"}
