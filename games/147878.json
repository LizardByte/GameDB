Balls that hit your paddle will take away bricks similar to a Breakout game, so you have to try your best to avoid the ball. The last person standing wins. Play single-player against a machine learning opponent, locally with a friend, or online with other players. With 5 game modes, this game is perfect to fill in the passing time. How long can you last?\n\nEverything from the art to audio to feedback has been refined for a modern look and feel on a classic and popular game. Anti Pong comes with three difficulty settings for players that are looking for a more casual experience or a challenging match. And because Anti Pong was made for the newest features in mind, the game has options for a beautifully smooth dark mode and iPad support.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/anti-pong", "videos": [{"id": 49403, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3XFlGBDoOZc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XFlGBDoOZc", "title": "Anti Pong Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3XFlGBDoOZc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
