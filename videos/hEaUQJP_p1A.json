The game first went live on 9th October 2016 at 21.00 UTC.  The trailer went viral, amassing well over a million views, and after Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon beat the game, it was planned for release on Christmas Day.\n\nTwo days before launch, an Australian law firm acting on behalf of Nintendo sent a Cease & Desist order to Pok\u00e9mon Prism creator Koolboyman, and the official release was cancelled.\n\nThe trailer alone was around two months of hard work by myself, as well as additional footage captured by Deadinsky66, representing a game mod that had been in development for 8 years.\n\nThe source of Pok\u00e9mon Prism was subsequently leaked and its development was taken up by a new team of developers, who continue to provide updates and patches.\n\nTrailer by Kip, including footage captured by Deadinsky66.
