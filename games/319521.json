The goal of the game is to navigate the maze in each stage and pick up all of the fruit in the maze within ten minutes, without touching the walls.\n\nIt features omnidirectional smooth scrolling, which is not typical of MSX 1 games since hardware scrolling is not a feature of the TMS9918 video chip used in MSX 1 computers.\n\nThe scrolling is achieved by pre-generating multiple sets of patterns, one set for each vertical scroll offset modulo 8, and by setting the TMS9918 pattern base address correspondingly.\n\nThe game also has accurate roll-on/roll-off of sprites at all sides of the viewport, achieved by setting the EC bit on every sprite and by pre-generating copies of the sprite patterns with pixels masked out from the right.\n\nThere are twelve stages, the second set of six stages has narrower corridors.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fruit-mazes"}
