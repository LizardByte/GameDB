It uses sprite scaling to simulate a 3D playfield, meaning it predates Virtua Fighter as a 3D fighter by about a year (though the 3D in Virtua Fighter isn't simulated, but rather true rendered 3D graphics). You can play as either warriors or monsters, but otherwise this is a typical fighting game with a dedicated jump button (as Up moves back). Although the title screen reads \"1992\", the arcade game was first sold in early 1993.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-edge"}
