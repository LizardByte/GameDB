The heroes accompany Morbius to his lab, only to find the vampyres have stolen his research and a prototype \"sunlight serum\" capable of dampening his and the vampyres' lethal photosensitivity. After the trio fend off vampyres who came to kill Morbius and destroy his remaining equipment, Spider-Man offers Morbius sanctuary at the Abbey despite Blade and the Hunter's reluctance. Deducing the vampyres intend to mass-produce the sunlight serum, Spider-Man locates a Hydra facility under attack from vampyres led by Sin. He, Morbius, and the Hunter mobilize to stop them and recover the prototype serum, though they learn too late that she had already delivered several completed batches of sunlight serum to Dracula. Nonetheless, while fighting off Dracula and his empowered forces, the heroes discover the vampyres had diluted Morbius' sample while mass-producing it, weakening its effects. Defeated, Dracula escapes to the sewers.", "summary": "Marvel's Midnight Suns: The Hunger is the second DLC expansion for Marvel's Midnight Suns, released in January 2023.
