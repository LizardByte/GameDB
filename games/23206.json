Rather than following the safer way of the path, you may decide to climb the cliff instead... but such a decision will change your speed and your technique. Completing 5 different screens will take you to the top of the mountain, but beware of diving eagles, and hungry bears that hide in darkened caves.

The higher you climb, the colder you'll get. \nSo hurry... before you freeze!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spikes-peak"}
