During each level you must control your very own Tron style snake and try to outwit your opponent and box them in - you must try and surround them and force them to crash!\n\nUse the arrow keys to move your own snake and try to avoid hitting your own trail. Each match consists of 5 rounds and it is the first one to three rounds who wins. Don't forget to use your turbo boost if you need to suddenly dash by your opponent but remember to keep control! As you progress the levels become increasingly difficult and you must work hard to outplay your enemy!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fl-tron", "videos": [{"id": 107028, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Wg-aQAphoZc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg-aQAphoZc", "title": "FL Tron - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wg-aQAphoZc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
