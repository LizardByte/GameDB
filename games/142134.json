You felt that something extraordinary was going to happen to you. And so it was, in the mail was that letter, you who said that in those contests nothing was ever won, you had won a cruise to the famous KURBUZ archipelago. \n \nAnd that is where you were disembarked due to a riot. \n \nNow you are alone on an island, with the problem of food, the same problem that the vermin that inhabit it and that they hope to solve with you, obviously you do not agree, so trying to avoid them you will have to take that fruit that in KURBUZ they call them HANA-NAS and that you know as PI\u00d1A. Once all the PINEAPPLES have been collected and taking into account that some may appear where you have already passed and if you do not collect them you cannot go to the island, you must recover energy by entering the cabin. \n \nThe Island's protectors will take pity on you, allowing you to use the bridges and thus reach another Island where you can continue to feed yourself and ... The rest, you will find out.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ananas"}
