An evil force has laid to waste our guards and now pours through the portals without resistance.\n\nWe've brought you here as our last chance at stopping this evil. You're one of the select few that have used the portals before, to come here for a better life, but in our darkest hour we turn to you one last time, to go back and triumph where we failed.\n\nWith our guards and roads destroyed, getting back to the portals will not be easy, as this invasion has crippled our ability to send forces en masse to clear a path. You'll be forced down, through the sewers that run underground to the ruins, into the crypt where the portal to the future lies. You must make haste we don't have much time!", "summary": "Adventure To Fate: Quest To The Future - is an JRPG style dungeon crawler game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/adventure-to-fate-quest-to-the-future-jrpg"}
