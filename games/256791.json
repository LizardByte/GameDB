Choose a popper from a pan or domed popper to a microwave or hot air popper. Tilt to pour in the oil & kernels, shake the pan or open/close the microwave door, and watch the popcorn pop!\n\nAfter you\u2019ve made a big bowl of hot popcorn, you can add 50+ coatings, toppings, and mix-ins. Caramel corn, kettle corn, cheese corn, wasabi, peppermint, fruit candy coatings, it\u2019s all there! Then mix in chocolate chips, nuts, gummy bears, or other kinds of fun foods.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve seasoned your popcorn just right (even shaking the phone to mix up the kernels to coat better), you can eat it or share it via email or save to your photos.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all! You can also roll your popcorn into yummy popcorn balls, or make popcorn strings that you can use to decorate Christmas trees or wreaths, or even pick you own photo and give it the popcorn decorative touch.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/more-popcorn"}
