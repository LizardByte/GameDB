The PlayStation Portable version was later published outside Japan by Majesco. It is based on the board game Blokus and features characters from Steambot Chronicles (known in Japan as Bumpy Trot). Like in Steambot Chronicles, players are able to customize the appearance of their characters. Each player is given a pile of blocks that resemble Tetrads . Players must place blocks on the board starting at the corners and then extend it from the corners of the pieces they have placed. The game is over when no one can place any more pieces. The player with the fewest pieces remaining wins.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blokus-portable-steambot-championship"}
