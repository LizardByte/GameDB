In fact, this particular day is looking remarkably grim. Stormy clouds thunder across the sky, the rain hammers down, the electricity flickers and, to top it all, Grand Dizzy is in an awful mood.\n\nThe source of Grand Dizzy's bad mood is his egg-ache. The old duffer had been practicing his somersaults in the kitchen and slipped on the wet floor. \"What do you think you were doing bouncing around like that at your age?!\" groaned Dizzy under the strain of picking up the old egg.\n\n\"You'll give yourself a nasty crack on the head.\"\n\n\"It's the temple of the Crystal Kingdom,\" spluttered Grand Dizzy, \"it's been robbed. Every egg knows that if the Crystal Sword, Chalice and Crown are removed from the temple, terrible strange things will happen to the Yolkfolk!\"\n\nDizzy looked outside. Things did look decidedly bad. \"It still doesn't explain why you were jumping off the Kitchen chair, Grand Dizzy\" said Dizzy.\n\n\"Well, young fella-me-egg,\" said Grand Dizzy puffing himself up slightly, \"I'm sick and tired of you always sorting things out. I'm going to get into shape, pack my knapsack and save the Yolkfolk myself. I was really heroic in my day, y'know.\"\n\nA salty tear formed in Dizzy's eye. \"I don't know, Grand Dizzy, what are we going to do with you?\" gushed Dizzy in his best sympathetic, yet caring, voice. Grand Dizzy was packed off to bed. But the moment everyone's back was turned, he jumped up and continued to whinge loudly at anything he could find that would listen.\n\nDizzy decided that he must begin his trek to retrieve the Yolkfolk's treasure. He packed his knapsack and popped on his new safari hat. Dizzy grimaced and, through gritted teeth, dramatically declared \"Don't fear, Grand Dizzy! The lost treasures of the Yolkfolk will soon be found!\". And so Dizzy began a whole new adventure - can our hero succeed\nagain??", "summary": "Crystal Kingdom Dizzy is an adventure video game featuring the character Dizzy released in December 1992 by Codemasters. The Oliver Twins who were heavily involved in the design and programming of previous Dizzy games had less involvement with this one.\nThe game is the last title to date in the core Dizzy series.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crystal-kingdom-dizzy", "collections": [{"id": 1594, "name": "Dizzy"}]}
