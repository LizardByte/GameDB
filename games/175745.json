This allows for a unique user experience - a game you can play with your face. In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device's camera. This access can be toggled on or off at any time in your device's settings.\nThe camera images and resulting depth data are only used for gameplay purposes. The live video feed is never used, and its data is never stored locally or remotely. Camera access is required to get depth data from Apple's API's.\nFace data is never stored on the device or remotely, given to third parties, or used for any non-gameplay purposes. The face data only remains on your device during your current game session and never leaves your device at any time.\nNo ads, no in-app purchases, just Rock'n'Roll.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yunmi"}
