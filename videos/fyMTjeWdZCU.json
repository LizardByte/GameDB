{"id": "fyMTjeWdZCU", "snippet": {"title": "Halo: Reach EVOLVED 2.0 Release Trailer (Reach Campaign Mod)", "description": "Salutations! I know it's been a while since my last upload, but the newest update for Halo: Reach EVOLVED, now 2.0, has been released! A metric ton of changes have been implemented into the mod thanks to fan feedback, inconsistencies between the maps, and a bunch of other personal things I wanted to change. The biggest difference is overall difficulty, which has been increased across the board. \n\nDOWNLOAD HERE: https://www.nexusmods.com/halothemasterchiefcollection/mods/23\n\n==2.0 UPDATE CHANGE LIST==\n\n-Overall difficulty addressed. Mod is more challenging than previous versions. \n-All enemies have unique firing patterns for every weapon they wield, and fire faster and more accurately than in previous versions.\n-Fixed melee cooldown oversight. Only the Energy Sword has the ability to melee super fast now. However, pistol-type weapons, including the Magnum, Needler, and Plasma Pistol, have slightly faster melee cooldowns than other weapons.\n-Fixed inconsistent melee damage from Exodus onwards; only the Eviscerator has increased melee damage now.\n-Fixed inconsistent Grunt backpack garbage on certain levels. Also, Grunt backpack garbage is now properly colored.\n-Brute Stalkers have their own helmet garbage now.\n-Jetpack Elites are now green like their Halo 2 Anniversary counterparts.\n-Heavy Grunts use the Major Grunt as the parent.\n-Brute Stalkers use the Brute Captain as the parent.\n-Hunters appear as large red dots on the motion tracker, just like vehicles.\n-NEW HUNTER VARIANT: THE PYRO HUNTER! Violet-colored Hunter equipped with a plasma flamethrower. \n-Shotgun spare ammunition increased from 18 to 24.\n-Assault Rifle has significantly less spare ammunition, from 600 to 360. Your starting Assault Rifle on Nightfall will still have 600 spare rounds, however.\n-Battle Rifle does less shield damage and has a smaller red reticle radius, requiring the user to be more precise with their shots.\n-Magnum's headshot dot has been restored.\n-Plasma Spate has slightly more maximum spread and has a smaller red reticle radius, requiring the user to be more precise with their shots. Red reticle range is not altered, however.\n-Brute Plasma Spate fires fully automatic instead of 4-round burst.\n-Eviscerator's heat-based properties have been restored, and the projectiles do human bullet damage instead of plasma. Projectiles bounce off of shields. Melee damage slightly buffed (118.5 to 125).\n-Needler is now a bright pink, like its Halo 3 counterpart. Rate of fire and projectile speed slightly decreased.\n-Needle Rifle's maximum bloom is slightly decreased.\n-Plasma Grenades, when stuck to enemies,  now do much better damage against shields. Detonation time increased to 2 seconds to indirectly buff Frag Grenades.\n-Rocket Launcher takes significantly less time to lock on to vehicles and aircraft. Target-tracking visuals adjusted to look like its Halo 2 counterpart.\n-Aggro Hunter's projectiles travel slightly faster (15 to 20 world units), now do slightly more damage (7 to 8)\n-Plasma Caster now automatically fires its charged shot after the trigger is held for 3 seconds.\n-Wraith secondary autocannons had their fire rates nerfed (10 min to 7 min), not as accurate in the beginning. This is to not only allow players to approach the Wraith easier, but to also knock its DPS down a few pegs to ultimately play a more supportive role.\n-Scorpion's co-axial machine gun is now fired by using left trigger instead of switching to it. Shoutout to DrkSteel for his Scorpion Cannon tags that enable this behavior!\n-Gauss Cannon does 50% less damage.\n-Updated encounters throughout the Campaign!\n\n-----\n\nMusic by: Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori\n\n-----\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/vengeful_vadam\nFollow me on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/the_vengeful_vadam\nJoin my Discord server: https://discord.gg/3WJVDPa\n\n#Halo #HaloMods #HaloReachEvolved", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyMTjeWdZCU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyMTjeWdZCU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyMTjeWdZCU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyMTjeWdZCU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyMTjeWdZCU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Halo: Reach EVOLVED 2.0 Release Trailer (Reach Campaign Mod)", "description": "Salutations!
