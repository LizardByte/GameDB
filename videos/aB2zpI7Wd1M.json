The game can be played by one player, or two players alternating turns. The first screen is similar to the 1981 game Kaboom. The player controls protagonist Billy Peltzer, who runs side-to-side across the screen catching falling Mogwai to prevent them from eating hamburgers. In the second screen, similar to Space Invaders, the player moves Billy back and forth across the screen and shoots waves of descending gremlins.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aB2zpI7Wd1M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aB2zpI7Wd1M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aB2zpI7Wd1M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aB2zpI7Wd1M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "GREMLINS -ATARI 2600-", "description": "Gremlins is a 1984 video game developed and published by Atari for the Atari 2600 system.
