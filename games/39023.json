It's a strategic, maze-based video game franchise originally developed by Hudson Soft. \n \nMost games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb's explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dyna-blaster", "videos": [{"id": 24354, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "DMNxOmNzfb0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMNxOmNzfb0", "title": "Amiga Longplay Dyna Blaster", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMNxOmNzfb0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
