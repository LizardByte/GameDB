Mr. Ghost plays remarkably close to Irem\u2019s Mr Heli, so much so that they could, in fact, be related. Both games let your character move in eight directions, both allow you to deform parts of the environment, and both have a super-deformed look to them. What sets this game aside, though, is its combat system. Mr Ghost dispatches a little sperm looking ghost at enemies and can only redeploy him after he\u2019s returned. Mr Ghost can also perform a bum rush to destroy enemies sneaking up behind him or break bricks.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mr-ghost", "videos": [{"id": 43848, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9IqhWm-lFwo"}]}
