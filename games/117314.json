There are a few coop maps where you and another player need to help each other to come across some puzzles. \n \nAlmost every day quests are added so make sure to install the latest releases from the website crypchania.com. \n \nThe game is free to play: for Browser and Windows desktop. \nThe hosting and updates are entirely from donations which makes you a VIP account, which allows you more types of weapons and armor to wear.
