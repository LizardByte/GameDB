In the midst of the midsummer wind, bathed in the wind that rushes in from the train window, they head to that town, which they only have vague memories of.\n\n\"Say, let's promise to meet again.\"\n\n\"I'll keep playing this harmonica, okay? Because even if I can't reach you, the sound of the harmonica surely will.\"\n\nThe harmonica, which was handed over together with the promise to that girl.\n\nAnd within the shaking cabin of the train, Makoto wakes up, dimly but surely recalling that memory...", "summary": "Originally released for PC (Windows) under the same title as an adult visual novel, the game was then ported to consoles with removed adult contents, but also with additional CG events and story elements added to compensate for the lack of erotic scenes. The game follows Makoto Okano as he returns to his hometown after 10 years away. Before he left, he and Minamo Narukaze made a promise to each other to meet again. She told him she will keep on playing the harmonic and even though he may be too far away to see it, the wind will carry the melody, hopefully all the way to his place.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wind-a-breath-of-heart"}
