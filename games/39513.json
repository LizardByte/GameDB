{"id": 39513, "name": "Teeter Torture", "summary": "Teeter Torture is a game that has rather mysterious origins. Only a single cabinet has even been found for it. (Fortunately it has been making regular appearances at the California Extreme show for a number of years.) For years there was even confusion as to whether it was an Exidy-produced prototype or some bootleg running on the Exidy hardware."}
