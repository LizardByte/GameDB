It was initially released in 1995 as a \"bonus scenario\" in the Might and Magic Trilogy compilation (the \"trilogy\" refers to Might and Magic III, IV, and V). Subsequently, it was also included in several series anthologies. The game was never published in standalone form. The game began as a mod based on the Might and Magic V engine, which was released in 1993. Personalities from Catware were responsible for leading the modding effort, with story contributions from Ellen Beeman. As development progressed, collaboration with New World Computing was established, and the mod received publishing support.\n\nSwords of Xeen exploits some quirks of the engine to great effect, such as morphing monsters by using the regular animation of one monster and the attack animation of another. The game also contains bugs in scripting, which allow the player to bypass many encounters by walking sideways.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/might-and-magic-swords-of-xeen"}
