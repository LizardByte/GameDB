That old Neverquaker has finally passed away! However, it would be a shame for his fortune to go to waste, and I would not mind putting it to good use myself. After all, that old decrepit man never got along with anyone, I don't even know if he had a family so most likely there is not any heir to take his money. To his abandoned tower at once! I said while unaware of the trials that awaited me. It turns out this damn tower is as cursed as his own fate for even a magician such as myself has trouble navigating this place; my trusted magic barely works and even a simple light spell becomes very unstable in here. Luckily my enchanted clothes can still protect me from any harm. I must get to the top where his treasure is and flee as soon as I can, for I even feel my own sanity crumbling every minute I'm here...", "summary": "You seek the treasure of the Neverquaker, don't you?! Well, TOO BAD!. The architect of his tower was drunk, you can barely maneuver in the air while you run and your lighting spell sucks too! At least your robe can sustain enough damage, but... can you climb the tower and get away with... The Gold of the Neverquaker?!", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gimme-money-neverquaker"}
