The movement grew quickly and they became known as the \u201cKryptorians\u201d. People were tired of the fake news, the lies and the totalitarian control of The Fed. The Kryptorians tapped into peoples\u2019 desire for a decentralised technocratic form of governance. Kryptorians wanted to give the people ownership of their information, which was enshrined in their \u201cDe-Fi\u201d constitution. They offered people back contol of their own lives, which had been taken from them without them even realising, so long ago.\n\nThe war was brutal. The Fed, led by General Tax, commanded vast legions of Regulators who were merciless. Their elite SEC marines dealt devastating losses to the Kryptorian forces. The Kryptorians realised that they could never win a war that was being fought in a world so tightly controlled by The Fed. But the Kryptorians also knew that if they lost, then their people would remain forever enslaved to the Government and the Web 2 corporations they were backed by.\n\nKnowing they could not win in conventional battle, they constructed the Proxy Portal, an interdimensional space portal that they could use to find a new home. Their hope was to establish a new world where they could be free. In a final battle, the Kryptorians retreated through the portal. Some of the Kryptorian\u2019s most elite troops, ERC Team 20, were supposed to destroy the portal, but they were overrun by the SEC marines. In the final moments of the battle, ERC Team 20 managed to shut down the portal, cutting off the connection to the new world. But they were not able to destroy the portal itself before being captured.\n\nAway from the control of the oppressive Fed, Kryptoria flourished. A new High Council was formed which blended both technocratic and algocratic forms of governance. Their society was founded on sacred De-Fi principles. Trust through transparency. This meant that everyone could finally own their own information and the decentralised economy was owned by the people.\n\nBut not everyone was happy with the new world. Following decades of peace in Kryptoria, an insurrection began to grow, eventually into a faction known as \u201cDegens\u201d. Whilst Degens predominantly agreed to the same principles of De-Fi, they did not like how focused on financial gain Kryptorians had become. They felt that De-Fi should be used for a different purpose, for creation, rather than pure profit. Degen extremists began to attack Kryptorian industry, including the Krypto mines in the mountains and burning the binary fields in the grasslands.\n\nRather than risk another all-out war, reminiscent of their escape from The Fed which was still fresh, the High Council decreed that half of Kryptoria would be given to the Degens, in a time known as the Separation. This meant a war was avoided, however, there were still Kryptorians and Degens who did not feel that the Separation was fair. Whilst an uneasy peace has been maintained in recent years, there are murmurs of agitators sowing malcontent. With both sides developing new weapons technologies and stockpiling resources.\n\nWhilst a civil war seems more and more likely, one can\u2019t help but wonder, what has the Fed been doing during this time?", "summary": "Kryptoria is an immersive 4X and RTS game enabled by the Ethereum blockchain, that encourages players to build an empire in the world of Kryptoria, through economic, technological and military power.", "themes": [{"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kryptoria--2", "videos": [{"id": 81362, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nPEVwKpHUqU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPEVwKpHUqU", "title": "Kryptoria - Built in Unity", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nPEVwKpHUqU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
