Every shop owner lives in fear of raids or blackmailing. Bank and mail robberies are more and more common. Everybody can buy fire arms, the corrupt police is no help at all. In this scenario, up to four criminals who have recently been released from prison fight for the domination of Gangland. The way to the Mafia Throne is long and hard. At the beginning, you are a nobody whom not even the shop owners take seriously. You have to do quite a few nasty odd jobs before you can even afford a car or a gun, let alone a flat and your own little gang.\nWhile the game itself mainly consists of PETSCI graphics, created with a modified charset, there are many comic-like multi colour images for the single buildings and events. The sound is not really worth mentioning, besides some FX and jingles there isn't any.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mafia--1", "videos": [{"id": 78112, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3UL62q1sgOo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UL62q1sgOo", "title": "Mafia C64 Longplay [127] Full Playthrough / Walkthrough (no commentary) #c64 #retrogaming", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3UL62q1sgOo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
