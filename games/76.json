Players create their own character by customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class. Combat is in real time with the ability to pause at any moment: tactical options include an editor which allows the player to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-age-origins", "videos": [{"id": 77256, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VaZXJQIHgEA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaZXJQIHgEA", "title": "Dragon Age: Origins - Sacred Ashes Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VaZXJQIHgEA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77257, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cfSAlyiI1mc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfSAlyiI1mc", "title": "Dragon Age: Origins - Violence Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cfSAlyiI1mc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77258, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "4k81SFkhFG4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k81SFkhFG4", "title": "Dragon Age: Origins - Story Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4k81SFkhFG4/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1893, "name": "Oghren"}, {"id": 1892, "gender": 1, "name": "Morrigan", "species": 5}, {"id": 1894, "name": "Sten"}, {"id": 1886, "name": "Alistair"}, {"id": 1887, "name": "Duncan"}, {"id": 1891, "name": "Loghain"}, {"id": 1896, "name": "Zevran"}, {"id": 1888, "name": "Flemeth"}, {"id": 1895, "name": "Wynne"}, {"id": 1889, "name": "Arl Howe"}, {"id": 1890, "name": "Leliana"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Additional Voices"}]}
