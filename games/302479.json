Each level consists of tiles that make out the spider's web. Problem is that the web is under siege by odd spherical creatures. This has lead to some passageways being broken and now it's up to our little spider to repair the damage done. The aim then is to rebuild these parts of each level so that the spider can move on to the next. This is done with the use of coloured tiles. The HUD shows a flashing dot that indicates what colour is needed. The spider then has to find a tile in that colour and move it to the tile that needs to be repaired. Once this is all done the spider gets access to a teleporter and can move on to the next level. The spider isn't alone however. It has to be careful not to come into contact with the balls that move around the web. Balls can be destroyed by building a web in front of them. They won't be gone for long though since they will respawn after just a few seconds.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spidertronic", "videos": [{"id": 114219, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Z5lql49tDOA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5lql49tDOA", "title": "Amiga Longplay: Spidertronic", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z5lql49tDOA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
