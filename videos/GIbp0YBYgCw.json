The final version that appears in-game will have updated team members and YOUR NAME if you back this tier on our Kickstarter.  Thanks for watching!\n\nVanillaBeast: Ace In the Hole\nA Parody Game\n\nCheck out Ace in the Hole on our Kickstarter pre-launch page! We've got some AMAZING rewards no game company has ever been able to offer thanks to our partnership with PSP. Be sure to \"Notify me on Launch\" on the Kickstarter page to remind you when we go live on March 15h 2022.. You're not going to want to miss these rewards and opportunity to back the game.\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vanillabeastgame/vanillabeast-ace-in-the-hole\n\n- Beautiful character and level design from many talented artists including the amazing pixel artist, Giuseppe \"Misbug\" Longo.\n- Rockin soundtrack from the legends of retro music, 8-Bit Universe.\n- Top-down exploration of a massive open world environment.\n- Tons of side quests that tie the open world into individual levels. Finding something while exploring the club may help your surf adventure, and vice versa.\n- Hilarious dialog and situations. This is seriously one of the funniest games you\u2019ll ever play.\n- Insane variety of gameplay. Casinos, clubs, Golf, HR Derby in the park, camp, football, surfing, fighting, racing, etc..\n- Retro-style gameplay brought together with modern animation and game design. A truly unique, yet familiar experience like you've never seen before.\n- Time-tested styles brought together to make VanillaBeast one of the most varied gaming experiences to date.\n\nGameplay Styles\n - Leisure Suit Larry - The Leisure Suit Larry series started in the late 80s and if you were old enough (and allowed) to play them there's no doubt they made a huge impact on you.  LSL was a pioneer of the adult humor in gaming.  We're designing our open world around the LSL formula of \"find an item here, use it over there\" all the while using adult humor to keep you laughing and immersed in the story. \n \n - Punisher (NES) - Rail-scrolling action is a rare form of gameplay not used much these days.  In years past games like Punisher, Gotcha!, Terminator 2 The Arcade game and a few others made lasting impressions on us.  A Punisher (NES) rail-scrolling shooter from the 90s is exactly what VanillaBeast needs to keep that retro variety flowing and that's exactly what we're giving it.\n \n- Mike Tyson's Punch-Out! (NES) - We've designed a full circuit of boxers to fight your way through as Vanilla reminisces back to the time he battled his way to face the Champ, Tike Myson, in our parody boxing tribute to the classic NES title.  \n \n- Jaws (NES) - Remember how Jaws had a fun open water exploration on a boat as well as under-water diving game play? We've came up with a pretty sweet take on this classic you're sure to enjoy while reminiscing back to the good ol' days of gaming.\n \n- NES Open Tournament Golf - One of the greatest Golf games of all-time (we know that's relative, please stop being so technical).  Our Golf mini game is based on the fan favorite NES golf game from the 90s with a twist of Caddyshack.  We're looking forward to seeing you tee off at \"All 3 Holes Country Club\".  FORE!\n \n- Friday the 13th (NES) - Remember F13 on NES?  We're sure you loved it, or at least loved to hate it, right?  We've taken this retro game designed to thwart that evil purple and teal evildoer to a whole new level as you go to Camp Crystal Fake and save the ladies in a Friday the 13th style side-scrolling level.\n \n- T & C Surf Design - Surf waves and fight enemies in a T & C Surf Design inspired level. We've taken the classic surf style gameplay and added a combo point system, crazy obstacles, enemy combat and a massive shark to make this T & C Surf Design parody level one of the coolest aquatic adventures you've ever seen.  Pixelated waves have never looked so good.\n \n- Outrun (Arcade) / Speed Racer (Arcade) - Race from and into danger in an Outrun / Speed Racer inspired racing levels. With a full arsenal of gadgets and tricks at your disposal Vanilla's Black Bullet roadster has never looked better.\n \n- Final Fight and Double Dragon - Love the old school brawlers like Final Fight and Double Dragon games? We do too. You'll be playing multiple levels inspired by those classics, but on a modern scale.\n \n- MK or SF - Ever get to a boss fight and wish you could fight them MK or SF style? Here's your chance. Select bosses will feature actual 2D fighter controls.\n\n#VanillaBeastGame #RetroGaming #PixelArt", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GIbp0YBYgCw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GIbp0YBYgCw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GIbp0YBYgCw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GIbp0YBYgCw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GIbp0YBYgCw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "VanillaBeast: Ace in the Hole | Demo Intro", "description": "NOTE:  This is the early Demo version.
