Sarah, having chosen to lose her memory as well, assumes Wol to be her brother and trains under Meia's supervision. Meanwhile, Wol lives a relatively calm and repetitive life helping out with the everyday problems of the village of Omega, primarily as a fiend hunter.\n\nElsewhere, two individuals, Sophie and Graff, separately come across strange artifacts. These \"runes\" show them visions of a grand city, and an ongoing conflict between two factions, the \"Free Citizens\" and \"The Collective\". In these visions, they come across each other, referring to one another as siblings. Believing these runic visions and their relationship to be connections to their past, they each journey to seek each other out.\n\nGraff comes across more runes, laid before him by faeries who manipulate the events seen within them. They desire to change his nature to that of cruel and violent one who will bring despair to the world in the absence of Chaos. Sophie's journey finds her coming across an Echo that traveled with Wol on his previous journey. Along the way, the two encounter Blanks who turn to Sophie for leadership and she in turn inspires them, unaware of the faeries' machinations in trying to make her into a new Warrior of Light.", "summary": "Act 2 of the RPG Mobius Final Fantasy, which added new characters, new jobs and a new scenario quests.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mobius-final-fantasy-warrior-of-despair", "videos": [{"id": 94623, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "b07JXu4C1S0"}]}
