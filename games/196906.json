Triagon has been trying to cure Max's illness - a very dangerous outburst of anomalous energy. Since there isn't any permanent cure, Max is dependent on Triagon's technology.\n\nJust as he has begun to accept that this is how it will be for the rest of his life, everything changes with the appearance of Thomas Jetsen. He informs Max that the Triagon Facility Leader has been kidnapped by strange, bug-like creatures from outer space.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more peculiar is that the measured energy signature of the alien bugs is apparently identical to Max\u2019s.\n\nThis is where Max\u2019s story begins. He will now go on a quest to save the Triagon leader, find a way to get rid of the space insects, and, most importantly, understand the nature of his unique skills. For years, this weird energy considered a curse now seems to be a blessing that could save humanity from an unknown threat. But the clock is ticking.\n\nCan he find the cure and save the Earth?", "summary": "Connect everything in this revolutionary Match-3 FPS with combat mechanics different from anything you've ever played before.
