Hit the ball with the paddle until all bricks are \ndestroyed. If all balls slip from the game field, then a spare one is launched. \nIf no spare balls are left, the game (or the level set) is over. You score \npoints by destroying bricks, picking power-ups and completing levels. The \nHigh Scores table keeps track of the best scores for all completed levels in \neach level set.\n  \nNote 1. Every single level set has its own statistics - a score table and a \n        ball credit (number of spare balls) counter.\n \nNote 2. You can complete the same level set multiple times - either to improve \n        your score or just for fun. ;)\nControls.\n\n     Mouse    Move the paddle left and right.\n\n     Left mouse button   Launch the ball/bomb or fire weapons.\n\n     Esc              Pause game, bring up the menu.\n     F1    Help.\n     F4    Options.\n\nNote: There are also other hot keys assigned to different menu items.\n\n Autosave/Checkpoints\nAutosave:\nOnce a new level within a level set starts, the game automatically saves the \nlevel, the score and the number of spare balls the player has. Thanks to this \nfeature, the player can suspend the current game (for example, close the \nprogram or start another level set) and later resume that level set, \nof course, if there are more than none spare balls.\nCheckpoints:\nWhen every tenth level within a level set is reached, the player gets the \nopportunity to start this level set from that checkpoint. When starting the \ngame from a checkpoint, the player starts with the best score and the largest \nnumber of spare balls (but not more than 2) the corresponding checkpoint was \nreached with.\n \nDescription of Units.\n\n[BRICK]\nBricks are the most essential elements of any level. There are three kinds of \nbricks: single, double and triple. Two or more bricks can form a group. \nDamaging a grouped brick damages the entire group.\n[CORE] \nThis is a special type of brick. A CORE is immune to the ordinary ball \nwhile it's surrounded by other bricks. But it can be destroyed by a ball with \nthe following power-ups applied: Disintegrator, Strikeball, Fireball or \nMine Blast. A bonus weapon, such as Railgun or Bomb, will destroy a CORE, too.\n[REGENERATOR]\nThis is a special type of CORE that can recover the bricks surrounding it.\n[MINE]\nThis is a special type of brick. A MINE blast can destroy up to 50 bricks.\n[EXPLOSIVE BRICK]\nThis is a special type of brick. Its explosion destroys the adjacent bricks.\n[RAILBRICK]\nThis is a special type of brick. It destroys units of all types, even if \nthey are behind a WALL.\n[WALL]\nThis is an indestructible unit.\n[SHADOW WALL]\nThis is a special type of WALL. Being hit by a ball, it lets other balls come \nthrough for the next 10 seconds.\n[BONUS GENERATOR]\nThis is a special unit. Being hit by a ball, it generates a bonus of a \ngiven type. It needs 30 seconds to recover from every hit. \n[TELEPORT]\nThis is a special unit. It sends a ball from one TELEPORT to another TELEPORT. \nTeleports with the green centers act as entrances, with the red centers - as \n\n \n  Power-ups.\n  \nMEGABALL\nFIREBALL\nDISINTEGRATOR\nSTRIKEBALL\nLASER BOMB\nSLOW DOWN]\nDEFECTIVE CLONE\nGLUE\nBOMB\nMINIGUNS\nRAILGUN\nENLARGE PADDLE\nSHRINK PADDLE\nMEGA ENLARGE\nMEGA SHRINK\nEXTRABALL\nSKULL\nSTONEBAR\nETHEREAL WALL\nSPEED UP\nROTATION\nDOUBLE ROTATION\nNEXT LEVEL\nRESTORE LEVEL\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n   Microsoft Windows 9x/ME/XP/2000 (with SP2)\n   Pentium II 300 MHz processor, equivalent or better \n   32MB RAM minimum\n   15MB of free hard drive space\n   DirectX-compatible video card with 2MB video memory\n   DirectX-compatible sound card \n   DirectX 2.0 or higher\n\nPublished by\nArchgames Inc.\nDeveloped by\nArchgames Inc.\nReleased\nNov 30, 2002\nPlatform\nWindows\n\nProgramming:\nIgor Garanin\nDesign:\nEugene Petukhov\nGraphics:\nEugene Petukhov\nSFX:\nEugene Petukhov\nLevel Design:\nIgor Garanin, Eugene Petukhov\nAdditional Levels:\nIgor Garanin, Eugene Petukhov, Eugene Kuzmin, Vitaly Kozlov\nSpecial Thanks:\nAlexander Mikov, Vadim Mikov", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3BBtktRHb8U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3BBtktRHb8U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3BBtktRHb8U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3BBtktRHb8U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Ball Attack    \u00b2\u2070\u2070\u00b2  \ud83c\udf1cFull Game\ud83c\udf1b", "description": "Ball Attack is an Arkanoid-style game that merges the best features of its \nclassic ancestor with fresh ideas and new twists.\n\n  Game Features: \n\n  - unique original game look and feel;\n  - easy-to-learn, non-violent and balanced gameplay;\n  - rich high-color graphics;\n  - easy-to-use mouse control;\n  - translucency effects;\n  - moving units;\n  - composite blocks (groups);\n  - level transformation;\n  - special units: bonus generator, teleport, distorter, etc;\n  - bonus weapons: minigun, railgun, bomb;\n  - mighty power-ups: laser-bomb, disintegrator, strikeball, fireball;\n  - penalty items: speed-up, paddle shrinker, skull, defective clone;\n  - free additional level sets;\n  - autosave within level sets;\n  - checkpoints every 10 levels;                         \n196 Levels \n Game rules\n\nYou begin a game (or a level set) with three balls: a ball on the game field \nand two spare balls.
