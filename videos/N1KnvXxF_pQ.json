{"id": "N1KnvXxF_pQ", "snippet": {"title": "Bomberman Online (Dreamcast) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 2001 puzzle-action game for the Sega Dreamcast, Bomberman Online.\n\nThis video shows the entire \"normal\" mode, including the ending.\n\nBomberman Online was one of the later releases on the Dreamcast, and it brought to the series quite a bit more innovation than most of the earlier entries. I bought it when it first came out, and though it certainly didn't match the excellence of Saturn Bomberman (though really, what other Bomberman game has?), it was exactly the kind of game the Dreamcast needed...though it probably would have had more impact if it had come out a bit sooner.\n\nThe main draw in Bomberman Online is, not too surprisingly, its online mode. You could hook the Dreamcast's built-in modem up to your phone line, dial in, find a game, and go. It was remarkably easy for such an early use of net play, and it rarely lagged, hitched, or dropped a connection over a 33.6k  connection. Eat your heart out, Fallout 76. The servers were unfortunately shut down in 2003, though I'm sure with a bit of trickery you could probably still play online with a private server. \n\nA Bomberman with online play might seem like a total given in the modern day where everything in someone's house seems to want to hook up to the internet, but in 2001, this was revolutionary stuff. The Dreamcast was pretty awesome like that.\n\nThe single-player normal mode adopts the different match types from the multiplayer modes and wraps them up neatly in the form of a 20-stage campaign. All of the stages have their own gimmick, and though they tend to be really hit-or-miss, they give a welcome shakeup to the more traditionally styled titles. \n\nThe story has you, as regular white Bomberman, competing in the Bomb-a-lympics against several gangs of different themed Bombermen such as the Electric Dragons and the Princess Mariners. They sound cheesy, but they fit the anime-style to a T.\n\nSpeaking of anime, Bomberman got a completely new look in Online. The entire game now showcases a cel-shaded look that really impressed (especially in VGA mode!) back in the day, and the bright, clean lines and simple textures have aged extremely well. 17 years later it is still quite an attractive game. There are also several animated, story-driving FMV clips strewn throughout the game, and not only is the art well done, but the video quality is superb.\n\nI really wish this game had been ported to a different platform at some point. It's a great addition to the series, and it deserved far more attention than it got being launched on a dying platform. I'd still love to see a port or a remaster on a modern system - it has more style and substance than many of the more recent releases, and seriously its Bomberman. Does it need any other reason?\n\nIf you love the series and haven't played this one, you really ought too. It's not the best game in the series, but it is a damn good one. I'd take Bomberman Online over Super Bomberman R any day.\n\nI was shocked at how little coverage it has on YouTube, so here is my personal contribution. Hope you enjoy my playthough of this forgotten Dreamcast gem!\n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1KnvXxF_pQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1KnvXxF_pQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1KnvXxF_pQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1KnvXxF_pQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Bomberman Online (Dreamcast) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sega's 2001 puzzle-action game for the Sega Dreamcast, Bomberman Online.\n\nThis video shows the entire \"normal\" mode, including the ending.\n\nBomberman Online was one of the later releases on the Dreamcast, and it brought to the series quite a bit more innovation than most of the earlier entries.
