There's a free demo you can try out either alone or with a friend, so no sweat off your back if you ever want to look!\n\nFor the ones listening to \"November Rain\" by Guns N' Roses:  Please don't forget it's only April.  Though I suppose there's a lot of rain outside the theater so it's still fitting.\n\nIf you're still reading this, please read the heartfelt message written by Co-Founder and Art Director of The Behemoth: http://devblog.thebehemoth.com/?p=8494\n\nEnjoy and Thank you!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EufrdjmsKBg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EufrdjmsKBg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EufrdjmsKBg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EufrdjmsKBg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EufrdjmsKBg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "BattleBlock Theater - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "http://devblog.thebehemoth.com/?p=8494\nIt's here!
