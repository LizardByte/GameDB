It\u2019s all three and much more! It is bingo with strategy! Place your pieces one at a time on the board. To score points, try to form continuous rows of the same color from edge to edge. But one wrong tile and the whole row is worthless. It gets harder as the number of empty spaces on your board, and your possible choices, diminish. Because once a tile is placed, it can\u2019t be moved!\nTake It Easy is a simple, yet surprisingly addictive and thought-provoking game that will give you endless hours of fun.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/take-it-easy"}
