The game takes place in a more traditional fantasy world this time, and is much more light-hearted in its story. The characters are cocky, dialogues silly and the premise about a boy who wakes up in a cave and tries to find his home quite banal. In this respect, it carries many similarities to the Grandia series, but it is never quite as charming.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harmonian-tales"}
