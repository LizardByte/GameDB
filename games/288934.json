It's up to you now to free her from this terrible demise by filling the jar with goop and letting her float out!", "summary": "Inspired by the likes of Not Tetris and C4D4U's \"Satisfying Softbody Tetris\" animations; this game sees you controlling jelly-like tetrominos, arranging them in such a way that clears rows, and draining the remaining residue with the two vents at the bottom of the field. Play ends once you've collected enough jelly to fill a container of variable size, depending on which mode you've picked.\n\nThe available containers hold a pint (~17 lines), a quart (~33 lines), and a gallon(~133 lines) each. Upon completion, you'll be shown your final time and score, allowing you to decide which to focus on.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-squishy-square-stacker", "videos": [{"id": 108145, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fiGvNyvQZXE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGvNyvQZXE", "title": "Super Squishy Square Stacker gameplay video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fiGvNyvQZXE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
