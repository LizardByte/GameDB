You must battle the minions of malignant Gods and their Holy Champions in an epic event known as the Trial of the Gods. Each level is randomly generated and features successive Altars of Worship where you exchange your Souls for Blessings. In the PolyGod universe, death is necessarily permanent but with each new game comes a unique first-time experience. The art-style is inspired by meta-physical surrealist artist Giorgio de Chico who is famously revered for his eerie mood and strange artificiality of cityscapes. PolyGod also features Arena Shooter multiplayer with randomly generated maps where the Victor is the first player to reach 10 kills. The Gods however only award blessings to those who die, and not to those who kill. In the words of De Chirico: \u201dTo become truly immortal a work of art must escape all human limits: logic and common sense will only interfere. But once these barriers are broken it will enter the regions of childhood vision and dream.\u201d\n\nPlease consider voting for Polygod on Steam Greenlight which will allow us to bring this game to you through Steam: goo.gl/fHxsWu", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzlLO3mtdCc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzlLO3mtdCc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzlLO3mtdCc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzlLO3mtdCc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RzlLO3mtdCc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Polygod Alpha Trailer", "description": "Get an early alpha version of the game on our Steam Greenlight page: http://goo.gl/fHxsWu\n\nPolyGod is a rogue-like, randomly generated FPS where you are an assassin known only as \"Faceless the Blessed\".
