The gameplay is in a style never seen before in a FNAF fan game :) I know I said I wouldn't make more FNAW games, but minds can change, and mine did. Fan games aren't hurting anybody, right? They're something I have fun making, and I choose to share them with you to play for free if you feel like it. So I don't feel this should be a bad thing for anybody.\nThe game takes places entierly on a TV screen... but is it real? Or are they just a dream? This is most likely them most challenging FNAW game out of them all. Can you beat all nights, and unlock the secret, new gamemode?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/five-nights-at-warios-4"}
