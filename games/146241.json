The game is based on the 2007 film TMNT.\n\nIt is an arcade game, which combines action-adventure and racing levels.\n\nLike most big movie titles, a mobile phone tie-in was developed for the TMNT movie and was available on all Symbian phones a few weeks prior to the release of the console video game and the movie. Based very loosely on the events on the film, Power of 4 consists of mixture of platforming stages and high speed chase sequences.\n\nThe platforming stages are heavily influenced by the old Shinobi games, featuring a lower plane and upper plane which the turtles can jump onto, and crates that can be either smashed or used for cover from gun-wielding maniacs and later sword-wielding Foot. There are also some roadside objects which can be used to your advantage like a block of logs which rolls down over any enemy which stands in the way. The Turtles are controlled by the surrounding buttons 4 and 6, while 2 acts as a jump and 8 crouches down. The 5 button will attack. At certain points, there are also other objectives such as protecting April from being hurt in order to complete the mission.\n\nThe racing stages are overhead high speed stages where the turtle van is being chased by the prehistoric mythical creature seen in the film along with other baddies. The goal of these stages is to spill oil onto the street to keep the opposing force at a distance. 4 and 6 steer the van in different directions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tmnt-the-power-of-4", "videos": [{"id": 48431, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_zNjjJp7lJA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zNjjJp7lJA", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Power of Four (Java game) Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zNjjJp7lJA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
