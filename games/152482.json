This is done by cracking a safe code in the warehouse office; cracking the safe will reward the player with a key, which can then be used to gain access to the next warehouse. As well as housing the hidden documents the player is searching for, these buildings contain supplies such as money, ammunition and explosives.", "summary": "All or Nothing is an action-adventure game for the ZX Spectrum.
