The player takes control of John, as his adventure leads him through an hour by hour experience of what may be everyone's last night on Earth. He will encounter unearthly evils, Demon lords, afflicted townsfolk, high school bullies, and a torrent of engaging, serial-like side stories all nested in a larger than life fantasy that brings the ultimate evil to a neighborhood near you. Choose your class, battle nightmarish creatures, customize your abilities, collect unique items and equipment in order to infiltrate the massive lairs of the Demon Lords and take on apocalyptic boss battles at their very centers.\n\nStory:\nIts 198X in the small town of Watford, Arizona.
