If you can use correct timing, it is possible you can just as high as 49 feet to reach the very top. I only got as high as 47 feet. After you jump on the trampoline, you go as high as you can and fall back down, you want to avoid the balloons and touch one of the platforms as you can to earn points. Just don't fall to the ground or you get no points. If you can spell DECO in full, you will be awarded with bonus points and possibly earn an extra life. If you reach 49 feet, you will get a prize of bonus points and earning you towards extra life. The game seems endless and only ends if you lose all lives.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1mg62codbE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1mg62codbE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1mg62codbE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m1mg62codbE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Arcade Game: Manhattan (1981 Data East)", "description": "A platform jumping game where you must jump as high as you can to reach the top of the building.
