Each mage has a wish they want granted or goal they want to meet. The only similarities they share is each mage wants to reach and conquer the 150th floor, granting them any wish they desire... Or so the saying goes. Beware, the floors made of tiles have a durability limit. If you attack a monster, you're also attacking the tile as well and it may break, sending the monster one floor down. The same logic also applies to you. If you fall through, you drop to the previous floor. Defeat all monsters on a floor, and ascend to the next floor. How will you fare against the 150 Floors? Will you get your wish granted?", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/150-floors", "videos": [{"id": 80521, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sOyrKVh9-CU"}]}
