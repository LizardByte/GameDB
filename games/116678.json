The action takes place in the distant year 2798. It is well known that any mighty empire tends to gradually rot from the inside and then disintegrate. And this time your character is categorically unlucky to appear in a harsh period of changing historical epochs. The governing center was no longer able to contain the manifestations of separatism. Distant colonies often rebelled. And on one of these planets, a special detachment of your hero was defeated, because in the management of troops reigned complete chaos. Having sold the rest of the weapons, Soap was forced to get home on the proceeds, using all sorts of dubious hitchhiking and plowing dubious space \u201croads\u201d. That's how he was \u201cbrought\u201d to this God-damned little moon on the big giant planet. But the decay of the Empire influenced not only the development of separatist sentiments. In just a few generations, the most valuable Imperial technology and knowledge had been lost. And here in the Arena, there had been continuous warfare for several centuries. After all, anyone realizes that war is first and foremost about the most advanced technology. That is why the Arena began to attract various criminals, scoundrels, adventurers, mercenaries and other very dubious people. And all of them began to dig and search in the sand-covered remains of former battles for various high-tech artifacts that could be sold back to the same Empire, and on the proceeds of the crumbs not to starve to death and last a couple of months until some new value is found. Our main character found himself in such a horrible world, and, most importantly, the oppressive atmosphere of such an environment deeply permeates the game. You can feel it directly on yourself, passing level after level. The main task of our hero is to escape from this cursed moon by all means, revealing the big secret of this planetary body.", "summary": "Dust is a Polish FPS by Optimus Nexus released in 1999.
