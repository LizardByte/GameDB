There are two types of races that can take place on the Wangan: Destination Races - a simple point to point race, and Top Speed Battles - whoever can set the highest speed record in between the start and finish wins. The Touge also features two events: Grip Battles - point to point race going uphill or downhill through tight Hairpin Turns, and Drift Battles - whoever can accumulate the most points by the end of the run wins. Throughout the Wangan are several exits which can lead to hotspots - where Wangan races can be started, touges, Car Dealerships, tune shops, and Robo-Garages. These garages were featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift."}
