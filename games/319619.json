That narrative involves, among other things, gay girls. Gameplay ranges from low-tier-enemy-heavy slaughter and microslaughter to: small-scale traps, light incidental combat, parkour/platforming, quiet exploration and secret-hunting (often there's some mix of a couple of those). UV can get quite hard. Play on HNTR or HMP unless you know you want that.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/umbra--4"}
