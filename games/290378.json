In 1985, Friedel invited then world chess champion Garry Kasparov to his house. Kasparov mused about how a chess database would make it easier for him to prepare for specific opponents. Friedel began working with Bonn physicist Matthias W\u00fcllenweber who created the first such database, ChessBase 1.0, as software for the Atari ST. The February 1987 issue of Computer-schach und Spiele introduced the database program as well as the ChessBase magazine, a floppy disk containing chess games edited by chess grandmaster John Nunn.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chessbase-1-dot-0", "videos": [{"id": 108807, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "KBUBiXAef8c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBUBiXAef8c", "title": "ATARI ST ChessBase 19xx De MONO CHROME BW HIGH RESOLUTION 640x400x2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBUBiXAef8c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
