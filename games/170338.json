You are part of the city guard, trapped in an underground complex of a city in grave danger. Due to a mishap very early in the morning, you have no sword and no armor. You have reason to believe that whatever is plaguing the city, is located in this complex. You take a deep breath and move forward, to whatever awaits.\n\nDeath Blade is a role playing game designed for the Macintosh. It's interface has been designed to be easy to use and quick to access. This is especially important since combat is real-time (well sorta).\n\nDeath Blade is not overly complex as some roleplaying games are. It has been designed to allow even younger adventurers to take part in the quest. While the interface is simple enough for younger users, the graphics and game play should be a challenge for experienced players as well.\n\nThere are sixteen levels to Death Blade. Each level poses a different problem that you have to solve. Some levels require a strong sword, while others require a systematic mind.\n\nResearch with the game and see if you can discover ways of being more effective. For example, the creatures always attack immediately following their movement phase. It is impossible for you to land an attack before a creature when the creature has just moved forward. However, if you time your movements, you can move forward and attack him before he can advance. It takes practice.\n\nGood luck.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/death-blade"}
