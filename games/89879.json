On the day he is born as Sora's Nobody when Sora transforms into a Heartless in the original Kingdom Hearts, Roxas is found by Xemnas in Twilight Town, the leader of Organization XIII, who names him its thirteenth member. Each day he is sent on missions to other worlds, either alone or accompanied by his fellow members, to destroy Heartless with the Keyblade and release captive hearts, with which the Organization can fulfill their goal of summoning Kingdom Hearts and become complete beings. Roxas is placed under the care of Axel, who he befriends and spends his spare time with at the end of each day, sitting atop the clock tower in Twilight Town, speaking what's on their minds and eating sea-salt ice cream together.\n\nKingdom Hearts Re:coded\nKingdom Hearts Re:coded follows the story of Donald Duck, Goofy, Jiminy Cricket, and King Mickey in Disney Castle after the events of Kingdom Hearts II. Jiminy Cricket was attempting to organize what is known as Jiminy's Journal after completing his adventure with Sora when he noticed a line that said \"Thank Namin\u00e9\". Looking further he discovers a message in the journal that he did not put there that states \"Their hurting will be mended when you return to end it.\" King Mickey digitizes the journal and takes it in the simulated world in hopes of finding out more. He awakens Data-Sora on the digital version Destiny Islands and asks him reenact the contents of the journal in an attempt to uncover the identity of those who are \"hurting\".\n\nKingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance\nFollowing the destruction of Ansem and Xemnas at the hands of Sora and Riku, Xehanort is revived. In response, Yen Sid puts Sora and Riku through a Mark of Mastery exam in order for them to become full-fledged Keyblade Masters and counter the coming return of Master Xehanort. As part of this trial, the two are separated from each other and sent to worlds previously destroyed by the Heartless that have since been restored, though now in a state of \"deep sleep\" which disconnects them from the other worlds.", "summary": "The contents of the box inlcude:\n- A simple style that includes the logos used throughout the series\n- Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Nintendo DS/Greatest Hits)\n- Kingdom Hearts Re:coded (Nintendo DS)\n- Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance (Nintendo 3DS)\n- 12 postcards with images of the past games box arts\n- Stickers\n- Protective cover for the 3DS", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 38352, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9FH0_reDWRY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FH0_reDWRY", "title": "Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (DS) Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9FH0_reDWRY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 38353, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "motYDb0kQ2o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=motYDb0kQ2o", "title": "Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance (3DS) Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/motYDb0kQ2o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
