Discover the next evolution of Sudoku with amazing graphics, animations, and ease of use. This is a Sudoku like one you have never experienced before ;)\n\n...Thousands of puzzles, all free. Top class puzzles with selectable level of difficulty :)\n________________________________\nTo the classic Sudoku, we added:\n\n=> A smart point system, wherein your score is based on 1) the value of each number multiplied (at the time of its match) by a multiplier that decreases in time and 2) the value of each block, row, column multiplied (at the time of its completion) by the decreasing multiplier\n\n=> Thanks to Game Center, you can now rank and compare Sudoku scores and achievements against friends and strangers\n\n=> \u25bbSudoku also counts the runs, that is, each uninterrupted sequence of games won, and adds them to the online leaderboards \n________________________________\nIn \u25bbSudoku, you win a game when you solve a puzzle with 3 errors or less (we used this threshold to give a bit of slack for mis-tapping :) Also, you have a number of hints to help you play (more at the easy, less at the hard level). To fit any taste, you can choose between a lush tile look or a more classic board look :) \n________________________________ \nYou gain access to medium level after you win the easy level 2 times consecutively, same for hard level (3 times)\n________________________________\nWhat our testers are saying:\n\n\u2022 \"The game is perfect!
