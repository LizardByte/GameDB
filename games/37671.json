Taking inspiration from games like Ikari Warriors and Commando, with a good dollop of Rambo to top it off, Bloody Wolf gives you guns, death and destruction. What more could you want? Viewed from a sort of overhead/side on angle, you have to make your way through town, river, forest and many other types of terrain with just your wits and a massive weapon under your arm. Along the way you will get the chance to rescue hostages - hiding in trucks, caves, tied to trees etc - and by opening crates you gain useful power ups. These include things like spread shot, flame thrower, rockets and frag grenades, but also contain more subtle items like flippers that allow you to move faster when ducked under water. Also, if you manage to shoot someone off their motorbike, you can get on it and race away, mercilessly running down anyone who gets in your way. At various points in the level you will come across bosses that break up the action a little. Also, you have the ability to jump, which comes in handy when traversing chasms or avoiding any suspicious rolling logs that may be out to get you. \n \n-http://www.pcengine.co.uk/HTML_Games/Bloody_Wolf.htm", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/narazumono-sentou-butai"}
