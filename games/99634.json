Choose yours wisely when picking for your cult, cult leader, the Divine Being that they worship, the Holy Room in which they prove their dedication and the followers that will become the cultists of tomorrow!\n\nBeing snappy dressers isn't enough, your cult must run like a well-oiled hypno wheel. Set schedules for your cultists, level them up and manage food and maintenance systems. Assign tasks to your cultists based on a priority system, who said micro-management doesn't work?!\n\nCultists have needs too and you'll have to ensure that all of yours are fed, watered and having lots of fun! You must take care of your cult's physical and mental well-being to allow them to be the best cult members they can possibly be!\n\nCultists can be sent on missions in the local town.
