To successfully complete each level, the player must arrange the stuffed animals in such a way as to make them all \"happy\" before bedtime. Each stuffed animal has it's own preferences (and physics), so this is easier said than done. Despite the relaxing atmosphere, make no mistake, 'Easy' difficulty is enjoyable for kids and casual gamers, 'Normal' and 'Hard' are a challenge that any puzzle gamer can appreciate."}
