Like SimCity, it requires you to build a functioning metropolis. However, City Life also adds a social aspect to the game. Your city is populated by citizens of six different economic classifications, from \"Have-Nots\" to \"Blue Collars\" to \"Elites\". Each social stratus has its own needs, some of which conflict with the needs of the other social classes. So you have to balance the social needs of your citizens as well as the zoning needs of your city. You have to adapt your strategies according to the citizens' needs, who communicate with you. \n \nA large amount of detailed structures is available, both commercial and residential. There are 22 maps with different goals, but an editor has been included to design custom maps, or you can start in the sandbox mode. Custom maps and scenarios can be exported and shared with other players. City Life is powered by a full 3D engine, allowing for full rotation and zooming as if you are walking in your own streets.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/city-life"}
