Players will experience procedurally generated levels with increasing difficulty. To beat a sector all space bases need to be defeated. Each base will constantly construct enemy ships to defend themselves and the ship type and strength is determined by what sector you are in. Skill based firing mechanics, rotational controlled power attacks, increasing level difficulty, and endless procedurally generated levels are some of the features players will experience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
