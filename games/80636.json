Your aim as the \"Doodlebug\" is to make your way through five different levels (with three sub-levels each), killing baddies by jumping on their heads until you eventually make it to the final baddie.\n\nThe most unique thing about this game is the novel theme at its centre: You can choose between five different coloured pencils to throw at your baddies (presuming you've picked some up). If the pencil's flight path is uninterrupted then they'll draw a useful item for you: Either an Umbrella (for long falls), Ball (to be able to jump onto higher platforms), a Potion (invincibility), a Clock (stops time) and an Eraser (kills everything on screen).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doodlebug-bug-bash-ii"}
