You play against the computer, with your ship at the bottom of the screen. The enemy ship soon appears at or around the top of the screen. Once sited, the computer announces 'Clear for Action!' in large text. You maneuver your ship, as does the computer, to acquire the best angle for a broadside, using the wind to best advantage. You have a choice of solid, grape or chain shot, depending if you want to damage the sails, the hull, or the men. After some exchange of cannon fire, the ships then grapple and attempt to board the enemy ship for combat with the crew, with the winner typically having the most crew to begin with, taking into account experience.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clear-for-action"}
