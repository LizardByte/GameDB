Now, in a rare opportunity, 2 of the original mappers, Steve Duff and Rob Berkowitz, and his son, Leo Berahovich, along with a team of veterans and fans of RoC, have combined to create Realm of Chaos 2: The Revenge of '96! The style of this megawad is oldschool with occasional fashion-forward maps. The mix is eclectic, similar to the original RoC, with broadly defined episode themes. Difficulty ranges from mild to challenging, especially in the episode-ending maps.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/realm-of-chaos-2"}
