Like its predecessor, Side Pocket 2, it features the in-game likeness of a real-life professional pool player. In this case, it's JPBA member, Kyoko Sone.\n\nUnlike the prior installments in the Side Pocket series, Side Pocket 3 renders the pool room environment with 3D polygons. In spite of this, the table can still be viewed in a traditional, top-down fashion.\n\nPlay modes consist of: story mode, training mode, trick game mode, and versus mode. Game variants include: eight ball, nine ball, rotation, 14.1 continuous, bowlliards, cutthroat, three ball, poker, pocket game, mitsudama, and yotsudama.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 55261, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1fB1TD5k5ro"}, {"id": 55262, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AFSiYowRV5I"}]}
