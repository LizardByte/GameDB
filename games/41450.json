Haul cargos to and from the cities of your choosing using your trusty road map. The player also has to watch out for Smokey or he will end up with a nifty speeding ticket. Deliver the cargo safely and it's on to the next job in Truckin'. \n \nThe screen is split in to halves, and a rear-mirror is featured. Players need to avoid incoming trucks and carefully plan the routes, even by consulting a real paper map to find the correct side roads. Some of the scenery included features Texas, Kansas and New York with distinct differences in the environment.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/truckin"}
