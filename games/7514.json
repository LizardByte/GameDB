The game features two playable characters: Queen Valanice and her daughter, Princess Rosella, who become separated in a magical realm called Eldritch. Players alternate between the two characters as they navigate through six chapters, each set in a distinct fantasy world. The story revolves around Rosella's unexpected journey to Eldritch and Valanice's quest to find her daughter, with both facing various challenges and encountering colorful characters along the way. King's Quest VII departs from the series' traditional art style, adopting a more cartoon-like aesthetic inspired by Disney animated films. The game incorporates point-and-click gameplay, puzzle-solving, and character interactions typical of the adventure genre, while expanding on the King's Quest universe with new locations and a focus on female protagonists.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/king-s-quest-vii-the-princeless-bride--1"}
