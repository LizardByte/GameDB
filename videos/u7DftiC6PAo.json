The forward alternate shot can be charged up twice but the all directions one can only be charged up once. This one seems better than the lvl 1 forward shot for getting gems though. \nThe alternate shot gets stuck in enemy hitboxes and deals damage in an area of effect way. \nSucking up items while charging the shot makes it charge up faster. \n\nThere seems to a bit of a Radiant Silvergun thing going on in this game where your shot power is linked to how well you play the game for score. The first time I played this it took me like half an hour to kill the final boss because my shot power was so low from not scoring. The shot power is the level counter at the top of the screen.\n\nThere is a sort of auto-bomb in this game. On normal it consumes two bombs. \nRed bullets can be cancelled with the alternate shot. \n\nThe scoring system is quite complicated. First of all there is a global chain counter. Letting it run out will quickly deplete your chain while killing enemies and picking up items raises it. The rate at which the meter depletes slows down when you have a charge shot ready. \nUsing a bomb freezes the chain meter altogether and is useful for bridging gaps when there are long pauses. \n\nBesides the global chain counter there also seems to be a more stricter item chaining. Collecting items in quick succession makes them increase in size and value. If you don't pick up any items after a few seconds the size resets back to small. \n\nGems can be auto-collected at the right side of the screen while the rings can be auto-collected on the left side of the screen.\nAfter every so few hits you get an automatic auto-collect. \n\nGetting the automatic auto-collect and picking up items gives you invincibility for a few seconds. \n\nSucking up bigger items makes you charge the alternate shot faster. This is extremely important, especially at the final boss. \nIf you lose the high item value it can be really hard to build it back up and you lose a significant amount of damage output and it takes way longer to clear the screen of enemies. \n\nGame page:\nhttp://www.01step.net/tobitsuki/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7DftiC6PAo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7DftiC6PAo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7DftiC6PAo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7DftiC6PAo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7DftiC6PAo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "\u3068\u3073\u3064\u304d\u3072\u3081 ~ Tobitsukihime - Normal Mode ALL Clear - 133 Million", "description": "Here's an interesting doujin I stumbled upon. \nIt seems to date all the way back to 2005 and even though it's really old and obscure it seems quite legit.\n\nBesides your normal shot you also have an alternate shot. \nThis one is divided into two buttons; one that shoots it straight and the other lets you shoot it at all angles.
