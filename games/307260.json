After a constant chase between them, one day both sides get tired of this situation and make an indefinite peace agreement.\nAfter long days of peace, both sides start to have disagreements among themselves. Perhaps because of this habit of division inherited from humans, they start to fight among themselves.\nOne day, one of the mice offers an alliance agreement to the one of the cats side. According to this agreement, these cats that are in alliance will support the mice in the war of mice, and the mice will support the cats in the war of cats. But what they do not take into account is this: The cats and mice on the other side have already formed an alliance among themselves against them. They have spent so much time with humans in the past that their nature has become like them.\nAnd as a result, the mice start to fight by riding cats with their weapons, just like their human ancestors who rode horses with their weapons. The war between cats and mice has begun.", "summary": "Online PvP and Battle Royal Experience with Cats and Mice characters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cats-and-mice", "videos": [{"id": 117826, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "685rEJjdwvA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=685rEJjdwvA", "title": "Cats And Mice Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/685rEJjdwvA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
