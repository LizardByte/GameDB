Thanks to the Golden core of \"The Golden Gravebringer\", the NGSM galactic battle station, an unlimited potential can be seen.

Remote Space Monkeys have gone full rogue, your only choice is to destroy them and gather any other resources you can find on the boundaries of space and time itself. Will you be able to find a way back to The Golden Gravebringer and seek out The Golden Leader?", "summary": "A classic 2D, metroidvania where you explore the color dimension of the space monkeys.
