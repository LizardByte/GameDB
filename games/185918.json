Kubebird looks a lot like a bird but in cube shape, covered with fluffy fur. They are a social species, live peacefully year by year, and never worry about their surroundings. One day, the island where Kubebird lived, however, was invaded by some wicked insects. To protect their nests, Kubebirds have evolved and developed special skills to fight against their enemies and regain peace for the island once again.\n\nIn this game, the player must carefully control Kubebird to deftly pass through the onslaught of those evil insects and destroy them with special bullets. Each Kubebird is unique and acquires different skills and the amount of Kubebirds that players hold can be increased through breeding. When you have 3 Kubebirds, you are ready to fight against those fierce insects. Tokens that are gained through battling can help your Kubebirds become sturdier and stronger. More specifically, Kubebird can be bought and sold through the \"Marketplace\" to meet the needs of players.\n\nKubebird is a proud result of our development team. It is the perfect combination of shoot 'em up game genre and NTF game - one of the most advanced blockchain technologies. The most important goal that we want to achieve through the game is how we can give our players an enjoyable moment with the convenience of playing a play-to-earn game. Anyone can log into Kubebird anytime and anywhere; all you need is your phone and a stable internet connection.", "summary": "KubeBird is the new NFT game (side scrolling shooting type) from the creators of Plant VS Undead and it's designed to revolve around the combination between your skills and fun-to-play experience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 62558, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "061TA-1wY6U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=061TA-1wY6U", "title": "Kube Bird - Annoucement Teaser OFFICIAL", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/061TA-1wY6U/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 62559, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fv1MkUpwaW0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv1MkUpwaW0", "title": "KUBEBIRD GAMEPLAY", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fv1MkUpwaW0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
