Then, the next day after all the people have left the building, you go to the top floor with a ball of cotton. You light it up and carefully go down the building floor by floor, picking up gas cans, pouring their contents all over the place, sometimes just running the fuse over them and letting them explode. This is depicted in ASCII graphics and using speaker sound.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pyro-ii", "videos": [{"id": 30176, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "7IoD7YnnI-c"}]}
