Just tap on the screen to drop a coin into the target. The more accurate and sweet the toss, the more levels you will beat.\nYou can play it anywhere, anytime. It's super simple to learn but hard to master! If you think you are smart enough and quick enough, give it a try; it won't be as easy as it sounds."}
