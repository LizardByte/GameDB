Crystals replace health, magic, money and other stats! \n \nManage your crystals while battling through waves of weird monsters in this turn-based RPG. \n \nAfter each battle there's an opportunity to meet the inhabitants of a peaceful town and stock up on items and useful skills. But beware: everything has to be paid with crystals and if you run out, your life comes to an end. Will you be killed by a raging tomato head? Will you shop yourself to death? Or will you triumph over all the demonic forces that await you? Is there ONLY ONE strategy to win? \n \nMade for GMTK Jam 2019 within 48 hours.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/statless"}
