A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda (\u30e8\u30eb\u30c0, Yoruda), a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Later, as they try to escape on the bridge, it splits up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness.\n\nIco awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen's death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She wakes up and smiles at Ico.\n\nShadow of the Colossus:\nThe story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across a long bridge on his horse, Agro. Unknown to the player, prior to entering, Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi.[34] Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several humanoid shadow creatures appear and approach Wander before he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as \"Dormin\" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which Dormin states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall by using the ancient sword to kill each colossus the idols represent located throughout the land. Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them.", "summary": "The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection is a video game bundle that contains high-definition remasters of two older PlayStation 2 games for the PlayStation 3, and was developed by Bluepoint Games and released alongside Ico as The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection in September 2011.\n\nThe Collection features:\n- High-definition (HD) graphics\n- Content previously missing from the North American release\n- PlayStation Network Trophies\n- 3D support.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ico-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-collection", "videos": [{"id": 40237, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eo0k0q7X47w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo0k0q7X47w", "title": "ICO & Shadow of the Colossus Collection - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eo0k0q7X47w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
