Set sail on the vast and beautiful Caribbean Sea as players commence their journey with their sights on eternal gold and glory.

It's a vast world out there, but you are never truly alone, and players will encounter historical pirate captains who they must decide is friend or foe. Take on trading convoys and settlements in tactical turn-based battles to relieve them of the burden of wealth, and then use your (stolen) riches to upgrade your formidable fleet. With a mighty fleet and enough gold, you might be able to keep your crew happy. But be warned! You are an elected captain, after all, and it is your duty to maintain your crew's morale, or else mutiny could be on the horizon\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 73680, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "Sk0v3COZ0EA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk0v3COZ0EA", "title": "Tortuga: A Pirate's Tale - Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sk0v3COZ0EA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 73712, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "bBrAm9-pApo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBrAm9-pApo", "title": "Tortuga A Pirate's Tale - Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2022", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bBrAm9-pApo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
