However, four rascals are guarding the castle: Sylvester, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and Wile E. Coyote. While presented in a side-scroller format, Crazy Castle differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny (ironically) did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invisible potions, or safes that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a \"puzzle-solving\" atmosphere. Because most NES game cartridges lacked the ability to save, passwords can be used to start at a certain level in this game. This is an especially helpful feature of the game, as it would take longer to complete the 80 levels than is really feasible for one sitting.\n\nKnown on Famicom as: Roger Rabbit \n\nNES Relatives: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2bz751BCEE\n\n\nNESGUIDE ARCHIVE INFO\n\nThe original NES gameplay archive, est 2007 includes gameplay captures from all commercial releases from the US market with a few extras (like famicom releases) just for fun.
