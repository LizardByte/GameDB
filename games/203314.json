The objective is to light up the cells in each level with a special seed known as the sporos. Players drag pieces onto the board one at a time, arranging them to extend all the way down every row and column. Sporos demands a mix of skill, luck, and logic; in order to succeed, players will conduct clever experiments like scientists in a lab. The soothing electronic music helps you keep your cool, while the colorful graphics lend the game a spacey, biological vibe. Sporos starts off easy, but with hundreds of levels and multiple solutions for each, it will take a true puzzle genius to master this stylish, colorful app.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sporos", "videos": [{"id": 68952, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "z6DW5mr5IPI"}]}
