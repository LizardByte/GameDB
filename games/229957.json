At the child stage, the Tamagotchi goes to preschool and receives a new toy. At the teen stage, they go to the Gotchi Performing Arts School and join a band with two other characters. The new band is taught by Classictchi until the band members reach adulthood. As adults, they perform in front of a panel of judges. If any judge votes \"no\", the band can only do street performances until their next attempt. If the judges all vote \"yes\", the band debuts as a professional band.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tamagotchi-music-star", "videos": [{"id": 81502, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hWoe-STyFPQ"}]}
