Endless League is a free-to-play MOBA game with 5v5 and free-for-all game modes.\n\nIn Endless League, players take control of their customizable battle ships and jump into the battlefield. Unlike many other MOBA games, game characters are not living beings which gives them some unique gameplay mechanics. Each ship in Endless League has different phsical properties like thrust, mass, inertia etc. So even movement and positioning requires certain level of skill.\n\nPlayers receive different objectives depending on the game mode. As players complete mini-objectives, they can upgrade their ships which will help them complete the main objective.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/endless-league", "videos": [{"id": 22779, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "39d0y8vZgLU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39d0y8vZgLU", "title": "Endless League", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39d0y8vZgLU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
