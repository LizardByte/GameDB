Androman also had a barcode scanner in his bottom that would read barcodes placed on the map so the 2600 (and the robot) knew where he was. Using a combination of the joystick and barcodes, the player could guide Androman around the floor mat and play various games. One of those games being Androman on the Moon.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/androman-on-the-moon", "videos": [{"id": 98611, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "oWM3gfBn4QM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWM3gfBn4QM", "title": "AndroMan on the Moon (Atari 2600)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oWM3gfBn4QM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
