The game will be available with the most important features and game modes. All other mechanics, some of which you could've already observed on this channel earlier, will be added/migrated later.\n\nThe current state of the early-access version contains the following features:\n1. 9 Unique characters with different equipment, skills and abilities. \n2. Basic combat system, with class differences for specific characters.\n3. Most of the weapon types.\n4. Maps: Lost Camp, Borderlands, Arena.\n5. Game Modes: Team Deathmatch, Control, Freeplay.\n6. Host/Join from the game or a Linux Dedicated Server for download. (Requires additional setup)\n7. Emotes.\n\nCheck out the other videos on this channel, they show many other features that will be added to the game after the early access release.\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Kingdomfall_\nhttps://www.indiedb.com/games/kingdomfall\nhttps://discord.gg/Bn2ScFTv", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6GisqoUnsg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6GisqoUnsg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6GisqoUnsg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6GisqoUnsg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D6GisqoUnsg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "KINGDOMFALL - EARLY ACCESS TRAILER!", "description": "Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030350/Kingdomfall/\n\nIt's been a looong path and finally I'm happy to share the steam early access trailer!
