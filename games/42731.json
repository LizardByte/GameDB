Large red gunships can be shot down to gain power-ups for the helicopter in order to upgrade the guns and have it fire homing missiles. Each level features a midboss and a boss, and both must be destroyed in order to advance to the next level. The style of the levels as the player advances alternates between \"Shooting Mode\" and \"Exploration Mode,\" where the latter involves levels set in a fantasy-like setting and are the only level types that provide no power-ups to the player and give the player the ability to switch their altitude.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/d-force"}
