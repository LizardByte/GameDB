It is the eighth installment of the MAYhem series, and was led by James Caldwell (Obsidian).\nThe megawad includes textures from Blood and Clive Barker's Undying, and as such, most maps carry a darker, horror-esque atmosphere. Additionally, the WAD features very extensive DeHackEd work, adding custom weapons, items and a wide range of custom monsters as well as new sprites for some of the original monsters", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mayhem-2019-blood-for-the-doom-god"}
