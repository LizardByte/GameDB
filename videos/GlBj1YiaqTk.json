I'm a solo developer who has been working day and night for over 2 years on this project. If you like the demo please think about donating to help show appreciation and support.  For the small group of people already following this project I was only promising a small arena fighter, but I am strong believer in under promising and over delivering so here we are! I want to deliver the best possible experience I can when I release the full paid version so your thoughts and impressions(and bug reports) really mean a lot to me. Too many games today are release in half finished state which is why I am releasing this as a free demo to help iron out all the issues that come up before moving on to the full scale world development.
