But life\u2019s got other plans, and they all involve chairs.\n\nDesigned as a free playable short for Valve\u2019s new Steam Deck, Desk Job walks you through the handheld\u2019s controls and features, while not being nearly as boring as that sounds.\n\nLower your expectations: This is not a sequel to Portal.
