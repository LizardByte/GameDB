With the money earned in these sci-fi contests, improved equipment can be bought in five categories, making the robot more powerful, more maneuverable and less easy to damage. On the other hand, getting damaged means you must spend money on repairs. This encourages careful and effective playing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
