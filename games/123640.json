{"id": 123640, "name": "Whirled", "slug": "whirled", "summary": "Whirled is a virtual world website and video game created by Three Rings Design. Its Open Beta stage was announced at the Game Developers Conference in 2007. It makes use of Adobe Flash as an applet embedded into the website while also having pages of HTML and JavaScript in a sidebar to allow players to manage their friends list and browse various categories of user-generated content.\n\nThe concept is comparable to the virtual worlds in the PlayStation 3 game Home and Second Life, while also incorporating aspects of feed-based social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. It pushes to make all content user-created, mainly with its approach to creative accessibility using Flash's affinity for 2D vector graphics and various web compatibilities to make it very simple for players to upload a wide variety of content using simple, conventional file formats.\n\nUpon Grey Havens releasing the source code for Whirled under their BSD License, several mirror sites formed. While they had no access to the original database, a lot of content was copied across to create a similar experience managed by the community.\n\nThe Whirled Club is the only mirror sites that is active at the moment. You can download the client here to load flash content [ https://wcmedia.xyz/client/wcclient-v1.1.2-setup.exe ].\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/whirled"}
