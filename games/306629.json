Beatrice was initially set to become a prosecutor at the prodigal age of 20, but dramatic life events disrupted her studies and she failed the bar exam on her first, second and third try. Despite her young age, Beatrice was convinced she was a failure. This was until she met a new professor at the law school she was studying. The professor\u2019s name was Marlin Astar, a retired criminal defence attorney. Despite being a fine defence attorney when he was practicing law, he was not as renowned as the likes of Mia Fey, Kristoph Gavin, or Phoenix Wright. He\u2019d won his fair share of trials but had no such \u2018perfect record\u2019. He was however known in the legal sector for his flair for theatrics in the courtroom wearing a full set of knight's armour to all his trials, and bearing a shield that he\u2019d slam on the defence bench in objection! Marlin helped Beatrice in this dark time in her life by both tutoring her and amusing her with her theatrical personality and happy-go-lucky attitude. Being a student of Astar, Beatrice naturally changed her career path to becoming a defence attorney. After passing the bar exam on her fourth try at the age of 22, Beatrice joins \u2018Astar Spectacular Law Offices'.", "summary": "Beatrice Verdict Ace Attorney: The Hidden Truth, is a fangame set after the third game in the original Ace Attorney Trilogy, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/beatrice-verdict-ace-attorney-the-hidden-truth"}
