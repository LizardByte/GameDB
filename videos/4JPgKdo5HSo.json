It's a FREE update for YIIK: A Postmodern RPG owners!\n\nAn unusual error manifests on April 4th, a day that echoes the enigmatic code 404. In a desperate act of innocence, a child relinquishes her name for an invitation to a birthday party, her hope tethered to the faint possibility of finding her brother. Meanwhile, Alex, a recent college graduate, returns home, only to find his reality unspooling like a threadbare tapestry. Guided by a cat which slips through the very fabric of his mind, Alex descends into the depths of his consciousness where he witnesses the impossible: a woman, locked away in an iron maiden, vanishing into thin air. A vision which ignites an undying obsession and threatens to unravel the boundaries of his world.\n\n\u2022 Combat in YIIK I.V is an arcane dance, a turn-based system where players use everyday weapons against bizarre entities, aided by the power of Karta. When players or enemies take damage, they start to bleed, and every action taken while bleeding brings them closer to defeat. It\u2019s a race against time to outlast the enemy and stem the flow of blood.\n\n\u2022 Navigate landscapes that blur the line between reality and dreams. These spaces are filled with intricate puzzles, deadly traps, and odd adversaries that challenge your perception, pushing the boundaries of what you know to be real.\n\n\u2022 The narrative shifts between the perspectives of Alex and the Nameless Child, drawing you into their separate yet intertwined realities, each twist revealing deeper layers of their destinies.\n\n\u2022 The game\u2019s soundtrack features over 200 tracks across a wide range of genres, from drum and bass to progressive rock. Much of the music is performed by live musicians, adding a vibrant and authentic layer to the experience.\n\nwww.yiikrpg.com\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/459080/YIIK_A_Postmodern_RPG/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4JPgKdo5HSo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4JPgKdo5HSo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4JPgKdo5HSo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4JPgKdo5HSo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4JPgKdo5HSo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "YIIK I.V Release Date Announcement", "description": "YIIK I.V drops on December 2nd, 2024!  \nAnd the best part?
