The main characters of the game are the Minos, the pieces that make up the Tetris board. There are four locations where you can play Tetris: the circus, the fire station, the laboratory, and the haunted house. Each board requires a certain amount of lines to be cleared to win Tetris. Since the game is a variation for children, the blocks start out small and fall down slowly. As the game progresses, the pieces become more complex and they fall down faster. After you win, there are many toys and stage props that you can play with in the activity center. You can also print out coloring pages based on the game and a certificate for each stage you play. The game supports both single player and multiplayer. The game is playable with the on-screen mouse controls or the keyboard.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kids-tetris", "videos": [{"id": 76263, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Fk61NgvNbts", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk61NgvNbts", "title": "Kids Tetris World Record", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fk61NgvNbts/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 516, "name": "Tetris"}]}
