After hours, the entrance is buried by snow, preventing its exit. You have no choice but to head towards the strange noises coming from the depths of the building.\n\nNow, you'll need to go through several dark rooms to find another exit.\n\nInspired by classic 2D sokobans, Friagem mixes the mechanics of pushing boxes to specific locations with elements of horror and suspense. You'll need to use the objects scattered throughout the levels to create a path to the next room, depending on the dim light from your flares to light your way as you explore the lab.\n\nBut beware, you don't seem to be the only one wandering around in rooms that haven't seen the light of day for a long time.", "summary": "A game that mixes the mechanics of pushing boxes to specific locations with elements of horror and suspense.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/friagem", "videos": [{"id": 56842, "video_id": "hM131qrpPA8"}, {"id": 56864, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hM131qrpPA8"}]}
