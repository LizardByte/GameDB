You control Lupin, and your goal in each stage is to find a red and a green ring, and bring them to a goat's head mounted on the wall to open the secret exit to the next level. In addition to the typical walking and jumping controls, Lupin has several attacks: a short range sword strike, a long range gun shot (if you have enough bullets) and a flash-bomb which is triggered while jumping, and destroys all enemies on the screen. Special items, such as the rings, can be found in niches which Lupin can break open with his sword. Some of the niches are hidden.\n\nIn addition to the rings, there are other items that can be found in niches, or occasionally dropped by defeated foes. There is ammo for your gun, a shirt that gives you temporary invincibility, rockets which can be used to launch a rope to access higher parts of the level, as well as goggles which hinder your ability to move. On some levels, a lady occasionally runs across the screen, and if you have a coin when she runs past, you will receive an item in return.\n\nMost of the items found are cups. These add to a special slider at the top of the screen, and When you pick up a tea pot, the cup statistic is converted into life energy. Energy is lost by touching enemies, or traps such as falling chandeliers. When your energy reaches zero, the game is over. A password is shown at the end of each completed level, allowing you to start where you left off without having to replay the entire game.", "summary": "A video game adaption of Hayao Miyazaki's Lupin III anime film of the same name.
