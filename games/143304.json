They\u2019ve established deep ties with the politicians of New Shore, and specialize in high-end rackets. They often take their success for granted, leaving their guard down: a key weakness that is exploited by other families. \n \nThe Calessi family is a family that is known for its code of honor and respectable operation (for a crime family, at least). Their strategy can be described as \u201cstrength in numbers\u201d, and they have a growing network of associates throughout the city. They traditionally have had the strongest reputation with the Commission out of the five families. \n \nThe Donano family is a mysterious family that prefers to stay out of sight and out of trouble. They prefer not to get involved in conflicts, but that shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for pacifism. Their influence on city politics and the media should not be underestimated. If you wrong them, you\u2019ll find yourself with the whole city turned against you. \n \nThe Junio family is a boisterous family that is largely comprised of immigrants from the old country who settled in 1890s Fordham. They specialize in low-end rackets that don\u2019t take much time or investment. They seem to find profits in places other families would deem a waste of time. They are the ever-present underdogs of New Shore. \n \nThe Rocca family is a dangerous family that has no qualms about engaging in high-risk rackets and killing those who get in their way. The Rocca family faces perpetual inner turmoil, but no one can deny their influence over the city. Nearly everyone knows someone who fell victim to the senseless violence of the Rocca family\u2019s machinations.", "summary": "The Commission 1920 is a turn-based strategy game set in the roaring 1920s where you play as a Don of a mafia family. The goal is to manage your resources and exert your influence on the city to remove competing powers using violence, politics, and careful investment of illegal rackets. The Commission 1920 is a re-imagining of the original The Commission game.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-commission-1920", "videos": [{"id": 45359, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Nvtg_nMzA9w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvtg_nMzA9w", "title": "The Commission 1920: Organized Crime Grand Strategy Teaser", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nvtg_nMzA9w/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 45358, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5L_fLyKzXcg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L_fLyKzXcg", "title": "The Commission 1920 Mood Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5L_fLyKzXcg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
