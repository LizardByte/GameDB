If so, grab your gun and join the most violent TV show in the history of violent TV shows! Participants will have to shoot, smash and rip through hundreds of enemies on their way to victory!\n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged by THE GIANT F*ING BOSSES that are more than capable of turning your innards outwards \u2013 just grab the best perks and weapons along the way. Make your gun spew molten lava all over the floor, turn yourself into a berserker, and let your bullets bounce between enemies! All these things stack, so you have every opportunity to turn your furry warrior into a raging death machine.\n\nYou\u2019ll still die, though. That\u2019s just how life is, even for those who wield a rail gun. But who cares about death when your audience loves YOU? Unlike real life, here you can make good use of the likes you receive.\n\nUse your new-found fame to help upgrade every item and every perk to deal even more damage when you head out again. Oh, don\u2019t worry about getting bored: every episode of the show is randomized so you\u2019ll never have the same run twice in-a-row.\n\nAnd, when you are completely done with show business, invite your friends and party-up with co-op mode with up to four players! Play smart and synergize with the team or bash their teeth in when they will try to steal your power-ups: every dirty trick in the book is valid, and every strategy works as long as you are having fun.\n\nSo, are you ready to sign the contract?", "summary": "The Crackpet Show is an action-packed rogue-lite shoot-'em-up about mutated animals that fight in a bizarre TV show, crushing their opponents with a variety of weapons.
