It's hard to imagine anyone getting very far on the actual hardware, but of course they do. It was difficult enough via emulation with the flickering sprites so hats of to the best of the best that can handle this game on the actual WonderSwan which is made more difficult with its small blurry slow refreshing screen.\n\n I have aimed to show the game being unlocked all the way to level 50 (which I wrongly assumed was as I high as it goes) although I do think I have unlocked everything, The last unlock being the Debug Shot, a super powerful weapon but wouldn't you know it, bugged in this game version.\n\n I have shown hard mode played with both ships and both special modes. The rest of the video is replaying over and over to unlock more stuff. Towards the end I enable Godmode to clear the levels even faster to get the final unlock\n\nFor youtubes 30fps limit, I encoded a special blended version so that all the flicker sprites can be seen. Also multiple plays have been cut for video length.\n\n 00:00:00 - First Play on Hard. Unlocks Training and Special modes and more credits.\n\n 00:28:05 - Special Mode (Boss Rush) played. More credits unlocked. and Extra ship unlocked.\n\n 00:41:33 - Hard Mode played, G-Xacalia ship used.
