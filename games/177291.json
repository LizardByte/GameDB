If there is no food... you become the food!!!\n\nThe spoopiness in this one is lagging a bit though. I hope you enjoy it anyway :)\n\nThe game does not yet have a propper ending, because I had to finish it in a very small amout of time.\n\nIf the mouse sensitivity feels off for some reason, I reccomend downloading the standalone build. There seems to be a weird bug with the mouse sensitivity.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hungry-ducks"}
