Think of a cuddly version of Jet Set Radio in terms of visual look. The game sees the player preparing dishes in a kitchen, jumping up stairs with a plank of wood on the shoulder as logs roll down and giving out tissues to people coming out of the train station. Quite a mull of mini games with a very unique graphical style and its own gags thrown in.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
