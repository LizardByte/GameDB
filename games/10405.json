{"id": 10405, "name": "Heavyweight Transport Simulator", "summary": "As a haulier focused on heavy transports there is no transport problem you can\u2019t deal with. Whether \"normal\" heavy cargo or loads of more than 400 tonnes (800 000 pounds), you transport each single freight safely to its destination. Powerful tractor units in different classes of load capacities and the required, matching semi-trailers are loaded in delivery order. Even in the event of special transports with unusual and challenging dimensions you keep cool and calm and know exactly how to remove obstacles, such as signs and stones efficiently from the road.\n\nGood planning is the basis for a smooth work flow. Therefore careful preparation of the routes, precise time management and the gauging of loading and unloading facilities are among the routine tasks of your team. But only if you are aware of all the possible challenges will you be able to work uninterrupted!"}
