It was a game that had rumble system in the cartridge.\n\nThe player plays the Jill (Dori Kururiin the Japanese version). She is the daughter of Doug, the leader of the bandit gang known the The Red Dozers. Doug was ambushed by a rival gang known to the Skullkers. They Attacked the Red Dozers to steal the powerful Red Diamond, a gift from Jill's dead mother. To retrieve it, Jill mounts the powerful vehicle, the Drill Dozer and will have to go through the stages collecting treasures and winning battles against the Red Dozers, for it has a drill that can be rotated to the clockwise and counterclockwise depending on situation, and involve puzzles and be necessary and must take two gears at each stage to advance. The video was recorded twice: first playthrough normally and the second was dedicated to collect all the treasures, maxed drill level (necessary to broke more obstacles), extras and beat last stages again with more better rank. A long, good and very underrated game. Hope you enjoy!\n\nYou can visit my channel too in https://www.youtube.com/user/xRavenXP -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XcOZQhg7QA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XcOZQhg7QA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7XcOZQhg7QA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Game Boy Advance Longplay [225] Drill Dozer", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nThis is the longplay game Drill Dozer (known as Screw Breaker Goshin Drillero in Japan), a platform/action game/metroidvania released for Game Boy Advance, released in 2005 in Japan and 2006 in North America.
