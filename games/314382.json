The protagonist of the game this time is Gloria, already met in the past and now Michael's girlfriend. Employed at MANN as an assistant, waiting to finish her studies in Archeology, Sofia will accompany us on her journey to discover love and its many facets.\nIt will be a timeless love, as once again we will travel through the centuries, experiencing important chapters in the history of humanity. We will meet an ancient Etruscan in Capua in 475 BC, Cleopatra and Marco Antonio sailing in the Mediterranean and Charles Dickens at the time of his trip to Naples in 1844. Once again in the magnificent city that hosts the MANN, we will live the most tragic and exciting moments of the 4 days that shook Naples in 1943, during the Second World War.\nAgainst the backdrop of these events, we will find ourselves visiting the halls of the MANN, one of the most important archaeological museums in the world, coming into contact with works and finds related to the historical characters present in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/father-and-son-2", "videos": [{"id": 123591, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RytBsUjL59Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RytBsUjL59Q", "title": "Trailer Father and Son 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RytBsUjL59Q/sddefault.jpg"}]}
