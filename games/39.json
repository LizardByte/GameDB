Driven by third-person gunplay, realistic driving mechanics and advanced graphics, Mafia immerses the player into a real-world mobster story.\n\nMafia contains a much bigger city to explore than most video games of the time, with multiple forms of available transport in addition to an expansive countryside. The game received positive reviews for the Windows version, with critics praising the game as a more realistic and serious Grand Theft Auto-styled game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mafia", "videos": [{"id": 17860, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "HMChqEQqj7o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMChqEQqj7o", "title": "Mafia - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HMChqEQqj7o/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1187, "name": "Michelle"}, {"id": 1593, "name": "Frank"}, {"id": 3469, "name": "Ralph"}, {"id": 13304, "name": "Paulie"}, {"id": 412, "name": "Sarah"}, {"id": 15497, "name": "Yellow Pete"}, {"id": 15496, "name": "Don Morello"}, {"id": 419, "name": "Sam"}, {"id": 15495, "name": "Detective Norman"}, {"id": 15492, "name": "Don Salieri"}, {"id": 15494, "name": "Luigi"}, {"id": 15493, "name": "Lucas Bertone"}, {"id": 15491, "name": "Thomas 'Tommy' Angelo"}, {"id": 6739, "name": "Vincenzo"}]}
