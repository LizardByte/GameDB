The Global Defense Initiative is an international security force set to combat global terrorism. Conceived as a united peacekeeping military force, GDI depends on the technological sophistication of its weaponry, and the superior training and loyalties of its officers. GDI looks to halt the spread of Tiberium, which is gradually destroying the Earth and killing off millions of people.\n\nAt the same time, the Brotherhood of Nod, led by the charismatic leader known only as Kane, grew to prominence. Working largely in third world countries, wherever there was discontent and unrest, there was Kane. With the promise of a New World Order and bankrolled by the illicit Tiberium research and trade that Kane made famous, Nod began to gain power. A few scattered, disaffected units grew into an army with powerful atomic weaponry, ruthless tactics, and a Tiberian fortune. The Brotherhood aims to push humanity into the next stage of evolution via Tiberium mutation.\n\nWhere GDI stands for international stability and the removal of the Tiberium contagion, Nod seeks to overthrow the established order and build a world centred on Tiberium research.", "summary": "Renegade X is a free Tactical Shooter that brings the Command and Conquer FPS experience to Unreal Engine 3. Renegade X is developed by Totem Arts, an independent group of Command & Conquer fans from around the world dedicated to bringing the world of C&C to you, up close and personal.\n\nTwo factions, the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod (Nod), are locked into a conflict over the green and mysterious resource Tiberium.\nThe primary game mode is Command & Conquer (C&C/CnC), where your objective is to destroy your enemy's base using any and all means necessary.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/renegade-x", "videos": [{"id": 41907, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "GL-sKU3wrgY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL-sKU3wrgY", "title": "Firestorm Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GL-sKU3wrgY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 84503, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "k-bLTYiaqqk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-bLTYiaqqk", "title": "Renegade X - Release Date Unveiled", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k-bLTYiaqqk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 84504, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "PQKyp6wkpmQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQKyp6wkpmQ", "title": "Nod vs Blackhand: Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PQKyp6wkpmQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 84505, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "x6loeCpRBZ4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6loeCpRBZ4", "title": "Renegade X: Tiberian Sun X", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x6loeCpRBZ4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 84506, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_VHennwBhG8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VHennwBhG8", "title": "Renegade X - #JustDoItUp", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_VHennwBhG8/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 16206, "name": "\u00ad"}]}
