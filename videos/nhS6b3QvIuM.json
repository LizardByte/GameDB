Desperate and suicidal, Amanda makes a deal with the devil. Selling her soul, she is given the chance to plunge into the bowels of a concentration camp-esque hell in an attempt to rescue her daughter's soul. The only aids she has in the bowels of hell are Virgil, a strange reptilian creature who Amanda must free from an enchanted sword, and four hellish beings called the Entities.\r\n\r\nThe Lost's development period had always been relatively rocky. Playable models of the game had been described as unstable, with a jittery framerate. [1] The developer chose to retool the graphics engine in mid-development.
