And now the County has opened the doors to its fledgling Space Academy, Two Point needs your help on the front-lines of galactic defence, inter-dimensional diplomacy, promoting the space industry and preparing the County for foreign life. The aliens are coming; look busy.\n\nWe\u2019ve also discovered a cluster of those cheesy space rocks caught in the County's orbit. So we need you to set up Two Point's first out-of-County campus, source alien students from all around the galaxy, and teach them everything we know about us. Conditions may be harsh out here, but we're sitting on a gold mine.\n\nSo dust off your moon boots, set phasers to fun, and get your students to reach for the stars\u2026 and their wallets.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "videos": [{"id": 79152, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "B1soHdxPLn4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1soHdxPLn4", "title": "Two Point Campus: Space Academy | Announce Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B1soHdxPLn4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
