We're ecstatic to become part of the MicroProse family and to have some major support behind the project. Having played MicroProse games as kids also really adds to that nostalgic feeling that we are so desperately chasing with this whole game.\n\nGreen Hawk Platoon means a lot to our whole team and having the resources to be able to develop the game we've been dreaming of as kids is such an amazing feeling! Being able to work with a publisher like MicroProse is surreal! Our goal is to make a fun, nostalgic game that has a unique perspective and fresh look. We want to do it right and we want everyone to love it as much as we do!\n\nEarlier this year we did a limited closed beta playtest, letting in a few hundred players to play the game for the first time. You played and you gave us your feedback. We listened. Since then, our team has worked tirelessly to address bugs, implement your ideas and expand the overall experience by adding new mechanics, fine tuning existing ones and polishing the game.\n\nAs always, thank you for the support! We couldn't do it without the passion and encouragement of our community!\n\nWishlist the Game: \n- Steam - https://store.steampowered.com/app/2077890/Green_Hawk_Platoon/\n- Epic Store - https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/green-hawk-platoon-218d49\n\nJoin the discussion:\n- Official Green Hawk Platoon Discord - https://discord.com/invite/2PSWYwvxrT\n- MicroProse Discord - https://discord.gg/xyWqGak", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JRAa2ayvF0g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JRAa2ayvF0g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JRAa2ayvF0g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JRAa2ayvF0g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JRAa2ayvF0g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Green Hawk Platoon | Publisher Announcement Trailer (2024)", "description": "We're happy to officially announce our new publisher!
