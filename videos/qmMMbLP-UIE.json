It is a game inspired by Kikiyama\u2019s \u201cYume Nikki.\u201d The goal of the game is to find 12 Prayers (similar to Effects in Yume Nikki).\n\nYou play as a young girl named Fluorette, who ran away from home and took cover in a shrine during a thunderstorm. By praying at the shrine, Fluorette can enter the spirit world. Aside from minor differences, the game plays exactly like Yume Nikki.\n\nThematically, the places Fluorette visits are more industrial and religious (shrine maidens) in nature compared to other Yume Nikki fan games. The horror elements are light this time around, though the game still leaves you with this unnerving feeling that you can't quite shake off. Sadly, some areas like the Game Boy Mansion and \"Beyond\" lead to dead ends, and I would've love to see what those areas had to offer.\n\nThis game also has a bit of a backstory (copied from the Yume Nikki fangames wikia, which was apparently copied from a deleted Tumblr post):\n\n\u201cThe date is unknown, but it is long after the calendars have ended. The world is mostly uninhabited by people. The only known civilization is a gloomy dystopian city, where a strange, incurable disease is spreading\u2026 but hardly anyone notices.\n\n\"That\u2019s because the only symptom of the disease is being forgotten. The afflicted transmit an airborne chemical signal that erases them from the minds and memories of their friends and loved ones.\n\n\"Having contracted the disease, Alone and forgotten, one little girl decides to leave her painful life behind and seek out a supposed promised land beyond the black walls of the city. A place said to be sunny, peaceful, and where grow the herbs that can cure any disease.\n\n\"Venturing into the strange wilderness of the forgotten world outside, she undergoes many hardships and learns much about the nature of being alive, loneliness, memories, and happiness.\n\n\"Her only clue is a photo she carries. A photo of a field of strange yellow flowers\u2026\"\n\nUnfortunately, Answered Prayers doesn't really have an ending to it and its development had been on an indefinite hiatus. But from what I read, Klaufir is still up and about and did express interest in expanding Answered Prayers to something more than just a Yume Nikki fangame.\n\nTimecodes:\n2:04 Prayer - Tall Geta\n3:27 Prayer - Chromakey Dreamcoat\n5:35 Prayer - Phantom\n7:50 Prayer - Tentacles\n9:38 Item - Rusty Key\n11:35 Prayer - Shovel\n13:08 Prayer - Food\n14:02 Event - Alleyway Chimiko\n21:19 Prayer - Koraiyn\n25:42 Event - Missingno.\n30:40 Prayer - Guitar\n38:40 Event - Underwater Ship Cat Eyes\n39:52 Prayer - Light\n41:33 Prayer - Monochrome\n43:04 Event - Monochrome City Spirit Murder\n49:37 Prayer - Halo\n52:40 Prayer - Karakasa\n53:13 Event - Frozen Lake Chimiko\n54:18 Ending???", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmMMbLP-UIE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmMMbLP-UIE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmMMbLP-UIE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmMMbLP-UIE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmMMbLP-UIE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Answered Prayers ver. 0.03 - Complete Playthrough (No Commentary Longplay)", "description": "Game Download - http://fluorette.yolasite.com/\nBreaking Canon website - http://breakingcanon.com/\nBreaking Canon Twitter - https://twitter.com/BreakingCanon\n\nKlaufir's Twitter - https://twitter.com/klaufir\nKlaufir's Tumblr - http://klaufir.tumblr.com/\nKlaufir's deviantArt - https://www.deviantart.com/klaufir\nYume Nikki Fangames Wikia Entry - https://yumenikkifg.fandom.com/wiki/Answered_Prayers\n\n\u201cAnswered Prayers\u201d is a top-down exploration game made by Klaufir using RPG Maker 2003, released in 2010.
