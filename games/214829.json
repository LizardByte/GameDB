Get creative and build a level unlike anything seen before, then unleash it for other players to try their hand at it. Take a look through other levels out there to see if you can manage to improve your personal best, and maybe find some inspiration for your next masterpiece.\n\nDabble Worlds aims to improve on the maker genre by removing level themes altogether in favor of full customization of how your background looks, which rules are in play, and more. No theme-locked tiles, backgrounds and music. Everything can be mixed together however you want.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dabble-worlds--1", "videos": [{"id": 76369, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6yuhJ0xE3-0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yuhJ0xE3-0", "title": "Dabble Worlds - Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6yuhJ0xE3-0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
