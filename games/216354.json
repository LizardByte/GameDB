During several months he was possessed by the devil, and his name inspired fear and hatred. As a reward the Devil presented him suit of armor and a sword, which gave Lord the immense power - the power of Chaos. Two Dominican monks were instructed to destroy these two damn things, the location of which was known only to them. Right after that they disappeared under mysterious circumstances. In 1269 rumours circulated through the kingdom, that the cursed armour and the sword appeared somewhere near Orleans. A great warrior joins the pitiless battle wishing to pass any tests to overcome the forces of evil.", "summary": "Fantasy-themed 2D fighting game fot mobile phones.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/medieval-combat-age-of-glory"}
