To achieve this goal, the player has access to items such as walls, fans and magnets to alter the course of the oil, which would otherwise fall straight down. The game also features elements such as buttons which move walls, and paint which is needed to colour the oil before reaching the destination.", "videos": [{"id": 65828, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "X6qhbZkMA0Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6qhbZkMA0Q", "title": "Chillingo Presents...Feed Me Oil", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X6qhbZkMA0Q/sddefault.jpg"}]}
