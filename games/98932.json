The rules are similar to the card game Blackjack but instead of cards, you use dice.\n\nPlaying against the computer you throw two dice and add their values. After every throw you can either throw again or let your opponent try his luck. You win by achieving 21, when the computer busts (reaching more than 21) or when you are nearer to 21 then he is.\n\nIn the shareware version you can only play against the computer. By registering you are able to play with one of your friends.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/21-gewinnt"}
