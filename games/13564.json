Success in the 1500 Meters event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria.\n\nRunning is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible. The game rapidly gained a reputation amongst players as a \"joystick killer\" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daley-thompsons-decathlon"}
