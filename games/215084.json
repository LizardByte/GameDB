He appears in the kingdom of Remlia and meets a fairy named Cutie. She tells him that Rosebud, the princess of the kingdom, has been abducted by an evil wizard called Blackhorn and asks him for a help. He agrees and together they set off for the castle where Rosebud is being held.", "summary": "It is a 2D action platform game focused on hack and slash and spell casting. The game consists of six linear levels of which each has two sub-levels meaning the game consists of 12 level in total. After every level there is a cut-scene pushing the story forward.\n\nThere are three weapons - an axe, a spear and a big sword. An axe is a basic weapon the hero holds at the beginning of the game. The player can upgrade the axe using a power-up which has the shape of a small axe. The spear is the second stage of the weapon upgrade system and the big sword is the final stage. The big sword is the most powerful melee weapon in the game.\n\nThe player can cast three magic spells which using is limited by the magic meter. The first is \"Bind\", which stops the time altogether with the enemies in the level. The second is \"Blast\", which casts fire balls destroying all enemies visible on the screen at the time of the casting. The third is \"Bolt\", which has the form of a lightning strike and acts similarly to \"Blast\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/astyanax--1"}
