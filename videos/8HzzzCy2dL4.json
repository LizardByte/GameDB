Released in Japanese arcades in 1994, \"Magical Error wo Sagase!\" (or \"Search for the Magical Error!\") is basically like \"Where's Waldo?\", but with lots of quirky Japanese humor, competitive two-player action, ridiculous bonus games, and lots of flair and frantic fun. The idea of the game, depending on your settings, is to identify a certain number of anomalies between two screens or \"spot what seems out of place\". Scenes typically have three anomalies, although some have more and are sometimes adjusted, to add to the game's challenge. As you play, you lose health based on how long it takes you to beat a stage and earn points based on how difficult an object is to identify in the scene. If you take too long to clear a stage, you will automatically skip it (assuming you don't run out of health first).\n\nPoints and bonus rounds are used to regenerate lost health, which can be done every five levels (if you have full health, left over points are carried to the next round) and the goal is to identify things in each scene as quickly as possible to reduce the number of coins you'd spend playing the game. Some scenes are rather tricky, though you can memorize most of the scenes after a few playthroughs, reducing the challenge of the game. To the game's credit however, there are a variety of scenes and some have the added challenge of scrolling left and right as well as having additional scene animations which must be observed closely. The game is adequate in the audio/visual department with lots of bright colors and several nice animations.\n\nThis is a video of the game in action, clearing the first two rounds.
