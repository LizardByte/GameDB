In between completing the weird tasks you're given that don't really seem to have much to do with each other (and let's be honest here, aren't exactly giving your Bachelor's degree a run for its money), you must safely navigate the spooky office hallways.\n\nYou're not sure what makes the hallways so spooky. Maybe it's the old, moldy smell. Or the weird noises made by the old building. Or maybe it's the invisible monsters who chomp your head clean off if you linger for more than 20 seconds...\n\nAs you navigate the endless office corridors with your trusty revolver at your side (well, not THAT trusty - cutbacks, you know), you must find a way out of this hellish place.\n\nIsn't this the best job you've ever had? Well, I've definitely had worse.", "summary": "This is a completely realistic game about exactly what it's like to work as an office temp.
