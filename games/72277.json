It was translated to English in 1996 by JAST USA, and re-released for modern Windows systems in 2002 as part of the \"JAST USA Memorial Pack\". It is widely regarded as one of their best early games. This popularity can be attributed to the game's strong characters, evocative setting, and high replay value: each of the girls has her own personality and story, and in some cases it is difficult to make the correct choices to get together with a particular girl.\n\nThe game contains some thinly veiled references to several popular anime series, including Neon Genesis Evangelion, Magic Knight Rayearth and Saint Tail: each of the female characters bears a striking resemblance in appearance and (in most cases) personality to a girl from one of these anime.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/season-of-the-sakura"}
