One day the rainbow mysteriously broke apart, separating into shards that fell on the island.

The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks \u2014 that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then \u2014 and sucking potions \u2014 that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid \u2014 from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.\n\nThis version would later get re-released as the expanded \"Event Version\", which added a ranking system, followed by other two \"Event Versions\" released for the Satellaview. Another expanded version of the game, called Sutte Hakkun as well, was released as a Nintendo Power downloadable game, containing many levels left out of the Satellaview broadcast due to the Satellaview 8MB Memory Pak size. That version was also released later as a Super Famicom standard cartridge and for the Wii and Wii U Virtual Consoles.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 44698, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SHrAV2JNgMg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHrAV2JNgMg", "title": "SNES Sutte Hakkun", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SHrAV2JNgMg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
