When you win! When Fritz entered his first tournaments some 25 years ago, humans still had a real chance of taking the engine down. Only a few years down the line, Fritz was already beating grandmasters left, right and center, but ever since his 4:2 victory over Kramnik in 2006, Fritz has been considered unbeatable. Who would want to play against him? In the case of Fritz 16, however, playing against an engine is now once again the very definition of fun! A host of features, including \"Assisted Analysis\", which gives you discreet visual hints as you move, and emoticons, which show Fritz\u2019s mood, are there to help you. Even with little knowledge of chess, you can enjoy many an exciting game, and more importantly, victory, against Fritz. If things don\u2019t work out, Fritz 16 shows you the combinations you might have missed directly after the game with the handy \u201cTactical Analysis\u201d function, or you can dive right into \"Easy Play\" calculation training to hone your skills. Fritz doesn\u2019t come up short when it comes to playing strength either: the new multiprocessor engine was developed by star programmer Vas Rajlich (\"Rybka\") and is up there with the global elite.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fritz-chess-16-steam-edition"}
