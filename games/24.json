Tackle the aliens with automatic rifles, rocket launchers, and even tanks in the struggle to retrieve useful technology, weapons or life forms.\n\nSuccessful ground assault missions will allow X-COM scientists to analyze alien items. Each new breakthrough brings you a little closer to understanding the technology and culture of the alien races. Once you have sufficient research data on the UFO's superior weapons and crafts, you'll be able to manufacture weapons of equal capability.\n\nYou must make every crucial decision as you combat the powerful alien forces. But you'll also need to watch the world political situation: governments may be forced into secret pacts with the aliens and then begin to reduce X-COM funding.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 527, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "pX0Cm3N_n6k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX0Cm3N_n6k", "title": "UFO: Enemy Unknown ( X-com ) - intro movie", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pX0Cm3N_n6k/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 5462, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "q0fOFXTnnlI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0fOFXTnnlI", "title": "DOS Game: UFO - Enemy Unknown", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q0fOFXTnnlI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
