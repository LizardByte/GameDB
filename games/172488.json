Survival lets you put your skydiving skills to the test.\n\nDas \u00dcberleben is a multiplayer skydiving game, with 8-bit retro graphics. The story is that you've gone skydiving, but your plans have gone horribly wrong!\n\nThis means you have to skydive through lots of obstacles, trying to reach your landing point. Your plans have gone so wrong, that you may be skydiving through a mine, a molten volcano, or even Star Wars' Death Star!\n\nControls are via keyboard, mouse or gamepad, and if you have enough controllers, can handle up to seven players! There are lots of options, which is pretty cool: difficulty settings, spin settings (which can be very disorientating!), multiplayer fighting and more. The sound is limited to rushing wind and a little ambient noise, like rain on the tree level. for such a simple game, it's quite engrossing and hypnotic.\n\nDas \u00dcberleben is also quite hard! The levels seem to be randomly generated so you can't learn them, and you really have to concentrate to stop yourself from being splattered into a wall. However, the random levels give you more longevity along with the difficulty settings and the insane spinning effect! Collected rings increase your speed as you dive.\n\nYou can invite up to six other players to pop by on a split screen, pushing them away to be the solo survivor!\n\nDas \u00dcberleben is an atmospheric and exciting retro looking game, great for solo and multi-player games alike.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/das-uberleben-dem-grossen-sprung", "videos": [{"id": 55138, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9yzxkGfYe28"}, {"id": 55156, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SCF-1OKJQcw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCF-1OKJQcw", "title": "Das Uberleben Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SCF-1OKJQcw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
