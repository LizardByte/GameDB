It was a decent remake that featured the original Amiga graphics for in-game matches. It did lack the original intro and music, along with the graphics for the menus, victory and defeat screens. An early Xbox 360 digital title, this one now seems to have largely been forgotten.\n\nWhile various versions of Speedball 2 are available on PS3, PSP & PC. This was the last version to use the original graphics. There is no doubting the new 3D graphics looks rather dire, but least they are full screen and run at a smooth 60fps. While Amiga fans will no doubt complain about some of the missing elements and changes. It was certainly nice to see the title get a modern update and since then we have seen the release of a number of other versions of the game.\n\nSpeedball 2 Brutal Deluxe was a violent sports game set in the grim future, that saw two teams, throwing a metal ball around an arena, as well at each other. There are goals at each end of the arena, along with various point scoring mechanics on the pitch. Hit one of these or score a goal and you earned points, highest scoring team wins the match at the end. Assuming you still had players standing and they hadn't all been carted off the pitch for first aid. This combined with the superb audio atmosphere, where you could hear various calls and chants from the crowd. Made for one of the best game on the Amiga a timeless classic that still feels as fast pace and brutal as it did in 1990.\n\nThere was DLC content for this version, however we are unsure what it was, but it appears to have been skins for the new 3D graphics changing teams and arena designs, based on a trailer for the game.\n\nAlso known as: \u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb2\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 (Japan)\n\nRelease: 2007 (Delisted 2009 May/June)\nDeveloper: Razorworks (Original game The Bitmap Brothers)\nPublisher: Empire Interactive\nFormat: Xbox 360 (X360) / \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9360\n\nSpeedball 2: Brutal Deluxe has been released on numerous formats over the years.
