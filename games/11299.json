Flip your cards, watch your opponents and grab the totem at the right moment to win the game. Just when you think you've got it down, a new card can temporarily change the rules and keep you on the edge. Play starts when the first person flips a card. Moving around the table, symbols are revealed until two of the exposed cards match. Players with matching cards must then scramble to grasp the totem in the middle of the table; the loser gets the winner's cards and anything in the pot. With paws flying, be the first person to get rid of all your cards and win the game.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jungle-speed", "videos": [{"id": 4604, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "htd35_UPGo4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htd35_UPGo4", "title": "WiiWare: Jungle Speed Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/htd35_UPGo4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
