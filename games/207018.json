When you encounter a game in the Timeline, you can immediately play it without losing your place.\n\nThe massive list of games spans six original Atari console and home computer platforms and generations of arcade titles, the most ever included in a collection by the team at Digital Eclipse. For the first time ever, games from the cult favorite Atari Jaguar and Atari Lynx platforms will be playable on modern consoles. Behind every game are the stories of Atari, what was happening at the company, what went into the creation of the games and the hardware on which they ran, all told by the people who were there. It is a rare opportunity to get a rich behind-the-scenes look at the history of video games.\n\nIn addition to presenting these Atari classics exactly as they were, the talented team at Digital Eclipse has also created the Reimagined series\u2014six new games that revisit, mash-up and reimagine Atari Classics. Each of these new games is included in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 77836, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CQKwj_hi-Gc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQKwj_hi-Gc", "title": "Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CQKwj_hi-Gc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 77854, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "6c_PSjsTxNQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c_PSjsTxNQ", "title": "Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - Official Atari Jaguar Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6c_PSjsTxNQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
