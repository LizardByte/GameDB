I Originally enjoyed this game when it was released on 15 disks for the Amiga :O and again later when i got a HD for the A600 and it took hours to install using the games own installer.  The best version I think is the CD32 release as the game just sounds better when the developer has full control over what samples are used to create the music and sounds ;)\n\nThe Way I have edited together the video is a bit unconventional for me but i hope it still delivers.  I have shown the death animations pretty much where they happen in the game instead of stacking them up at the end of the video. The game can be completed alot quicker than this video shows, but i have tried to show many of the various dialogue paths the game has.\n\nScummVM was used to play the game, and even though it has supported the game for a long time there are still a few minor bugs including missing speech and the game freezing for a few moments when entering the factory.\n\nI have to apologize for the low speech volume in the first half of the video as the music gets overly loud in some places. I boosted the volume later in the game. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9p1Dna5yhwQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9p1Dna5yhwQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9p1Dna5yhwQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9p1Dna5yhwQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PC Longplay [487] Beneath A Steel Sky", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nAnother great adventure game if a little short.
