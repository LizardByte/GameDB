There are lots of levels to go through, and you need to test your prowess as you try to complete every level. The game is very immersive, and you always need to remove all the monsters, even if it feels hard to do. There are lots of dynamic elements that move in the game, so you can use those to your advantage. In the end, you must use the limited number of bombs to kill enemies and it will be well worth it every time. Blow Up Monsters has dozens of great levels and game worlds, and you have to use all the tools at your disposal to try and win as quickly as possible!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blow-up-monsters"}
