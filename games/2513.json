Those mighty creatures threaten the wizard, but they are trapped in magical cages, unable to act. To prevent the revenge of gods, the wizard imprisoned the souls of the four greatest gods in four talismans, and then hid them in four different dungeons. Controlling a party of adventurers, you must retrieve these talismans and release the gods.\n\nThis is a first-person RPG with a 4-person party made up of warriors, wizards, rangers, and assassins. Characters are pre-generated and chosen from a pool of 16 adventurers (4 of each class). Choose from 32 spells drawn from the disciplines of earth, chaos, dragon, and night magic. Combat takes place on the same screen as exploration and is fully in real-time.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hexx-heresy-of-the-wizard"}
