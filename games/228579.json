According to a strange doctor who lives in the town, a mysterious underground world inhabited by unknown creatures spreads out beyond the hole of \"Hokora\", and fossils with life are buried in it ...\u30fb. Apparently, the guy next door, who is always fighting, went looking for a legendary monster. \"Let's lose! I'm going on an adventure with courage!\" At that time, the doctor's words came to my mind. \"Without the power of friendship, you can't know the world ...\" The fossil excavation game is back! Collect the fossil fragments buried in the dungeon and revive the monsters on the Lab's Reborn Machine. Various monsters can be created depending on the attributes and combinations of fossils. Some monsters evolve when the parameters of a specific character exceed a certain value. Strategicity has increased due to the advantages and disadvantages of the character's orientation, the compatibility between attributes, and the character's \"friendship parameter\". You can exchange monsters with a communication cable, or use a pocket printer to seal monsters.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kaseki-sousei-reborn-ii-monster-digger"}
