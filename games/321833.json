Yes, every area is new and fully modeled! This isn't just a \"repaint\" of Pikmin 2, it contains an entire new story with new characters from a parallel Pikmin universe where many things are strange, a little bit memey, or just not correct. With over 130 new treasures to collect and brand new mechanics to make the game feel fresh this mod is essentially a new game. This mod is not meant to be taken too seriously in most aspects, but its gameplay is meant to be fresh and creative for fans of the Pikmin series to enjoy even if they don't care about the memes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bikmin-269-dx-directors-cut", "videos": [{"id": 132496, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FGbOdBogPTk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGbOdBogPTk", "title": "\ud83c\udd71\ufe0fIKMIN 269 DX || MOD RELEASE", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGbOdBogPTk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
