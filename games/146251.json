We're talking about a level-based runner inspired by the Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show. That's right, this 2018 comedy revisits the all-time classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT or The Ninja Turtles).\n\nYou get to go on an adventure alongside Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, and Michaelangelo through 50 different missions in which you have to collect coins in order to stop the New York mutants from gaining control over the city. The game is very similar to other classic games such as Subway Surfers or Temple Run as far as the gameplay goes: your character moves horizontally through different lanes by sliding your finger across the screen. You can also jump and slide under objects by swiping up or down.\n\nEach Ninja Turtle includes its own unique attacks, which you can perform by tapping on the screen. There's even a way to customize them more by using these three elements: costumes, weapons, and skills. Earn these unlockables by advancing through the different levels, or by playing with a roulette (but it'll cost a pretty significant amount of coins). With your earnings, you can also level up your characters.\n\nRise of the TMNT: Ninja Run is an incredible videogame that combines endless runners and New York's Ninja Turtles. Shout Cowabunga at the top of your lungs and submerge yourself in a comics universe with the game's eye-catching style.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-ninja-run"}
