It is strong enough to block out the sun, causing the affected areas to become dark and cold.

Their search will lead them to the Scarlet Devil Mansion and to its eccentric owners...", "summary": "Embodiment of Scarlet Devil features two playable characters to choose from, with two Spell Card types each. Reimu Hakurei can cover a wide area of the screen with weaker attacks, while Marisa Kirisame relies on her speed and power to make up for her thinner attack spread. The bombs show different behavior and damage depending on the character and type chosen.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, Mystic Square, Embodiment of Scarlet Devil comes with an \"automatic item collection\" feature, which allows you to collect all items on the screen by moving to the top of the screen if you are at full power, as well as a counter-bomb system, which allows you to avoid a fatal hit by using a bomb immediately.\n\nThough there are six total stages in the main game, playing on Easy will end the game after Stage 5.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-koumakyou-the-embodiment-of-scarlet-devil", "videos": [{"id": 12103, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "KJXUt9H9OZM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJXUt9H9OZM", "title": "Touhou 6 - The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil - No Bombs Lunatic 1cc", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KJXUt9H9OZM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
