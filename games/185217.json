The player must use this Ability Tile to eliminate his or her own hand, as in the Bubba Draw, in order to win.\n\nOne of the characteristics of an Ability Tile is that it has a fixed maximum number of tiles that can appear on the field. For example, one player can monopolize one Ability Tile, and while that player is monopolized, no other player can draw that Ability Tile until that player uses the Ability Tile they are monopolizing.\n\nThe game is characterized by the fact that both players can read each other's ability tiles as well as the opponent's hand, which creates a deeper gameplay than in ordinary Old Maid.", "summary": "Produced in 3 days!\nThe Ultimate Combination of Old maid and Mahjong!\n\n\"Ultimate Super Powers Old Maid: 3Days\" is a game based on the card game Babanuki. It is an irregular Old Maid where the player's actions are determined by the ability tiles that are replenished each turn, apart from the cards such as Numbers and Jokers.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-super-powers-old-maid-3days", "videos": [{"id": 61831, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kCSKlYLoMDg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCSKlYLoMDg", "title": "Ultimate Super Powers Old Maid\uff5e3Days\uff5e", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kCSKlYLoMDg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
