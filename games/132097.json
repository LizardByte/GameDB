This is your City. These are your rules.\nRemastered with enhanced graphics, Steelport the original city of sin, has never looked so good as it drowns in sex, drugs and guns.\nYears after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.\nRefusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.\nWeapons of Crass Destruction \u2013 It\u2019s one thing to defeat your enemies. It\u2019s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and outrageous melee weapons are all part of the fun.\nCrazy Character Customisation \u2013 Create the most outlandish characters ever seen, from washed-up celebrities to maskless ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?\nOver The Top Co-op \u2013 Fly solo or play online with a homie. Give freefall skydiving a try, landing in your partner\u2019s flaming pickup as you make a desperate run toward a heavily armed Syndicate base. Steelport is always more fun with a friend.\nAll DLC included \u2013 All three expansion mission packs and 30 pieces of DLC from the original version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 35012, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "G4Z1qGoY0BU"}, {"id": 49723, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "374Yny37oYY"}]}
