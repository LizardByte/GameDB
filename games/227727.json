It contains 120 stars and requires Mario to collect every last star before he can enter the final stage, Bowser in the Sky. As the name suggests, this hack is intended to be a much more difficult version of the game. This hack does not alter the level geometry of any of the stages, but instead adds difficulty by moving, adding, and replacing the objects within the stages. In general, this hack was not designed with glitches in mind, so many stars can be collected easily with trivial glitches or skips.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kaizo-mario-64"}
