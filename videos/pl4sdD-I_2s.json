Jurassic World is set against a global backdrop of diverse locations, with a sprawling story grounded in believable science and populated by distinctive dinosaurs, heroic humans, and cunning villains at both ends of the evolutionary spectrum.\n\nCinema's only dinosaur-driven live action franchise, Jurassic World has earned three Academy Awards\u00ae and over $3.6 billion worldwide across four films. Its cross- generational appeal can be attributed to audiences' enduring fascination with dinosaurs and boundless imagination, both nurtured by each new installment. Jurassic World is more than a film franchise. It is a larger-than-life destination for exploration, discovery, and epic adventure. Dinosaurs live again, and they live in Jurassic World.\n\nConnect with Jurassic World\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/JurassicWorldSite\nLike Jurassic World on Facebook: http://bit.ly/JurassicWorldLike\nFollow Jurassic World on Twitter: http://bit.ly/JurassicWorldTweet\nFollow Jurassic World on Instagram: http://bit.ly/JurassicWorldFollow\nFollow on Snap: http://bit.ly/JurassicWorldSnap\n\nConnect with Universal Pictures\nLike Universal Pictures of Facebook: https://bit.ly/UniversalLikes\nFollow Universal Pictures on Twitter: http://bit.ly/UniversalTweets\nFollow Universal Pictures on Instagram: http://bit.ly/UniversalFollow\nFollow on Snap: http://bit.ly/UniversalSnaps\nDinosaur Protection Group: http://www.dinosaurprotectiongroup.com/ \nIsla Nublar Site: http://islanublar.jurassicworld.com/ \n\nWelcome to the Minecraft Jurassic World DLC!\nhttps://youtu.be/pl4sdD-I_2s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/jurassicworld", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pl4sdD-I_2s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pl4sdD-I_2s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pl4sdD-I_2s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pl4sdD-I_2s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pl4sdD-I_2s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Welcome to the Minecraft Jurassic World DLC!", "description": "The Park is open!
