After nine o'clock at night, they hear the sound of breaking glass from upstairs, so they investigate the rooms upstairs and find a dismembered corpse in Tanaka's room. The window of the room is still broken and open, and there is no sign of the murderer.\n\nThere was no sign of the killer. A blizzard prevented anyone from getting out, and everyone was completely trapped. With the phone lines cut and mobile phones out of range, it is a closed circle where the police cannot be called.
