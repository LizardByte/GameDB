There is a wide variety of offensive and defensive moves you can use to make things easier, including dives, spins, hurdles, jukes, and stiff arms on offense; and dives, jumps, forearm bashes, and swim moves on defense. Basically, if you've seen it done in the real NFL, then chances are you'll see it in NFL GAMEDAY. Things like long snap counts, men in motion, and defensive stunts can all be found in the game, giving you an NFL experience like no other.
