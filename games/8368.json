CFO focuses on its atmosphere and explorative gameplay mechanics to tell a mature and vague narrative, left open to the player's imagination and interpretation of events. By only giving half the story through the level progression and leaving the rest for the player to piece together by inspecting and interacting with the environment, CFO aims to be a short 15 minute adventure game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-cow-flew-over-the-moon", "videos": [{"id": 3287, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "aPb0Sh39Ue8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPb0Sh39Ue8", "title": "Cow Flew Over the Moon - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aPb0Sh39Ue8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
