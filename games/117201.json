Each wave will have more enemies than the last. Make sure to watch your ammo, pickups are all around the map and respawn every wave. \n \n \n \nCONTROLS \nA, D, for left to right movement. \nSpace bar for jetpack. \nMouse for aiming. \nEscape to return to main-menu \n \n \n \nNOTE \nCurrently Only Goes to Wave 10 \n \nVery much an early build. I wouldn't consider it stable for an actual release. I just wanted to share current progress! \nOriginally built for a standalone desktop build, so the main-menu quit button does nothing in browser \n \nWork in Progress \nThis will be my first released game. As of right now it is a prototype. Most of the art is temporary, and if pursued further will most likely be changed.
