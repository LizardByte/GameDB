As The Universe began to take shape, so too did space. But space is unpredictable, and creating life is tiresome work. So, the Sprites took it upon themselves to create a pastime. The Galaxy Games.\n\nEach event features its own unique bite-sized challenge where up to 4 players can compete. Eject your friends into space as you race across gravity fields, score a goal with an entire moon, leap across planets to escape a black hole, and capture and hold zodiacal constellations.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/which-way-up-galaxy-games", "videos": [{"id": 125316, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jjYRBbgw4NA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjYRBbgw4NA", "title": "Which Way Up: Galaxy Games - Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jjYRBbgw4NA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
