Strategy games 1998 goin' strong!\n\nSo in this game you chose from one out of five aristocratic families in Sweden from the time when the Kalmar Union collapsed until the years of peace in 1810-s. Brahe is the easiest to complete the game quickly with by far, due to it's strong strategical position in Finland and due to the fact that they start with a harbour.\n\nA good run. Some small mistakes related to build order and anticipating what message comes next. Also the transfer to the \"danish death ball\" could've gone smoother, but I'll blame that on bad RNG. Overall I didn't do any major mistakes, usually runs when I accidentally click \"go to the battlefield\" instead of \"quick combat\" are just dead.\n\nWorking on the Seven Kindoms scenario and looking for to optimize Netzcaro.\nJoin the Dungeon Keeper community at \nhttps://discord.gg/mFfT5aE \nhttps://www.speedrun.com/dungeon_keeper\n\nJoin the Seven Kingdoms community at\nhttps://discord.gg/sTU6AVb\nhttps://www.speedrun.com/7kaa", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rvwdT-e7Yx4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rvwdT-e7Yx4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rvwdT-e7Yx4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rvwdT-e7Yx4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Svea Rike 2 - Brahe Any% 12m13s speedrun", "description": "Date: 191105\nRunner: BNDR\nGame: Svea Rike 2\nSystem: Lenovo ideapad 330, i3-8130U, Intel(R) HD Graphics 620 and a Trust GXT 140 mouse.\n\nJust trying out some new things.
