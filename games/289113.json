The white marks passing below are target markers (flares released at lower level by target marking aircraft. You must maneuver your aircraft so that markers are in the centre of your site when the bombs you have released detonate. This involves accounting for your present height (1-6), so that the bombs will explode with the most markers within the blast range (the red area in centre of your targeting site) when the bombs hit the ground. Therefore, at higher heights you must release your bombs sooner, since it takes more time for them to fall, so that they will hit the ground when the target markers are in the centre of your site. If you completely miss (fail to have any markers within the blast area) you lose a point, if you only have one marker in the blast area no points are lost or gained. You must have at least two markers in the area to begin to gain points. A total score is reported at the end of your bomb run.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bombaim"}
