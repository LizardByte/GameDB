Situation at Persian Gulf has been stable for some years. For the last month there has been rising tension from new direction while Iran has launched multiple naval and air force exercises at southern coast of the country. Iran has made political and diplomatic provocations against other Gulf States, mostly United Arab Emirates, accusing them about production of nuclear and chemical weapons and repeated attacks against Iran commercial shipping.
