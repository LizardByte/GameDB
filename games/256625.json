The man was already dead, while the woman had fainted.\n\nAccused of being the murderer by the store manager who appeared on the scene, the protagonist was framed and embarked on an investigation to clear their own name.\n\nHowever, as if one mystery led to another, the tragedy repeated itself...", "summary": "The 12th installment of the pachinko simulator series by Sanyo Bussan, a pachinko manufacturer in partnership with Irem Software Engineering. The series features pachinko machines produced by Sanyo Bussan and is known by the abbreviated title \"Pachipara,\" starting from this installment, transitioning from its previous title, \"Sanyo Pachinko Paradise.\"\n\nThe featured pachinko machine in this installment is \"Daikai Monogatari\" (The Tale of the Great Sea). Additionally, the familiar story mode, \"Pachipro F\u016bunroku\" (Pachinko Professional Chronicles), is included as the fourth installment titled \"Pachipro F\u016bunroku 4: The Silver Ball Murder Case.\" The Pachipro F\u016bunroku series has been included since \"Pachipara 8\" and is characterized by elements of gal games and oddly serious storytelling (with some absurd game elements) despite being a pachinko game.\n\nWhile the previous three installments had a top-down view, this installment showcases an expanded potential for the game as it adopts the same game engine as \"Ponkotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot,\" a game developed and released by the same company.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pachipara12-daikai-to-natsu-no-omoide", "videos": [{"id": 93723, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "WxWqBpuBe3k"}, {"id": 93724, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8hcZ4mBg-l4"}]}
