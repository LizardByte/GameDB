At some point, a tribe of sorcerers corrupted by darkness, forged a weapon called \u201cThe Trident of Power\u201d.

These were given to the strongest races of the continent.\n\nHyrule and Tylistem, are two kingdoms that have coexisted in peace for centuries, but this harmony will be disturbed by a group of people who, from the shadows, have created a meticulous plan... They believe that it will lead into a world changing revolution.", "summary": "The Trident of Power is a Zelda fangame developed by Pizus, under RPG Maker 2003.
