Visit old friends, relive memories and experience bursts of inspiration in this nostalgic game about the passage of time.\n\r\nSid is a fiction author struggling with a creative block, attempting to recapture the feelings of inspiration he felt when he was younger. In order to pay the bills, he needs to think up a story and apply for a grant - the deadline is today - a lazy Sunday in the middle of summer.\n\nOn this Sunday, his struggle is disturbed by an invitation to attend an unavoidable family obligation - The place Sid grew up in is about to be sold, and his mother wants him to come home for a small party so he can say goodbye to it. With the deadline approaching and his creative juices having frozen, this is not something he's looking forward to.\n\nJoin Sid as he reluctantly journeys back home, meets old friends, relives memories and attempts to kick start his creativity back into gear. Also take part in his creative process as you play through interactive sections depicting the story he's attempting to write.\n\nForgotten Fields is a warm, cozy game about nostalgia, creativity, appreciating the present, and the passage of time - a meditation on impermanence and the shortness of life.\n\r\nForgotten Fields is being developed by Frostwood Interactive, a studio found by Armaan Sandhu, and is being published by Dino Digital. The soundtrack is being composed by Micamic, the composer behind Rainswept, and Harvester Games' excellent 2012 indie title \"The Cat Lady\"\r\n\r\nFeaturing:\r\n\n- A story focused on nostalgia and time that is sure to linger in your mind long after you've finished the game.\n\n- Deep characters with interwoven histories and well developed backstories.\n\n- A warm, atmospheric game world with a slice-of-life setting.\n\n- Vibrant visual style combined with a cinematic presentation.\r\n\n\nLinks:\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.forgottenfieldsgame.com/\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frostwood_int\nIndiedb: http://www.indiedb.com/games/forgottenfields\nEmail: armaan@frostwoodinteractive.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q8XYvnGVW0A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q8XYvnGVW0A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q8XYvnGVW0A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q8XYvnGVW0A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q8XYvnGVW0A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Forgotten Fields - Reveal Trailer", "description": "DEMO ON STEAM - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296980/Forgotten_Fields/\nSUPPORT IT ON KICKSTARTER! - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/forgotten-fields/forgotten-fields-0\n\nForgotten Fields is a game about a struggling author who travels back to his childhood home one last time before it's sold off.
