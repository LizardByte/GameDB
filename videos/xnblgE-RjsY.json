{"id": "xnblgE-RjsY", "snippet": {"title": "Sidney 2000 (Dreamcast)", "description": "As you might suspect from the title and the cover art, this game is about Sydney Olympic Games of 2000. As a matter of fact, this is the official game and was released on Dreamcast, PC and Playstation during autumn 2000.\n\nThe game was published by Eidos Interactive (except in Japan, where it was published by Capcom) and developed by British studio Attention To Detail.\nAttention to Detail was formed in 1998 by a group of graduates from Birmingham university and did not only develop games, they also designed electronic parts for arcade machines. The company went out of business on August 28, 2003. But before that they developed games like Drone Racers for Playstation, the LEGO Racers series, Rollcage I and II and also Cybermorph for the Atari Jaguar. Oh yes, Cybermorph of AVGN fame.\nhttps://youtu.be/3LVcvkLCUtU\n\nSydney 2000 got mixed reviews when it was released, but it still won the BAFTA award for the Sports game of the year. How that came to be, we have no clue. Because if there is one thing you can say about Sydney 2000, it's that the game is anonymous. Sure, it features 32 countries, but it doesn't feature any IRL athletes from the actual Olympic Game. The athletes in the game are all generic models simply named after their country of origin. It doesn't even feature Sydney or any of the beautiful arenas they built for the Olympic Games. In other words, this game could be used on ANY Olympic Ame anywhere, at any time. Just change the title.\nThe technology was there. Other sports titles featured digitalized models of famous athletes, so why couldn't Sydney 2000 spice things up with Michael Johnson, Ian Thorpe or Jonathan Edwards?\n\nThat aside, Sydney 2000 is a quite solid game. It's easy to get into and some of the sports feature a two-player mode, either hot seat or simultaneously. It's button mashing, anonymous fun.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This recording of Sydney 2000 has been subject to a copyright strike from Banging Records. They still allow me to show the clip under fair use, but the video can be taken down at any time by Banging Records.\nPlease note that the song from Banging Records that has been matched is not the same song featured in the video. It's matching error with Youtube but since we still can show the video, we let it be for now.
