The goal is to terminate Crocomire in the Dissolvery, which is locked behind 4 Security Locks, (Similar to Fusion) however one unique thing that this ROM hack does it that you have a great choice of which order you want to do things in. You could get Space Jump before even touching the Varia Suit, get the Plasma Beam as your second beam upgrade, everything is possible if you\u2019re clever enough.\n\nThe major items also move around during a \u201cCORE-X\u201d playthrough, (This game\u2019s equivalent to Hard Mode) granting even greater replay value, especially to get those nice ending pictures. And yes indeed, the player sprites have been changed to those of the SA-X from Fusion, making the hack the second one to ever have custom Samus graphics in Zero Mission. The length of the hack is pretty short, (Around 2 hours) but going through all the endings and exploring the different paths of every difficulty could more than quadruple that. A full map is included with the download, with two different styles (And two different ones to reflect the changes in Hard Mode)\n\nThere are also other various ASM tweaks thanks to the talented ASM hackers of Metroid Construction, such as the Crocomire final boss being very close to Super Metroid\u2019s, and the Fusion beams being ported back into Zero Mission.\n\nSo if you are looking for a refreshing Zero Mission hack with a Super Metroid vibe, this hack is for you!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metroid-crocomires-last-stand"}
