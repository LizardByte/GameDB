The trains run alongside passenger lines, pass through long tunnels and elevated shelters through residential areas, and pass through a number of freight stations, allowing to enjoy the unique view of the freight line.\n\nIn this DLC, you can drive from Odawara Station to T\u014dky\u014d Station via the T\u014dkaid\u014d Freight Line and Hinkaku Line (Yokosuka Line), which are separate routes from passenger lines, and to Shinjyuku Station via the Yamanote Freight Line.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the different scenery from the passenger line.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jr-east-train-simulator-tokaido-freight-line-nebukawa-to-tokyo-shinjuku-e257-2000-5500-series"}
