Seeking inspiration for his next book, Thomas begins to explore the history of Blackwood Manor, only to uncover a dark secret that dates back centuries to the days of the Great Scottish Witch Hunts.\n\nThe Ghosts of Blackwood Manor is a complex interactive fiction piece written in Infocom's advanced Z-machine format XZIP. The game has three different endings, a bad, a neutral and a good ending, depending on the player's choices. It is very likely that the player, on a first playthrough, will not reach the good ending, even though it is possible. Reaching the bad or neutral ending first is part of the experience and helps the player understanding the true intentions of some of the NPCs and the impact of decisions made, so they may be reconsidered.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ghosts-of-blackwood-manor", "videos": [{"id": 120285, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "MswHxrpnk60", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MswHxrpnk60", "title": "The Ghosts of Blackwood Manor [TRAILER/GAMEPLAY]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MswHxrpnk60/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
