Proceed with caution!]\n\nA simple and easy-to-learn Semi-Idle RPG game that combines the coin pusher gameplay, with a large number of character backgrounds, talent combinations, and equipment choices. Combined with high-paced monster battles and the idle mechanism, there will be a sense of satisfying grinding! Players need to recruit heroes, choose their exclusive talent skills, and assemble various squads to lead them on a journey to find treasure, upgrade villages, craft legendary equipment, and improve their strength to defeat the demon king.\n\nInnovative in-game combat: During the battle, the coins collected by the coin pusher will be distributed to the heroes, and they will receive the corresponding amount of compensation before helping you fight monsters. Give them money to make your heroes work for you, and you can also hang out and automatically play the coin pusher to grind!\n\nPublished by Wise Games\nDeveloped by RAmen\nRelease Date: Q2 2025\n\n#steam #steamgames #steamgame #theforeseenarcade #steamnextfest #steamnextfestfebruary2025 #coindrop #coinpushrpg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4krMoGSrnE0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4krMoGSrnE0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4krMoGSrnE0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4krMoGSrnE0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4krMoGSrnE0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Coin Push RPG - Steam Next Fest: February 2025 Demo", "description": "[WARNING: This game, possibly due to the budget and/or laziness, uses AI generated content for some of the equipment icons in the game, icon for props, the character avatar in the store and guide character's stand-up drawing.
