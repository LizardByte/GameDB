Level designs have been improved upon to really nail the balance between tough and fair.\nOr perhaps you loved the limited lives and ludicrous overuse of instant-death blocks in the original release? We've got you covered. Just select \"Old School\" or higher from the difficulty menu and you'll be cursing the developers' name in no time.\n\nQuality of Life Improvements!\nFaster respawning (When you die, which will be often, you'll just pop right back out of the Toaster and get on with your day, just like nature intended!), multiple save slots, accessibility options and more mean that anybody can take on the challenge.\n\nSurprises!\nPerhaps you've never played either of these games, perhaps you're new to the sequel, or maybe you have spent years achieving the world speedrun record for both, but whatever your experience with the series, there are plenty of surprises in store for you!\n\nNew Chapter, Completing The Story!\n\"Wait, the game had a story\" You ask? To which we say: ...Kinda! But there's more of it now! Beat both games to unlock the epic finale!\n\nAnd more!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/angry-video-game-nerd-i-and-ii-deluxe", "videos": [{"id": 46802, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "-8EO9nVk1Tc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8EO9nVk1Tc", "title": "AVGN 1 & 2 Deluxe - Teaser Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-8EO9nVk1Tc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 46803, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cONbIjV_YCU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cONbIjV_YCU", "title": "AVGN 1 & 2 Deluxe - Release Trailer (Steam and Nintendo Switch)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cONbIjV_YCU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
