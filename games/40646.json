{"id": 40646, "name": "Demolition Herby", "platforms": [59], "release_dates": [{"id": 91505, "date": 404956800, "platform": 59, "y": 1982}], "summary": "Demolition Herby is basically the same as Amidar by Parker Brothers', though in this case, you control a car that's being chased by other cars. When you drive around a box, it fills in. Fill in all of the boxes before you run out of gas or crash into another car. The other cars can also erase the work you've done. If you're in a tight spot, hit the button to shift into gas-guzzlin' overdrive. As the game progresses, the speed and intelligence of the other drivers increase."}
