So, when you start the game, don't be fooled: you didn't buy Space Jam with the wrong label on the cart. Get Ready for This is actually one of the songs in the game, in fully SNES synth glory. \n\nThe game itself is pretty good, though it's not for those that want a game that they can sail through. It's not quite bullet hell, but it gets pretty close by SNES standards. The graphics are REALLY nicely done, with parallax thrown in all over the place to vary the feeling of speed and to add to the overall chaos, and bosses show up in flash effects using heavy sprite scaling and transparencies. The biggest achievement in my mind, though, is that it pushes the SNES as hard as it does with very little sign of flicker or slowdown. Like with the NES, Athena had a pretty good handle on the SNES, and their experience shows. Well worth a play for anyone that wants something a bit derivative, hard as nails, and pretty to look at  - just about every aspect oozes with quality. \n__________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j117k0MzWCE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j117k0MzWCE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j117k0MzWCE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j117k0MzWCE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "BioMetal (SNES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Activision's 1993 Super NES shoot 'em up, BioMetal.\n\nPlayed through on the hard difficulty level.\n\nJust like X-Kaliber 2097 that Activision released just a few months after this, BioMetal has a thoroughly awesome licensed soundtrack - this time by 2 Unlimited!
