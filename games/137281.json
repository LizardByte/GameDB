It features \nprocedurally generated levels with lots of rooms to explore, items to find and enemies to fight. Permanent upgrades will help you improve on your quest and these stick with you forever, even if the you fail a run. This makes the game less punishing and enables \nplayers to save up for that next upgrade. The game is designed to work perfectly with \neither a controller or with mouse/keyboard.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 40623, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lobc6JmRTNs"}, {"id": 40624, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DJsvxCtvBZM"}]}
