It was during this era that the Spanish resistance gave their style of fighting its name: Guerrilla, or the \u201clittle war\u201d. \n \nIt is 1811 and the war in the Spanish Peninsula has been raging for over two years, with mixed fortunes and heavy casualties for both sides. Following the withdrawal from the Madrid area of the combined armies of Great Britain, Portugal and Spain after the Battle of Talavera in July 1809, Viscount Wellington retreated into Portugal and consolidated his forces. Now Napoleon\u2019s Arm\u00e9e d'Espagne, has invaded Portugal once again but thus far the network of entrenchments has proved impossible for the French to successfully assail. \n \nWellington has planned a fresh offensive to drive the invaders out of Portugal and eventually out of the Peninsula altogether. Although forced back to the edges of their Peninsula by France and the traitors who helped them, Spain is not yet out of the fight. The Supreme Central Junta and its successor the Supreme Regency authorised the forming of local bands to fight guerrilla - the \u201clittle war\u201d - against the invaders. \nChoose one of the three nations involved - France, Great Britain or Spain - and experience one the most intense conflict of the Napoleonic era.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/napoleon-total-war-the-peninsular-campaign--1"}
