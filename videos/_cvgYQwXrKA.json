Finally we heard you and, considering how things are running, decided to publish the IPECAC Community Mod On Steam! Be on the watch, as a few new surprises are coming out in the next few days. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1925867065\nIf you're currently playing the mod from out beta downloads and is wondering whether to subscribe to it on steam as well, here's my personal opinion: We'd sincerely appreciate if you did so, at least for the visibility on the workshop, but the differences aren't that much as compared to V 1.4.1 . We've reworked the numbering system, did some polishing, changed some default settings, fixed bugs here and there, and that's about it. So, while not really life-changing, it may still be worth checking out. If you want to keep your progress and whatever achievements you've unlocked, that can be done pretty easily, and I might do a quick video on that if it is really necessary (tip: just move the save1.dat, save2.dat and/or save3.dat to the new folder and that should be it)\n\n\nFinally, I'd like to thank the community for letting us reach this point. It hasn't been easy, especially with each of us having other things to do, but we'll keep on improving the mod - after all, this is but its pre-release; the final version will still take its time to grow into the truly enjoyable experience we expect to provide you all.\n\nAs always, this has been the IPECAC Community Mod, made by Team IPECAC. For more info about us (and even to download whatever version of the mod you want without using the workshop), you can take a look at our website:\nhttps://ipecaccommunitymod.wordpress.com/\nAnd, to know in detail about the mod's mechanics, we have a work-in-progress wiki:\nhttps://ipecacmod.gamepedia.com/The_Binding_of_Isaac:_IPECAC_Wiki\nWe also have a twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ipecaccommod\nOur discord Channel is probably one of the best ways to keep in touch and suggest improvements and give us feedback:\nhttps://discord.gg/Jzt9REK\nFinally, would it be possible to \"revive\" our subreddit from its early death?\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IpecacCommunityMod/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_cvgYQwXrKA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_cvgYQwXrKA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_cvgYQwXrKA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_cvgYQwXrKA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_cvgYQwXrKA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ipecac Community Mod: Now On Steam", "description": "Finally!
