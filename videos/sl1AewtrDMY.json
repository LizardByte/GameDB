Looks like some Quake 1 mod to me. The background music is pretty good though.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sl1AewtrDMY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sl1AewtrDMY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sl1AewtrDMY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Daikatana E3 trailer 1997", "description": "Daikatana E3 trailer from 1997, when the game was still running on the old Quake engine.
