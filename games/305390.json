Following the liberation of Herford and Cologne, Iris was captured by Adler\u2019s J\u00e4ger unit. Since she possessed too much sensitive information to fall into enemy hands, including the concealment of his own magic and plans for a rebellion, Wilfried pursued them into Greiz instead of going after the third witch.\n\nGreiz is a middle-sized city in the center of Groesen, and it is home to the capitol. However, there were no trains entering the castle town, and the hustle and bustle of the past was eerily missing. Surprisingly, it was also under the territory of the third witch. He was forced to fight on two fronts, as fate also seemed to conspire against him. Wilfried\u2019s final battle has begun.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/re-lord-3-the-demon-lord-of-groessen-and-the-final-witch"}
