The package consisted of a G7000 and two special games -- Verkehrsspiele 1 and Verkehrsspiele 2 -- that were used to teach children how to behave on the street. The console set is nothing more than a repackaging of a regular Philips G7000. The package comes with a special \"Video-Traffic Games\" sticker affixed to the TV screen depicted by the box art. It contains a regular G7000, the two games, and some documentation. The first volume of the traffic games was also given away to members of the German Commander-ROM club as Videopac \"V,\" and retitled Kinder im Verkehr 1 (Kids in Traffic 1). The manual claims that Videopac V was the first of a series of new learning games aimed at kids 6 to 14 years old. From this, one might surmise that \"Kinder im Verkehr 2\" was planned for release, but no copies have been found. In all forms, the traffic games are quite rare, with Videopac V being a bit less difficult to find than the Verkehrsspiele games.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/verkehrsspiele-1"}
