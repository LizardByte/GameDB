At its core, it's an arena shooter that takes inspiration from the likes of Smash TV, #Contra, #Mercs, #Granada, #Alien Syndrome, Zombies Ate My Neighbours, Chaos Engine, and Shock Troopers.\n\nWe want the game to look, feel and sound like the classic Mega Drive games of the '80s and '90s, but also add some new elements that weren't so common in games of that era, particularly procedural map generation and randomisation of gameplay elements. Achieving that classic look and feel is vitally important to us, which is why we've teamed up with legendary pixel artist Henk Nieborg, who previously worked on the Mega Drive title \"The Misadventures Of Flink\", developed by Psygnosis.\n\nWe're also working with \"Savaged Regime\"; a highly renowned chip-tune artist that knows how to push the Mega Drive's YM2612 chip to the limit - you can hear a sample of the Xeno Crisis soundtrack in the Kickstarter video above.\n\nThe game is currently at the prototype stage and we will be releasing the finished product in October 2018 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Mega Drive's launch in Japan. We're launching this Kickstarter campaign to fund the remainder of the title's development.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vIFSzeK-PsI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vIFSzeK-PsI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vIFSzeK-PsI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vIFSzeK-PsI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Xeno Crisis: a new game for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive / Dreamcast", "description": "Support on : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1676714319/xeno-crisis-a-new-game-for-the-sega-genesis-mega-d \n\u24d2 Bitmap Bureau | SEGA \nXeno Crisis is a new, original title for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis which will be released both as a physical cartridge and also as a downloadable ROM.
