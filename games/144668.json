Unfortunately, Mr. Ratburn sprains his ankle - badly - and it's up to Arthur to save the day. Players will climb mountains, travel through forests, find hidden surprises, and lead the class to safety. Activities include pitching a tent, navigating rockslides, river crossings, exploring a spooky cabin, mazes, and building rescue devices. Children can interact with characters, develop critical thinking skills, and enjoy the introduction to wildlife science. The 21 environments include 30 printable scenes and 40 hidden surprises.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arthurs-camping-adventure"}
