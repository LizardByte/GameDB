Once the last dewdrop is collected, you proceed with the next level. The dewdrops are in different colors in the game and you can only collect those that match your own color. But you can change your color when ever you want (by rotating through them). Color codes are also important for some enemies, as they may go about the color (they attack you when you don't match their color).\n\nIf you manage to collect five dewdrops of the same color in a row, you get the super-power and you can knock off or even out the most dangerous foe. The game consists of more then 70 levels spread over 5 different world (like Terrarium, Honey Garden, etc.) and offers 9 power-ups to help you get that far. And at the end of each world, you face a boss.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/glow-glow-firefly"}
