To this dark and foreboding place, Lord Celeborn of Lothl\u00f3rien send the Malledhrim, the Golden Host. Their purpose is to harry the armies of Dol Guldur, fortress of the Ringwraith known as the Lieutenant of Dol Guldur, right hand of the Witch-king of Angmar and keep them from growing stronger, but more importantly... to mask the passage of the Company of the Ring from the eaves of Lothl\u00f3rien, turning the eyes of the Nazg\u00fbl upon themselves and away from Frodo Baggins and his companions. Join the Malledhrim as they lay siege to the tower of Dol Guldur and confront the Lieutenant upon his own threshold.", "summary": "Siege of Mirkwood will expand the online world of Middle-earth where players will join forces to press further eastward into the dark, foreboding and treacherous forest of Mirkwood and take part in the epic conclusion to Volume II of The Lord of the Rings Online.
