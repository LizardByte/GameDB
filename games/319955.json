Over the past 20 years, PizzaDawg's has been successfully delivering pizzas to monsters.\n\nOur protagonist, PizzaBoy, is one of the many staff members unfortunate enough to be promoted to monster deliveries. After PizzaBoy gets promoted, life gets a whole lot whackier. While delivering pizzas he finds himself learning more about the company he works for, and even about himself. He befriends a vampire and a dog made of pepperoni who accompany him during many different scenarios he ends up in.\n\nThe game's ending is determined by the player's choice to search for the truth or remain ignorant of the company's dark secrets.\n\nCharacters:\n\nPizzaBoy is a loyal employee of 'Pizza Dawg's Pizza' who has recently been promoted to a more dangerous job (that pays an extra 60 cent an hour). Not much is known about his identity, as he seems to have lost all memories of his past. While delivering a pizza, he falls in love with a vampire.\n\nVampireGirl is one of the last surviving vampires on Earth. For unknown reasons, she has a burning hatred for pizza delivery guys. In her free time, she orders pizzas just to kill them. However, she makes an exception for one...", "summary": "Take control of PizzaBoy, a nimble pizza delivery guy equipped with an air dash that allows him to bounce off walls. This can be used to reach greater heights and distances than the standard run and jump. PizzaBoy must navigate dangerous environments to deliver pizzas to hungry monsters.\n\nPizzaboy must make it to the end of the level to deliver the pizza but don't expect it to be too simple, as each area is full of pizza-hungry monsters. Don't get too close or they might just steal a slice! The customer won't be happy with a half-eaten pizza.\n\nThe path to the customer won't always be straightforward either. Every level is a Metroidvania-style map, with many secrets, collectibles, and areas to explore. Alongside delivering pizzas, PizzaBoy may find opportunities to recover his lost memories and discover the dark secrets of the company he works for. The player's choice in how they tackle the level will determine the ending of each chapter, and ultimately the end of the game.\n\nIf the customer is satisfied with your performance, you might just get a 5-star review.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pizzaboy"}
