Development of Eternal Darkness continued on the Nintendo 64 for a short time before being ported to the GameCube as Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 version seemed to contain at least one playable character who only appeared as a bit-part in the final game: a knight named DeMolay. There appear to have been many other chapters cut from the final game as well, suggesting that Silicon Knights intended the game to have further sequels. Unfortunately, these also failed to appear.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eternal-darkness", "videos": [{"id": 62288, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "koBEIdTuaIQ"}, {"id": 62289, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "WVh_yJvsQKs"}, {"id": 62290, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LSD9iG7hdUQ"}, {"id": 62292, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7WIDWoefpAc"}]}
