Goddard exits a portal behind SpongeBob's house, and displays a message to him from Jimmy Neutron. Following Goddard through the portal, he meets Jimmy Neutron, Timmy Turner and Danny Phantom in Jimmy's lab. Jimmy coats SpongeBob with self-regenerating moisture to keep him from dehydrating. Jimmy explains that his latest invention, the Universe Portal Machine, has been copied by Professor Calamitous, whom has formed a Syndicate with Plankton, Vlad Plasmius, and Denzel Crocker, and are already stealing energy from their worlds.\n\nThe heroes attempt to teleport into Casper High, but arrive in Vlad's castle, where he reveals that his ghost portal is siphoning energy from the Ghost Zone, and has captured Danny's parents. Vlad knocks the group out and imprisons them in the Ghost Zone Prison. Befriending the Box Ghost, the heroes escape after defeating Walker. Danny leads the heroes to the Fenton Works ghost portal, and meet Sam Manson and Tucker Foley. Upon returning to the castle, the gang destroy the portal's generators. Danny possesses his father and uses his Ghost Gauntlets to pummel Vlad, but ends up escaping. The heroes' then travel to Bikini Bottom, using Jimmy's air gum to breathe underwater. Sandy Cheeks sends them to Jellyfish Fields to meet Patrick Star, but is sucked into a jellyfish-capturing harvester. After destroying the harvesters, the group find themselves on the Flying Dutchman's ship. Danny persuades him to let them go in exchange for bringing back his old crewmates. Upon arriving at the Chum Bucket, they free Patrick and the jellyfish. On the roof, they battle Plankton piloting a gigantic robotic crab to rescue Mr. Krabs, and learn that the villains have been extracting energy to power a Doomsday Machine.\n\nIn Dimmsdale, the heroes infiltrate and shut down the power to Crocker's golden fortress. They then head to Fairy World, where they encounter Jorgen von Strangle, free the fairies, and defeat Crocker piloting an exosuit at The Big Wand. The group then return to Jimmy's lab and meet Cindy Vortex. Jimmy then realizes that Calamitous has planted a flea-bot in Goddard to spy on him. The heroes use Jimmy's shrink ray to shrink down to enter Goddard, defeat the flea-bot, and hack it to locate Calamitous' lair.
