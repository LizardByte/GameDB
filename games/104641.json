You can buy and sell goods at each port to earn money. If you find good (long) words you can sail fast enough to avoid pirates. But if not, you can always battle the pirates to take their gold. Visit all of the ports to upgrade your ship, buy more cannons, and get pieces of an ancient treasure map to win the game.\nWindWord is endlessly replayable as each game features a randomly-generated map of the seas with islands, ports and words. Each game is a new adventure. See how fast you can build up your rank, earn money and find the treasure. Advance from \"Swabbie\" to \"Commodore!\"\nBe sure to read through the bullet-list how-to guide for all sorts of helpful tips and hidden game features!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/windword"}
