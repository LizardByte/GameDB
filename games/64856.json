The player simply watches each scene as it proceeds; the only interaction is occasionally selecting dialogue choices when prompted. Depending on the player's choices, they will reach one of four different endings. Once an ending is reached, the scenario leading to that ending can later be replayed without interruption. Any scene already viewed can also be freely revisited.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dancing-blade-katteni-momotenshi"}
