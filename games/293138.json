The organizers of the banquet are very busy, such as the partition of the place and the care for the boss. As the manager of the banquet, the player will challenge mini-games with various scenes of in-house events as a motif.\n\nA number of mini-games for all seasons! There are a total of 9 mini-games such as \"a drink master\" who pours beer into a mug and \"dish turning\" to help with entertainment. Some of them are full of seasonal feelings such as cherry blossom viewing, Nagashi somen noodles, and fireworks display, and they change every season.\nIn each mini-game, if you get a certain score or higher, a \"hard\" mode will appear. Let's aim to update the high score with a \"hard\" with a high difficulty level.\n\nExciting bingo tournament!!\nIf you get a high score and get a bingo ticket, let's participate in \"Bingo\" in the menu! Depending on the degree of collection of bingo prizes and the score of the game, the title as a banquet manager will rise, so please aim for the ultimate title!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/daienkai-buchou"}
