Move around to destroy the balls, and destroy as many as you can within the alloted time. Some balls reward you with more points than others; you get some points for destroying red balls, more for destroying blue balls, and even more for destroying green balls. Avoid black balls: those are bombs. \nAs you are moving your body to take out red, green, and blue balls while avoiding black balls, you are exercising. A calorie counter estimates how many calories you have burned.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ballstrike"}
