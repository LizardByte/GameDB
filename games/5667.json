A clown appears from the edge of the screen where there is a jumping board, and the player must move the seesaw located at the bottom of the screen so that the clown can bounce back off the seesaw once he jumps off from his starting position. If the player successfully gets the clown onto the seesaw, the clown on the other side shoots off into the air towards the 3 rows of balloons on the top of the screen. The clown may not have enough speed to reach the balloons if the first clown does not land squarely on the seesaw. Clowns bounce off of balloons, walls, and jumping boards, but will pass directly through multiple balloons if they are moving quickly enough. They will only bounce off the jumping boards when they are heading downwards, and will pass straight through the boards while moving upwards.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/circus-atari--1", "videos": [{"id": 16120, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "OfTyOK2CO6Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfTyOK2CO6Y", "title": "#17 Circus - VC 4000", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OfTyOK2CO6Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 132041, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "BVODkDgY4JQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVODkDgY4JQ", "title": "Atari 2600 - Circus Atari", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BVODkDgY4JQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
