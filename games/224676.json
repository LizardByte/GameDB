Players command German, Italian, French, United States and U.K. Commonwealth forces in a wide range of missions. Most of the scenarios primarily focus on historical armored engagements in this challenging desert environment. The battles of the western desert were unusual as there was generally a lack of cover, making weapons such as the German 88mm\u2019 especially deadly, being able to destroy almost any Allied tank at long range.", "summary": "Build your army and enter into combat with your enemy in the desert battles of WWII.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/desert-war-wwii"}
