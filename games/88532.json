It\u2019s a prequel to the censorship game Blackbar. In Grayout, you play Alaine, a rebelious resident of the totalitarian community called The Neighborhood, who wakes up in a hospital research lab following an accident\u2026 or so she is told. The game is a series of conversations with hospital staff, made challenging by Alaine\u2019s post-traumatic aphasia\u2014a disorder that affects one\u2019s ability to process language. Grayout simulates the experience of having a word on the tip of your tongue, the frustration of knowing what you mean but not how to say it, the feeling of being overwhelmed by the runaway thoughts inside your head and struggling to reign them in. This is a game for fans of text adventures, interactive fiction, word puzzles, story-driven games, and emotional simulations.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grayout"}
