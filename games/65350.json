The game is divided into 15 episodes, with each episode consisting of two Quickfire challenges and one Elimination challenge.\n\nWithin the Quickfire events, you will be asked to create a dish based on certain constraints. For example, you might be asked to create a salad based on the color white. That meal is divided into steps; for each step, you will need to pick ingredients, then process them. You have a wide variety of ingredients to choose from, and some go together better than others. If you pick interesting combinations of ingredients, the judges will comment, and you will get a better score. Also, you will receive a chaining bonuses for finishing up with multiple ingredients at around the same time. Once all steps are done, you will be graded on adhering to the instructions, the quality of the food, style, and time taken.\n\nElimination challenges are similar, but require you to make an entire meal instead of just one dish.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/top-chef-the-game"}
