Coming to mobile (Android, iOS) soon. Console releases are on our wishlist, depending on how the game's full launch on Steam performs.\n\nInspired by games like XCOM 2, Shadowrun, and Invisible Inc, Cyber Knights is a modern tactical RPG with some of our favorite elements: gridless movement, environmental cover, specialized overwatch, initiative manipulation and more. Independent enemy unit AI opens up a world of creative stealth options; pick them off one by one, stage diversions, or use advanced tech to sneak right by them.\n\nCombat is challenging and in-depth.
