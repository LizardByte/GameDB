A battle simulator with some strategy needed to get past certain levels, but overall a casual experience!\n\nIn a world where hope and joy have been eradicated, a lone light is birthed within the shadows. You alone are the ember that shall either burn out or create the conflagration that will allow the rebirth of this world. You have been created by The Elder as the final barrier in defense of the world of Atham. Blessed with the powers of Salran, Al\u2019math & Ir\u2019alok you must find and destroy the evil lurking to save all that is known.\n\nYou will encounter vast environments that will test your endurance, enemies that will challenge your strength, and different elements that will enhance your wisdom, or push you to madness. Meeting folks of all kinds, discovering new areas, or having your fortitude tested within the trials are all part of your adventure. A myriad of choices are yours to discover in Atham but beware: time is against you!\n\nExplore, conquer, and evolve as you gain knowledge in Atham. Use these skills to your advantage to abolish the evil from this world and take back control of your destiny -- or die trying.\nGoals:\n\nThe goal of this title is to bring entertainment and a side of maple syrup to your life.
