According to his unmatched brain, the destruction of mankind was drawing near: a monstruous power from space. It seemed to him like humans would not be able to stand against it. So, he built one huge robot in order to draw the power necessary to defend the Earth. This robot's name is Valsion; the ultimate robot, boasting immense power.\n\nHowever, the scientist, Bian Zoldark, felt insecure. He thought if all mankind wasn't united, if all their efforts weren't concentrated, they would not be able to defend themselves against the space invasion.\n\nTo prevent this thought from coming true, he formed a secret society, the Divine Crusaders (DC) and steadily built reserves for it. To unite the world by force; in other words, to conquer the world...\n\nDC's mobilization was quick. Unexpectedly, Super Robot pilots fell, one by one, into DC's hands. With more and more Super Robots joining them and the threatening power of the Valsion, it seemed like it was just a matter of time before all the world fell under DC's control.\n\nHowever, even if DC conquered the entire world, there would be people that continued to oppose their rule. Miraculously, some Super Robots escaped from DC's hands, including Gundam, Mazinger Z, and Getter Robo; they and their pilots stand against DC with all their hearts. Gathered in the White Base, they began to gain power with guerrilla activites, gathering companions from various places to rebel against DC.", "summary": "Dai-2-ji Super Robot Taisen was the first Super Robot Wars on a console, and the first entry to contain the traditional SRW gameplay that exists to this day.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dai-2-ji-super-robot-taisen"}
