The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you will be on land as well as in the air.

After a certain number of kills, a \"goose\" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon's powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a \"goose\" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/silk-worm--1", "videos": [{"id": 117371, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yPa7tl409Vw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPa7tl409Vw", "title": "1988 Silkworm  (Arcade) Game Playthrough Video Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yPa7tl409Vw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 117372, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "P4uSqhR5R6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4uSqhR5R6g", "title": "Silkworm (NES) Playthrough [60 FPS] - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P4uSqhR5R6g/sddefault.jpg"}]}
