The ball can rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this. \n \nThe game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/angleball"}
