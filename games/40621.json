You send your Spiderdroid in to capture a building by covering the structure with its unbreakable Droidweb. Your Spiderdroid lays down a web strand as it crawls along each girder. Once you have strung a web strand completely around an opening, the Spiderdroid flings a web over that opening. Your objective is to travel all the building's girders so the entire structure is caught in\nyour Droidweb.\n\nBut watch out! The building is swarming with Birddroids out to have your Spiderdroid for lunch. If you get cornered, use your secret weapon!\n\nPress the Joystick's button to cast a magic spell that makes the Birddroids\ninvisible and unable to eat you...but only for a few seconds. And remember - each of your Spiderdroids can cast only four magic spells.\n\nOnce you capture the first building, it's time to send your advanced\nMummydroid to capture the next one, which is guarded by a horde of Skeledroids!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spiderdroid"}
