Run your car by earning points and try to get the extra time before the time runs out. \n \nIf you stay in the race without crashing for some time, you will be rewarded with more points. Avoid crashing your car as this will cost you time and precious points. \n \nWatch out for roads with snow and gravel because you can easily lose control. You may have to slow down to get past the other race cars on these roads. \n \nSee if you can catch the birds to earn extra points and thus increase your score. Some are fast and others are slow, but driving and catching birds is no easy task. Oh! and try to catch the 3-color bird that gives you one of the 4 powers that will help you in the mission. \n \nBe rewarded by seeing your score on the Global Leaderboard and try to be the best in the world. \n \nThis is a fast and exciting game that requires quick reflexes!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arcade-racing-gt"}
