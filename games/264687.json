It's up to the Ascensions to bring order to the realms. This power given to ascensions is given by the same elder primordial who gave its power to the gods in the first place, but this thing wants you to earn it.\n\nSo anyways, Your goal as a player(The Fateborne) is to take control of a member(Create one) of Ardron(the universe) and either:\n1. Ascend and take control of the realm of your birth to protect it.\n2. Descend, and give all of your power to the elder primordial so that they can help take care of the realm of your birth.\n\nIf your character dies? You get nothing. You lose, GOOD DAY SIR!\nThe kicker is. To ascend or descend. You have to acquire knowledge. experience(points), and become stronger.\nHowever once you become level 21. You become an Initiate. You steal half of the current Ascensions power. and your Game Master(Weavers) will set up a duel either between you 2 specifically, or the whole party versus all the parties ascensions at the same time. Big war time. lots of fun. Or you can just concede and Descend right then and there.\n\nThat's the setting and the plot/reasoning for the game. If your character don't have a goal. Well it has one now, or maybe your character wants to do something else and just accidentally finds themselves in this situation? Who knows.
