They are ambushed by U.C.S. Wanzers, triggering a series of events that plunges the whole island into war. Royd's fianc\u00e9e, Lieutenant Karen Meure, goes missing in action.\n\nDischarged from the military, Royd sets out to investigate what happened to Karen. His quest leads him closer and closer to the conspiracy behind the incident and the powers that orchestrated it.\n\nWith dozens of characters to meet, its mature story, and non-Manichean protagonists, Front Mission is the classic of a tactical Japanese RPG genre, finally available worldwide.", "summary": "Wanzers return to the battlefield once more!
