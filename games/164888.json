All Tyberians had to do in order to enter his paradise was to simply die at the hands of his Dead Army. The war was over before it even began, with thousands perishing in the Tyrant's wake, only to be brought into his fold as undying thralls, bound by magic. The few living warriors left are scattered across the remnants of their homeland, tirelessly looking for a way to turn the tables on the tyrannical Tyrant. Lead a great Uprising, defeat the Dead Army, and drive the monstrous overlord back into the depths of the sea from whence he came.", "summary": "Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tyrants-blessing", "videos": [{"id": 69578, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CpeagcA4TNQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpeagcA4TNQ", "title": "Tyrant's Blessing - Official Release Window Announcement Trailer | Summer of Gaming 2022", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CpeagcA4TNQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 55616, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "fqXznoQqzsA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqXznoQqzsA", "title": "Tyrant's Blessing (trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fqXznoQqzsA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
