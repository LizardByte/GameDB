As usual, the goal is to find and click on all the items from a list at the right side of the screen, on cluttered locations around the Tahiti island, within a time limit.\n\nBesides the list items, each location has four hidden pearls. After collecting them, the player receives one extra hint. The hint button highlights the position of one of the required objects.\n\nMini-games appear between stages, where the player has to find the differences between two similar images, assemble jigsaw puzzles and solve similar challenges.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}]}
