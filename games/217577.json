The story progresses by discovering relics like old newspaper articles and notes that help the girls unravel the island\u2019s secret past. While exploring, the girls will also be confronted by a series of spirits. They will need to use a Fatal Frame franchise classic, the Camera Obscura, to repel vengeful ghosts, sealing away their power by photographing them. Throughout the game, the girls will need to equip stronger lenses and change out different films in order to capture the most powerful spirits, while also using the camera to capture \u201cthings that cannot be seen\u201d to help them find the evidence they need to remember their haunting past.", "summary": "Unforgettable horror.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "videos": [{"id": 74638, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "XwxRTmO_lrY"}, {"id": 74891, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vPUQE_GO-GE"}]}
