I decided to make this trailer since it's been about a year since I made the last trailer if you don't count the Demo Release. Unfortunately there is no new Demo to play or anything like that. I just felt like releasing a new trailer for the sake of showing how much progress we've been making with this hack. Just in case you're unaware, Super Mario Starshine is a modification for Super Mario Galaxy 2 that aims to make Sunshine levels playable in the Galaxy 2 engine.\n\nBianco Hills Remix (Trailer Theme): https://youtu.be/BbaFo9D7KAY\n\nShine Mod by Froggo: https://youtube.com/channel/UCiyIBAMGwkgvlc2uIIIikTg\n\nSocial Links and Stuff:\nMy Discord - https://discord.gg/3xvcveZ\nMy Twitter - https://twitter.com/SPG642\nMy Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/spg64\n\n#SuperMarioGalaxy #SuperMarioGalaxy2 #SuperMarioSunshine\n\nThanks for watching my stuff! :D", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sKloGkRN3xU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sKloGkRN3xU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sKloGkRN3xU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sKloGkRN3xU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sKloGkRN3xU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Super Mario Starshine - 2023 Trailer", "description": "Super Mario Starshine Discord Server:\nhttps://discord.gg/2Qzqn3WGfY\n\nBefore you even mention it, yes I am aware that the Title Screen in this trailer still shows the year 2022.
