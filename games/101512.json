Of course you do.\n\nExpand your water park, adding exciting facilities, and become the talk of the town. Your visitors will take selfies at your park, generating free publicity for you! Befriend them and they'll send you comments and suggestions.\n\nMake your visitors happy by offering a range of foods and beverages for purchase at food stalls, creating colored or scented pools, and giving away free floats and swimwear.\n\nCollect ingredients and cook foods, then create menus for your food stalls.\n\nYou'll be spoiled for choice when customizing your water park, with a wide choice of attractions to build. You can also have both indoor and outdoor pools, so that no matter the weather, your visitors will always have somewhere to splash about in comfort.\n\nCan you create a wonderful water park that everyone will love?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pool-slide-story"}
