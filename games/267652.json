This game is significantly better than the first\ngame in the series, but also much harder. If you can't read Japanese very\nfast and if you are not going to cheat using save states, then this game is\ngoing to be a huge problem to beat. But it seems like a native Japanese\nspeaking person would find this game to be a lot of fun.\n\nThe game flow is the following. You choose a region of Japan that your\ncharacter lives in. Then you will compete in the regional quiz championships.\nThis is composed of a qualifying quiz that you have to get 10 questions right\nto pass, then you compete against the other contestants from your region that\nalso passed the qualifying test. If you get first or second place, you will\nmove on to the national level of the game. Again, you must pass a qualifying\nquiz. Then you will compete against the other contestants that made it this\nfar. Finally, the winner will compete against the Quiz King.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gimme-a-break-shijou-saikyou-no-quiz-ou-ketteisen-2"}
