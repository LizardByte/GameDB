The game was originally programmed back in 1983, but was never commercially released due to ownership changes at Atari. This game requires the use of the Kid's Controller, although the keyboard and touch pad controllers work fine with it also.\nA version of Holey Moley complete with a cartridge, manual, box and Kid's Controller overlay was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo.
