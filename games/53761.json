Fight party crashing monsters with the power of music! Level your party and upgrade your gear while dancing to the beat of some SICK tunes. Packing in a fully-fledged story mode with a colorful cast of musically-empowered heroes and villains, The Metronomicon sees you take control of a party of eight new masters of the \u201crhythmic combat arts\u201d to wage musical warfare against a multitude of dance-mongering fiends. Control up to four concurrent heroes as they cast powerful spells, buff their teammates, and beat down their enemies with a variety of magical loot and groovin\u2019 dance moves. The effectiveness of your team is all in the rhythm, so put on your dancing pants, light up dad\u2019s disco ball, and prepare your body for The Metronomicon. Oh, and did I mention couch co-op? Because nothing's better than an armored dance partner. Hash me bro! #Metronomicon \"You got your glowsticks in my chainmail! You got your fireballs in my dubstep!\" - Danny (lead dev) The Metronomicon features a fantastic, fully-licensed soundtrack featuring some of the hottest electronic, synthwave, chiptune and indie artists, including an exclusive track from Jimmy Urine of Mindless Self Indulgence, an unreleased track from Shiny Toy Guns, along with tracks from YACHT, Perturbator, J-Punch, Dj CUTMAN, and many, many more. As much a soundscape as it is a soundtrack, the music behind The Metronomicon is set to be every bit as varied and exciting as the gameplay itself.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-metronomicon-deluxe-edition"}
