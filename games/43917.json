Your objectives include getting past security to snag an autograph, lighting \"PASS\" to access backstage, collecting weapons, shooting a spinner to upgrade record sales, hitting the Statue of Liberty repeatedly to reveal the Destroyer Skull to start 3-ball, spelling \"MAYHEM\" to light video mode, collecting lost souls, discovering hidden power-ups, locking balls with Gene's tongue and much more. \n \nYour perspective is directly above each table. You can see approximately one-third of the playfield at a time with the screen scrolling to follow the course of the ball. Each table has the standard two-flipper layout, with the ability to nudge the table up, left, and right to influence ball movement.
