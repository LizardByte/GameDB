Smith and initially released online in 2009. The game went on to receive a limited cartridge release through Good Deal Games in 2011. Miss It was later included in the Atari Flashback series of plug-and-play consoles, starting with the Atari Flashback 5 in 2014, and most recently in the Atari Flashback X Deluxe in 2019.\n\nIn Miss It, the player must move a black square to avoid touching colorful squares that bounce around the screen, the number of which increases over time. The longer the player manages to avoid contact, the higher the score they achieve. The left difficulty switch can toggle the functionality of the score counter, either to go up 1 point every second, or to only increase when the the player is moving.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/miss-it"}
