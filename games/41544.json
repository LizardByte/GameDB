The object of the game is to get a higher count of cards than the dealer, up to but not over 21. If a player draws cards with a point value over 21, the hand is a BUST, and he loses his bet to the dealer. If the dealer's goes BUST, he pays off each of the remaining players. A player may \"draw\" any number of cards until he reaches or exceeds a total of 21. The dealer must \"draw\" a card on 16 or less and \"stick\" with his hand on 17 or more. An ace counts as either 1 or 11 at the player's discretion. Kings, queens and jacks count as 10 each. All other cards count as their face value.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/las-vegas-blackjack"}
