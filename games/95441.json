The train tracks circulate those dispensers as they keep filling the inner field around them with balls. Matching 3 or more balls of the same color makes them disappear. If the spheres accumulate, a floating time bomb appears. Its detonation ends the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/steam"}
