If you like Atari you'll love Dodge 'Em!  If you love Atari you'll want to make Dodge 'Em your mistress, and then cheat on Atari behind its back.  Dodge opposing cars as you collect dots (or cursers) on screen in this fast paced, exciting Atari game from the 1970's!  Dodge 'Em is a super easy game to find and collect today and costs pennies. If you like Atari games like Maze Craze, Surround or Indy 500 you'll dig Dodge 'Em because the simplicity of the gameplay makes it addictive and extremely challenging.  Change lanes and avoid the opposing cars as they try to smash into you preventing you from collecting points!  Bitches!  DodgeEm is one of those classic video games that can be easily overlooked because it doesn't have a popular, catchy mascot.  Don't pass this game up though!  Classic Game Room reviews Atari games with respect for the past 30 years of old school retro gaming.
