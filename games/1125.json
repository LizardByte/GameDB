According to the Boku Dracula-kun series, Kid Dracula is 10,009 years old. In Castlevania Judgment, Galamoth sends the Time Reaper from 10,000 years in the future.", "summary": "His pearly fangs drive the girls wild, while his dead-of-the-party sense of humor makes them scream. He's Kid Dracula, star of the mythical Transylvania 92010, and the coolest living corpse ever to stake his claim on the Game Boy. If you thought Mario had a way with magic, you should see junior jugular's spellbinding powers, including the mesmerizing bat transformation. Poof! Nobody wings it better than Kid Drac.\n\nThis game is both a remake and a sequel to the original Kid Dracula, on the Nintendo Entertainment System.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kid-dracula", "videos": [{"id": 38268, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BerT_XrWWU4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BerT_XrWWU4", "title": "\u307c\u304f\u30c9\u30e9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9\u304f\u3093 (FC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BerT_XrWWU4/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 6722, "name": "Kid Dracula"}]}
