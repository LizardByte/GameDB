The submarines come in four different variants, and additional purchases act as additional \"lives\". Each can be equipped with a one-way, two-way or three-way fire weapon of increasing power (and thus cost). Secondary weapons include sonic waves, powershots and target-seeking missiles. The player can also purchase auxiliary satellites and specify their movement pattern, which can be circular orbits, vertical and horizontal movements, or an intercepting action.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-out"}
