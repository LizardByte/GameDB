This port is credited to Piko Interactive in its ROM header, and was reportedly developed by Shiru. The game seems to have considerable slowdown if running on standard Genesis hardware.\nThe port features three video modes, one of which has the screen rotated on its side (creating an arcade-perfect pixel layout). Different consoles will utilize one of the three modes depending on its form factor.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pac-man--34"}
