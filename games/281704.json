By shooting out gems, match 3 or more gems in a row or column to score! Clearing multiple sets of gems in quick succession will add to your combo which will increase the points scored.\n\nThe timer is ticking down and it's game over when it hits zero. Clearing rows and columns will add time to the timer and you'll get more time added for longer rows of gems. After clearing enough lines, more and more worthless rocks will start to enter the play area which you'll have to clear them out by shooting them.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shootagem", "videos": [{"id": 104334, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5WBnrLRhHJ8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WBnrLRhHJ8", "title": "Shootagem - joe - SMS Power!
