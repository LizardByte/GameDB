Villages provide food as well as villagers, who are weak warriors, but attack in hordes and when they turn to berserkers, they can gain a destructible force. Gold can be gathered at mines, mage towers can shoot fireballs and destroy garrisons in enemy houses, etc.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
