{"id": "oxiML5IrXpE", "snippet": {"title": "Amiga 500 Longplay [165] Time Machine", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nPlot from the manual:\n\n\"Professor Potts is a recluse scientist who has a pet obsession - traveling through time and space.\n\nOur hero, Potts is working on his time machine when suddenly he is the victim of a terrorist attack. Unfortunately an explosive device hits the time-machine and also the vital accelerator crystal (a rare carbon that is only formed at extreme heat and pressure) becomes destroyed, throwing Potts into a time warp. The future has happened, leaving him trapped in prehistoric times...\n\nYou take the part of Potts, and must manipulate history from prehistoric times to the present day. To return to your own time zone you must first create your own future by interfering with evolution. In order to survive you must also protect the environment and man's forebears. Your final goal is to stop the terrorist attack and rescue the time-machine, now 10 million years in the future.\"\n\nA bit annoying controls and sound effects, especially the sound when you are next to an item you can interact with. You can play with either music or sound, not both. This version of the longplay is music (which is what I prefer). You can check out the sfx version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1vF5-e4jNE. Usually I record with sfx, then manually add the right music in the right places later and upload both versions; one with just music, and one with sfx+music. This time I can't do that as the game uses a bunch of sub-tunes, which would make for one helluva painful editing... experience. So played through the game twice instead.\n\nThere are some weird hiccups in the music, and something that sounds like broken instruments, sudden short high pitch stuff as well. They are not editing errors (maybe like 5% of the \"hiccups\" are from using save states, unavoidable). The game music just behaves like this. Maybe bad coding or not 100% compatible emulation? I tried .ipf and .adf and WHDLoad version with stock A500 and A1200 (with 100% floppy speed), and it sounded the same on all of them.\n\nThe text-based walkthrough I found wasn't detailed enough, so I had to use my poor brain to THINK for myself, arggghh! I'm too lazy to think, but it had to be done. There was no video longplay, except the C64 version, which I looked at a bit just to see the differences, and there were quite a few.\n\nJust a little about what's going on, as it seems it can be confusing to some watchers: The first thing I have to do is to unlock time zone 2, which is a cold age (ice age?). To do that I need to cool down the place by plugging the fire holes with rocks,. Also, to have some living creatures in the coming future (next age/time zone), I transport some monkeys(?) to the cave using my pods. I teleport between the pods using F1-F4, and the different time zones using 1-5. Then when the holes has been plugged and enough creatures have been delivered to the cave, time zone 2 is unlocked. But Time zone 1 needs to be maintained or it closes. Like, the yeti who keeps plugging the holes because he doesn't want the heat to come up, and the new (evolved?) creatures in the cave dies off or something and needs to be replaced every now and then.\n\nLike 1/3 of the video is the intro and outro music :)\n\nI know about the shortcut through the huts, but didn't want to cheese through the carrying part. I show it in the extras video instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q5194dzBM8.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n04:43 - Gameplay starts\n19:13 - Outro/ending -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxiML5IrXpE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxiML5IrXpE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxiML5IrXpE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxiML5IrXpE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oxiML5IrXpE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga 500 Longplay [165] Time Machine", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Ironclaw\n\nPlot from the manual:\n\n\"Professor Potts is a recluse scientist who has a pet obsession - traveling through time and space.\n\nOur hero, Potts is working on his time machine when suddenly he is the victim of a terrorist attack.
