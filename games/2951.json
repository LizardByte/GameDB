Young Alex Ryder longs to visit the planet, but his father Jason, a seasoned trader, reminds him of the strict regulations. The Ryder family has a long history in trading, but Alex is still uncertain about his future, torn between adventure and stability.\n\nAs the ship prepares for hyperspace, a heavily armed Cobra-class freighter follows them unnoticed. The Avalonia jumps into Witch-Space, a mysterious and dangerous realm, but Jason soon realizes they are being pursued. Emerging near Leesti, they are attacked. With the ship doomed, Jason forces Alex into an escape pod, uttering the cryptic word \u201cRaxxla\u201d before the Avalonia is destroyed. The Cobra fires on the escape pod, leaving Alex drifting toward the planet below.\n\nAlex survives the destruction of the Avalonia thanks to his RemLok mask, which shields him and sends a distress signal. Rescued by a hospital vessel, he vows to avenge his father's death who seemed to have anticipated the attack.\n\nLater, Alex receives a mysterious HoloFac message from Rafe Zetter, an old associate of his father. Rafe reveals to a surprised Alex that his father was more than a trader\u2014he was an \u00e9lite combateer. When Alex mentions \"Raxxla,\" Rafe explains it\u2019s a legendary ghost planet, suggesting Jason\u2019s death is tied to a greater mystery. Before disappearing, Rafe instructs Alex to visit the grave of Starpilot Fleischer in Tionisla\u2019s orbital cemetery for vital information.\n\nAlex arrives at the eerie, massive, orbital graveyard at Tionisla. Following Rafe Zetter\u2019s instructions he searches for the grave of Starpilot Fleischer and discovers a battered Cobra-class ship with a blinking signal directing him to land. Inside the Cobra, he only finds a corpse at the controls, and a woman named Elyssia Fields. A sharp-witted fugitive from the clone-world Teorge, Elyssia reveals their plan\u2014to steal the abandoned ship, once owned by Henry Bell, and use it to start a trading career while secretly preparing for revenge against the Cobra that killed Alex\u2019s father. With minimal fuel and weak defenses, they must trade and upgrade their ship before taking on their enemy.\n\nAlex Ryder, now in possession of a ship and with Rafe Zetter's guidance, is preparing for a dangerous journey to avenge his father's death. Rafe explains that Alex's father, Jason, was part of the legendary Dark Wheel, a secret group searching for hidden truths in the universe. Jason's death wasn\u2019t caused by pirates but by someone trying to protect a secret he discovered. To uncover this secret and follow in his father's footsteps, Alex must reach elite combat status, which involves seeking out danger and bounty hunting. Despite the shock, Alex is determined to honor his father's legacy. In the meantime, during various skirmishes Alex\u2019s skill in combat becomes evident.\n\nOver three months of trading aboard their modified Cobra Nemesis, Alex and Elyssia work toward transforming their ship into a battle-ready vessel but remain low on funds. Weighing risky trade options, they are interrupted by a cryptic message from Patrick McGreavy. McGreavy, horribly disfigured by parasites, with a shady past, warns Alex that he is being watched and manipulated, even by Rafe Zetter. He urges Alex to visit the traders' center in South City on Coriolis station. Entering the seedy underworld of illicit trade, Alex meets McGreavy at the Magellan Building, where he is offered a deal to trade rare creatures called Mymurths, revered by the Ciragian people. With limited funds, Alex purchases them, hoping to sell them for a significant profit\u2014money that will bring him one step closer to arming the Nemesis for his ultimate mission: vengeance.\n\nAs Alex and Elyssia approach Cirag, an unregistered and dangerous planet tied to Alex\u2019s father\u2019s past, they find it swarming with criminals. They are ambushed by pirate ships. In the ensuing battle, Elyssia skillfully evades and destroys several fighters. Pursued relentlessly, Elyssia is injured, leaving Alex to take control. They manage to escape to a Coriolis station, only to discover a disturbing truth\u2014the Mymurths they\u2019ve been transporting are infected with Tharglets, the deadly larval form of the infamous Thargoids. Realizing they\u2019ve been set up and that their cargo is more dangerous than they imagined, Alex\u2019s mission takes on a new urgency.\n\nIn the heat of battle, Alex finally faces the Cobra that destroyed his father\u2019s ship. Driven by revenge, he engages in a desperate dogfight but soon realizes the Nemesis is outmatched. Using the sun\u2019s radiation to his advantage, he fires a missile cloaked by solar interference, striking the Cobra and destroying it in a fiery explosion.\n\nAfter his victory over the Cobra and the pirates, Alex Ryder gains recognition from the Galactic Police, earning the prestigious Deadly status\u2014an impressive feat for someone of his age. Rafe Zetter reappears, revealing more about Jason Ryder\u2019s connection to Raxxla\u2014a legendary, possibly alien gateway sought by the secretive Dark Wheel. Jason had been close to uncovering its secrets before his assassination. Rafe warns that those who control Raxxla will go to any lengths to protect it, making Alex a target if he continues his pursuit. Rafe offers Alex a place within the Dark Wheel, a path requiring years of training and sacrifice but one that could lead to unimaginable discoveries.", "summary": "Elite is a space trading video game, written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and originally published by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers in September 1984. Elite's open-ended game model, and revolutionary 3D graphics led to it being ported to virtually every contemporary home computer system, and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history. The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\".\n\nElite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game Star Trader. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elite", "videos": [{"id": 42598, "name": "Dev Diary", "video_id": "47HzgWqv_kk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47HzgWqv_kk", "title": "Acornsoft Elite - Promo Video 1984 - VHS", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/47HzgWqv_kk/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 544, "name": "Elite"}]}
