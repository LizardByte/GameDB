Pigs with guns. And flying bowls of soup! Sounds funny...but remember that each can zap you with a touch! You do have a couple of tricks up your sleeve. Collect power-up pots to fly faster and make your Ki force even more powerful! Defeat the mid-round bosses and you will earn the use of true magic...fireballs, guardian flames and bouncing bombs. Defeat the five world guardians and you'll become a Cloud Master! Fail, and you'll be locked in combat forever.
