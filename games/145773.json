IT corporations are gradually gaining more and more influence, becoming a modern aristocracy that couldn't care less about the law or mere mortals. Criminal organizations are still trying to resist the powerful corporations, but even they understand that the city of Farca is entering a cyberpunk future. They know that their golden age is over.\n\nAs private detective Isabella Song, you must navigate the city's disparate factions and investigate the most complex, seemingly unrelated cases with the help of gadgets, a small army of drones and your intellect. Though Izy is under house arrest after a bar fight, that won\u2019t stop her from doing her job. Getting online is no problem for a hacker, after all.\n\nYou must uncover information through hacking, surveillance, and the internet, create an information cloud from leads and logically connect them to draw conclusions and apply them in dialogues.\n\nAs the plot progresses, things get more complicated. The stakes get higher and the various plot strands come together to form a single story.\n\nThe choices you make in investigations have important consequences to the plot. Do you convict the suspect that all the evidence is pointing to or dig deeper? What collateral damage will you leave behind you?", "summary": "You are Isabella Song \u2013 a hacker PI.
