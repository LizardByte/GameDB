GobMan is highly remniscent of Pac-Man with a yellow proteagonist traversing multiple mazes eating dots and eluding ghosts.\n\nIn the shareware version of the game, ten stages are available which repeat after they are completed. If a player were to buy a registered version of the game, they would be given fifty more stages.\n\nThe game adds many different power-ups and layouts for the maze differentiating it from the traditional Pac-Man design. Alongside the \"power pill\" for eating ghosts and \"food\" bonuses, the game offers a \"bomb\" power-up to destroy all enemies, an \"hourglass\" to stop time briefly, and a \"red pill\" to make the walls disappear for a time. Extra lives are gained after every 10,000 points.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gobman"}
