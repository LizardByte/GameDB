Players control each outfielder individually and can throw the ball to each of the four bases, but the computer controls the infielders. When a ball is hit to an infielder, the batter is automatically out. When a ball is hit into the outfield, the perspective switches to an odd close-up angle of the nearest outfielder, who can run right and left to try and catch the ball. Pitchers can throw fast and slow and curve the ball right and left, providing the potential for some crazy- looking pitches.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/baseball--19", "videos": [{"id": 112176, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "inQZhAW8J5E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inQZhAW8J5E", "title": "Emerson Arcadia 2001 - [7] - Baseball", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/inQZhAW8J5E/sddefault.jpg"}]}
