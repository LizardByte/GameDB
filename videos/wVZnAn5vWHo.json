Get too complacent and all sorts of weirdos start coming out of the woodwork. Good thing Sam & Max are here to hose down the sleaze and keep some kind of peace. Violently, if possible. Who are these irreverent crime fighters? Sam's a six-foot tall canine shamus with a love of justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're a team of freelance police officers, on a mission to take down a bizarre mind-control conspiracy.\n\nGet ready to meet some off-kilter characters and to puzzle through some brain-tickling conundrums. Grab your Wii Remote, sit back on the sofa and get ready for some side-splitting humor!\n\n\nWebsite:http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/telltalegames\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/telltalegames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVZnAn5vWHo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVZnAn5vWHo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wVZnAn5vWHo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Sam & Max - Situation: Comedy", "description": "The full season is available now on XBLA and PC/Mac!\n\nXBLA: http://bit.ly/kMEcH9\nPC/Mac: http://bit.ly/Z7JawG\n\n\nSam & Max Season 1\n\nIt's a vile world out there.
