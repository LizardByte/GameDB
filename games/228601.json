As before, JellyCar 3 added more features to the game, such as video replays, car customization and secret goals. A limited rewind feature was also added, allowing players to back up on the current level and resume at a chosen point; a total of ten rewinds were available, with extra rewinds as in-app purchases. A March 2011 update added new car shapes, new customization options and the ability to race ghosts of other players.\n\nReviews of JellyCar 3 have been generally favorable, with a Metacritic rating of 84, based on seven reviews. Steve McCaskill of Pocket Gamer said the game was \"an addictive combination of driving and physics-based platforming that manages to overcome one or two minor control issues\". In the review for SlideToPlay.com, Chris Reed said that JellyCar 3 was \"a bouncy, wildly creative romp\" and that the March 2011 update \"brings more value to an already great game\".", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jellycar-3"}
