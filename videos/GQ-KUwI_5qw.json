I have never been so confused about what's going on while simultaneously having a perfect idea of what I need to be doing. There are tons of different mechanics, and dozens of cards/items to augment them in one way or another. On top of really well implemented difficulty settings. And all of it made by a single dev! The only thing that's bad about the game is that it's poorly explained so you have to sort of trial and error your way through what different things do and what you're meant to be doing with them. And sometimes English is a bit off since the dev doesn't speak it. Still, phenomenal cozy adventure, do play it if you're looking for something with short runs.\n\nGet the game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416050\nOther Random Games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Sdv8G17-r-ArcqANe_drNJXKnuTtJmF", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQ-KUwI_5qw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQ-KUwI_5qw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQ-KUwI_5qw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQ-KUwI_5qw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQ-KUwI_5qw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Cento - Full Run", "description": "Cento is an absolutely delightful game.
