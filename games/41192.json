Below your craft are six humans and you must stop them being taken by swooping aliens to the top of the screen and if they reach the top, they turn into skulls and fall down the screen. If you are hit by an alien or falling skull then you lose one of three lives but if you lose all the humans then it is game over.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/abductor"}
