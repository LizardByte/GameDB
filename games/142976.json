A small group calling themselves \"The Confederation\" discovered an ancient planet with unlimited resources which helped them develop their technical potential. It took them some time, but finally they\u2019ve managed to create an AI so profound that it developed a free will. They\u2019ve called these creatures \"Terteths\". With time passing these robots were assisting the Confederation in everything. Realizing their own potential the Terteths formed a Union and separate themselves from the Confederation. Few of them stayed as assistants to their masters but the others were curious about the rest of the universe, just like their creators. In their distant journeys the Terteths discovered another intelligent race at the far end of their Galaxy, Insect-like creatures they called \"Noxis\". Blinded by their eagerness for knowledge, the Terteths and the Confederation didn\u2019t notice that the Noxis had started to evolve. Like many other creatures the Noxis were parasites, linking with an unsuspected source they would drain information and eventually overtake their host. War has started. The three races were in constant conflict. The end wasn\u2019t near and some outcasts, less hostile communities separated from their people. They formed alliances and combined their knowledge in a final effort to escape. You can help the outcasts in their quest.", "summary": "Nemexia is a browser-based, massive multi-player online space strategy game.
