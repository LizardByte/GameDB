Your ship rapidly evolves as you defeat enemies, allowing you to shape its abilities and weaponry to your desires in a matter of minutes. Unlike many ARPGs which can absorb hundreds of hours of time, Nova Drift allows you to take a ship build from inception to execution in a single game session.\n\nFeatures\nCreate a unique build every run. Games are quick, allowing for rapid experimentation, iteration, and advancement.\nCunning and creativity are rewarded as you chain upgrade modules for powerful synergies.\nAccess over 120 modular upgrades as you progress and expand your arsenal.\n\nBuild to play how you want. Snipe, command a drone army, discharge your shields, charge up, burn enemies with your thrusters, or smash right through them... there's a way to make it work.\nUnlock various challenge modes, providing greater risk and rewards. The stakes are high, as death is permanent!\nEvery game is randomly generated, keeping the fight intense and unpredictable. Fight through the campaign or play endlessly...\n\nNova Drift is a living game. Frequent updates will continue to expand the depth and content of the game world.\nPlanned updates soon after Early Access launch:\nBody Gear: Viper | Weapon Gear: Dart | Weapon Gear: Thermal Lance | Super Mod: Barrage\nWeapon Mutations: each weapon type will have 1-2 variations\nNew Challenge Mode: Wild Metamorphosis - extremely rare mods that have a variety of powerful and/or bizarre effects\nTranslation into French, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese & more...", "summary": "Nova Drift distills the mechanical depth of an action RPG into classic arcade space combat.
