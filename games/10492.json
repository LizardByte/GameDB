The player has the opportunity to seize settlements, manage their resources and build various constructions and installations, enjoying the best of RTS elements.\nThe world of Konung is a unique and spacious fantasy land that combines parts of known history with classical myths and the legends of the Chronicles, including immortal heroes, magical artefacts and ancient sorcery.
