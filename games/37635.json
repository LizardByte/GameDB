The story focuses on the manga's protagonist, a cute half-human, half-dragon girl named Mink. She is in love with a pop singer and dragon-slayer Dick Saucer; however, to win his love, Mink has to find a magical potion to turn her into a human. In the game, Mink and her friend Lufa and Pia are having a vacation on the beach, listening to Dick Saucer's concert on the radio. When Dick mentions Mink in his \"special thanks\" speech, she decides to find him no matter what, even if it means changing her own nature.", "summary": "Based on the crazy manga/anime, Dragon Half is a board game style of affair, similar to 21 Emon or some of the Peachboy titles. You progress around a board by rolling a dice, competing against other human or computer controlled players. Landing on different coloured squares has different effects. Some of these cause special events, others trigger animated battle sequences that require precisely timed button pushes for maximum impact.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-half", "videos": [{"id": 105839, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "DAQkmR4rmNQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAQkmR4rmNQ", "title": "(PC-98) Dragon Half - Microcabin - Gameplay and Card Battle System Explanation", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAQkmR4rmNQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
