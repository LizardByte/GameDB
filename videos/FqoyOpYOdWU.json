{"id": "FqoyOpYOdWU", "snippet": {"title": "Drakengard Trailer (English)", "description": "Drakengard is one of those unknown, underated games. The game play itself is a bit repetitive for ground missions especially. The game is somewhat of a mix between Panzer Dragoon with its air missions, and Dynasty Warriors with the ground missions, with a little taste of Final Fantasy mixed in, considering it was made by Square Enix. What really makes this game shine is its story. It's the perfect story of a tragic hero, and really gets going after Chapter 4. This game is also extremely twisted in its own way. (Not sick twisted, don't worry) Infact, it's been said that the English version has been toned down quite a bit. Since this game is of a tragic hero, there really isn't a 'happy' ending to this game, even though there are 5 endings. Even so, each ending is something completely unpredictable. This game is a MUST have!\r\n\r\nBy the way, the song used in this trailer is Drakengard's theme song, Growing Wings. I can't find it anywhere at all. If anyone knows where to find this song for download, preferrably english, please tell me?", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FqoyOpYOdWU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FqoyOpYOdWU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FqoyOpYOdWU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Drakengard Trailer (English)", "description": "Drakengard is one of those unknown, underated games.
