The look of the game is inspired by classic sci-fi book covers of the 70s and 80s and the major sci-fi films of that era. Each area is a visual treat for sc-fi fans. \n \nThe setting evokes a strong sense of wonder and is highly interactive and alive with AI nuances. Each area is designed to be revisited many times without becoming stale.", "summary": "\"Starlit: Colony\" is a 2d sci-fi action adventure game, dedicated to exploration, experimentation, emergent gameplay, and narrative. Its unique approach to non-linear exploration and action gameplay offers a fresh take on Metroidvania gameplay: The player must use photography to gain knowledge of a hugely detailed and fascinating ecosystem. This knowledge is used to manipulate creatures and systems in order to survive.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starlit-colony"}
