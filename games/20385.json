Many enemies need to be hit from the side, thus Mario must throw shells from the background to the foreground and vice-versa in order to knock them off.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-clash", "videos": [{"id": 35650, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "PcFJDt8_U0g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcFJDt8_U0g", "title": "Mario Clash: Nintendo Virtual Boy (1995) - 3D Anaglyph", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PcFJDt8_U0g/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
