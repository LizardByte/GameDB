You had better be ready for action if you want to survive the frantic, side-scrolling mayhem of TWEETY'S HIGH-FLYING ADVENTURE for the Game Boy Color. You play as the lovable Tweety Bird in an adventure to save an endangered orphanage. In an animated take on AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, you travel to 10 different locales and collect pawprints from 80 cats spread across exotic foreign cities. You'll need to bop these kitty cats with weapons and power-ups like spatulas, plunger guns, oil slicks, banana peels, and more. Just be careful to avoid chomping plants, squirmy worms, bugs, bees, and butterflies along the way. Lola Bunny updates the action with humorous newscasts between levels as you run, jump, and fly your way to victory. You'll need quick, button-smashing reflexes and platform-hopping skills of the highest degree to save the kids in TWEETY'S HIGH-FLYING ADVENTURE.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tweetys-high-flying-adventure"}
