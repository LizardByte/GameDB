If you somehow manage to gain the appropriate number of points during an opponent\u2019s turn, you must wait until the end of your next turn before you can win the game (assuming no one else manages to win before then). The number of victory points required to win depends on the scenario being played. the game constantly displays the number of victory points you currently have, as well as the number that you need to win. You gain victory points in five ways: building settlements, upgrading settlements to cities, deploying the largest army, building the longest trade route, and gaining victory point cards. Settlements built in a region where you did not begin with a settlement gain an extra victory point.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/settlers-of-catan"}
