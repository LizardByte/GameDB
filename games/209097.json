In this place, beautiful, colorful creatures called\nNefties flourish, living as nature intended. Wealth here is distributed, with no single entity powerful enough to dominate the rest. This new world is called TOKAN\u00c9. The powers of Antik have discovered the existence of Tokan\u00e9\nand have created a portal to pass between worlds. Denizens of Antik are filtering into Tokan\u00e9, fleeing their masters,\ncorrupting the Nefties and greedily staking their claims. And their masters are not far behind ...", "summary": "Aurory is a free-to-play, tactical, turn-based JRPG built on the Solana blockchain. Players are invited to explore a rich and diverse universe where they will travel across the worlds of Antik and Tokan\u00e9 as they complete quests, discover lost relics, defeat enemies, and compete against other players using creatures called \u201cNefties\".\n\nThese magical creatures can be hatched, evolved, traded, used to battle, and have been designed as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
