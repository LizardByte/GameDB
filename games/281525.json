But it does mix and match different types together, and in general extends the stages with additional hoodlums. There are a few other notable structural differences \u2013 namely, the fight on the huge moving bulldozer at the end of the forest level is missing, but to make up for its omission, the Lee brothers actually have to fight Willy before they meet their own shadows like in the arcade game. They also get to face the Shadow Master (now without the cape) on any difficulty level, although you miss out on the second round in a church and the good ending with Marion revived unless you beat the game on the Hard difficulty mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/double-dragon-ii-the-revenge--11"}
