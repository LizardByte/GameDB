You are an explorer and have decided to navigate the maze and find the answers on the other side.\n\nESCAPE is a single screen top view maze game where the screen has many paths to walk along as you try to find an axe that is hidden to break a blue door at the other side. As you explore the maze you are being chased by a dinosaur and if he catches you then it is game over.\n\nWhen you walk over the axe then the border turns black and you pick it up but this slows you down and if a dinosaur is close then you can drop it to speed up. Once you manage to break the door then you are given a time and you can select another skill level (1-5) with more dinosaurs the higher the level.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}]}
