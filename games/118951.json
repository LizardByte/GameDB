Instead of being represented visually (which would have been sensible), everything is represented via text (which is not sensible). Push:Block features 30 levels of block-pushing action, original music, deep lore about a cult obsessed with cudgelling watermelons, and an allegorical narrative about friendship and community. \n \nI'm not sure if Push:Block is the kind of thing that can be enjoyed. But I hope that it is, and I hope you enjoy it.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/push-block"}
