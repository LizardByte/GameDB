As he progresses deeper into the game, players must decide which suit to rely on - the agility and quickness of the red suit, or the sheer power of the black suit. As Spider-Man defeats enemies, he'll unlock new abilities, web moves, and suit upgrades, including the ability to call in other Marvel characters as allies, such as Nightcrawler and Green Goblin.\n\nThe game's sidescrolling action lets players explore the expansive, symbiote-corrupted New York at their own pace. Abilities unlocked in the game let players explore deeper into the city, allowing Spider-Man to traverse symbiotic sludge and blast through ichor-filled tunnels, as well as defeat the increasingly-dangerous infected denizens.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spider-man-web-of-shadows--1"}
