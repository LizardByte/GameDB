You'll face monsters of all shapes, sizes, and varieties, each with their own powers and abilities which may make your time in Hell, well....Hell. No Water in Hell is a 2D roguelite which is designed in the same vein of games such as The Legend of Zelda, Enter the Gungeon, and Crypt of the Necrodancer which features top-down gameplay and 4-directional movement.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/no-water-in-hell", "videos": [{"id": 56457, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "SPwUKHXMvjc"}]}
