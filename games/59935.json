Each one of them, obsessed with the desire of creation, wanted to shape the world in their own way. After a countless time of void, they all agreed to create one world, and share everything between themselves.\n\nThe First Brother created fire, from which emerged a burning, barren land. The surface was hot and thick smoke eclipsed the whole sky. In these flames he called himself Gnashal and his fiery spirit began to circle over the land, feeding on evil lurking inside.\n\nThe Second Brother formed stone and spread it all over the land. His grounds were hard and solid, full of power and greatness. In this rock, he carved his name, Talkatan, and soon after that, he took his first step on his newly created land.\nThe Third Brother despised the look of the land, so he filled all the remaining space with a humongous ocean. From horizon to horizon the only thing he could see was the infinity of undisturbed water. From that arose a mighty father of the oceans, known as Malaloth.\n\nThe Fourth Brother, Magin, refused to divide the land. Rather than sharing he used his powers to spread his energy through the air. Magic was created. A mystical power without purpose rose above the flames, water and stone. Wherever it appeared, it distorted everything. It raged the oceans, softened the lands, and dimmed the fire.\n\nWhen the other brothers saw this they became very displeased with his actions and decided to destroy the magic once and for all, by hiding everything deep within the ground. Within a short period of time, Gnashal used all of his power and the fire within the ground suddenly burned like never before. The earth erupted with huge living flames, destroying everything it encountered on its path. Fiery smoke reached high in the air and demolished the magic on every height possible. Then Malaloth controlled his water to ruffle and shout. The calm oceans began to form whirls, powerful currents and soon the whole magic presence above the water was dispersed. The final bit of the destruction was carried out by Talkatan. He used his power to evoke strong earthquakes. The earth was rising and falling, creating canyons, caves, mountains and valleys. Finally, all of them managed to trap the magic deep beneath the surface of the land.\n\nThe three brothers satisfied with their victory did not even notice how their actions had changed the world. The burned earth gave birth to volcanoes, holes and lava rivers. The hard rock grew into mountains, dry rivers and valleys and the water began to rage and crash into the shores of all the lands.\n\nAfter several centuries, the remaining Three Brothers fell into a deep sleep. While they were asleep, secretly from the fire, 11 Great Demons rose. They were the first beings younger than the brothers themselves, and although they were not equal to their fathers, they were extremely powerful. Jealous Talkatan awoken from his sleep powered his stone to become alive. 7 powerful leviathans opened their eyes. When Malaloth saw his brother\u00b4s work, he reached all the way to the bottom of the ocean and threw away a horde of creatures. Among them were serpents, snakes and other powerful predators living underwater. He also released a handful of birds that immediately began to fly high above the ocean.\n\nThese ancient beings rapidly bred their own servants. At this time, the Three Brothers realized that they were no longer the only creatures that had the ability to create and command their elements to disappear, fall or descend. They no longer had power over them. Knowing this, they decided to destroy their creations, just like they did with their fourth brother. After a long time of brutal and bloody fights, the Brothers fell. All three world powers roared victoriously, knowing that from now on, they had the whole world just for themselves.\n\nThe three forces of the early world quickly realized that their own land was not enough for them. The smaller demons eventually began to venture further and further into the land of rock and earth, shaping it into their own liking. Underwater creatures swam closer and closer to the shores of the other lands. Eventually, Leviathan Torgorath, wishing to defend his own land, smashed one of the demons with his tusk and unleashed what they now call the First War.\n\nOnce more, the three elements clashed in a monstrous battle between themselves, much longer and more destructive than before. The boundaries between the Lands began to collapse. Elements fighting each other began to fuse together. Between lands and water formed sands and grasslands which soon Basilisks, Snakes, Great Spiders and all the animals inhabited. The area of hard rock began to grow unknown plants, trees, shrubs and the fire made materials to be harder and nobler than earth and rock.\n\nThe war lasted for more than four centuries. During this period, the earth began to change more and more, causing a series of ever-increasing changes in the structure of the earth. Finally, the world had enough. During one of the giant clashes, the foundations of the world were heavily affected, leading to the First Cataclysm. A huge explosion broke out in one of the largest mountains. The force that freed from the earth swept most of the creatures from the ground and levelled the volcanoes and hills. The greatest of the monsters and demons managed to withstand long enough to bury themselves deep underground, but most of their servants did not resist the power of the world trying to escape annihilation.\n\nA giant explosion destroyed a piece of the earth's surface, revealing the magic that was hidden underneath for hundreds of years. Then, Varazin emerged from beneath the surface. An entity much more powerful than everyone else, made of pure magic, with four wings and a human-like body floating in peace and stillness over the immensity of the purifying world.\n\nAs soon as the cataclysm came to an end, Varazin created his servants. Rather than making them out of himself, he took one part of each of the existing elements and formed the first Humans.\n\nThe early humans, nowadays called the Ancients, quickly made their mark on the world. They did not belong to any of the elements, neither did they understand all the previous conflicts and therefore, they did not pay attention to the fact that they are changing the world, and even more \u2013 they enjoyed it. At the beginning of their existence, the rest of the still existing demons and other entities offered help. They taught people how to start a fire, extract minerals, and use water. Everyone wanted to gain a mighty ally in times of war. People used their teachings but they never fully trusted them. The Ancients considered them strange and evil beings.\n\nEventually, the monsters stood together before the council of already very numerous people and demanded an answer \u2013 who will they decide to serve. The answer of the Ancients was \u2013 nobody.\n\nThe war between Ancients and monsters was abundant in death and loss. Ancients were much stronger and mightier than today\u2019s people. They handled weapons of extraordinary quality and a great size with ease and crafted powerful armors which, despite their thickness, were very light and agile. However, they had no chance against the monsters that still remembered the beginning of this world. Ancients were losing soldiers quickly. They would lose the war eventually if it was not for Varazin's Sacrifice. As humanity began to fall, the so-far neutral Varazin had arisen above all the rocks, mountains and clouds. The battle stopped as both the ancients and monsters looked in the sky, shocked, not knowing what would happen next. Then a sudden surge of enormous energy appeared in the sky and in a blink of an eye everything exploded. It was Varazin who had destroyed himself, giving people his last gift - magic. This powerful release of energy triggered the Second Cataclysm. That eventually sealed the shelters of demons and other powerful creatures. Although the ancients were also affected by the cataclysm, they managed to survive, though this did cost them a lot of effort and power.", "summary": "Medivia Online is a massive multiplayer online roleplaying game first released in 2009.
