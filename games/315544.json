Does the Devil still live near the bridge? May be Lara will find him at home! Enjoy this 167 room level and see how is the hell! If the previous level do not had too many enemies (I do not like the free violence), in this one there are some, do not hesitate to shot them: They are not longer human, they are Wraiths! If you see them do some strange things like walk over lava, some time they do it, do not worry, it is not a Bug, they are not humans and they can do things that Lara can't do it. If you do not help them (with the weapons) to leave their actual existence, there system can slow down and additionally you will not find some pieces that they give you before disappear!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tarragona-4-devils-lair", "videos": [{"id": 125226, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LtnpOofkX6Y", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtnpOofkX6Y", "title": "Tarragona 4 - Devil's Lair ~ Josep Borrut", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LtnpOofkX6Y/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
