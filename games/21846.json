One of the Curators, a rogue Creator called \"the Collector\", is stealing the other Creators' creations and not sharing them with the world (sharing is one of the core elements of LittleBigPlanet). Play starts at the \"Gardens\" level, where the player meets the King, one of the Curators; the Queen; Little Xim; Big Zam and Dumpty. The player is taught the basic gameplay at this stage: running, jumping, and grabbing. The next setting is the \"Savannah\", where the player accidentally breaks one of the ruler's creations. In return for forgiveness the player must investigate what's scaring the ruler's buffalo. Further adventures involve finding Meerkat Mum's son and a Bridegroom (a story arc with a Day of the Dead theme). After the wedding play moves to the \"Canyons\", where the player must rescue Uncle Jalape\u00f1o and defeat the evil Sheriff Zapata. After completing this the player is taken to the \"Metropolis\" and gets a car for a race scenario. The next adventure takes place on the \"Islands\", where the player is trained in martial arts and must defeat the Terrible Oni. From there the player goes to the \"Temples\", to get a flame-throwing cat. Here they meet the Great Magician, who tells them to defeat the Collector in his \"Wilderness\". After the final battle the Collector is revealed to be a little, lonely man who kidnapped everyone because he did not have any friends. Everyone, including the player, offers to be his friend and he accepts, ending his being evil.", "summary": "If you were to stand on LittleBigPlanet and try to imagine a more astounding, fantastic, and creative place, full of enthralling adventure, uncanny characters, and brilliant things to do... you couldn\u2019t.
