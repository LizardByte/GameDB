You can play online against up to 4 players. \nAs the fruits ripen and their gauge rises, their status (speed, attack, defense, etc.) changes. You can speed up the ripening speed of your opponent by shooting gas from you at them. If it is too ripe, it will rot, but the strength of the gas you release will increase. \nUse items, attacks, and special moves at the right time to defeat the other fruits and survive! (Who's the strongest bad fruit?) \n \n\u30fbYou can play online with 2 to 4 players at the same time. \n\u30fbYou can play against other users or against your friends in a private environment.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bad-apples", "videos": [{"id": 43661, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "5nrayLsLSOQ"}]}
