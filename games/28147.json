Streets are empty, buildings are in ruins, remaining a few people live in fear of thieves and murderers.\n\nAfter the phone call Jason gets this morning, he will go on a journey to solve years old murders in the light of newly found evidence and face his worst nightmares in the dark corners of Islesbury.", "summary": "Seclusion: Islesbury is a mystery/horror adventure game with a focus on creating a deep atmosphere and an absorbing journey.\n\nIn this journey you will explore various locations with countless mysteries to solve while trying to stay out of the madness that surrounds the town.\n\nIs it really possible to solve a decade old murder case?
