Gameplay is similar to After Burner: the plane follows a predefined path, but the player can steer it slightly to evade incoming missiles. The player can fire guns and homing missiles, the latter of which requires the eponymous lock-on first.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lock-on--1", "videos": [{"id": 143837, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "pdjcZ6FbDr0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdjcZ6FbDr0", "title": "LOCK-ON (Arcade, Tatsumi/Data East, 1986) 720p HD 60fps", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdjcZ6FbDr0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
