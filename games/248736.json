It first plays from an overhead view of an Amusement Park where you can enter open doors which lead to 12 different themed worlds. Each world is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, where you face different enemies and end-level bosses all in your quest to find the Gold Amulet. Once you finish a certain number of the levels, you'll be rewarded with one of two mini-games. One is a target range where you have to shoot a number of enemies within a certain time. The other is a strength test where Ace must swing to hit a bell at the top of a pole.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ace-lightning--1", "videos": [{"id": 135788, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ab-8-C-eC1U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab-8-C-eC1U", "title": "Game Boy Advance - Ace Lightning \u00a9 2002 Gamezlab - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ab-8-C-eC1U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
