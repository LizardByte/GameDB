It was designed by SEGA and published by Other Ocean in 2008. The object of the game, like others in the Super Monkey Ball series, is to get AiAi, MeeMee, Baby or GonGon to the goal.\n\nThe graphics are similar to both Super Monkey Ball: Touch and Roll and Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz: the monkeys' sprites are reused from Touch and Roll and the level design and appearance are reused from Banana Blitz, although unlike Banana Blitz, you cannot jump.\n\nThere are five continues of six lives, totaling 30 lives altogether.\n\nThere are five worlds, and each world has two sets of ten stages.\n\nIf you collect all the Bananas on a stage without falling off, you will earn a crown. Earning a crown on every stage in a set unlocks an Extra Stage.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 37307, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wOc1xoitFJc"}]}
