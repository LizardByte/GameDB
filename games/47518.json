It's been twelve long years since the waters came. Most people left. Headed inland to make a new life for themselves. But the brave and hardy few stayed behind to eke out a living in this new world of ours, one day in the hope that they may reclaim the land once the waters leave. But nothing has changed. Folks have settled into a new life, a new routine and a new way of living. Now a new threat looms. May we have the strength to survive this too.\u201d\n\nFrom the diary of Samuel Webb dated September 25th, 1911", "summary": "\"Featuring a top-down isometric presentation, Empyre: Lords of the Sea Gates will rekindle old-school PC RPG fans with feelings of some of the classic story driven RPGs of the 90s. While the combat should feel familiar to veteran players, there\u2019s a new twist in that the game uses a hybrid Real Time/Turn-based System. Players can enter a \u201cPlanning Mode\u201d where they choose actions for each character in their party while combat is paused, and when entering into the \u201cAction Mode\u201d all characters will perform simultaneously, giving players complete control over their party while presenting a streamlined combat system that eliminates waiting for each character to act in sequence.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/empyre-lords-of-the-sea-gates", "videos": [{"id": 14890, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "AQQIfGUbFZA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQQIfGUbFZA", "title": "Empyre: Lords of the Sea Gates - Announcement Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AQQIfGUbFZA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 15811, "name": "Story Trailer", "video_id": "g_mpLqS5tMM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_mpLqS5tMM", "title": "Empyre: Lords of the Sea Gates - Story Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g_mpLqS5tMM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 16264, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "hioWpYKb75A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hioWpYKb75A", "title": "Empyre: Lords of the Sea Gates - Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hioWpYKb75A/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
