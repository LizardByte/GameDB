Battles occur as random encounters, Rogue Galaxy uses a real-time hack and slash combat system in which the player fights with a party of three characters. The player has direct control over only one character, although they can change which character that is at any time. The two NPCs fight independently of the player character, based on a strategy selected prior to the battle. Available strategies include fighting especially aggressively, targeting a specific enemy or not fighting at all. The strategy can also be changed at any time during the battle. Additionally, the player can issue specific orders to the NPCs during combat, such as having them use an item or activate one of their special abilities.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rogue-galaxy", "videos": [{"id": 4596, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "X9Gm1WS0x00", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Gm1WS0x00", "title": "Rogue Galaxy Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X9Gm1WS0x00/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
