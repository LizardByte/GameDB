Characters have three main parameters; body, mind, and magic, as well as strength, dexterity, IQ, and charisma. Controlling a party of up to six combatants, the player has to accept quests, explore towns, and battle enemies to advance the story.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spirit-of-adventure", "videos": [{"id": 27852, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "NgLeLDb8tP4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgLeLDb8tP4", "title": "Spirit of Adventure, PC DOS (1991) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NgLeLDb8tP4/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 82884, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZR7m0nYYQts", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR7m0nYYQts", "title": "Spirit of Adventure (1991) PC FPA Adventure \"Deutsch/German\"", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZR7m0nYYQts/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
