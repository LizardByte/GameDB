It uses the same save file as single-player. Players share stats. Each only uses 50% of all resources but also only does 50% normal damage to balance.\n- If playing via the Steam version, the game now supports Remote Play Together, allowing players to play together over the internet.\n- Added a button in-game allowing you to jump back to the main menu. This allows the user to switch from single-player to multiplayer in less than 10 seconds.\n- Added support for playing the game via Steam. Save files are saved in the same location regardless and are therefore shared between Steam and standalone versions.\n- Replaced the FSR 1 upscaler with FSR 2.2. This vastly improves visuals at lower resolutions at a slight cost to performance and temporal stability.\n- Added support for Linux ARM64 devices. This should allow any Vulkan-capable 64-bit Linux device to run the game, including laptops, tablets, and single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi.\n- Changed how areas are loaded/unloaded when walking through doors. This should lead to a CPU and RAM optimization and a performance boost on low-end hardware.\n- Fixed a long-standing bug that prevented users from pressing Backspace while typing in their names.\n- Fixed several crashes related to walking away while accessing a chest or bartering.\n- Tons of smaller bug fixes you will never notice, but kept me up at night :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvoKV_l4Ghg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvoKV_l4Ghg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvoKV_l4Ghg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvoKV_l4Ghg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qvoKV_l4Ghg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wizzerd Quest 1.6 Trailer", "description": "Patch 1.6 is coming February 13, 2024 to Wizzerd Quest, the TOTALLY FREE bite-sized open-world RPG, now with multiplayer! \n\nDownload today!\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2785800/Wizzerd_Quest/\nItch: https://kondoorsoft.itch.io/wizzerd-quest\n\nUpdates include:\n- Added split-screen multiplayer co-op.
