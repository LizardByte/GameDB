You'll also be able to use multiple versions of the Bible including KJV (King James Version) and ASV (American Standard Version).\n\nDon't forget to go into settings to update your profile, book version, and control the sound effects and music.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bible-verse-challenge", "videos": [{"id": 127695, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iUqIX1W-Q68"}]}
