It runs on Namco's System 246 hardware and is the ninth installment in the Ridge Racer series. The game is inspired by Ridge Racer V for the Sony PlayStation 2, which was released earlier the same year. In this version, two players can race head-to-head, a reduction from the eight-player support found in Ridge Racer 2 and Rave Racer. Players can choose from six new cars and race on one of five new tracks: \"Park Town,\" \"Outer Pass,\" \"Above the City,\" \"Bayside Line,\" and \"Sunny Beach.\" The \"Sunny Beach\" track is a shorter version of the original Ridge Racer track, featuring updated graphics.\n\nTo activate \"Time Trial\" mode, players must hold down the \"View Change Button\" (introduced in Rave Racer) after inserting a coin and keep it pressed until they have selected their car. Once activated, \"T.T\" will appear on the track selection screen. Ridge Racer V: Arcade Battle marks the final arcade release in the Ridge Racer series.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ridge-racer-v-arcade-battle", "collections": [{"id": 946, "name": "Ridge Racer"}]}
