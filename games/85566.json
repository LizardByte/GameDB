You play as a demon that has been summoned and captured by an evil alchemist. To avoid being tortured and used, you must escape his trap filled dungeon. Demogeon uniquely combines the challenge of level-based platforming into one large adventure style level with just enough hints of metroidvania gameplay to keep you wanting more! For the hardcore gamer, there is unlcokable speedrun and survival modes. In survival mode you get one life to see how far you can make it!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/demongeon"}
