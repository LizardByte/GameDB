It's a driving auto combat game in the vein of burnout and twisted metal. You'll drive through various courses set all over the world in all sorts of different environments and blow stuff up. You'll go from level to level completing various objectives and trying to get not only a great destruction score but first place to the finish line. If you\u2019re unlucky enough to get blown up by someone, you can always \u2018un-wreck\u2019 and turn back the clock to get a second chance and turn the tables. When you\u2019re done wrecking the AI, you can take the road war onto Xbox live where you can race and blowup up to 8 opponents.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/full-auto"}
