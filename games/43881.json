You won't miss a second of the action with a wide variety of camera angles. For those who want an arcade feel, choose the underwater camera and watch that fish fight; the above-water view provides a simulation experience, where the fish is unknown until it is brought in. Don't worry, bringing in the fish is not going to be a problem with the large number of spots to drop a line. Naturally, dropping the line is not going to be enough; you'll have to choose lures wisely and use the proper technique if you want to catch anything. If you're not having any luck, get advice about your technique from legendary angler, Hank Parker. With all of the options and a large number of fishing spots, BLACK BASS WITH BLUE MARLIN has something for every aspiring angler."}
