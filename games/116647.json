Their Quarterback, Jared Goth passes with demonic precision to the best receiving tandem in the league.\n\u2022 Los Scandalous Volts Team \u2013 Led by All-Star veteran Bloody Livers, a smart, gutsy Quarterback who\u2019s not afraid to throw the long ball or bash his skull against any defense. While their offense gets most of the acclaim their defense is stout and can bloody up any offense in the league.\n\u2022 Los Scandalous Shake & Bake Arena \u2013 Both teams share the same arena with different hazards. The stadium managed to survive the big one but is littered with cracks, crevice\u2019s and other nasty obstacles.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mutant-football-league-la-power-pack--1"}
