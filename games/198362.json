Yet you are all the cogs. There is no end and no beginning. Only computation.\n\nThere are only a handful of base components to master. Clone replicates a token. Filter redirects a zero of Nul token to another path. A lock will not allow a token through until it has been unlocked from the side. Switch directs tokens left or right, which can be selected by supplying a token at the other end. And finally a nullifier converts a zero to a Nul and vice-versa. All other units in the game are ones made by you.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}]}
