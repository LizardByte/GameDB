A'aron returned on his own, without the document he went after, but the stranger brought the document shortly after. Hakan, finally asked the stranger's name, and Lara revealed her name. Hakan told Lara that the document revealed a secret hideout of a cult, and Lara offered to join him. Hakan told her to meet him near the abandoned village on the outskirts. When Hakan reached the meeting point he was captured by the Cult. The cult offered Lara a deal, she would retrieve the Godslayer for them, and they would release Hakan. While Lara was getting the Godslayer, A'aron attacked the cult members to release Hakan. During the fight Hakan got injured and they ran. They managed to get over a bridge, when Lara caught up with them. Hakan and Lara then cut the bridge. Hakan's injuries were too great though, and he couldn't continue. He confessed his plan to use the Godslayer bow to challenge Amaru, and kill him. Because he couldn't forgive him for turning Atzi against her family and forcing Hakan to kill her for it. Knowing that he might not make it through his revenge plan, he had arranged Kayara to stay with Chasca. Hakan gave Lara the Godslayer, and made her promise to use it against Amaru if she had a chance.
