It was released simultaneously for multiple consoles and while the plot remains largely the same, there are differing styles of gameplay and graphics across platforms.\n\nThe Amiga version is a side-scrolling action game. It uses digitized graphics for characters that were recycled from the Sega CD game however the setup is quite different. In this version there are nine stages in the game to play through. Each stage has a primary task that involves finding and destroying all the coffins that have Transylvanian earth inside, in order to advance in the game, but the last coffin to be destroyed is guarded by one of Dracula's stronger minions, in each stage.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bram-stokers-dracula"}
