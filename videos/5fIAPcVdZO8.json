The past two years have been one heck of a journey! Millions of ARK players worldwide have built gigantic bases, captured and trained armies of dinosaurs, crafted armories full of weapons and eaten billion of pounds of berries. With your help, we're now about to reach the completion of core content for ARK: Survival Evolved and release the full game to the world!\n \nThat was just the beginning; now we'll be entering the next phase of our journey. Players who have been with us throughout this early access program and were excited with the launch of each update, have even more reason to be excited! ARK is going to become even more fun with surprise new content at launch and beyond, as we continue to have a behemoth amount of additional gameplay, creatures, and story elements in the works. The adventure has only begun!\n\nWildcard would like to extend a big thank you to our trailer team of volunteers for all of their help, and an extra thank you to Fizz for his building guidance and skills throughout this video.
