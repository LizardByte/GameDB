The game is set in NeoSushi City, formerly Tokyo, several years after a catastrophe saw a portion of the moon impact the earth's surface, destroying much of civilisation, including the internet. Corporations rely on individuals who are able to courier data using personal cybernetic implants, and the protagonist, Dogeron \"Dog\" Kenan, does this for a living. At the opening of the game a deal has gone wrong and he has become a wanted man.", "summary": "Cyberpunk interactive fiction video game written by the Cabrera Brothers and released on August 31, 2012. It updates the traditional text adventure format by including music, sound effects and limited graphical elements to the game. The game is available as a download for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OS X, purchasable directly from the creators' website.\nGameplay consists of the player reading descriptions of their character's location and surroundings as presented in text form by the game, then inputting their desired actions into the text parser. Further atmospheric detail is provided throughout the game in the form of background music and sound effects, as well as an animated image of the player character on the righthand side of the screen. When the player collects an important object from the game environment, these too are displayed on the right hand side. These images are updated when the object changes, such as when a dirty keycard is cleaned or a device is activated.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cypher-cyberpunk-text-adventure", "videos": [{"id": 19240, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "VPdTQj4f4r0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPdTQj4f4r0", "title": "Let's Play Cypher: Cyberpunk Text Adventure - 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VPdTQj4f4r0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
