In other words, you have to arrange things on each level where all yellow balls fall into the bin.\nYou control a magic saw that can cut through platforms in order to make a clear path for the balls to move. Each level has a different setup and some levels are relatively easy to play. It gets more challenging as you progress, so there's definitely a level progression. You have an option to skip a level if it is too challenging, but that's up to you."}
