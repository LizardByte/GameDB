Demons joined both forces in this great battle. Finally, Huangdi got the upper hand and became the emperor of China. Shortly before his death, he decided to reincarnate as a mortal many years later, so he came to the border of paradise, and spoke with the dragon demon Yinglong, who was supporting his rival before, as well as other demons. Yinglong descended upon the Earth, and his body parts turned into powerful weapons and artifacts - his claw became a sword, his eye a pearl, and his heart took the shape of a seal. The legends say that if someone can get one of the three artifacts, he can once again wield the power in the whole China.\n\nFast-forward to 196 AD. It is the time of Eastern Han dynasty, the end of one of the several golden epochs of the Chinese civilization. Two gods, Yunkong and Daotian, are playing chess with each other to decide the fate of China. In the village Zhaode live two young noblemen, Chu Ge and his best friend Han Jing, as well as his beloved one Shen Yan. They live a normal life and wish to move to the capital and to find good jobs there. But an accident makes them meet their true destiny...\n\nThe second Huanxiang Sanguozhi game takes us to the time period that preceeded the Three Kingdoms era by about a hundred years. Once again, the game deals with concrete historical events and characters, but adds many fictional elements to them, mostly of supernatural character. The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game. You control a party of heroes and fight enemies in turn-based or active-time combat (you can choose the type of combat since the beginning). The game features pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D cut scenes. It also allows you to choose between three difficulty levels.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/huanxiang-sanguozhi-ii"}
