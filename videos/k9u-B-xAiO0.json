Build large and accurate telescopes to explore distant stars. Discover a habitable planet or an unknown anomaly in a far corner of the galaxy. Equipment and research funding are important aspects of your work. Get scientific grants and publish your results, explore new technologies and telescope components.\n\nThe game will take you through 30 years of your career (720 rounds). If you do not go bankrupt in process, then the final score is calculated in year 2037. The game will allow you to proceed further.\n\nWrite your name in history alongside the greatest scholars of all time.
