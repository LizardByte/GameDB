At the end of Marathon 2 proper, as the Pfhor's Trih Xeem or \"early nova\" device is fired upon the S'pht System's sun to explode it, Durandal recounts an ancient S'pht legend in which a chaotic entity known as the W\u2019rkncacnter \u2014 an eldritch abomination \u2014 was sealed inside of that sun by the Jjaro \u2014 a highly advanced race from centuries past, their technology being the only remnants of their existence \u2014 eons ago. The story involves the player \"jumping\" between alternative realities via surreal dream sequences, seeking to prevent the W\u2019rkncacnter from being released from Lh'owon's dying sun. These jumps are apparently caused either by technology left behind by the Jjaro or by the W\u2019rkncacnter's chaotic nature. The player begins as Durandal's ally, only to be transported almost immediately to a reality where Durandal did not rescue the player at the end of the first game, Marathon; as such, he is controlled by the Pfhor-tortured AI Tycho instead.", "summary": "Marathon Infinity takes the closed universe of the Marathon series and blows it wide open.

More than that, the scenario sheds a surprising new light on the story\u2019s characters and the meaning of events.
