The androids are stronger, more dangerous, and have their own dark motives. The remaining spirits of the once-loved characters are trapped, and it\u2019s up to you to free them before they\u2019re lost forever. But as you close in on the androids, you begin to encounter a ghost who seems to know more about you than you do yourself.\n\nAs mysteries unfold, you\u2019ll have to question your own identity, your past, and the true nature of the show you once ran. Can you save your friends? Can you uncover the truth behind the androids? And, most importantly, can you trust yourself when your very existence is called into question?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mints-hints-3"}
