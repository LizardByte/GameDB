You can jump and thus avoid these holes, although you have a limited number of them for each level, and it's possible to adjust the speed through joystick or keyboard control. You also face a time limit on each of the levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/trailblazer", "collections": [{"id": 2725, "name": "Trailblazer"}]}
