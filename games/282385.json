The game is divided into a \"training volume\" and a \"competition volume\". In \"Training Volume\", you can choose your favorite character from Rantaro, Kirimaru, and Shinpei to play the game. Each shinobi has its own characteristics, so let's identify and challenge each individuality! In \"Battle Volume\", you can play CPU battles and 2P battles using communication cables. The number of characters that can be used increases with the \"Training Volume\". There are five types of games: \"jumping\", \"gunning\", \"shuriken\", \"foot rowing\", and \"swimming\".", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nintama-rantarou-ninjutsu-gakuen-ni-nyuugaku-shiyou-no-dan"}
