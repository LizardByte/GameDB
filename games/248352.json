After helping them defeat vampyres while investigating the orphanage where Dahlia last stayed, Storm joins the Midnight Suns and aids them in their quest while continuing her search. Eventually, they locate Dahlia in New York's sewers, where she lives alongside the Morlocks, mutants with monstrous appearances who were rejected by society and refused to join the X-Men. Though initially resentful of the X-Men, Dahlia later opens up to Storm and accepts her offer to help. Sometime later, Dahlia is kidnapped by Dracula, who wants to use her healing power to create a perfect vampyre race. Storm, the Hunter, and Blade confront and defeat Dracula and Sin, freeing Dahlia in the process. Afterwards, Dahlia accepts Storm's invitation to take refuge at Charles Xavier's school.", "summary": "Marvel's Midnight Suns: Blood Storm is the fourth and final DLC expansion for Marvel's Midnight Suns.
