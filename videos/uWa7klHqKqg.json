Taking place within the fan-favorite world of Majesty, players of Impire will be tasked with ruining the lands of Ardania for those fans by reviving the greatest threat the realm has ever known within a dungeon lair of their own design. Run your Impire by defending against heroes invading a personalized demonic compound while also sending underlings to the surface to wreak chaos among those who call the land near your Impire home. Utilizing a vast array of minions, deadly traps, and a growing arsenal of wicked spells, players will guide the demon B\u00e1al-Abaddon to his rightful place atop the skulls of his mortal foes... just as soon as they can help him escape the body of a pathetic little imp. \n\nDeveloped by Cyanide in Montreal, Impire tells the sordid tale of B\u00e1al-Abaddon, a once-mighty horror from the Bottomless Pit, who finds himself summoned by the incompetent sorcerer, Oscar van Fairweather, and trapped in the form of a laughable imp. Using their cunning and an array of devious tricks, players will help the demon lord break free, rebuild his proper hell-spawn body, and construct an impressive dungeon to form the seat of his new kingdom. Players will have to design, develop, and defend their demonic dungeon from would-be do-gooders in order to expand and triumph. \n\nThe game includes features like:\n\n- User-designed dungeons filled with different room types and an assortment of deathtraps\n- Minions of every shape and size to be leveled up and equipped with upgraded equipment\n- A custom deck of magical item cards to be unlocked and built to suit any playing style\n- The opportunity to squash pesky heroes beneath one's hooves, and grind their souls into helpful dungeon-building resources\n- A perilous campaign to be played in solo or co-op mode\n- Many multi-player modes to confront and crush one's so-called \"friends\"\n\nImpire is slated for release on PC in Q1, 2013, so here's hoping you've lived a full and satisfying life.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWa7klHqKqg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWa7klHqKqg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWa7klHqKqg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWa7klHqKqg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uWa7klHqKqg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Impire Announcement Trailer", "description": "Twitter: https://twitter.com/impiregame\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/impiregame\nWebsite: http://www.paradoxplaza.com \n\nParadox Interactive today announced their intentions to unleash the full might of their new Impire, a game of strategy that challenges players to properly assess and allocate the evil within their black hearts.
