A part of the plan involves scoring with some of the university chicks. \n \nThe gameplay is like a classic adventure game. You have some actions at your disposal (walk, take, give, talk, etc.) and must solve puzzles to make the plot advance. There is also a point-based ranking system similar to the one in the first Leisure Suit Larry games. You can complete the girl quests in whatever order you want, and in that sense the game isn't linear. \n \nDescribed as a romantic comedy, this game has some soft sexual content.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chick-chaser", "videos": [{"id": 24412, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "VGqqdvVRwo8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGqqdvVRwo8", "title": "[Under the Radar Part 131]: Chick chaser [Aussie]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VGqqdvVRwo8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
