Your favorite airports will see a major upgrade too, as the surrounding vegetation takes on a new lifelike appearance. Airliner pilots also benefit, as approaches, departures and taxiing will be greatly enhanced by more realistic vegetation.\n\nWhether you are new to flight simulation and upgrading FSX: Steam Edition for the first time or are a seasoned veteran, FTX Trees HD is designed for maximum compatibility and will upgrade all of your auto-generated trees worldwide.", "summary": "FTX Trees HD is a complete overhaul of Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition's auto-generated tree textures, lending new immersion to your flight simulation experience! These tree textures are double the resolution of default trees, resulting in greater detail, and are derived from high-resolution photographs of real trees for maximum realism. They have been hand-edited and color-matched to give a top-quality flight sim experience. New, optimized tree models reduce the burden on your system when flying over most dense-tree areas, with a negligible change in VAS compared to the default.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-steam-edition-ftx-trees-hd"}
