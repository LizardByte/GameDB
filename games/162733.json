You are only limited by control points which should be scored in specific order. You can drive on walls and ceilings thanks to special gravity panels and appropriate engine upgrades.\n\nEach track location has interact-able objects that can be activated by a special transmitter. It can be a shortcut on an extendable bridge or activation of a toy robot, which will shoot a volley of projectiles on your opponents, or a fan that will make driving harder.", "summary": "Mini Madness is an arcade racing game inspired by such titles as Re-Volt or Micro Machines.
