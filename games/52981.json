Now Raph must hunt for the spare parts needed to fix their skyship - and save his girlfriend too. Fortunately, our hero has access to the amazing GEMMA - the 'Gyroscopic Exploration Multidimensional Multiterrain Apparatus'. It's a small explorer vehicle that works like a spinning top - which is perfect for the crazy part of the world our characters are trapped in. Controlling GEMMA needs some practice. It's spin needs to be controlled carefully, as the degree of spin - and therefore its overall speed - directly affects its movement and behaviour. GEMMA can also be upgraded with special abilities to help you on your journey, too. Sounds like a solid platform/puzzler, don't you think?"}
