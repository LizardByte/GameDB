You'll also find Bionicle cannisters to help aid your quest to defeat Vezon - the 7th Piraka who had stolen the Mask of Life.\n\nGameplay centers around firefights against the alien \"robots\" called Vahki, Visorak and Borhok. Players will collect Lego pieces for every enemy you defeat, and eventually enable an invulnerable Hero Mode to help defeat the Toa's enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bionicle-heroes--2"}
