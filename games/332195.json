In this version, Juandissimo Magnifico tricks Timmy into wishing the book destroyed so that Cosmo and Wanda will get in trouble for it. It also notably features an appearance by Vicky and Tootie's mother (at Timmy's age, as the level featuring her is set in the past), named Nicky. She is shown behaving a lot like Tootie, and Timmy initially mistakes her for Tootie when he first sees her, although the in-game graphics depict her as resembling a young Vicky.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-fairly-oddparents-breakin-da-rules--2", "videos": [{"id": 140749, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "q927jaOfm-4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q927jaOfm-4", "title": "The Fairly Oddparents Breakin Da Rules PC Full Walkthrough No Commentary", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q927jaOfm-4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
