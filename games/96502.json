Often with very little information. Always with zero clue as to what Harm or Other could possibly mean in the current context. In exchange for your extraordinary talents you earn nearly half of a living wage. \n \nSince the result of every choice is unique and each chapter contains at least one major branching path, you will be able to play the game four times before encountering every unfair and ridiculous outcome.\"", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
