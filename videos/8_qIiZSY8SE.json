The game stands out by having an exciting action, skill-based combat in which players will be able to customize their combat strategy by changing their magic powers and weapons. The skill build will be inspired on Trading Card Games which means that no matter how many skills a player has, he or she will only be able to equip a limited number of them at a time. \n\nProfane will feature open PvP and full loot everywhere.
