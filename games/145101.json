That is, as the one in charge of \u201cCrossdress infiltration\u201d. Since the previous events, he has successfully completed several more assignments, and currently considers stepping down from the position. Unfortunately for him, however, he has been tasked with just 1 more assignment. This time, his task involves another all-girls school similar to St. Theresia Academy. He has to run in the elections for student council president and success in obtaining the position.\n\nShuuji himself considers the operation to be impossible. To infiltrate the school alone, and run in the elections that take place within just 2 months from now? There\u2019s no way that he can do it. Especially since apparently there are many dangers involved with the run for student council president. And who knows what other traps lurk within the shadows of the Academy? Will he manage to find his way through?", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/koi-suru-otome-to-shugo-no-tate-bara-no-seibo"}
