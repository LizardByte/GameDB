Like its predecessors, The Wind Waker is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Basic gameplay mechanics are similar to those found in Ocarina of Time, but it differentiates itself with its massive Great Sea which must be explored using a boat named King of Red Lions.\n\nThe limited edition of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker includes the game itself and a second disk containing:\n- Ocarina of Time\n- Ocarina of Time Master Quest", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-limited-edition", "videos": [{"id": 84673, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RxMos9muPYQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxMos9muPYQ", "title": "Zelda The Wind Waker E3 2002 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RxMos9muPYQ/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
