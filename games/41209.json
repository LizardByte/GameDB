It takes place on a space station. The computer malfunctioned and now four robots are out to hunt down the player. Gameplay mainly has the player trying to trick the pursuing robots into one of the four electrified force fields littered throughout the playfield. Every time the player is touched by a robot, one of the force fields disappear. Once all the force fields disappear, the player loses a point to the robots. If all the robots are defeated, the player gets a point for that round. The game also features an option for two players, where the second player takes control of the robots. The game features four game speeds from slowest to fastest\n\nThe other game is Torpedo Alley. Players control a shore battery at the bottom of the screen and shoot at an invading fleet of ships above them. Each hit ship is worth a different amount of points, with the lowest ship being worth 1 point, the middle ship worth 3 points, and the highest ship worth 5 points. The game ends when a player reaches 99 points or the adjustable time limit expires.\n\nThis preprogrammed cartridge plugs into the console of the Fairchild Video Entertainment System for more TV fun. The hunter or the hunted. Take your choice in these action-packed one and two-player games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/videocart-13-robot-war-torpedo-alley", "videos": [{"id": 16081, "name": "VR", "video_id": "iTvB6HxmMKI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTvB6HxmMKI", "title": "The Channel F Files VideoCart 13 Robot War! and Torpedo Alley!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iTvB6HxmMKI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
