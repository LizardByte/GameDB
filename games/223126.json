It has an easy to understand swipe swing system that puts you in control with each of your swings. As of right now play as one of five characters and customize them with outfits through the game's Gatcha system. Earn more clubs and level them up to up your stats to your liking just by playing. No worries about pay to win, even with good stats, your swing really affects the accuracy of your shot, so a lot of this is skill based. You can play casually or competitively in battle mode, make friends, create rooms and play up to 9 holes in public or private matches, voice chat, rank up and enter in weekly tournaments or special events.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neko-golf-anime-golf"}
