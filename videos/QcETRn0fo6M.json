An aquarium horror game where you become an aquarium creature and solve the secret.\n\nSuzu and her best friend Lulu go to an aquarium. But suddenly, Lulu disappears. Suzu follows her and wanders into the Horror Aquarium. Meeting other people along the way, she only has one hint to help her escape.\n\nBecome an aquarium creature. \n\nSolve the secret\nwho's the traitor.\"\n\nI made a little machine-translated patch of a Japanese-only RPG Horror game The Aquarium does not Dance. Due to its machine-translated nature, expect jank and unclear or odd dialogue. Sorry, I tried to make it more bearable and understandable but I'm not a native speaker... I'm also dumb... Sorry...\n\nBy the way, DON'T BOTHER ACTUAL TRANSLATORS TO TRANSLATE THIS GAME PROPERLY. IF THEY THEMSELVES WANT TO TRANSLATE IT, THEY WILL. DON'T BOTHER THEM ABOUT IT. \n\nDON'T BOTHER THE CREATOR ABOUT THIS EITHER.\n\nI won't release the patch as it's machine-translated and I'm not overly confident in it (and I didn't ask for permission to translate, I'm too shy... Sorry), but I still wanted to share this cool little game with people as I don't think many English speakers know of it. (And making a gameplay video over Japanese footage with English subtitles felt very tedious so I made a patch since I have the tools for it.) ((I won't release the patch even if you were to ask me 1 000 000 times. So don't even try.)\n\nNotes:\n I'm not sure how to translate Suzu's name properly. It's written as \u30b9\u30fc\u30ba (Suuzu) and the other options I had sounded bad so I just went with Suzu. If this isn't correct, my bad. (Every name is still honestly for me unclear. I just took the most likely names, but if I'm wrong, then I'll admit it.)\n\nEDIT Sept. 8th, 2023 - I now know what the names are and I got two names wrong. The official twitter released an image that showed the characters' names in English. Suzu is now Suze (DeepL did give me this but I wasn't sure if it was accurate) and Kris is Chris (Which is also what DeepL gave me but since I associate Chris as a masculine name I hope you see where I came from.) \n\nIf I do record the second part whenever that comes out, the names will be these fixed ones. (The other names I didn't mention are accurate.)\n\nEDIT OVER\n\nI might occasionally pause during dialogue as I notice an oversight/error and fix it during the video. Sorry.\n\nA few puzzles have a little (Answer: ) provided in-game. I added this for myself so I wouldn't forget. I have no idea how to first puzzle with this works (The original had the sea creatures Japanese and English names in the books) so I just put the answer in so I wouldn't have to look it up on replay.\n\nThe second one is one you can figure out easier but I couldn't bother. The third one is easy enough for me to get so it didn't require that for me. Hard to translate so I just kept it the same.\n\nThe messed up text I have no idea what to do with. You can see me change it up after a point since I think I understood the intent at that point. Jisho helped and I did try to get the required info from those but those were a blank for me through and through. My earlier attempts look quite stupid at the messed up text when you think about it.\n\nIf some lines seem especially weird, it means I didn't know what it tried to mean either, so I just took the machine's word for it. Which lead to some obvious jank.\n\nI cannot translate any images here, so some things do look off. Sorry.\n\nThe beginning I feel has some of the most jank translation, as I didn't check it during my initial playthrough. Most of it's still very jank but especially at the start I feel.\n\nWhat do I think of the game? It's pretty cool. Very pretty art and creepy when it needs to be. Reminds me of Ib in a way actually.\nI like the characters here and the atmosphere is nice. \n\nSome sections were annoying (you can probably guess which one since I died a lot there) but otherwise, the gameplay was fine for an RPG Horror. Apparently, this one has some amount of popularity in Japan and I can see why. \n\nGood game. \n\n(I don't actually know if this hasn't been translated before my bad machine-translated attempt, but when I looked there was nothing so whatever.)\n\n(Also apparently when I made this the second part of this is very close to completion? Dunno if I'll translate that since I really want an actual translator to translate this, but who knows. Maybe for my own enjoyment.)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcETRn0fo6M/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcETRn0fo6M/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcETRn0fo6M/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcETRn0fo6M/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QcETRn0fo6M/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Aquarium does not Dance | Japanese RPG Horror | No Commentary", "description": "There's some content that might disturb some players.
