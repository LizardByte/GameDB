The story is similar to the original Ape Escape in that it has you playing as Spike as he tries to stop Specter and his army of apes, but it does take place after the first game. In each level, you\u2019re tasked with capturing most of the apes with your net before you can advance. You also have other gadgets, such as the stun club, radar, and slingshot that can be used to track the apes and stun them for easier capture. As you explore each level, you can find healing items, items that grant additional lives, and enemies that can only be defeated and not captured. Some levels also have doors that lead back to hidden areas in previous levels if you can find the key to unlock them. There are 121 apes in total to catch across five different worlds and in-game achievements can also be unlocked based on the player\u2019s accomplishments.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ape-escape-m", "videos": [{"id": 120439, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7vLC_TftLJA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vLC_TftLJA", "title": "Ape Escape M - Mobile Java Videogame", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7vLC_TftLJA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
