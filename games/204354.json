Level up and specialize your soldiers with unique abilities and an arsenal of weapons, armor, and perks, for high stakes missions in treacherous territory. Develop your base to research new tech and improve your squad even further.\n\nManage your resources wisely and take calculated risks to outsmart the deadliest creature mankind has ever faced.
