One are the Dark Elves which are ruled by the Witch King. They come from far beyond the Great Ocean and left their home Naggaroth to pillage and raid among the other races. But the real goal of the Druchii is to return to the island of Ulthuan - birthplace of all the elves and current home of the High Elves. The second new race are the Orcs & Goblins who created a loose alliance under their stupid and violent leaders to aimlessly raid the other races. In their war-campaign, called the \"Waagh!-Offensive\", they have now entered the heart of the land and the old races need to defend themselves against these relentless hordes that only know one thing: War!", "summary": "During the single player campaign the player takes over the control of the Empire, the Orcs & Goblins and the Legions of Chaos. But in multiplayer all of the now six races (Legions of Chaos, The Empire, High Elves, Dark Elves, Skaven and Orcs & Goblins) are available to fight in the new multiplayer mode called \"World Domination. There the old world is divided into several dozen territories and the goal is of course to gain control over every one of them. But this is no game mode that only a few players play. Instead the map is hosted by the developers and every player can join in the fight. Once a player chose a race, he can then attack one of the enemy territories which then activates a normal skirmish battle with different victory conditions. Once a race has won a hundred battles in that territory, it gains control over it. Depending on the territory, the race then gains a bonus like a higher gold production ratio or a 10% increase in fighting moral.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 13855, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "IVl9-ZWfIMM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVl9-ZWfIMM", "title": "Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IVl9-ZWfIMM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
