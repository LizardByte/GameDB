Crucial resources dwindle as piracy and crime escalate dramatically.\n\nAmid this chaos, the Alliance Commander has the chance to tip the scales in favor of either faction, committing their elite forces to decide the fate of the galaxy. As the Sith Empire prepares to make a decisive strike against a newly-constructed Republic shipyard on the planet Corellia, members of the Dark Council see victory on the horizon and begin plotting against one another in anticipation of the spoils. Meanwhile, Republic forces must race against time to muster reinforcements from across the galaxy in order to defend Corellia from the Sith.\n\nPinnacles of Power\nStrengthen your ties with the Galactic Republic or Sith Empire and establish a new personal headquarters in the luxurious Alderaan Noble Estate!\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sith Empire\u2019s assault on the Meridian Complex Shipyard, both factions form elite organizations to carry out key objectives that could tip the balance of the war. As fighting intensifies across the galaxy, representatives from the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire arrive on Odessen to discuss plans of attack.\n\nAway from the war\u2019s chaotic front lines, players can form a lavish base of operations within the Core Worlds by purchasing a new Stronghold: the Alderaan Noble Estate.

The Servants, fanatical agents of the former Sith Emperor, are somehow responsible \u2013 but their sinister plan is still a mystery.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mandalorian flagship Spirit of Vengeance II has been attacked by mysterious raiders. Shae Vizla plans an immediate counter-strike to drive these attackers away, but she\u2019ll need powerful help to ensure the mission succeeds.\n\nThe Dark Descent\nWith the aid of some of your faction\u2019s greatest fighters, visit the lost ruins of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine in pursuit of one of the galaxy\u2019s most formidable foes \u2013 Darth Malgus!\n\nTo the concern of Empire and Republic forces, Darth Malgus has been spotted in the ruins of a Jedi Enclave hidden away on the remote planet of Dantooine. The Empire\u2019s leadership is dispatching two of its best agents to quickly give chase: Darth Rivix, liaison to the Hand of the Empire, and Darth Krovos, head of the Empire\u2019s military might. Meanwhile, General Daeruun has enlisted the aid of Arn Peralun and ex-Jedi Aryn Leneer to put a stop to Malgus, once and for all. Who will be able to solve this mystery first?\n\nAway from the ruins of Dantooine, \u201cThe Stranger from Kubindi\u201d is making its galactic debut!
