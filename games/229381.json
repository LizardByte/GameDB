The primary goal of the game is to explore Midoritsuki's dream world and collect effects.\n\nOne interesting element of this game is that the majority of the dream world is initially in grayscale. There are several colored orbs hidden in the dream world for the player to find that will change the appearance of certain areas once obtained, also granting the player access to new areas/effects.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/colours"}
