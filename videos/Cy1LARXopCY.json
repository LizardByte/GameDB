Interact with regulators, valves, brakes, couplers, and many more features in first-person view as you drive your vehicles. But you won't simply be driving around aimlessly! Your task is to transport goods like timber, ore, coal, oil, and various other freight for a broad variety of industries.

All collisions and forces are rendered dynamically in real time, making the train driving experience much more immersive. So, be careful about derailing your train! And to top it all off, you can play Railroads Online with up to 16 players on a server and enjoy the ultimate train simulation in multiplayer sessions with your friends. Lay tracks together and cooperate to move trains seamlessly or share the work while you play independently.
