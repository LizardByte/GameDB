The game begins atop a snowy mountain where the protagonist awakens in an unfamiliar wilderness, surrounded by deadly creatures, with nothing but a hospital gown and a splitting headache. However, he\u2019s eventually rescued by a beautiful girl named Kuon, who sports both adorable animal ears and a beastlike tail. Finding that the hapless man has no memory of anything, Kuon decides to take the amnesiac into her care, naming him Haku. As their journey takes them across the land, Haku will (reluctantly) encounter colorful characters (yes, that means more animal people), build deep relationships, battle ruthless enemies, and find himself inexorably dragged into the political machinations of the mighty nation of Yamato. \n\nUtawarerumono: Mask of Deception features: \n\n\u2022 An Unforgettable Story \u2013 Mask of Deception offers a story-rich visual novel experience (40-50+ hours long) that lets players shape the future of a fully realized world filled with fantastical lore and history! Mask of Deception sets up the story for a thrilling conclusion in Mask of Truth, and we\u2019ll reveal more information about the final game at a later date. \n\u2022 An Active SRPG Battle System \u2013 Players will need to defend Haku and his friends by engaging in intense SRPG combat with the various hostiles that populate the world. The battle system is a thrilling mix of turn-based tactics and Attack Chain mechanics. Players can remain active during combat by successfully completing timing-based charging rings to execute critical attacks or vital dodges/blocks. \n\u2022 Fully Fleshed Out Combat \u2013 Unique combat features such as the rewind function, elemental affinities/weaknesses, unique character skills, and more add a layer of depth to fights. It\u2019ll take true tactical acumen to emerge victorious in battle! \n\u2022 Breathtaking Art \u2013 With a stunning art style and beautifully rendered cutscenes, the game is a feast for the eyes for Japanese visual novel and anime aficionados!  \n\u2022 Beautiful Songs and a Thrilling Score \u2013 The rousing music, recorded and remastered at the legendary Abbey Road Studios and EastWest Studios, is a perfect soundtrack to accompany a great adventure.  \n\nWebsite: http://atlus.com/uta", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BL7zNEGyqCY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BL7zNEGyqCY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BL7zNEGyqCY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BL7zNEGyqCY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BL7zNEGyqCY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Trouble Is Brewing in Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception", "description": "Originally known as Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen in Japan, Mask of Deception is a grand tale meant to enchant the hearts and minds of players in search of incredible journey.
