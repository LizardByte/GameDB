This was made possible by using the Game Boy Advance as a game controller via the link cable. As its name suggests, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble 2 was planned to feature the tilt controls that appeared in its predecessor. Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble 2 was originally scheduled for a May 2002 release for Japan, but the Kirby theme was eventually scrapped. Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble 2 was reintroduced as a game starring an ordinary marble, titled Roll-O-Rama; this version was shown at E3 2002 but was ultimately cancelled itself.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kirby-tilt-n-tumble-2", "videos": [{"id": 62514, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5QFUZemGILY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QFUZemGILY", "title": "Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble 2 Spaceworld 2001 Presentation Partial Restoration", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5QFUZemGILY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
