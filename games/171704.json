Resurrected \"Pneumatic Diversity Vent\" element, New laser cube variant, and Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun.\n\nPortal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops, but fear not. All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through vigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.\n\nDepending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.\n\nPortal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.\n\nThis allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/portal-revolution", "videos": [{"id": 101919, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cXczxIIvXJ0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXczxIIvXJ0", "title": "Portal: Revolution - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cXczxIIvXJ0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
