Hop on your bike to race through 4 incredibly detailed cities, which were personally surveyed by the development team. Just like the Dead Heat street racing game, zoom through the streets of New York, Chicago, London and San Francisco but now on different courses through each city. Select from 5 different superbikes as you ride on a recreated motorcycle swivel seat. Another great feature is found with Namco\u2019s patented software technology that analyses and stores registered players driving styles, later mimicking registered players as \u201cghost drivers\u201d. This allows current players to race against previous drives, even when they are not around. This title also features a completely revamped soundtrack, designed to match the white knuckle intensity of each race. Enjoy more social racing with the Integrated Camera! This takes a picture of the players and uses that photo to identify your car and other players you are racing against in real-time during the race.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-heat-riders", "videos": [{"id": 107899, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Eotue9n0d5E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eotue9n0d5E", "title": "Dead Heat Riders Arcade", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Eotue9n0d5E/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
