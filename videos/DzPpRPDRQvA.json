{"id": "DzPpRPDRQvA", "snippet": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay - Sonic Spinball", "description": "http://www.longplays.net\r\n\r\nPlayed by: Darius320\r\n\r\nThis game had to be based on pinball games. This game is some sort of fun that you just play it for fun and you can also select up to 4-players.\r\n\r\nToxic Caves level:\r\nThis boss seems to be quite easy to defeat and you just simply jump right inside the scorpius and that can lose its tail.\r\n\r\nBonus Stage 1:\r\nI almost had that Jackpot Bonus even I was damn close to win that first bonus stage.\r\n\r\nLava Powerhouse level:\r\nI had little hard time trying to beat this boss about Robothead, then I slip all the way down to where you hang on the chain which is unstable and you have to press left or right\r\nto get off without touching the lava, but I touch the lava and I was like there's no way of getting out of it. I had to use couple of extra ball to have few chances.\r\n\r\nBonus Stage 2: I did fine by busting Eggman's Teeth because it was too ugly. :D\r\n\r\nThe Machine level:\r\nI tried reaching for the first emerald and then loop right on to the grinding machine. OMG XD Then' it was fine for the second time and that emerald should be quite easy to get to.\r\nIn this level you collect 5, not 3.\r\n\r\nBonus Stage 3: This stage was quite easy to beat.\r\n\r\nShowdown level:\r\nThis is level that I could not possibly pass or beat. When you try to get to emeralds soon one of thing block you from getting it to it. I found the switch to destroy the blocks to the\r\nemeralds and you should collect at least five. Inside Robotnik's Ship, all you have to do is to hit the trigger about four time in order to get him. You hit it about ten times and then he's\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this longplay. :) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DzPpRPDRQvA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DzPpRPDRQvA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DzPpRPDRQvA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay - Sonic Spinball", "description": "http://www.longplays.net\r\n\r\nPlayed by: Darius320\r\n\r\nThis game had to be based on pinball games.
