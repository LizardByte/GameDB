So Satan decides to use his magic to make the sun much larger and create a tropical paradise. Arle and Carbuncle find the sun too hot and see the castle from which Satan's heatwave is emanating. Schezo also travels to Satan's castle to take back the night. Draco however, loves the hot weather and sets out to the hill to sunbathe in a bikini.", "summary": "Satan has enlarged the sun in a devious attempt to get a perfect tan. Arle Nadja embarks on a quest to defeat him in this competitive puzzle game.\n\nThis is the 3rd installment of the Puyo Puyo games series, and the sequel to Puyo Puyo Tsu. After the highly acclaimed success of its predecessor, Compile took a slightly more retro approach, so players had a more original feel to the game over that of Tsu.\n\nThe name of Puyo Puyo SUN comes from a Japanese pun on san, and also indicates a new Puyo brought into the game. As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (san (\u4e09)) is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes.\nThis game was released only in Japan.\n\nFollowing the arcade release, Puyo Puyo Sun was ported to the then-current home consoles. The Saturn version was released merely three months after the arcade release, while the other ports were released in late 1997 and throughout 1998. The Saturn, PlayStation, and Windows 95 versions feature fully voiced cutscenes unlike the original ST-V version.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-sun", "videos": [{"id": 35645, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "gx2EzELBvTg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx2EzELBvTg", "title": "Puyo Puyo Sun Promotion Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gx2EzELBvTg/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 35575, "name": "Game Intro (all versions)", "video_id": "VNJ-InRTg2k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNJ-InRTg2k", "title": "Puyo Puyo Sun All Openings HD (Arcade/PC/N64, PS1/Saturn, and GBC)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VNJ-InRTg2k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
