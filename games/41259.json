The people were at peace and everything was well. However, one day the incarnation of destruction, King Egger, came from the underground realm of Eggerland seeking to destroy the peaceful realm and claim it for himself. King Eden dispatched Lala to the God Inphony to seek his help, and Inphony gave her Inphonit Power and five keys to open the gate of evil. Four gods obeyed Inphonit and joined her, but Egger caught her while she tried to stop him and concealed her in his underground labyrinth of Eggerland. Fortunately, she succeeded in concealing the Inphonit Power, and Five Keys and Four Gods in the land of Eggerland. Lolo, prince of Gentle Land, heard the news that Lala had been captured and immediately ran to Eggerland to rescue her.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eggerland", "videos": [{"id": 70654, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jSqV_uN61Uk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSqV_uN61Uk", "title": "\u30a8\u30c3\u30ac\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jSqV_uN61Uk/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 616, "name": "Eggerland"}]}
