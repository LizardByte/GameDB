It was released in Japanese arcades only on the Sega Hikaru arcade system board in 2001. Following its initial release, there was initially no home console port of the game due to the Hikaru's superior graphical capabilities.\n\nA region free home port of the game was released for Xbox 360 on December 22, 2010. The Xbox 360 version retains the same gameplay as the original series, only with a few inclusions: 2 on 2 Leader Battles, co-op boss fight mode, a Mission mode and Xbox Live support for online play. Battles have local 2 player splitscreen or up to 4 player over System Link. The game also has a special Collector's edition which includes a booklet called Virtual On Chronicle 15, that looks back at 15 years of Virtual-On, and a six disc soundtrack called Virtual On Official Sound Data. All of the items come packaged in a box with artwork from Hajime Katoki. Jaguarandi is now available as a hidden character, along with Apharmd the Hatter based on Apharmd J. However, Ajim, which was a playable character in Oratorio Tangram, is not playable in this Force version. The split-screen gameplay, which was absent from Xbox Live Arcade version of Oratorio Tangram, makes a return in this version. Preordering of the games allows access and download a special \"Thorax\" item that adjusts the bust sizes of both female Virtualoids: Fei-Yen and Angelan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyber-troopers-virtual-on-force", "videos": [{"id": 138722, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "1D07W9F8BS0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D07W9F8BS0", "title": "Cyber Troopers Virtual-ON FORCE (2010) Fei Yen & Kagekiyo Playthrough (60 FPS) XBOX 360 / iPlaySEGA", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1D07W9F8BS0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
