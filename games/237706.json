Your objective: to get more loot than the rival team. To do this, you have to fight against the other players as well as other smaller enemies.\n\nOne Piece Bounty Rush lets you control a bunch of different characters that belong to five classes: warriors, support, shooters, swordsmen and tanks. Luffy, for example, is one of the main warriors that you can play with; while Zoro is an excellent swordsman. Learning how to combine characters will be vital to your victory.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-piece-bounty-rush--2"}
