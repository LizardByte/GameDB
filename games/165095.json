This plant produces \u201cViletrap\u201d seeds, which can attract Smurfs and imprison them in vegetal traps! But these Viletrap plants are also a great danger for the forest, as they are highly toxic, especially for the sarsaparilla fields!\n\nIn order to fix this dreadful situation, Papa Smurf decided to ask some of his fellow Smurfs to help him find the ingredients for an antidote powerful enough to eradicate the Vileaf once and for all and heal the plants afflicted by this curse. An ace Smurf team, featuring Hefty, Smurfette, Brainy and Chef, goes on an adventure to complete this mission. All of these 4 characters are playable over the course of the game.\n\nIn order to help them in their quest, our heroes can rely upon a very handy tool, the Smurfizer, a revolutionary invention from Handy Smurf. The Smurfizer allows the Smurfs to get rid of the foes they encounter, as well as heal the plants afflicted by the Vileaf. This special gear will facilitate our heroes\u2019 exploration journey across the game\u2019s different environments, whether it be in the forest, the swamps or even in the most dangerous place of all: Gargamel\u2019s laboratory!", "summary": "The Smurftastic Edition contains:\n- The main game\n- 3 lithographs (10x15cm)\n- A Papa Smurf keychain (5cm)\n- Sticker sheets (11x8,5cm)", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "videos": [{"id": 54159, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tW22HiWnxA8"}]}
