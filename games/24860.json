The heavy iron door behind you is sealed and there is only one means of escape. You must retrieve your mind's eye, located within the tunnel of death, and return with it to the iron door. Then, and only then, may you return to reality.\n\nYou'll hear piercing screams from within the castle walls and the sound of footsteps - not always your own. The Nightmare takes you from the depths of the dungeon, up flights of stonecold steps, into three other vast castle floors, all riddled with mysterious chambers, fearsome creatures and amazing treasures. A psychopathic killer is on the loose, and a mangy rat pack, in search of food, is eager to end your quest. Beware, too, of other gruesome creatures, standing guard to your mind's eye. A grotesque gargoyle and a headless man, beheaded and confined in the castle by former occupants, are but two of them.\n\nHowever, wonderful magic, once in your possession, will see you beyond these frightening obstacles. A glistening silver cross, a book that warns of things to come, a quarter-staff that destroys stone and a magical ring that penetrates otherwise impassable barriers, are just a few you may find. Take everything you find - you never know when it may aid you in the search for your mind's eye. Remember, reality awaits your return!", "summary": "You have eight hours to escape the haunted castle that your subconscious created in your mind and keeps you prisoner.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-nightmare", "videos": [{"id": 105782, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eWrFT-7IVjg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWrFT-7IVjg", "title": "Epyx - The Nightmare", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eWrFT-7IVjg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
