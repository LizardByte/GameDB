Both the entry and Champions' Race ranking systems are incorporated - the former covering the last 52 weeks and the latter being fixed over a single calendar year.\nPlayers can be defined as volleyers, defenders, punchers or varied, with definable kit colors and playing abilities. As you play the game, your player's ability improves - by more if you lose.
