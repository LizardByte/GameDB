Doesn't take much effort to overshoot your targets. One of the bonus areas involve rapid tapping of the A button to stay in the air. try as I might, I just couldn't get the power and achieve the 50 points. Even with autofire helping, it wasn't enough.\n\nI quite liked the rescue mission sections far more then the rest of the game. I would really like to play more of these type of levels. Maybe they did make such a game and i never saw it.
