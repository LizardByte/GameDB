As a song plays, the player, guided by on-screen graphics, must shake the maracas at high, middle, or low heights with the beat of the music, or occasionally must strike poses with the maracas held in various positions. The player is represented on-screen by Amigo, a Brazilian monkey. If the player does well, the scene around Amigo (usually a concert or a dance) will attract more people and become more vividly animated; if the player does poorly, characters leave and eventually all that's left is Amigo alone, looking sad.\n\nIn the primary game mode, each player has six spots arranged in a circle on the screen: two red meaning \"shake high,\" two yellow meaning \"shake middle,\" and two green meaning \"shake low.\" Blue dots will appear in the center of this circle and move towards the spots; as soon as the blue dot touches a spot, the player must shake a maraca at that location. For example, if a blue dot touches the upper left spot, the player must shake either maraca above his left shoulder. If both maracas are shaken in that location, the player gets an \"Amigo\" bonus. Occasionally a long line of dots will flow into a spot and the word \"Shake\" appears, telling the player to continue shaking his maraca rapidly there. Sometimes a stick-figure (named \"Pose\") appears on the screen holding its maracas in a certain position; the player has a second or two to match the figure's pose for points.", "summary": "Samba de Amigo: Ver. 2000 is an upgraded version, and it contains 14 new songs, as well as six new downloadable songs for the home version. Whereas in the original game, there were only three songs to choose in each stage, this version allows the player to choose several. \"Love Love/Couples\" Mode, originally available only in the home version of Samba de Amigo, is included in the arcade version of Ver. 2000. A new character named Amiga joins the cast. She is Amigo's sister, and wields a tambourine. In the home version, a new volleyball game replaces the original minigames. Survival mode was also added, where the player must finish as many songs in a row as they can. In addition, the Challenge mode has new goals, as well as five new secret stages that are quite difficult.\n\nThe most significant addition to Ver. 2000 is the new \"Hustle Mode\". In this mode, the player must still follow the dots and shake the maracas in the appropriate location, but this is done a lot less often. Instead, Pose appears frequently, and in addition to making the player do static poses, he will be shaking his maracas in certain patterns that the player must mimic. These patterns include either shaking one or both maracas back and forth between two of the six positions, doing a full 360\u00b0 rotation starting from one position, and looping all the way back around. All the songs in the game, including the ones previously found in the first version, have both Original and Hustle Mode patterns.\n\nSamba de Amigo Ver. 2000 was announced for North American release, under the name Samba de Amigo Ver. 2001, but it was among the games that were canceled when Sega discontinued support for their console.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samba-de-amigo-ver-2000", "videos": [{"id": 95171, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8MwgEt_i5OQ"}]}
