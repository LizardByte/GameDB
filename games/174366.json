The aim of Puzzle Pests is simple - clear all the fleas off the game board by blowing them up, sending them through trap doors or matching four fleas of the same color in a straight line or a square formation. But beware! New fleas are being born all the time so you have to keep up with the population growth. Puzzle Pests is packed with puzzles and challenges to keep you coming back for more. Have you got what it takes to beat the pesky fleas?\nHours and hours of insect fun. With three different game modes and cartoon-style graphics, you\u2019ll never get tired of playing Puzzle Pests. Solve 100 puzzle levels, see if you can deal with increasingly more difficult levels in the Round Robin mode or test your mettle under time pressure.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzle-pests"}
