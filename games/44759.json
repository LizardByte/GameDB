The game is unusual in that, rather than using a 3:4 aspect ratio to better suit the vertically-oriented gameplay, it uses a horizontal monitor (4:3) in the style of Neo Geo vertical shooters as well as the later Radiant Silvergun and Giga Wing. There is an English version of the game titled Terra Diver, but it was never officially released.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soukyuu-guren-tai"}
