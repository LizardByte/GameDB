It ran on a black & white monitor with a color overlay that gave each row of balloons at the top of the screen a different color. It was designed and programmed by Edward Valeau and Howell Ivey of Exidy in 1977.\n\nCircus came in an upright dedicated cabinet, and may have also been available in a cocktail configuration as well. Circus machines had white sides with red painted sideart of several balloons in flight. The front of the machine was decorated with a large ornate monitor bezel that also doubled as a marquee (or nameplate). This bezel showed several clowns in a circus scene and had the game title spelled out with multicolored balloons. The control panel was unadorned, save for an analog spinner and a start button. The whole machine was finished off in black T-molding.\n\nAt least 13,000 units, possibly as many as 20,000, were produced.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/circus--1", "videos": [{"id": 132426, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "p4ZTxIXL-Ws", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ZTxIXL-Ws", "title": "Circus (Exidy/1977) Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p4ZTxIXL-Ws/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
