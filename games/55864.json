Midranda, the mightiest of them all, betrayed his brothers and raised an army of aberrations to fight alongside him. The resulting war was long and devastating, and in the end, humans and gods were forced to utilize the \"Ancient Weapon\" to defeat Midranda. However, the planet was left in ruins, and the gods abandoned it, leaving humanity to fend for itself in a shattered world.\n\nAs time passed, humanity emerged from the ashes of its past and built a new civilization. But this progress is now threatened by the resurgence of Midranda's followers, Igolations, who seek to revive their fallen god.\n\nAdding to this threat is the \"Tome of the Ancients,\" describes a third race of demons known as the \"Pagon,\" rising from the aftermath of the Second God's War. These malevolent entities plan to free their creator from the depths of the Netherworld and reclaim their dominion over Efria.\n\nIn response to these imminent dangers, the great kingdom has focused on training new soldiers in every corner of the continent. They are preparing to face the adversities that await the human race as foretold by the tome.", "summary": "Experience a classic open-world MMOARPG and engage in thrilling battles against epic monsters in fast-paced action combat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wartale", "videos": [{"id": 95760, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "GN8KNOZdVPA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN8KNOZdVPA", "title": "Wartale - Sunken Domain (137 cave)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GN8KNOZdVPA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
