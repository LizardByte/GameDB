They have a strong presence in the galaxy, inhabiting several star systems, and their incursion puts pressure on the Union and the Commonwealth\u2019s uneasy alliance.\n\nThe human alliance is fragile, but it must endure if it is to have the slightest chance of withstanding the assaults of the fanatical Sha\u2019Kari, who consider humans to be usurpers and grave robbers.\n\nThe Sha\u2019Kari have the clear advantage in technology, being the original creators of the powered armors that inspired humans to build the highly successful Mechanised Starfighter series of vehicles.\n\nOn the human side, Mechanised Starfighters are helmed by the very best pilots, and the Ranger Squad represents the best of the best - a highly regarded unit of Union and Commonwealth elite pilots known for their fearlessness and effectiveness in battle.\n\nYou start the game as a Mechanised Starfighter pilot ensign who joins the ranks of the Ranger Squad of elite pilots.", "summary": "Phantom Galaxies is an open-world online space sim in which initially players take on a pivotal role in the war for control of the sectors of Canis Major.\n\nPlayers will fight on the front lines as well as explore deep space to find valuable resources and uncover the powerful weapons of the Sha'Kari.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phantom-galaxies", "videos": [{"id": 64716, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "jtNp1XLuNRk"}]}
