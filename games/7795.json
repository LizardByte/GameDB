Of course it's up to our favorite prehistoric hero to stop him, and so Bonk embarks on an all-new quest to save the world.\n\nBonk\u2019s second adventure leads him through 7 exotic levels, from sunny beaches to winter wonderlands, including 8 special bonus stages. Bonk\u2019s new enemies include bad-attitude dinosaurs, vicious piranhas, oversized insects and many more treacherous foes. However, as always, Bonk comes packed with an arsenal of his very own dangerous moves.\n\nStaying true to his name, Bonk\u2019s ultimate weapon is still his gigantic head! Bonk can pummel his enemies into submission with his signature headbutt or shake the very ground they walk on by pile-driving straight into the earth. A master of his terrain, Bonk can also climb various objects using his razor sharp teeth. Of course, what would Bonk be without his favorite caveman power-ups? That\u2019s right, the roasted meat is back, but this time with an all new Bonk!\n\nBy eating one small slab of meat, Bonk can now transform into Zombie Bonk, allowing him to petrify his enemies with a powerful pile driver or fireball. But by eating two small slabs or one large slab, Bonk will transform into Butthead Bonk, an all-powerful being who breathes fire, eradicating his enemies at will.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bonks-revenge"}
