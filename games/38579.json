Each island contains multiple paths, and the creatures have to swim the water between the islands, which is slower than running. Many obstacles slow the creatures down, including apple-throwing trees, lightning, sea monsters, giant clams, and sinkholes. There are also ways to move forward quickly, such as a hand that throws a character and caves that warp the creature to the exit. In addition to a joystick for movement, there is a jump button.\n\nThe goal is to finish in the top three to progress to the next race.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mystic-marathon", "videos": [{"id": 112004, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "igUb0PijcTw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igUb0PijcTw", "title": "Arcade Game:  Mystic Marathon (1983 Williams)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/igUb0PijcTw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
