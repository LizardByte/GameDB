Neil/Tyra did it. However, this is not enough for Neil/Tyra. Because they want to make Mewtwo stronger, they want to turn it into a Pokemon which can mega evolve without ordinary mega stones, but unluckily, they have no money to keep it up. When they think they have to give it up, a man called Kasper shows up. This man is a businessman; what's more, he is the leader of Team Delta, a mysterious organization in the Ivara Region. He said he could help Neil/Tyra finish their experiment. Neil/Tyra has no choice; they join Team Delta. However, they are still wondering why did Kasper help them? Should they trust this man?"}
