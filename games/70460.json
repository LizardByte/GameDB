The Indians, in addition to trying to enter, will throw torches at us that we must extinguish with a hammer. There are only four points where enemies can enter.\n\nSTAGE 2 THE SOUTH SEAS.\nOur ship is being attacked by pirates who are besieging us from the sea and firing cannon fire from their ships. We will have to destroy the cannonballs before they explode on deck.\n\nSTAGE 3 THE CASTLE.\nWe are in the Middle Ages, our castle is attacked by the enemy army, armed with a catapult. Enemies will be able to enter through five points of the castle.\n\nSTAGE 4 THE SPACE BASE.\nWe defend a base on the surface of a hostile planet. Aliens in rocket engines, floating mines and flying saucers that we can destroy with laser cannons.", "summary": "Hammer Boy is a game based on the essentials of HAND HELD-type machines, easy to use, simple but highly addictive.\n\nOnce the enemy or the object that is going to penetrate our fortress is within reach of our hammer, the blow will finish with it. If a greater number of two enemies enter (in the Spectrum, Amstrad and MSX versions) or five in the other versions, our fortress will be conquered. An equal number of thrown objects that penetrate will cause us to lose a life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hammer-boy", "videos": [{"id": 138987, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "KzURy92c6Wg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzURy92c6Wg", "title": "Amiga Longplay 105: Hammer Boy - Not Commented", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzURy92c6Wg/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
