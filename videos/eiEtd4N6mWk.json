It is notable for cultivating a 'feminine sensibility' in its design by employing primarily women for its creative staff. An unofficial English translation patch was released in 2019.\n\nStory\nWhile enjoying the once-per-year Summer Festival, the heroine Poach Arsia is accidentally brought to Napple World due to a mistake made by Straynap, a novice Spirit Guide who leads souls into the afterlife. Napple World, known as the land of daydreams, lies between the Real World and the Deep Dream, where souls go to rest. The concept of time in Napple World is unlike the real world: the seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter exist separately from each other as distinct locations. When Poach arrives in Napple World, six fairy-like beings called Petals leave her body and escape into the seasons, and she must retrieve them in order to go home again. To make up for his mistake, Straynap becomes Poach's guide and instructs her throughout the game, explaining the often contradictory nature of Napple World to her.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Napple Tale takes place in two distinct sections. Similar to Sonic Adventure, there is a fully 3D hub where Poach can interact with the townspeople. The citizens of Napple Town have an assortment of problems (approximately seventy) with which Poach must help them. Tasks range from building a house to helping two friends stop fighting with each other.\n\nThe levels extend from the Napple Town hub level, and correspond to the seasons. They contain a fixed path with a boss at the end. The enemies encountered along the way sometimes drop recipe pieces or random items. The recipes show four items which, if combined, will create a Paffet. Poach wields a racket-like weapon which she swings to battle foes. She can double-jump and attack to perform a spinning attack. Health is designated with petals and by finding certain items you can increase your maximum health.\"\n\ngame info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napple_Tale:_Arsia_in_Daydream\n\nview via Dreamcast plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiEtd4N6mWk&list=PLuuPtpz2AigABTqqfHKzV2XtSvMNyteq9&index=1\n\npatreon: https://www.patreon.com/zedrapsyborg\npaypal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ZedraPsyborg\n\n#NappleTale #\u30ca\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb #Longplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiEtd4N6mWk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiEtd4N6mWk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiEtd4N6mWk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiEtd4N6mWk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eiEtd4N6mWk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Napple Tale: Arsia in Daydream Pt.1 (Chime / Sega - Dreamcast - 2000) Longplay", "description": "Pt.2 (completed): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utRB1PyUtjc&list=PLuuPtpz2AigABTqqfHKzV2XtSvMNyteq9&index=4\n\n\"Napple Tale: Arsia in Daydream (\u30ca\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb \u30a2\u30ea\u30b7\u30a2 \u30a4\u30f3 \u30c7\u30a4\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0), more commonly called simply Napple Tale, is a 2.5D platform game for the Sega Dreamcast, released on October 19, 2000 in Japan.
