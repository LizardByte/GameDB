It\u2019s going on above your head as you walk the planet surface. Night becomes day as planets orbit the sun. Hundreds of asteroids with their own trajectory. We even simulate temperature and atmospheric resistance, and there is no cheating involved.\nThe player is free to do anything within the confines of the simulation. You can...\n\u2022 ...spontaneously exit the ship inside a busy asteroid field!\n\u2022 ...fly to the sun and melt your ship!\n\u2022 ...tow a giant mushroom and put it in orbit around the sun!\n\u2022 ...ride a sofa into a black hole!\nOnly your failures and imagination set the limits!\n\nRookie Mode\nWith Rookie mode it is possible for players of different skill levels to play together. Parents can play with their young children. Or gamers can play with their less talented parents and siblings. We want the whole family to be able to play ADIOS Amigos together. Rookie mode makes the controls easier and stops the player from doing obviously dangerous things.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qE5FYOcLgCE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qE5FYOcLgCE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qE5FYOcLgCE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qE5FYOcLgCE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qE5FYOcLgCE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ADIOS Amigos - Launch Trailer", "description": "Team up with your friends & family and explore the peculiar universe of ADIOS Amigos.
