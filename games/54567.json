These challenges are based on \"what-if?\" scenarios for historic races or horses. For example, players may choose to become an undefeated champion for Deep Impact's Triple Crown winning spree. When these challenges are cleared, players can obtain new unique race horses for their characters.\n\nPlayers can increase the benefits gained during their practice sessions by fulfilling \"Practice Challenges\". Different bonus points can be gained based on the player's performance.", "summary": "Champion Jockey: Special is a horse racing simulator in which the player becomes a jockey and leads the racehorse to victory.
