Start each action-packed stage with a silhouetted girl behind the playfield and dodge enemies while drawing lines that cut away when connected, methodically uncovering the image underneath.\n\nIt's a game of risk-vs-reward as you capture as much of the playfield as possible without enemies or bullets crossing your path. Will you whittle away at smaller and safer zones along the edge, or will you go for higher scores by cutting into enemy territory? Box in power-ups to use their effects, unlock completed images in the gallery and share your victories across online leaderboards!\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Rescue anime-style mecha girls in 50 unique stages!\n\u2022 Decide your own strategy in freeform gameplay.\n\u2022 Adapt to gradually increasing difficulty.\n\u2022 Unlock special 5-star challenges with the girls in alternate outfits!\n\u2022 View your captured images in Gallery mode.\n\u2022 Enjoy a pumping soundtrack that will get you in the mood.\n\u2022 Share high scores with online leaderboards!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 48681, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LqhTb-jdk94"}]}
