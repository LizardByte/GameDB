When a full row is filled that row will be destroyed. When all the blocks are destroyed the level is cleared. The game needs you to focus and think of how each block should be drawn to fit the board.\n\nStory mode The player will complete faster and harder levels, and if done fast enough a star will be rewarded.\nEndless An endless game which gets faster and harder and there will be a highscore at the end of the run.\n\nFor now it's only a Android game but there might be a iPhone version if there is enough interest. I also have a lot of ideas to add if the game gets popular.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/svajp", "videos": [{"id": 28106, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Kt0Hpu9Sz7A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt0Hpu9Sz7A", "title": "Svajp game play", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kt0Hpu9Sz7A/sddefault.jpg"}]}
