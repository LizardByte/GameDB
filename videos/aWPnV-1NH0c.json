Nimble scavengers must stealthily explore the Deathgarden, hoping to gather and deliver enough blood to open the exits and get out alive. \n\nUnique characters & playstyles \n\nEvery hunter and scavenger has unique powers and customizable loadouts. Upgrade your characters and unlock higher progression tiers by spending your hard-earned resources and completing challenges. \n\nFrantic and Brutal Gameplay \n\nScavenge for blood in third person or hunt for kills in first person. Players must think fast and act quickly if they are to succeed in the arena. Hunters, who\u2019s sole objective is to track down and kill  scavengers, control the playing field by setting up dynamic traps for their prey. With the hunters\u2019 net ever closing in around them, scavengers must deliver blood and amass resources, while hoping to survive high intensity chases.\n\nThematic Gardens\n\nEach thematic map is procedurally generated and has a direct impact on your experience. As hunters and scavengers, you\u2019ll need to adapt your playstyle and strategy to the map in which you play. Weather conditions, visibility, structures, vegetation and elevations will vary greatly and impact your gameplay experience in meaningful ways.\n\nAs Deathgarden continues to grow, you are bound to meet new hunters and scavengers, discover new maps, experiment with new weapons and powers, and take on additional challenges and seasonal events that will enrich your gameplay experience.\n\nOfficial licensor Studiocanal S.A.S. \n\nAbout Studiocanal S.A.S.\n\nStudiocanal is a subsidiary of the Canal+ Group.
