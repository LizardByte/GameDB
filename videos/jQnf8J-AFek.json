You can move tiles up, down, left or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to the other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared to \"a match game mixed with a color cube\". Unlike other popular puzzle games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos - make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.\n\nIn Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds. Play against a friend in Versus, complete with items and special moves... or simply relax to a variety of different, aesthetically striking skins in Chillout mode, where there's no score, timer, or game overs. No matter your playstyle, there's a mode in CROSSNIQ+ for you!\n\nLet's Cross!
