These videos, releasing over the course of the month, will examine the challenges and opportunities inherent to a project like Stronghold: DE, through new interviews with veteran Stronghold developers.\n\nFirst up we have Senior Graphic Designer Darrin Horbal and Stronghold: DE Lead Artist Niall Benzie, resident experts in art and animation for the project and integral parts of our small team. Watch to learn more about their method, the details of specific improvements and techniques used to enhance our first, classic castle sim. Subsequent developer diaries will further explore the game's creation and development, with insight from other long serving members of the Firefly team. We will discuss DE's new features and confirm any fresh developments, as we approach our November 7th launch date.\n\nPlease enjoy this first entry in our Stronghold: Definitive Edition dev diary series and be sure to download our final pre-release demo next week, during Steam Next Fest: October Edition 2023! We will be streaming a few bonus videos on Steam as soon as the festival begins and later uploading those here on YouTube. These will be followed by even more DE content before launch, so thanks for playing and stay tuned for plenty of exciting features in the run up to release.\n\n00:00-01:44 Introduction\n01:45-03:24 Art Archaeology\n03:25-06:31 Upgrading Animations\n06:32-08:56 Enhanced Visuals\n08:57-09:25 Photogrammetry\n09:26-11:05 Favourite Upgrades / Outro\n\nJoin the Discord - https://discord.gg/strongholdofficial \n\nSubscribe for Updates - https://www.fireflyworlds.com/signup", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AUIN8YV3-9A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AUIN8YV3-9A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AUIN8YV3-9A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AUIN8YV3-9A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AUIN8YV3-9A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Stronghold: Definitive Edition - Dev Diary (Art & Animation)", "description": "Buy Now - https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140020/Stronghold_Definitive_Edition/\n\nIn anticipation of our second public Stronghold: Definitive Edition demo - Releasing at 5pm GMT on Monday 9th October as part of Steam Next Fest - We have just released the first in a series of in-depth developer diaries!
