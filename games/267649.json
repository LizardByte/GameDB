Fusion Shooting Game!!!\", at least according to the advertising flyer. The game's official description for the Game Rating Board is more humble, it bluntly calls the game out a Galaga clone, which seems to be the more appropriate version. One or two players shoot cartoony enemies in front of abstract, non-scrolling backgrounds. It is possible, though, to move in all 4 directions, contrary to Galaga's restrictive horizontal only movement.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diet-family", "videos": [{"id": 98361, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "RH9UUbOU_cI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH9UUbOU_cI", "title": "Arcade Longplay [528] Diet Family", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RH9UUbOU_cI/sddefault.jpg"}]}
