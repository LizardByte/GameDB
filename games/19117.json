It is a dual-stick shooter in the same vein as its predecessor, Robotron: 2084 (also produced by Jarvis). As in the previous game, players battle waves of enemies by using guns. The plot of Smash TV revolves around a futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes as well as their lives.\n\nAs the Super Nintendo doesn't have dual stick controls, the ABXY buttons are used to aim the player's gun instead - for a total of 8 possible directions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-smash-tv", "videos": [{"id": 110749, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lV92TwNc4gc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV92TwNc4gc", "title": "SNES Longplay [256] Super Smash T.V.", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lV92TwNc4gc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
