Here are my first impressions:\n\nGraphics - Obviously outdated, the world looks like my attempt at making a map in Unity Engine lmao. Low-res textures, disproportional buildings, and low poly, but overall it looked nice and unique. It really gives me those mid-2000s 3D games.\n\nCharacter Creation -\nIt's pretty similar to RO2:LOTS, though we don't get the semi-realistic proportion of human characters but \"kawaii-like\" small characters. I still prefer RO2:LOTS character creation.\n\nMusic -\nTHE MUSIC IS GODLIKE. It flows well with the map, also the combat music caught me off-guard. I didn't remember RO2:LOTS having this dynamic music when in combat.\n\nCombat -\nI've only tried attacking one mob but my first impression has to be that it's a bit clunky or weird, but eh.. I'll get used to it probably.\n\nWorld Design -\nSo far, I've only been on two maps, Lift Island and Hoddmimis. They're quite plain in design but good enough for an in-development game. Hoddmimis reminds me of FF7CC maps probably because it has the same vibe.\n\nGonna try playing the game more so I can understand more about the game's mechanics and lore (if it exists).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mpcimwYVo9U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mpcimwYVo9U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mpcimwYVo9U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Ragnarok Online 2: Gate of the World Gameplay", "description": "A private server obviously.\nMy first time playing RO2:GOTW.
