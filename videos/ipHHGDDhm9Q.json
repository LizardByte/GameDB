Adapted for consoles with revised controls and adjusted mechanics, Frostpunk: Console Edition allows you to fully test your tactical prowess on the frozen wastelands.\n\nOffering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you\u2019re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. \n\nWhether you\u2019re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you\u2019ll discover choices in this world aren\u2019t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\n\n--- Follow us ---\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frostpunkgame\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frostpunkgame/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/11bitstudios/\n\n--- Video credits ---\n\nEdit: Radikal Studio, Dawid Kurowski\nScript: Patryk Grzeszczuk, Karol Zaj\u0105czkowski\nMusic: Original track by Darkride - arranged for the trailer by Piotr Musia\u0142", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ipHHGDDhm9Q/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ipHHGDDhm9Q/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ipHHGDDhm9Q/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ipHHGDDhm9Q/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ipHHGDDhm9Q/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Frostpunk: Console Edition | Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Frostpunk: Console Edition is out now!\n\u25ba Xbox One: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/frostpunk-console-edition/9np539lhjd8s\n\u25ba PlayStation 4: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4361-CUSA15716_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000\n\n--- Music ---\n\nTrack Name: Weight of the World\nPerformed by: Darkride\nArranged by: Piotr Musia\u0142\n\n--- About the Game ---\n\nFrostpunk is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price.
