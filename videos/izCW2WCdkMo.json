Don the coat of a clever entrepreneur, take over a small railway company in the early 1800s and turn your steam engines into the workhorses of the economy. Grow your company into the largest railway company of the continent and outsmart your competitors as you connect cities and companies with an ever-expanding network of rail lines, bridges, and tunnels. 60 famous steam engines are at your disposal, all pulling freight and passenger cars as they usher in an era of historic importance during the Industrial Revolution. \n\nRailway Empire 2 features bigger, more detailed and lively maps than ever before. The whole of the US and continental Europe are covered in two huge, sprawling maps, whilst more detailed maps put the focus on specific regions of each continent. Improved track construction helps you focus on the important decisions as you drive the economy and help the growth of the cities. Signals are placed automatically, bridges can hold up to 4 tracks and the expandable train stations can now have up to 8 tracks.\n\nChoose from 6 different characters to lead your railway company, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Play the 5 campaigns or any of the 14 different scenarios if you are looking for a challenge. Set your own difficulty in the fully customisable Free Play mode or build the perfect rail network in construction mode. You can even board one of your trains and gaze upon the scenery passing by as the iron horse speeds along the tracks while you sit back and enjoy the view.\n\n*** \n\nKalypso Media also publishes critically acclaimed strategy games like the Tropico series, Railway Empire, Commandos, Port Royale, Dungeons, Sudden Strike, and others for PC, PlayStation\u00ae, Xbox\u00ae, and Nintendo Switch\u2122.
