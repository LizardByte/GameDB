To be honest though, there's not that much to do. Nothing of any Fae-level importance has happened in hundreds of years... Until now.\n\nStep into the shoes of The Bard, master WizardChess and scribble your name into every history book. Your prize for competing in their tournament? A boon from the FaeQueen herself. The Song of The Fae is yet to be written.", "summary": "WizardChess is Deckbuilding Chess.
