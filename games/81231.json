Like its predecessor, it is an unconventional soccer game where instead of a complete team, only a single player is directly controlled, with the other 10 players being controlled by the AI, although with the option to influence their choice in plays. However, unlike the original title, Liberogrande International is a home console title, and along featuring a more realistic visual presentation, it's now possible to choose formation and pick any player (including goalkeeper and the title-mentioned libero) to control, instead of being limited to play as either right-wing or playmaker, depending on the predefined team formation.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/liberogrande-international", "videos": [{"id": 39431, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "KKPbqLlUs90", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKPbqLlUs90", "title": "PSX LiberoGrande International (JP LiberoGrande 2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KKPbqLlUs90/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
