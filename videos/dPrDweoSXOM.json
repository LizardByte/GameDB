Not much in the way of sound effects either however color clash seems to have been kept at a minimum.\n\nThe game is really difficult and I don't imagine it was completed by many. The ending was an advert for unreleased games so felt completely unrewarding after all the effort. As for power ups, the Reds are upgrade weapon, and the whites are tempary invincibility which is invaluable and a must have pickup. If there are other weapons in the game I never figured how to get them.\n\nThe game is nothing like the Darius you know and love from the arcades and the only aspect of the game you can really connect the game too is the huge end of level bosses which thankfully are the easiest part of this port ;) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPrDweoSXOM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPrDweoSXOM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dPrDweoSXOM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "ZX Spectrum Longplay [068] Darius+", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nDarius+ on the Spectrum 128k\n\nThis is a disk version which again feels wasted due to lack of use of the 128k part (Just a tiny amount of looped music on the title screen) although I guess it helps when loading the random multi levels.\n\nGameplay wise, the gfx are large and dont leave you any room to manouver making the game insainly hard, especially if your playing with keys!
