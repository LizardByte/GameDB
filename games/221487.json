When you feel your pet's skill is good enough (buy a report card!), send it off to the local talent show for a chance to win a shiny trophy. Your pet will get tired after a few too many shows so be sure to only send them to one once you're sure they'll win.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tiny-talents"}
