A year later, a new rancher (male is by default named Adam and female is by default named Amanda) comes to Flowerbud Village, where Theodore, the town's mayor, helps set up their farm. The protagonist also meets the Harvest Sprites, who request their help in reawakening the Harvest Goddess by collecting magical music notes. Jamie becomes rivals with the protagonist. As the protagonist works at the farm, they also meet various people, some which are returning characters from Back to Nature, Save the Homeland, and A Wonderful Life, and makes an effort to befriend and help them. In the end, the Harvest Goddess is revived and Jamie leaves in shame. The protagonist then marries one of the bachelors or bachelorettes and has a child (if they choose to marry Jamie, then they will both leave town, ending the game). Once all the notes are found, Jamie is devastated, but the Goddess encourages him/her to be more selfless, ending his/her rivalry with the protagonist.", "summary": "Bokuj\u014d Monogatari: Shiawase no Uta is the fourteenth title of Bokuj\u014d Monogatari series to be released for Gamecube.
