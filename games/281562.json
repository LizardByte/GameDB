Now, as a string of murders casts a shroud over the city and the law begins to fail, justice cannot afford to be blind.\n\nThe son of a murdered lawyer, Takayuki Yagami was raised on the streets of Kamurocho by a yakuza patriarch who paves the way for Yagami to follow in his real father's footsteps. Taking a job at the Genda Law Office, Yagami accepts a high-profile case: Proving Shinpei Okubo, a man suspected of murder, innocent.\n\nAgainst all odds, Yagami succeeds and is hailed as a hero, but his prolific career is short-lived. Only months later, Okubo brutally murders his girlfriend, stabbing her over ten times with a kitchen knife before setting their apartment on fire.\n\nYagami becomes the lawyer who let a murderer walk - and everything he had worked for comes crashing down.\n\nThree years later, Yagami has taken off his lawyer's badge to run a small detective agency in the red-light district of Kamurocho, scraping by on odd jobs and evidence collection.\n\nBut even a city as seedy as this is shaken by a string of serial murders, where the victims' bodies are discovered with their eyes gouged out. Yagami is drawn into the case by his old law firm, where he discovers that in order to bring this killer to light, he must seek the truth that slipped from his grasp three years ago. But can a man haunted by his failures prevail over his own past?", "summary": "A remastered version of Judgment, featuring faster loading times, 60 FPS, as well as all of the downloadable content from the original release.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/judgment--2", "videos": [{"id": 104195, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Oo96SMJxSVc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo96SMJxSVc", "title": "Judgment - Announce Trailer | PS5", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oo96SMJxSVc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
