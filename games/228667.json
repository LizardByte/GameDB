The goal of the game is to align rows of lights on top of each other. A player who stacks 11 rows can choose to take a minor prize. A minor prize is usually low in value, sometimes lower than the amount of money the player paid to play the game. A player who stacks the blocks to the top row wins the jackpot prize, called the \"major prize.\" Major prizes vary from machine-to-machine but will often include high-value items such as game consoles, mobile phones, and gift cards.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stacker--1"}
