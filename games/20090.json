Equipped with Burst technology, these two cutting-edge craft were entrusted to humanoid AI terminal Ti2 and test pilot Riga Pratica. Flying the Silver Hawk Burst fighters alone into enemy territory without network support, the two heroes braved overwhelming odds to secure victory and liberation for Darius.\n\nIt is now 1910 D.C., and repairs on the hyperspace network have begun to reconnect the pockets of humanity scattered across the vast reaches of space. Combat data transmitted from Darius soon sees Burst-equipped Silver Hawk fighters constructed in every inhabited galaxy. The stage is set for mankind\u2019s grand counteroffensive. A team of heroes takes wing, flying into battle and the pages of history.", "summary": "Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours is a horizontal scrolling shooter developed by Pyramid and published by Taito.
