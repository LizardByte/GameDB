And soon enough most of the pupils were making fun of him, creating memes laughing at Matheus and then sharing them over the internet. In result the only friend Matheus had was Agro the puppy. And the only time he really felt happy was when he was alone in his room playing his favorite game Spiral Galaxy 2. Oh if only there was a place somewhere without the internet! But Matheus knew there was no escape for him.\n\nUntil one afternoon when an unusual entity named Calydra appeared in his room and entered a portal to Calysgore \u2013 a mysterious world full of wonders, magic and\u2026 no internet! Matheus entered the portal without a second thought and this is where our adventure begins and our hero is born.", "summary": "The Path of Calydra is a beautiful 3D adventure platformer set in the fantastic world of Calysgore.
