Points are scored for hearts delivered. Bluto, UFO's, witches etc try to stop you. Some hearts are behind locked doors so you've got to find the right key to open the door and get them while others can be grabbed simply by jumping up to get them. Somewhere there's a fruit machine for which you need to collect 'spin' items.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/popeye--10"}
