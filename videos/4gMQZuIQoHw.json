Like the first Mystic Ark title for Super Famicom it did not make it out of Japan. Although the Super Famicom game does have a fan translation available.

Mystic Ark 2 is the only game in the series that has no English translation available.\n\nThe concept is similar to the first Mystic Ark game where you need to solve puzzles to access new worlds. each world is unique and had it's own subplot. However, Mystic Ark 2 is not a turn based RPG. It's a 3D adventure game where you mainly solve puzzles, explore  and get into the occasional battle. You collect Arks here too (elemental spirits) and you will need to use them in various places to progress.\n\nOpening 2: https://youtu.be/Du2OJX_CY4A\nIf you've played the first Mystic Ark you'll likely recognise a few things.
