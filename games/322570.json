Now the player takes the role of a male or female kid to set things right. There are basically two goals per level: Drive away all rowdies and gather enough money for the bus. This is done by playing either nice tricks, e.g. washing off graffiti, or bad tricks, e.g. using a banana peel so someone slips.\nThe usage of tricks influences the village's morale either positive or negative, when it gets too low the game is lost. To do tricks the player has to use and combine items he finds on the streets. These depend on the character's gender and are randomly distributed. When pranksters get a hand on the player they pummel him and he loses life energy.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pranksters-treasure-of-the-indians", "videos": [{"id": 133332, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JwQq4dOe1Lo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwQq4dOe1Lo", "title": "Pranksters PC game (2005)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JwQq4dOe1Lo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
