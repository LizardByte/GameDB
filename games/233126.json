One day, after pondering what else is left to master, you receive a distress signal. The government on planet Kumdor requests your help with defeating monsters invulnerable to all but the best keyboard warriors. You accept, taking an ill-fated rocket trip to the planet, where you crash land and end up losing all your keys and prior experience. To Kumdor's residents, you might as well be nobody.\n\nThe planet, renowned for its potables & tourism, faces not just monsters, but inclement disasters. Fruit-bearing trees are petrified, settlements are blocked off by unworldly gates, and a volcano now spews lava across the land. With only your tenacity left, it's time to relearn your touch typing skills, use the monsters' spells against them, and prove that you're the hero Kumdor had sent for.", "summary": "In this touch-typing JRPG for PC-98, created by Michiaki Tsubaki with ASCII, you play as the Milky Way's #1 typist, summoned to planet Kumdor to fight mysterious monsters with typographic magic \u2014 but you lose all your keyboard keys and your QWERTY skills in a crash landing. Worse yet, the planet suffers from a petrified economy and natural disasters. Can you recover your skills, prove your identity, and save the world?\n\nThe game has a surreal atmosphere, quirky dialogue, and a distinctive visual style. It also features a control scheme built entirely around touch typing, using no directional keys or joypad input.
