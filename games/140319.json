In order to do that, he needs to pass through three zones, the garden, the forest and the castle, defeating Kings' followers and buying upgrades from the other Popgoes Animatronics. When King Cultivate is defeated, he calls Popgoes evil and claims, that without Kings' help, they will all starve.\n\nWhen exploring the world, the player can notice a mysterious, glitched object. When the player passes through an invisible entrance to the top of the castle area, they will be able to encounter the glitch, notice a couple of flashing images and get the white key to enter the House area. After entering the house, the player can notice two white characters, one of them saying \"Look Dad\" with Toy Bonnie's mask on their head. If the player goes through the invisible entrance to the left from the house area, they will pass through the empty areas from the FNaF3 minigames, and meet the mysterious glitch at the end. If it's encountered, a battle with \"Bonnie\" will start, but after an attack, the game will stop, and the Blackrabbit's hand will come out from the arcade machine, crashing the game. After restarting the game and going back to this area, the glitch will be gone.", "summary": "In Popgoes Arcade, you play as a child. You\u2019re not going to be killed by a mysterious man, you\u2019re not going to be stuffed into a suit or given a mask to wear in purgatory. No. Today, you\u2019re just going to play a damn game on a top-of-the-line Popgoes Pizzeria arcade machine. You\u2019re going to play Weasel World. Your favourite. But Weasel World feels\u2026 strange today. It plays the same, it looks the same, it... smells the same... But there\u2019s just something wrong about it. And with your little hand at the joystick, you WILL find out what that something is. Until your parents come to pick you up, of course."}
