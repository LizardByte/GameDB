In it, you take aim at zombies hellbent on, you guessed it, eating your brains.\nThe good news is that you are armed with an infinite number of arrows to survive 50 waves of zombies. Each wave brings more zombies whose aggression and evasiveness grow greater and greater as well.\nYou aren\u2019t limited to an old-fashioned bow and arrow, either. Holiday items littered throughout the scenario -- presents, stockings, ornaments -- unlock special weapons to combat the dead men (and women) walking. Weapons include bows capable of shooting three arrows at once and arrows that can be rapidly fired or tipped with explosives.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arrow-flick"}
