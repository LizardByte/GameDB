If, after defeating this extra opponent, the player still fails to meet the goal, Arle is booted from the tower and the game ends. The EXP goals vary from version to version; for example, Super Puyo Puyo Tsu requires twice as many points to clear the first floor as the arcade or Mega Drive versions.", "summary": "Super Puyo Puyo 2 Remix is a puzzle action game released by Compile for the Super Famicom.\n\nThe mayor differences between this \"Remix\" version and regular Super Puyo Puyo 2 is that you now can play 4 player multiplayer with bots.
