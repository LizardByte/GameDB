The success of a date is tracked, from moment to moment, and two Sims who hit it off will soon find new social interactions available to them, to help them develop their romantic relationships even further. Many of the expansion's new objects, such as the dining booth and the bowling alley, can be used to help Sims improve their relationships with one another while they have fun and quell other needs at the same time.\n\nNightlife is designed to enhance the gameplay of the Sims 2 in other ways, as well, by adding new options and features never before available in any Sims game or add-on. In addition to dates, Sims can band together to go on \"Group Outings,\" which allow them to enjoy the downtown scene together, without all that heady romantic pressure. The expansion also adds a new life aspiration, Pleasure, which allows for characters who are truly devoted to the pursuit of happiness, and receive wants and fears based on their epicurean ideals.\n\nAnother major addition introduced by Nightlife is automobiles. If they can afford one, Sims can now own and operate their own cars - no more need to wait for the carpool or taxi cab to get them where they need to be. Other new objects include a poker table, a DJ stand, and many more lighting choices. As usual, most of these objects can be used in Sims' private homes (or dorm rooms), as well as in the new public downtown areas.", "summary": "Your Sims are on the town hitting all the swanky hot spots in The Sims 2: Nightlife, the second expansion pack for The Sims 2.
