Throughout the game, each player's character learns skills that will determine how successful (or not) they will be in their craft. The first two attributes (race and class) are chosen by the player when creating his character. The skill attribute depends mainly on the experience during the game and is deeply influenced by the way of playing and the preferences of each player.\n\nThe action takes place in a virtual fictional world where the role of a character that interacts with other characters is adopted, whether they are controlled by other players or non-player characters.
