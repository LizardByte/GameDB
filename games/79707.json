The 100+ minutes of music include licensed tracks, fresh dance hits, and cool new songs exclusive to the North American release. DDRMAX delivers never-before-seen in-game videos, new gameplay options, blistering 60-frames per second frame rates and the largest song library in franchise history. Further enhancing the gameplay experience is the introduction of the FREEZE ARROW option that freezes on-screen arrows and forces you to modify your dance steps thus increasing complexity and adding a twist to the routine. Popular gameplay options that return in DDRMAX are the Edit Mode that enables you to customize your own dance steps, and the special Work Out mode that tracks the number of calories burned with every move.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ddrmax-dance-dance-revolution"}
