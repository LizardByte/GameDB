Paul has returned to his friends Amelie and Ricky after one year of studying in Berlin, and is thrilled to see his old crush Devine again, although he's less thrilled about her getting married to macho Vincent in a few days. Ricky is interested in Luca, the red-haired waitress at the clique's favorite caf\u00e9, while Amelie would like to get closer to her former professor Marcel Beno\u00eet. Amelie's fashion-conscious and manipulative twin sister Estelle and flower girl Marie will also play their part.\n\nTaking control of these characters throughout 15 episodes, players influence the relationships between them, mainly by choosing what they say in conversations. Some characters occasionally have to be dressed for a specific event in a mini game, while a second, more frequent mini game allows characters to tip the mood or topic of a conversation in their favor by using cards representing certain gestures. In the end, the player's actions through all episodes will determine who hooks up with whom.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kiss-before-midnight"}
