In SOD, Wolfenstein 3D\u2019s representational renderings (considered state-of-the art at the time of the game\u2019s release in 1992) have been replaced by pure geometrical forms in a limited palette of black, white and gray. The result is a game space that is loosely architectural and extremely disorienting; it is easy to get lost, and it can be difficult to distinguish the walls from the targets one is supposed to shoot. Paesmans and Heemskerk complement the game-play difficulties with a cryptic interface (setting game preferences is no easy task!) and tongue-in-cheek game instructions along the lines of \"If you are tough, press N. If not, press Y daintily.\" With its stark elegance, SOD offers a compelling alternative to the computer game industry\u2019s mindless pursuit of representational realism.", "videos": [{"id": 58876, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "24KQiy0U_Uk"}]}
