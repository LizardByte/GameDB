Dark magic surges into the land to fill the void. Recognizing the potential for complete control over the dark powers, Gandohar starts to use the power of Aziraal trap within Kyra, the descendant of the Orphans. Despite her ancestry, Kyra cannot endure the strain. With Antaloor already in his clutches, Gandohar concocts a new plan from his stronghold in Oswaroth. There are still those who struggle against the tyrant, hoping to shift the balance of forces in their favor. The fight for Antaloor continues...\n\nFive years have passed since dramatic events brought the whole world to the edge of the abyss. The hero is a prisoner in the dungeons of Gandohar's castle. His hopes of saving his sister vanished with his freedom. Just as despair threatens to overcome him, hope comes from where he would have least expected. The Orcs, a race the hero had always hated, have put together a rescue squad that frees the hero from his bonds. He emerges into a land desecrated by evil. He embarks on a journey to shed light on Gandohar's dark past, hoping to discover a weak point in his enemy's defense. If he fails, he will lose his sister forever.", "summary": "Two World II is a fantasy role playing game which continues the storyline from the first game.\n\nAziraal was the ancient god of war revered by the Orcs and said to possess immense powers. When Aziraal's tomb was opened at the end of the first game, the god's powers transferred to our hero's sister. Now the dark lord Gandohar, determined to have Aziraal's power for himself, has taken our hero and his sister captive and is draining those powers from her. The escape from the prison acts as a tutorial for the game until the hero finally steps out into Antaloor.\n\nThere is a huge world to be explored containing deserts, forests, swamps, seashores, cities and rural areas, plus many hidden caves and dungeons. There will be encounters with every kind of monster imaginable from killer insects to huge beasts, as well as humanoid enemies of varied races. Since the levels of the enemies are not tied to the player's level, some fights need to be avoided until the hero advances and increases his abilities. The game boasts that there are enough quests to keep players busy for about 100 hours.\n\nIn the single-player game, the hero can be a male only. His specialty (warrior, ranger, mage) can be changed at will by swapping equipment. Success as each is entirely dependent upon how earned skill points are assigned.\n\nTwo Worlds II features improvements over the first game including new user interface, game engine and magic & crafting systems. It includes all of the gameplay elements that were part of Two Worlds I (riding on horseback, crafting, forging, alchemy). Sailing (planned for the first game, but never released) is possible in this game, albeit in only a few locations.\n\nFeats and skills can be learned to enhance each form of combat. Learned spells can be combined with each other using the new card modifiers to enhance or change their effects. Improvements to the crafting/forging aspects make it possible to improve weapons and armor differently. For instance, objects in inventory can be broken down to their base elements (cloth, wood, iron).\n\nTwo Worlds II also offers five multiplayer modes for up to 8 players: Crystal Capture, PvP, Dual, Adventure (7 chapters), and a Village mode. In multiplayer, new characters are created with a choice of several races and can be male or female.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/two-worlds-ii", "videos": [{"id": 128490, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9LJGD-ni7-4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LJGD-ni7-4", "title": "Two Worlds 2 Trailer [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9LJGD-ni7-4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 128488, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "7tW0eFVKrOg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tW0eFVKrOg", "title": "Two Worlds II | release trailer (2010)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7tW0eFVKrOg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 128489, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-IjuwKq6QJ8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IjuwKq6QJ8", "title": "Two Worlds II Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-IjuwKq6QJ8/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1245, "name": "Two Worlds"}]}
