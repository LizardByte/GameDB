Exploring the eerie town of Silent Hill, she must find a way to escape.", "summary": "Silent Hill 3 is the third installment in the Silent Hill survival horror series and a direct sequel to the first game, although this is kept secret from the player for plot twist purposes. Like the previous entries, Silent Hill 3 is a survival horror combining action-based combat and puzzle-solving, but is somewhat more combat-oriented than the preceding installments. The main character is able to side-step and block some attacks, but in general shares with the other protagonists of the series their relative ineptitude in combat.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 455, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9s5t6R3aWwY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s5t6R3aWwY", "title": "Silent Hill 3 E3 2002 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9s5t6R3aWwY/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 36145, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "MLo2WtNN69Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLo2WtNN69Q", "title": "Silent Hill 3 HD - Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1 - Prologue [4K 60FPS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MLo2WtNN69Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 5707, "name": "Claudia"}, {"id": 1640, "name": "Voice Actor"}, {"id": 11585, "name": "Vincent"}, {"id": 16567, "name": "Heather"}, {"id": 16568, "name": "Douglas"}]}
