{"id": "XqaS5WA3IsA", "snippet": {"title": "NINJA GAIDEN (Arcade) - No Death Clear", "description": "I finally got around to learning the original Ninja Gaiden, which was a Double Dragon type of beat 'em up. It still holds up pretty well, and it's cool seeing the ninja actions they created for the game - a lot of which were carried forward into the 3D reboot series. And as a wrestling fan, I always get a kick out of the references in these old games, like the Road Warriors appearing as bosses (complete with a knockoff Iron Man theme), and a big Stan Hansen sign lol. But I digress. \nThe game itself is pretty fun, though it has some boring segments and a bit of jank you need to adapt to. It's also not very hard, so I think it's worth giving a shot for fans of the newer games if you want to see where it all started. Note that there are a few more guaranteed 1ups you can after stage 2, but I skipped them because that woul just add some unnecessary risk for what I was trying to do.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:55 Round 1\n4:09 Round 2\n7:58 Round 3\n12:57 Round 4\n18:18 Round 5\n23:46 Round 6\n30:14 Ending & Credits\n-----\nBeat 'em Ups (e.g. Final Fight): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI6IYca_kvMhpG1GR9sk8OYiWQMZZTgl\n2D Action (e.g. Metal Slug): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI6IYca_kvNFjpnJ59Th6N0IU1PSpD3d\nSTG/Shmups (e.g. Dodonpachi): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE6B3779BE759F71", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqaS5WA3IsA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqaS5WA3IsA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqaS5WA3IsA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqaS5WA3IsA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqaS5WA3IsA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "NINJA GAIDEN (Arcade) - No Death Clear", "description": "I finally got around to learning the original Ninja Gaiden, which was a Double Dragon type of beat 'em up.
