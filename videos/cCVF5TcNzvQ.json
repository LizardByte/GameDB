I managed to arrive safely on the island of Eden. Like its biblical namesake, it is most certainly a garden, with a wide variety of plants, fungi, and perhaps some heretofore undiscovered animal species.\n\nDay 13. To my own horror, I have discovered that I am stricken with an unknown plague, something probably local to the island. Thankfully, I managed to find the research station left behind by the previous expedition. Perhaps the cure to this disease lies in the flora of this island. I must make haste and find the cure before it's too late.\n\nDay 17. I was wrong about Eden being nothing more than a peaceful idyll paradise. For the past few days a mysterious animal has been stalking me. I can't describe what it looks like but I am sure that it's hungry, it's highly intelligent, and it's not going to stop until one of us is dead.\n\nMiasmata is a game of survival, exploration and discovery. During your adventure, you'll encounter a mysterious and deadly creature. This creature can stalk you for miles, lurking behind grasses and vegetative cover. By treading carefully and quietly, you may be able to elude the creature. If you're careless, however, you will be forced to confront the creature head-on. Exploration is a key component to Miasmata, so you will need to make full use of an interesting cartography system. You can use landmarks, such as ruins and statues, to triangulate your location and construct a map of Eden's boundaries and contours.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCVF5TcNzvQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCVF5TcNzvQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCVF5TcNzvQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCVF5TcNzvQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cCVF5TcNzvQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Miasmata trailer", "description": "http://www.gog.com/gamecard/miasmata\n\nFrom the journal of Robert Hughes:\n\nDay 1.
