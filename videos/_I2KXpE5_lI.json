{"id": "_I2KXpE5_lI", "snippet": {"title": "Blue Lightning (Jaguar CD) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Atari's 1995 arcade-style flight sim for the Atari Jaguar CD, Blue Lightning.\n\nRecorded from the original hardware with an X-Capture 1 card using composite hookups.\n\nThe playthrough shows all 40 in-game missions (training all the way through to the secret base) and  is done on the easy level - the Europe stage is too hard and cheap on easy to even consider medium or hard. AFAIK, the difficult level has no impact on which ending you get.\n\nI put the game in 'comedy' mode starting with the Arctic missions so that you could hear the utterly ridiculous voices. Finishing the game in comedy mode also is how you access the full, proper ending video.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. It's definitely messy - the controls and hit detection are pretty wonky, but the spirit scaling looks pretty nice, and the music is a pretty awesome variety of 90s generic guitar shredding. The odd thing about the music though, is that though it is streaming off the CD, it's somewhat low in quality. If you try to put the JagCD in a regular CD player, you'll be able to access the music, but it'll be super distorted and play back at double speed. I ripped the tracks and dumped them into an editor, and it appears as if two songs are encoded per track (can be changed by shifting stereo panning) and that the Jag is halving the playback speed on the fly (probably by playing back the 16bit track at 8bit? Or resampling the track from 44khz? Halve the resolution to halve the speed?). Anyways, that's all to do with the audio quality in case you were wondering.\n________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_I2KXpE5_lI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_I2KXpE5_lI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_I2KXpE5_lI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_I2KXpE5_lI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Blue Lightning (Jaguar CD) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Atari's 1995 arcade-style flight sim for the Atari Jaguar CD, Blue Lightning.\n\nRecorded from the original hardware with an X-Capture 1 card using composite hookups.\n\nThe playthrough shows all 40 in-game missions (training all the way through to the secret base) and  is done on the easy level - the Europe stage is too hard and cheap on easy to even consider medium or hard.
