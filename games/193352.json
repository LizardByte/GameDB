The rules of the game are simple: throughout the story, certain statements made by characters will be presented in purple-colored text. When the statement is given by an innocent character, the purple statement must be the truth.\n\nWhen spoken by the culprit, however, it does not have to be.\n\nAn experienced reader of Umineko may worry about the existence of this so-called 'magic'. There is no need for such worries. There is no magic here. Not a single golden butterfly in sight.\n\nYou need not hunt for a witch. For there is no witch to find.\n\nForget her.\n\nForget all of it.\n\nThere are only people. And the monsters that wear human faces hiding among them.", "summary": "This is an Umineko no Naku Koro Ni fangame, made using the PS3 game assets and the original Umineko soundtrack.
