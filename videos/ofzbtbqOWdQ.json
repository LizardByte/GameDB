{"id": "ofzbtbqOWdQ", "snippet": {"title": "F-Zero AX Arcade", "description": "F-Zero AX is a futuristic racing game where thirty pilots race on massive circuits inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds that can exceed 2000 km/h. \nThe game is noteworthy for its visuals, intense action, high level of difficulty and for its very high sense of speed. Tracks include loops, half-pipes, cylinders, and jumps. \n\nSome courses have innate obstacles like dirt patches, mines, tricky jumps, and magnetic tubes to navigate. Before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. This adds strategy, as players with greater knowledge of the circuits can make better decisions. \n\nThere is a limited range of machines available for the player to choose from. There are only ten vehicles in this arcade game plus the four pilots and with their own vehicles from the original F-Zero game; Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, Pico, and Samurai Goroh. Each vehicle has its own characteristics and performance abilities, including and limited to varying levels of top speed, acceleration, cornering, grip, boost, body, and each is driven by a different character.\n\nThere are six courses in F-Zero AX and a single race consists of three laps around one of those tracks.\n\n Each machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. First, it is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. Second, the player is given the ability to boost after the first lap. Boosting greatly increases the racer's speed, but also drains their energy. Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips that are placed on the track. If a player falls off a track or runs out of energy, a time penalty is received. As with all F-Zero titles, combat is not a crucial part of the game, but machines can attempt to damage and destroy each other using side or spin attacks.\n\nF-Zero AX includes two different modes of play. In the Race mode, the player chooses a cup and races against twenty-nine opponents through each track in that cup. \nUsing this mode, up to three other people can join in to compete simultaneously when the cabinets are connected to open up \"Versus Play\". Though each track must be completed before time runs out, the player is awarded \"time extensions\" for reaching certain checkpoints in the course. In Time Attack, the player chooses a track and complete it in the shortest time possible.\n\nThe game also dispenses F-Zero License Cards for various Prices. With these Cards, the game will build a custom vehicle that can later be upgraded using the pilot points earned for winning races. The card also saves the players' user ID, custom machine data, race data and pilot points, and provides a password for the F-Zero AX Internet Rankings. \n\nThis Internet ranking system is where players will enter a password on the Internet and will get ranked based on their position in the database. \nWhen using the F-Zero License Card, players will receive a password after racing in Time Attack that can be entered into the F-Zero Internet Rankings. It will save their time with the machine they've used on the database and rank it against other people's scores.\n\nA Nintendo GameCube memory card can be plugged directly into the F-Zero AX cabinet to download and/or upload special data. \nIf the memory card has F-Zero GX data on it, it is possible to access and use the custom vehicles contained there. \nNevertheless, players can use these arcade cabinets to unlock permanent access to multiple features in F-Zero GX; the fifth and last cup called the \"AX Cup\", a number of new custom machine parts and ten new vehicles. \nThis is easier said than done, as AX cabinets are quite rare; according to a fan-compiled F-Zero AX Locations database, less than twenty are Confirmed to be available in the North America region. However, more were manufactured for America and are simply MIA, Thus the chance of a new discovery, and its content can instead be unlocked in F-Zero GX, although with extreme difficulty.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/InsertCoinArcadeOfficial/\nEmail: insertcoinarcade@outlook.it", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofzbtbqOWdQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofzbtbqOWdQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofzbtbqOWdQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofzbtbqOWdQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ofzbtbqOWdQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "F-Zero AX Arcade", "description": "F-Zero AX is a futuristic racing game where thirty pilots race on massive circuits inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds that can exceed 2000 km/h. \nThe game is noteworthy for its visuals, intense action, high level of difficulty and for its very high sense of speed.
