Oh well, I still made it, plus it does illustrate just how over the top Keiko's level is compared to the others, what with all those insta-death hazards. (*_*)\n\nThis was in truth the last game I ever bought for the C64 way back in 1992, not that I could 1 credit clear it back then without using an Action Replay Cartridge. It's not a bad title either, comparable in gameplay to any of the 16-bit platformers around at the time. Okay, it's a bit lacking in the sound department (a pity Sonic Graffitti didn't do some in-game tunes as well), but the sprites are really well done and do at least look like the characters from the show.\n\nAh, with the exception of Keiko that is... the programmers evidently didn't realise that Keiko is Japanese and not Chinese (the yellow face and red china dress look way out of place, especially considering she wears blue in the show). This even led me to commission an artist to create a scene of a fake China Keiko stealing all the arrows off the real Keiko and escaping with them on her own skateboard. (^_^;)\n\nFor anyone that is interested, I did a similar thing with this game like I did with Paradroid, talking about it with PantherUK.
