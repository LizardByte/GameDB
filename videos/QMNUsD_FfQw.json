The difficulty and poor controls make it a chore to play.  If you roll your vehicle, you are done and not able to catch up to the pack.  The vehicle is also bouncing around and really easy to over steer when hitting a bump in the ground.  The game is also not pretty and hasn't aged well.  The music is not to bad when it can be heard with a soundtrack by Gravity Kills.  After completing each championship you are awarded with a class specific fmv.  These are quite poor, especially the jeep.\n\nI star out on medium difficulty and complete the 4 class championships first.  This unlocks 4 extra bonus vehicles.  In hindsight, this was a bad idea.  The extra Vehicles are only usable in Practice mode and there are only 6 tracks unlocked at this point.  If I had done the mixed championship first I would have all 12 tracks making the class races more varied.\n\nI then switch up to hard difficulty and play through all 6 mixed championship modes.  Winning each championship unlocks a new track.  In both modes, the game seems to choose a random track list from any that are unlocked.  I dread the winter wonderland track as its so long and dread it more when it lands on the 5 lap race.  Strangely the ai cars are really aggressive on the winter tracks.  I think the speed of the game seems to change more than the ai difficulty on each of the difficulty modes.  The video would have been shorter if I played it all on hard.\n\nCompleting the final championship unlocks the last track which I show in Practice mode.  Figured it would be a Mirrored snow track... The race does not go well.  The rc style car is pretty much not driveable on this terrain.  The games credits are then shown.\n\n00:00:00 Intro and Class league - Hummer\n00:27:20 Class League - Jeep\n00:51:10 Class League - Range Rover\n01:15:10 Class League - Chevy Truck\n01:39:35 Mixed League - King of the Hill Cup\n02:02:05 Mixed League - Speed Demon Cup\n02:23:05 Mixed League - Mud Runner Cup\n02:46:30 Mixed League - Dirt Racer Cup\n03:11:20 Mixed League - Power Challenge Cup\n03:34:30 Mixed League - Elite Cup\n02:57:40 Practice Mode with an unlocked car showing final track and credits. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QMNUsD_FfQw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QMNUsD_FfQw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QMNUsD_FfQw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [558] Test Drive Off-Road", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nTest Drive Off-Road was released by Accolade & Elite in 1997 and is the first off three spin off test Drive Games on the PlayStation and pc.\n\nI've longplayed a lot of racing games on various platforms, good and bad and I think this one takes the top spot for worst racing game.
