She tries to ask him what's going on, but he magically vanishes without saying a word and dumps her into the Country of Diamonds. Its major areas are the Castle of Diamonds, The Hatter Mansion, The Train Station and the Graveyard & Art Museum (which are right next to each other.) Alice is now in a new country but unlike her previous move from Heart to Clover, nobody here remembers who she is\u2014except for Nightmare.\n\nSuddenly characters like Nightmare and Ace are shotas, Dee & Dum are only in adult form and Vivaldi, Gowland and Pierce are missing in action. Additionally the castle of Diamonds is run by the queen of Diamonds, Crysta Snowpigeon and the new prime minister is now a black rabbit named Sidney Black. Over at the art museum & cemetery area is another mafia with a leader by the name of Jericho Bermuda who is a dodo bird. Alice has to figure out what the hell is going on and at the same time try to convince everyone to like her again. Unfortunately, unlike the country of Hearts, everyone's feelings towards her are as cold as a frozen diamond.", "summary": "5th Alice world otome game by Quin Rose.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/diamond-no-kuni-no-alice-wonderful-wonder-world", "videos": [{"id": 75418, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "Nm03EtotgAs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm03EtotgAs", "title": "Diamond no Kuni no Alice OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nm03EtotgAs/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
