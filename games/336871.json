King Scrotomus Maximus created a totalitarian society that values sexiness above all else. A strict society was formed, the highest levels of society are chosen for their outstanding beauty, whilst the lowest levels exist purely to create spaceships to kidnap humans and make Life Elixir for the higher levels, which they drink to live forever.\n\nYou are the highest-ranking officer in the Earth's military operation to destroy the Vampires from Uranus. The evil Vampire Pirates have been kidnapping humans to harvest our blood to make their precious Life Elixir. Their might is magnified by their collaboration with the Divine Sisters of the Mighty Moons, a powerful sisterhood of Witches from the moons of Uranus.\n\nYou must fight your way through 7 locations in ZetaZania to destroy the Transportation Factories, The Scientific Laboratories, The Department of Sexiness, The Divine Sisters of the Mighty Moons, The Sacred Few, The Queen's Palace and The King's Lair. Each location has new challenges and a monstrous boss.", "summary": "A 2D sci-fi action-adventure side-scrolling platformer, with a rich storyline, immersive music and retro-style pixellated graphics.
