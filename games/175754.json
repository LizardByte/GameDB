Guide the Vubu to the portals while keeping them away from traps and ledges. There's one catch - they all move in unison! Careful positioning is required and each Vubu type has its own unique traits.\nVubu is a logic puzzle game that involves sliding pieces together towards the goals. Each board or level is a small maze that floats in the sky and the pieces can be lost if they fall off the edge or land on a trap. Be sure to take advantage of each Vubu's special abilities. They can either help or get in the way.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vubu"}
