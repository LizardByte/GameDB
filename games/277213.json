Without provisions, the situation looks bleak. Mario eventually decides survival is paramount and decides to eat his dinosaur companion. It seems some asshole decided to make one last romhack and inflict it upon unsuspecting Super Mario World players. But as Mario savored what might have been his last meal, it becomes apparent that all is not well in the world. Earthquakes rumble and the seas roil.\n\nWhile Mario can't exactly count on Yoshi anymore, undoubtedly he can find another of the annoying creatures somewhere on the looming undiscovered country. Luigi has landed his green ass back in jail again for some reason, but maybe Mario can enlist his help beating this bullshit again.\n\nWith a little luck, a lot of patience, and a halfway decent controller, Mario can uncover the mysteries of this new land. Many hidden locations are bullshit, so you may want to write some things down so you remember it for later. Don't say I didn't warn you, now stop asking me to release already and play the damn game.\"", "summary": "Grand Poo World 3 is the final game in the Grand Poo World trilogy of Super Mario World ROM hacks created by Barbarian and dedicated to Twitch streamer Grand POOBear.
