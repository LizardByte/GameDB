It is almost an exact replica of sonic the hedgehog in stage formation and how the player attacks enemies. All the enemies are a random assortment of inanimate objects come to life as well as the players character being a volleyball. To attack enemies you can roll in a ball at them, but you must be going very fast. However if your going to slow you'll bounce off an enemy back to a standing position. The problem is you can't just jump on them, you must turn back into a ball in midair and land on them. The controls are very awkward and don't respond fast enough to attack oncoming enemies\n\nTips & Tricks:\nAll codes are to be entered on the Title Screen\n   - Invincibility and Infinite Time: Right, Left, L, R, Up, Down, B, B, then start.\n   - Round Select:  Up, Down, L, R, Right, Left, A, A, then start.\n   - Round Select and Invincibility and Infinite Time: Right, Left, L, R, Up, Down, X, Y, then start.\n   - View The Ending:  X, B, Y, A, Up, Down, Left, Right, then start.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jW8x5DaTeMs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jW8x5DaTeMs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jW8x5DaTeMs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Action Pachio (1993) Walkthrough No Commentary", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOdpYTR7DD8&t=16s\nPlayed by: TASVideosChannel\n\nThis game is a 2D scrolling platformer made for Super Famicom.
