His strength and will had disappeared as the time passed, turning him into and old and defenseless being.\n\nHowever, that didn't change the fact that within him the incredible power that allowed him to create that other world still existed. Because of that he was attacked by an entity called Final: A powerful creature that emerged from the infinite chaos that exists in the space between both worlds. In a single attack he ripped the king's heart and ran away with it to the depths of chaos.\n\nIt is said that the one that succeeds at freeing the power within the heart will be given an extraordinary strength; a power that could end all that exists if it falls into the wrong hands.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-black-heart", "videos": [{"id": 59794, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "zCQfu3akVBc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCQfu3akVBc", "title": "The Black Heart (PC) - ANANZI STORY MODE - Chapter 5 - Playthrough Gameplay Longplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zCQfu3akVBc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
