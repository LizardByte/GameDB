Once the boulder is coupled, the player must move the ship toward a neutron star in the left edge of the screen. The neutron star exerts a magnetic force which will draw the ship into it. The ship must be moved carefully as it displays momentum. If the ship is drawn by the neutron star, it will be destroyed. Once close enough, the boulder can be released (by pressing the action button) and it will be drawn into the neutron star. The boulders can also be destroyed with rockets launched by the ship, but they are only available while the ship is not carrying any boulders.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neutron-star"}
