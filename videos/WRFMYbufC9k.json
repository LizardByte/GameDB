When the Pope arrives on a mission to sway the non-believers towards his pious ways, he is perturbed by the city\u2019s lack of faith. Thus, aided by his cardinals, he decides to sift the righteous from the lost. To keep the residents in check, he erects a powerful magical dome, preventing all who try to flee.
