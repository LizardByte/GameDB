A solar flare has knocked out communications. You awake on Mars, presumably knocked out and memory erased by the flare. You are still alive, protected by the elevator you were in at the time of the flare (technically called a Coronal Mass Ejection). This event was far bigger than the Carrington event that happened centuries ago. Humanity colonized the solar system, but has retreated back to Earth due to the flare. Missions: re-establish contact with humanity, save the Earth, and help humanity get back out into the solar system! The Quivakons are a friendly alien race we are working with, and they have provided quizzes, puzzles, races and other challenges throughout the solar system to help you gain further abilities.", "summary": "Planetary Settlers is a family friendly game with real benefits!
