This lingering disease is a formidable opponent and we all have to be aware that it is going to stay with us for a little while before a vaccine is developed. This brings us to the topic at hand as Jujubee would like to declare its participation in fighting this coronavirus head-on. We've decided that 20% of all our net Steam sales throughout the month of May and June will be donated to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and other charitable foundations supporting the fight against the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBy supporting us, you are supporting the development of the vaccine that we all desperately need, and for that - we thank you!\n\nStay safe everyone and let's win this battle against this invisible enemy!\n\nGAME DESCRIPTION:\n\nHere at Jujubee, we\u2019ve always thought that games should address current and serious topics. In the case of our historical-documentary game KURSK we touched on the subject of the Russian submarine tragedy and to what end an arms race could lead to, in Deep Diving Simulator we focused on issues related to the ecology and protection of our underwater world, and Realpolitiks tackles the problem of terrorism and migrations. In COVID: The Outbreak we allow the players to face the most current and touching topic of all - a pandemic of a dangerous virus. \n\nAs the leader of the Global Health Organization (GHO) your task is to contain the spread of a coronavirus and save humanity before it is too late. \n\nIn addition to crisis management, the game provides the players with information on how to behave in the event of an epidemic, what actions to take, and how to protect themselves and their loved ones in the most effective way. The game is based on the data published by WHO and on the information acquired from experts and consultants.\n\n(C) 2020, JUJUBEE S.A. | http://jujubee.pl", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cb90KQv2ls/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cb90KQv2ls/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cb90KQv2ls/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "COVID: The Outbreak | Real-time strategy game by Jujubee.
