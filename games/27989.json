The players only means of defense in the game is the use of magical spells that the player can acquire during game play (by picking the power up).\n\nPlayers start with a single shooting ball of energy that can be charged to fire one powerful shot, but players can also acquire a spiritual flame that can be pointed in straight and diagonal directions and when charged can reach good distances and a spherical power that launches ricocheting spheres around the screen that multiply when fully charged.\n\nAside from these powers, players can also use a screen-clearing power that summons a three-headed dragon that destroys all enemies and fired shots on screen.\n\nThe game is a port of the Japanese game Kujaku-ou II, removing the anime license.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mystic-defender", "videos": [{"id": 117265, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rxebrKODM8I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxebrKODM8I", "title": "Mega Drive Longplay [267] Mystic Defender", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rxebrKODM8I/sddefault.jpg"}]}
