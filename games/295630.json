There's still plenty to appreciate, like living down by the beach, having a dad that loves you, and being across the street from the best neighbor on the block.\n\nMy Neighbor Enide is a short light horror-themed RPG game. This game is dialogue heavy, and plays out more like a visual novel with light RPG elements.\n\nThe game takes about 40 minutes to 1 hour to complete. There are two endings: One normal ending and one true ending.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-neighbor-enide"}
