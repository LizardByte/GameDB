Players control their own ant colony through real, professional program code and learn to overcome various challenges. These include collecting sugar and apples, defending the anthill and overcoming attacks from natural enemies such as bugs. Since AntMe! works with a real programming language (currently C# and Visual Basic) right from the start, the knowledge gained can be transferred directly to your own projects. The game is based on scientific principles and is used successfully in schools and universities.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/antme", "videos": [{"id": 135037, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "0RZXuoWKLxk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RZXuoWKLxk", "title": "AntMe! 1.7 - Die Ameisensimulation (Official Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0RZXuoWKLxk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
