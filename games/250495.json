For those that still wish to live on this dead land, a temple was established. It was known as Saint Sheol of the Underworld.\n\nWith the help of a distant relative, I moved to the capital that I had longed to live in, and began work as a trainee priest at Saint Sheol.\n\nEvery day I endured pain and suffering in this unfamiliar land.

I knew the face of that angel.\n\nBefore the looming disaster stood 6 girls.
