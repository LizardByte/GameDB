{"id": "uUbViM8LRYQ", "snippet": {"title": "Oh... Sir! Prototype - PC Gameplay (Steam)", "description": "This is the original version of Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator that was made for a 42-hour game jam. Not only it looks and sounds different from the full version, the win/defeat banter is also different. Both the prototype and full version obviously pay homage to the classic parrot sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus. In the full version, if the complaining player wins, the dialouge is still intact, though with a small error in grammar. But if the shop keeper wins, his dialogue is VERY different. In the full version, this exchange is as follows:\n\n\"You're clearly not a parrot expert. I can assure you, I am qualified to assess his mood.\"\n\"I'm sorry, you were right all along. He's probably just pining for the fjords.\"\n\nIn this prototype, he tells the complainer to go to \"his brother's shop.\"\n\nRegardless of which version you prefer, it's still as silly as the final product.\n\nOh...
