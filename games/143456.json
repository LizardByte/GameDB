Instead, he got the nanobots. Although the bots were designed to solve problems as a team, all their trial runs seem to end with the sound of tiny metallic fists meeting tiny metallic torsos. It\u2019s enough to make even the most laid-back hippie want to tear out his dreadlocks. Now, with the evil Professor Killfun threatening to give him a failing grade, Groovy Greg has almost given up on his experiment. Little does he know that his beloved bots are about to meet an even bigger challenge than they had been programmed for... Nanobots is a classic-style point and click adventure game that lets you take control of Hotbot, Brainbot, Tallbot, Audbot, Strongbot, and Chembot as they race to save themselves from being turned into scrap metal. Can they make use of their surroundings, fashion an escape plan, and avoid coming face-to-fist with Professor Killfun? Only if they give peace a chance."}
