River Raid was a popular game on the Atari 2600, and with the resurgence of older video game properties in the mid 1990s, Activision decided to capitalize. They had sequels to games like Kaboom, River Raid and Pitfall in development for the SNES, but only Pitfall actually made it out. This game was shown at the 1993 Summer CES, and covered in the EGM 1994 Video Game Preview Guide.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/river-raid-mission-of-no-return"}
