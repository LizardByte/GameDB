The project is inspired by Arsinikk and NinjaDelphox's Line Massacre Series and is the sequel to 100 Line Christmas. It uses the new Doom Christmas Enhanced resource pack with some new additions specific to the project.\n\nAs the 200 in the title suggests, each map was limited to 200 lines at most. Each mapper was asked to add some kind of friction in their maps (Either slippery ice or heavy snow). In addition, each map has a hidden runaway gnome for you to grab (replacing the item count)!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/200-line-christmas-snowy-slaughter"}
