Your task is not an easy one - you will have to struggle with time, catch quotas, migration of crabs, and, most importantly, with the sea itself. This is your destiny in the waters of Alaska!\n\nYour ship will be in the same conditions as any ship sailing out of Dutch Harbor every autumn in the hope that the deep sea will bestow its treasures on it. He will be afloat in any weather - like a breeze, a strong wind and even a storm - you don't care. The restless sea, the soaking wet deck, the ship swaying on the waves - you can handle everything!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-of-deadliest-catch"}
