Each card depicts a type of wrestling move, such as a suplex or clothesline, and the player can use them to counter and overpower their opponent. The game's story mode(s) plays out like a board game with occasional bouts.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zen-nihon-pro-wrestling-fight-da-pon"}
