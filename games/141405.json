It requires a Boom-compatible source port to play, although MAP32: Sodding Death will not run in Boom itself due to passing the 32,768 seg limit, and MAP24: The Mucus Flow cannot be completed in Boom as the result of a design flaw. It is the first sequel to Community Chest. It was also first released prematurely, before it was re-released in complete form. It was one of the winners of Doomworld's Cacowards in 2004, and was followed by another sequel, Community Chest 3, in 2007. The third sequel, Community Chest 4, was released in 2012.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
