Throughout your adventure you'll be doing puzzles, platforming, exploring and much more. Together with plenty of wacky characters, help these three unlikely friends escape the alien lab!\n\nI'm a 15 year old solo developer from Sweden, and this is my passion project I've been working on for about 1.5 years. It's a very personal game, with almost every tiny detail having its own little story to tell.
