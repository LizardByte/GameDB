He was then stuck in Arkham Asylum surrounded by common criminals, with all the time in the world and nothing to do but confront his failure. Faced with a long list of demons to overcome, Wilson quietly disappeared to train and meditate. After months of work, Deathstroke realized he had nothing to prove \u2013 that is, until Brainiac invaded Earth. So, when Amanda Waller approached him with a blank check to cut the invasion off at its head, Deathstroke didn\u2019t need to be asked twice.\nIn every dimension that the Squad have chased Brainiac to so far, he has already taken control of the Elseworld and terraformed it into his twisted vision, but something is different this time. Task Force X are catching up to Brainiac\u2019s interdimensional conquest, and it looks like he\u2019s only just arrived at this new Elseworld. This Elseworld completely reconceives Superman\u2019s hometown of Smallville as a medieval village, completely stripped of the advanced technology that empowers the modern day Justice League. While the rest of the Squad may not think much of this Elseworld, preferring Jetpacks and explosives to swords and lances, it seems like Deathstroke has been busy making a name for himself in this land of chivalry and swordsmanship.", "summary": "Season 4 of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League delivers the final content updates for the game, bringing exciting new features and enhancements.
