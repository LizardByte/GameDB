Each peablin has 1 to 6 hands each; when two peablins are adjacent to each other, they join hands. If all hands of a peablin are joined, the peablin is happy. \n \nBut there are other kinds of peablins -- some can move their hands, some cannot; some cannot be moved at all; some are only happy if they have no neighbors, while others scare adjacent peablins. The game contains over 150 boards, with all kinds of shapes and restrictions. The goal of the game is to place the peablins so all their hands are joined (if possible, collecting stars in the process).", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/joining-hands"}
