Or did you make the common mistake of knocking an entire bottle of wine over their lap? Or go the whole hog and set fire to the table several times?\n\nRecreating disastrous dates the world over, Curve Digital and Echo Chamber Games are proud to announce their new first-person dating game, Table Manners, will hit PC early next year, giving us all the chance to experience some potentially calamitous courtship.\n\nThis tongue-in-cheek experience charges people with taking charge of a would-be romantic eager for love. The only problem is, said suitor is a disembodied hand with a knack for catastrophe! Players will be thrust into the most awkward dinner date they\u2019ve (hopefully) ever been a part of, where every act - from eating your burger to pouring your date a glass of red - is utterly fraught with danger and hilarity.\n\nAttendees at Twitchcon (27th - 29th September) this weekend will be able to go hands-on with an early version of Table Manners. If you are heading to the show simply head  to booth #1361 (adjacent to the Streamer Workshop on the showfloor) where the development team will be on hand to showcase the game.\n\n---\n\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CurveDigital\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CurveDigital\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/curvedigital", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FNmcUUGJ8Lo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FNmcUUGJ8Lo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FNmcUUGJ8Lo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FNmcUUGJ8Lo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FNmcUUGJ8Lo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Table Manners | Steam Announcement Trailer", "description": "Add Table Manners to your Steam Wishlist: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1019450/Table_Manners/\nSubscribe now for more news and updates: https://bit.ly/2AMyqSx\n\n---\n\nEver landed a date with the person of your dreams, only to accidentally throw their meal across their face?
