Both are expansionist governments, and their border clashes are almost constant.\n\nWithin the Empire, the greatest power, after the Emperor himself, are the MegaCorporations, financial associations that control each and every aspect of the lives of the citizens. With the power of life and death, these Mega-Corps, as they are familiarly called, spread their tentacles throughout the Cosmos in search of riches to extract or, if necessary, to snatch.\n\nThe federative system consists in the \"adoption\" under their tutelage of planetary systems, generally technologically poor, although rich in materials or manpower, which are invariably used to improve the resources of the original Hark planets.\n\nFaithful reflection of the errors of all the financial-political systems of history, Empire and Federation stand as possessors of the universe. Utopia does not exist.\n\nAs an executive of a MEGACORP, you must guide your operative agent to take control of the situation on the planet GEA-3.You must, by helping the rebel groups, overthrow the government, currently in the hands of \"The Federation\".\nYour ship will land in the wooded area surrounding the rebel base.Cross the lake, pass the police checkpoint and meet your liaison who will identify himself as a fur trader, from here on follow his instructions.\n\nThe mission is risky but the reward is great, if you manage to bring GEA-3 into Imperial power, the reward will make you immensely rich.", "summary": "A conversational adventure, created with the Graphic Adventure Creator, which was the first one published by Dinamic Software, under the Aventuras Dinamic (AD) label.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-corp"}
