You need to place the colored cubes in a harmonious way in the gradient. The locked cubes are not moveable and they will be your guide. It seems that it is a piece of cake, right? Well, the beginning levels are really easy to pass, but on the other hand, when the number of locked cubes and the number of colorful cubes increase, the game becomes more interesting and challenging. 377 levels will challenge your logic and sense of color.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hue-2"}
