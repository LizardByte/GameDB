Like the regular Mario's Cement Factory which was part of the \"New Wide Screen\"\" series this was released in 1983 with this unit actually being released slightly before the \"New Wide Screen\" one.  Emulation was provided by Algestam and co.\n\nI find this to be one of the most curious releases.  While it had a Table Top release, it didn't see a Panorama release, when usually they went hand-in-hand.  It's also a significantly different game to the \"New Wide Screen\" version, using the more advanced CPU type which allowed for better sound.  The gameplay is also a little different here - no longer do the cement blocks slide across in boxes, instead the cement drops from pipes.  There's also an additional place to wait for a lift to go down if you're about to get squashed against the ceiling, this was removed in the \"New Wide Screen\" version.  A later version of this Table Top also exists with the start game jingle changed because it was deemed to sound too close to Queen's \"Another One Bites The Dust\"\n\nGame & Watch artwork for MAME was done by DarthMarino (more recently emulated units) and hydef (units emulated before 2020)\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1vl9O-0jIGCHHY_lrWpOwBtqTXEKsVGOY  DarthMarino \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WLKcvynl0ky2mRL1UacA9yaiMTnNs4x5 hydef", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aSGckGXcW_U/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aSGckGXcW_U/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aSGckGXcW_U/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aSGckGXcW_U/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Game & Watch - Mario's Cement Factory (Table Top) (c)1983 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "description": "This is the Table Top release of Mario's Cement Factory, part of the Game & Watch series from Nintendo.
