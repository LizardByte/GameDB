It is based around a stage magic theme, and includes many images of rabbits and top hats. \n \nThree modes are available. Quick Quiz displays randomly-generated arithmetic questions and the player is scored by correct answers. Comp Quiz allows the user to customize several quiz options, such as enable time limits, choose whether to complete answers or missing numbers, and select custom or randomly-generated questions. Electroflash is similar to Comp Quiz but all of the questions include a specific number and arithmetic operation, chosen by the user. \n \nAfter each quiz, the player can choose to repeat the same quiz, generate a new quiz with the same options, select a new quiz type, or quit.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/number-magic"}
