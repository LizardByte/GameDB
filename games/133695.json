After choosing one of the 8 races (Human, High Elf, Dwarf, Bearan, Orc, Undead, Infernal Demon, Minotaur) and a class corresponding to the chosen race (Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Priest, Ranger, Druid Witch, Pirate, Assassin, Necromancer), the players will be taken to the world of Aragon where two factions \u201cThe Sacred order\u201d and \u201cThe Domination\u201d are in a constant battle between each other. The players would be able to do whatever and go wherever they please because of the open-world model. The main goal of the players will be making their way to level 50 doing quest-like content, Dungeons, and Raids along the way. Scars of Honor will be heavily social and almost everything will require a party of more than one person to complete. The Dungeon mechanics will be scaling with the player's level, changing every 10 levels, so this way the players will have to return to previous zones and there won\u2019t be any useless content.\nSome of the features the game will have are an Active Weather system, Character housing, and personal address, Bounty hunts, Massive-scale wars, Guild wars and questing, and many more.\nThe community of the game is also heavily involved in the making as the slogan of the game says \u201cFROM the Community, FOR the Community!\u201d\nA true example of an MMORPG project that brings the player\u2019s ideas and dreams to life.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scars-of-honor", "videos": [{"id": 44717, "name": "Character reveal 360-degree", "video_id": "jWx4TRGUmyU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWx4TRGUmyU", "title": "Scars of Honor: Human Male character reveal in 360-degree", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jWx4TRGUmyU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
