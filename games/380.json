Liquid Ocelot, a fusion of the consciousness of Liquid Snake and the body of Revolver Ocelot, is once again set on world domination. Solid Snake, now also referred to a Old Snake due to his advanced accelerated ageing, is dispatched to assassinate Liquid Ocelot as a personal favor to Roy Campbell.", "summary": "Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is the final canonical Metal Gear game to feature Solid Snake as the main character. The gameplay of the previous games have been kept along with some new features, such as the ability to roll on your back and also to hide in bins scattered around the environment. Most of the story and the relationship between the characters are explained through cut-scenes with a considerable length, so knowledge of the prior games is recommended to fully understand the story. The game also features a complex multiplayer mode entitled Metal Gear Online with some original missions based on the stealth aspects of the single-player games.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots", "videos": [{"id": 70608, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RRDc68wpbIQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRDc68wpbIQ", "title": "METAL GEAR SOLID 4 trailer E3 2006", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RRDc68wpbIQ/sddefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 4445, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 3620, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gcfonqqir7kwd4bq9yld.jpg"}, "name": "Beast", "species": 5}, {"id": 1603, "name": "Ed"}, {"id": 5117, "name": "Rosemary"}, {"id": 5122, "name": "Vamp"}, {"id": 5129, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 4025, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm33t.jpg"}, "name": "Mei Ling", "species": 1}, {"id": 5116, "name": "Otacon"}, {"id": 5404, "name": "Werewolf - Narrator"}, {"id": 5381, "name": "Screaming Mantis"}, {"id": 5384, "name": "Raging Raven"}, {"id": 5406, "name": "Ocean of Gossip - Co-Host"}, {"id": 5390, "name": "Little John"}, {"id": 5382, "name": "Crying Wolf"}, {"id": 5393, "name": "Bomb Shelter Buffet - Audience Member"}, {"id": 5396, "name": "Pieuvre Armement - Narrator"}, {"id": 5403, "name": "Ravensword - Enforcer"}, {"id": 5378, "name": "Old Snake"}, {"id": 5383, "name": "Laughing Octopus"}, {"id": 5385, "name": "Drebin 893"}, {"id": 5392, "name": "Bomb Shelter Buffet - Rachel"}, {"id": 5394, "name": "Otselotovvaya Kvatka - Cyborg A"}, {"id": 5405, "name": "Ocean of Gossip - Host"}, {"id": 5407, "name": "7th Circle - Host"}, {"id": 5379, "name": "Liquid Ocelot"}, {"id": 5391, "name": "Bomb Shelter Buffet - Chef"}, {"id": 5395, "name": "Otselotovvaya Kvatka - Cyborg B"}, {"id": 5397, "name": "Pieuvre Armement - Swimmer A"}, {"id": 5414, "name": "Body of Armor - Athlete A"}, {"id": 5417, "name": "Body of Armor - Athlete D"}, {"id": 5419, "name": "Body of Armor - Satisfied Customer B"}, {"id": 5398, "name": "Pieuvre Armement - Swimmer B"}, {"id": 5410, "name": "7th Circle - Melissa"}, {"id": 5412, "name": "Celebrity Moralist - Himself"}, {"id": 5416, "name": "Body of Armor - Athlete C"}, {"id": 5401, "name": "Praying Mantis - Stunts"}, {"id": 5409, "name": "7th Circle - Avatar"}, {"id": 5402, "name": "Praying Mantis - Narrator"}, {"id": 5411, "name": "Celebrity Moralist - Host"}, {"id": 5413, "name": "Body of Armor - The Sarge"}, {"id": 5415, "name": "Body of Armor - Athlete B"}, {"id": 5418, "name": "Body of Armor - Satisfied Customer A"}, {"id": 5355, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 4022, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm33q.jpg"}, "name": "Naomi Hunter", "species": 1}, {"id": 5357, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 4024, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm33s.jpg"}, "name": "Roy Campbell", "species": 1}, {"id": 5399, "name": "Pieuvre Armement - Swimmer C"}, {"id": 5400, "name": "Praying Mantis - Biker"}, {"id": 5408, "name": "7th Circle - Larry"}, {"id": 5354, "gender": 1, "mug_shot": {"id": 4020, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm33o.jpg"}, "name": "Meryl Silverburgh", "species": 1}, {"id": 5386, "name": "Johnny (Akiba)"}, {"id": 4368, "name": "Raiden"}, {"id": 5380, "name": "EVA"}, {"id": 5388, "name": "Jonathan"}, {"id": 5387, "name": "Sunny"}, {"id": 5360, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 4028, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm33w.jpg"}, "name": "Revolver Ocelot", "species": 1}, {"id": 5389, "gender": 0, "mug_shot": {"id": 4107, "url": "//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cm363.jpg"}, "name": "Big Boss", "species": 1}, {"id": 2140, "name": "Soldier"}]}
