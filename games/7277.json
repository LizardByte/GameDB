After her father and Gio, the leader of Arland, discussed the merging of the two lands, she met Totori, the now-graduated alchemist. Dazzled by the power of alchemy, and with a desire to help her country prosper, she forced herself on Totori as her first student. Her father initially disapproves of this decision, but agrees following a suggestion from Rufus. He gives Meruru a directive to use her alchemy to improve the kingdom, with several intermediate goals which must be met within specific time periods in order to be allowed to continue her alchemy work. Later, Rorona joins the two, but she has been turned into a child by Astrid after drinking an experimental potion of youth.", "summary": "Atelier Meruru: The Apprentice of Arland is a Japanese role-playing video game developed by Gust. It is the third and final game in the Arland series and a direct sequel to Atelier Totori: The Adventurer of Arland. The game features a turn-based battle system. Battles are based on the idea that the princess, Meruru, is the leader and those accompanying her are considered \"escorts.\" Meruru can use items in battle and depending on the conditions in battle, her escorts can chain attacks and the power of the items can be increased.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/atelier-meruru-the-apprentice-of-arland", "videos": [{"id": 10991, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "LDjngttYkas", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDjngttYkas", "title": "Atelier Meruru\u2122: The Apprentice of Arland Prologue English Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LDjngttYkas/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 10992, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Wb5O_xvUHm4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb5O_xvUHm4", "title": "Atelier Meruru: The Apprentice of Arland Official English Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wb5O_xvUHm4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
