Not only does it run in a lower resolution, but the art style is very inconsistent between sprites and backgrounds as well.\n\nOnce again one male and one female character are used as protagonists, but this time they have equal abilities and only differ in their looks. Instead of grabbing powerups directly, the two gather money by defeating enemies, which is used to buy weapons and ammunition in a shop between stages.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/toppy-and-rappy"}
