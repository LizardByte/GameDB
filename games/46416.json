The setup is that a brother and sister pair is arguing about what would make the best Marky Mark video. Since they can not agree, they enlist help from some other people: A boxer and his trainer, a trio of teenage girls, the members of a garage band, and their parents. Each group has their ideas about what an ideal Marky Mark video should or should not contain. The specifications normally come in the form of a set of pictures they either do or don't want to see, and perhaps some effects. The game has three Marky Mark videos from which to choose: \"Good Vibrations\", \"I Need Money\", and \"You Gotta Believe\".", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marky-mark-and-the-funky-bunch-make-my-video"}
