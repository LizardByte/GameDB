You own a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, 3 workers\u2026and the dream of owning the best winery in Italy.\nYour job is to allocate your workers and helpful visitors to complete various tasks throughout the year. Each season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There\u2019s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to arrive at each one has an advantage over the rest.\nUsing those workers and visitors, you can expand your vineyard by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders as you work towards the goal of owning the most successful winery in Tuscany."}
