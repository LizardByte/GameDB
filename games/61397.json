Even if you can't relate to the game storyline, you will still get a good experience. The storyline is presented with short monologues, displaying the thoughts of the player, as you need to perform certain tasks to proceed in the game to continue discover new clues about what's going on.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 39406, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "aU0HFY8rA3w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU0HFY8rA3w", "title": "One Late Night - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aU0HFY8rA3w/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
