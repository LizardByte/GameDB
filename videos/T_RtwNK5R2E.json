That game only appeared on arcades but it's just the original Ridge Racer with some new options and music. Ridge Racer Revolution only takes the music from that game and the rest is 100% original. It consists on 3 circuits that share the starting/finish line, and of course there is the mirror mode with increased difficulty and Time Trials were you race against the bosses. This game isn't too well considered between the fans of the series, most probably because of the new controls, that made drifting quite a bit punishing.\n\nWhile the recording is a bit smoother than the previous Ridge Racer, there are some slowdowns here and there because of some emulator issues (I should have checked others before recording :/), aside from that, there aren't any big problems. The walkthrough consists on 9 races, the 3 original circuits, the mirror versions and 3 time Time Trials so you can see the bosses.\n\n03:21 Novice - Drive U 2 Dancing\n\n07:52 Intermediate - Rotterdam Nation 94\n\n14:07 Expert - Over the Highway\n\n22:38 Intermediate Mirror - Dat Dan Day\n\n27:42 Expert Mirror - Grip\n\n32:48 Novice Mirror - Feeling Over Remix\n\n39:59 Novice Mirror (against 13th car/ Black Lamborgini) - Maximum Zone \n\n44:41 Intermediate Mirror (against the Devil Kid/Racing Kid) - Rare Hero 2 \n\n49:47 Expert Mirror (against White Angel with the other \"lord of techno\" ^^U) - Lords of Techno -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_RtwNK5R2E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_RtwNK5R2E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T_RtwNK5R2E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [052] Ridge Racer Revolution", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed By: Deskawa\n\nThis game is the continuation of the series on PSX but it isn't Ridge Racer 2.
