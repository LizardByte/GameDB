The experience of holding a racket and hitting a ball -- so difficult to capture on a TV screen in the past -- has been fully realized in VR. The movement, rotation, angle, friction, and bounce of the racket and ball are fully simulated, and you can even freely perform things like topspin and slices, which cause the ball to spin.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dream-match-tennis-vr"}
