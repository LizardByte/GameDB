This recording was captured from an S-Video feed off of a Pentium 200mhz MMX running Windows 3.11. This was not done in DosBox nor any virtual machines.\n\nTerror TRAX, a vampire themed FMV PC game, is one of the more entertaining (barely interactive) interactive movies to come out of the mid 1990s. Featuring lots of CG, questionable makeup, and a shaky handicam viewpoint that would make Blair Witch jealous, Officers Graves and Walkin have to hunt down a vampire and a succubus after responding to some X-Files style 911 phone calls. The plot is pretty stupid, involving a vampire  that runs a dating agency and an executed death-row inmate who has come back from the dead looking for his organs that were donated to people in need, but it makes for an enjoyable short-lived romp. It's no worse than Night Trap, but that doesn't really mean too much. \n\nDetective Graves is pretty damned hilarious, I have to admit, especially when noting the lack of \"road pizza\" after someone flings themselves out of a window, or when referring to a smoldering ashtray as \"Sizzlin' Cs\". I mean, come on! Who in the hell wrote this?!\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly simple: every so often a choice needs to be made, prompting the player to hit either A or B. That's about it. Hope you enjoy watching it!\n___________________________\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jonldpee0RY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jonldpee0RY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jonldpee0RY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Terror T.R.A.X.: Track of the Vampire (1995) PC Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A beginning to end playthrough of Grolier Interactive's 1995 Windows 3.1 interactive movie, Terror T.R.A.X.: Track of the Vampire.
