Developed by WayForward and published physically by Limited Run Games, this Switch-exclusive one- or two-player action title will deliver thrills, laughs, and varied gameplay unlike anything else on the system.\n\nIn Vitamin Connection, players assume the roles of Vita-Boy and Mina-Girl and take control of the minuscule Capsule Ship to battle evil bacteria from within living organisms. By blasting subatomic foes with your Vitamin Beam, utilizing a special claw tool, and navigating maze-like stages, you\u2019ll save the members of the Sable family \u2014 including the dog! \u2014 from a variety of hazardous and increasingly wacky predicaments. Each level also includes sub-games featuring rhythm challenges, Pong-like reflex tests, and more.\n\nWhile the entire game can be played solo, Vitamin Connection also features an innovative, asymmetrical local two-player co-op mode, in which one player controls the Capsule Ship\u2019s movement and shooting, while the other handles the ship\u2019s rotation and aiming. Coordination and a connection between players are essential for success!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 37761, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "y6AyHYkos5E"}]}
