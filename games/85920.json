Driving a souped-up F40, your objective is to scour the streets of Miami, locate and destroy the red cars driven by the criminals. Once all the red cars are eliminated, the exit to the current level will open, allowing you to confront the yellow car-driving crime lord. However, you must be cautious, as reckless driving near other police cars will result in being stopped, costing you valuable time. Using the city map, you must navigate the streets, destroy the criminal elements, and complete your mission within the tight 48-hour deadline.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/miami-chase"}
