ASA is a first-person slideshow adventure game (point 'n click) reminiscent of famous games such as the Myst and Rhem series. Visit a vast spaceship called The Ark, divided into several areas, and discover the truth behind the Cubes and their creators...\nYou'll probably need a pen and a paper to write down your notes in order to solve the challenging puzzles! This game can be very difficult for people who are not familiar with the genre.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/asa-a-space-adventure-remastered-edition"}
