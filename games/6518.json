At once, Chip, Dale, Gadget, Monterey Jack, and Zipper set off to defuse the explosive before it goes off. While there, they manage to corner the rabbit responsible for setting the bomb, who admits that it was Fat Cat who ordered him to do it (having broken out of prison the night before) so he can steal a relic called the Urn of the Pharaoh from a docked cargo ship.\n\nThe Rangers give chase to the docks. After a search of the ship turns up nothing, Zipper then spots Fat Cat running into a warehouse. Chip and Dale follow him inside, but are ambushed and locked in a refrigerator to freeze. Though the chipmunks escape in time, Fat Cat opens the Urn and releases the evil spirits contained within it.", "summary": "Chip and Dale, those tiny but daring detectives, have learned of some terrifying news: The notorious criminal cat has escaped from prison and he's stolen the Urn of the Pharaoh.

Join Chip and Dale and the rest of the Rangers in their wacky new adventure. Help them explore the dangerous levels of the downtown restaurant and meet the exploding personality of Water Rabbit. Aid them on their escape through the freezing floors of the giant refrigerator.
