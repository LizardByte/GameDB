It is based on a Japanese manga set during a historical Chinese civil war. The player controls a protagonist via a series of menus in order to solve a series of puzzles. \n \nThe game, and the manga it is based on, depict a period of ancient Chinese history between the Qin and Han dynasties, a few decades before the Three Kingdoms era began. As expected of a transitional period, there was plenty of intrigue and conflict leading up to the change of power that future novels and mangas could draw from."}
