He was sent to the City States of Jowston with a mission: the Security Force has been informed that one of the 27 True Runes has appeared in Jowston. He has to verify the rumor and to bring back as much information as possible. On the way, Nash meets a mysterious woman named Sierra and soon gets involved in a large conflict featuring characters and events from the first and second Suikoden games.\n\nUnlike the \"mainstream\" Suikoden games, this is not a RPG, but a \"digital novel\". You read text and watch background images, at some points making a decision and leading the story to different paths.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/genso-suikogaiden-volume-1-swordsman-of-harmonia"}
