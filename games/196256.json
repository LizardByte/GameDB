It started in 2019 as a restoration of graphics, songs, and voice clips from the Japanese version and unused soundtrack. In 2021, development resumed with the inclusion of a retranslated script and several new features. The amount of work put on this is now comparable to what's been done in X6 Tweaks. And even though there isn't (and there won't be) a patching tool, there are a few customization options.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 66236, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "0GhzDLad33Y"}]}
