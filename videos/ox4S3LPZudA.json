{"id": "ox4S3LPZudA", "snippet": {"title": "DCS World", "description": "Digital Combat Simulator World (DCS World) is a free-to-play digital battlefield game, focusing on a military aircraft simulation. It includes a FREE Su-25T attack aircraft and it is extensible through additional DCS modules as well as user-made add-ons and mods.\n\nDCS World includes a vast mission area of the Caucasus region that encompasses much of Georgia - the location of the 2008 conflict. Additionally, DCS World includes:\n\n\u2022 Powerful mission and campaign editors\n\u2022 Multiplayer\n\u2022 Massive inventory of air, land and sea combat units and weapons\n\u2022 Advanced AI\n\u2022 Fast mission generator\n\u2022 Dynamic weather and seasons\n\u2022 Training missions\n\u2022 Mission replay system\n\u2022 Pilot log book\n\nThis all allows the creation of engaging, real-world combat missions in this flashpoint region. DCS is a true \"sandbox\" simulation that can and will cover multiple time periods covering many types of combat and civilian units. DCS World allows both realistic game play and more relaxed game play to suit the player.\n\nDCS modules that can plug into DCS World can include aircraft, maps, ground units, campaigns, etc. Not only can DCS World include modules developed internally by Eagle Dynamics, but it can also include those by certified third party developers. The first third party aircraft will be the UH-1H Huey.\n\nDCS World includes a FREE Su-25T \"Frogfoot\" attack aircraft!\n\nOther modules that can be purchased for DCS World include:\n\nDCS: A-10C Warthog. Warthog brings the most realistic PC simulation of a modern fixed wing combat aircraft in regards to flight dynamics, avionics, sensors, and weapon systems. Warthog is considered by many to be the current bench mark of PC flight simulation.\n\nDCS: Ka-50 Black Shark 2. The Ka-50 \"Black Shark\" is a unique and deadly single-seat, Russian attack helicopter that has seen combat in the Northern Caucasus. It combines a high performance dual rotor system with a deadly weapons payload of guided missiles, rockets, bombs, and a 30mm cannon. \n\nDCS: P-51D Mustang. The most realistic simulation ever done of this legendary World War 2 ear fighter.\n\nDCS: Combined Arms. DCS: Combined Arms gives you control of ground forces during the battle. Use the Command Map to move ground forces, set artillery fire missions, and control the ground battle. Assume the role of a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) in multiplayer and designate targets for player-controlled close air support aircraft, or directly control armor vehicles or air defense weapons and engage the enemy.\n\nAll DCS modules can be purchased from: http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/index.php?end_pos=136&scr=products&lang=en", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ox4S3LPZudA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ox4S3LPZudA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ox4S3LPZudA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ox4S3LPZudA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ox4S3LPZudA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DCS World", "description": "Digital Combat Simulator World (DCS World) is a free-to-play digital battlefield game, focusing on a military aircraft simulation.
