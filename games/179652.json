The games are designed to explore some of the elements of the experience, without naming any specifics of place or time or name. The games are intentionally simple, designed to mimic old-school 8bit games, and in many ways are a mirror of my earlier game c ya laterrrr, but depicted in a much more focused and stylised manner.\n\nEach game is no more than ten seconds or so in length, with a total gameplay time of around 3-4 minutes.\n\nThis project has been commissioned for the 2018 Now Play This experimental games event as part of London Games Festival , and is displayed in a custom-built arcade cabinet deployed at the event at Somerset House in London, and will hopefully be touring to other games events. This version is identical and hosted online, to allow players to try it out without making it to the event.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-loss-levels"}
