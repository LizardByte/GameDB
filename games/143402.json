As the last remaining employee on a corporate-owned earth colony, it\u2019s up to you to salvage the remains of the planet\u2019s economy following a disastrous management mishap. With dozens of trains at your disposal, it\u2019s up to you to manage the production of goods and ensure the delivery of essential resources in order to create a thriving industrial colony once more.\n\nIn a near-future, corporations have transformed distant planets into industrial colonies, harvesting their resources for commercial gain. Your employer, Nakatani Chemicals, has lost control of one colony following a complete economic collapse - so it\u2019s now up to you to salvage what\u2019s left using retrofitted train transport.\n\nBuild tracks, buy trains and transport the required cargo to reach your goal. Develop a truly successful transport economy by creating the most efficient system possible, and perhaps what\u2019s left of the colony, and your career, will be restored.\n\nWith simple construction tools it\u2019s easy to jump in and start building a busy railway delivery system. Carefully consider the placement of tracks to overcome mountains, canyons or other challenging terrain, and create the fastest, or most cost-efficient route for delivery.\n\nControl resource inputs and outputs, optimise workflow, or increase the speed of production with catalysts and workers. Maintain a constant level of production across industries, or deliver enough water and other necessities, and the cities of the colony will begin to expand and thrive once again.\n\nUse your earnings to buy new train engines with different attributes, construct useful buildings like a lawyers firm or water pumps, and even research new industries to invest in: such as Steel, Oil and Ore. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether to invest in the growth of your city, or focus purely on your own profit.", "summary": "Railgrade is a construction strategy game about building railway networks to connect future, off-world cities with valuable industry.
