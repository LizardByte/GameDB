The game can be played in a browser on itch.io and Newgrounds (links provided above). It can be downloaded to Mac, Windows, and Linux on itch.io. The Windows and Mac versions support the use of a gamepad.\n\nCats on Mars is a bizarre blend. That doesn\u2019t just refer to the title but the game itself, which mixes the mechanics of an RPG with those of a DDR-style rhythm game. It\u2019s one of those concepts that sounds strange on paper. And yet it works, as does its subject matter. \n\nThe Martian setting allows for a touch of wild creativity. Most of the cats you come across are humanoid, like yourself. But there are also giant lounge cats lazing all over the place. As you explore the space colony, it becomes clear that the cats have created their very own slice of utopia. Here the main source of agriculture is catnip. Rooms are littered, in more ways than one. Some cats love to revel in their own filth. Others just like to play video games all day long. They can afford to because they have mice working for them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are allusions to popular video games sprinkled throughout the environment, as well as a somewhat suspicious reference to Among Us. Observations are playful and plentiful. \n\nRegarding the flip side, Cats features a swinging selection of tunes to swish one\u2019s tail to. Its soundtrack is an eclectic mix of bouncy ballet, heady trip-hop, slinky jazz, smooth disco funk, trance-like EDM, and foot-stomping jungle. What's more the catchy audio is complemented by the winsome pixel art. Items are rendered in a whimsical cartoon style \u2013 note the shape of the computer mice \u2013 and the animated NPC cats seem to bop their heads and swing their tails to the background music. \n\nThe art, music, and gameplay gel together well. So much so that, once the music comes to an end, the player might just find themselves purring for more.\n\nThis playthrough was published with the permission of the developer.
