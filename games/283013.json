Aux Armes! The cry is heard throughout the village to lead another brave quest into the Dungeon!!! Many have entered; few have emerged!!! Will your party be able to conquer the dungeon and return to the village? What evil lies within? What TREASURES are for the taking? What GLORY lies ahead? Thanks to a few successful forays into the dungeon, a partial map of the first level and a Tome of Dungeon Monsters exist. Armed with this information, it is your job to lead your meager party of adventurers through the Dungeon, to add to the knowledge of what lies below, to claim the money and treasures of the depths, to go for the GLORY! As your party gathers as Diane's Drinking Depot, the blood chilling cry still lingers in your ears, \u201cAux Armes! Aux Armes!\u201d Will you survive?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lord-of-the-dungeon"}
