Stalingrad, Soviet Union. We are on one of the major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fight the Soviet Union for the control of the Stalingrad City (now Volgograd) in Southern Russia, on the eastern boundary of Europe.\n\nMarked by fierce close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians by air raids, it is often regarded as one of the single largest (nearly 2.2 million personnel) and bloodiest (1.7\u20132 million wounded, killed or captured) battles in the history of warfare. The heavy losses inflicted on the German Wehrmacht make it arguably the most strategically decisive battle of the whole war.\nIt was a turning point in the European theatre of World War II; German forces never regained the initiative in the East and withdrew a vast military force from the West to replace their losses.\n\nThe German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942, using the German 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intensive Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into house-to-house fighting, and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the Volga River.\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker Romanian and Hungarian armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.\nThe Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was cut off and surrounded in the Stalingrad area. Adolf Hitler ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By early February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining units of the 6th Army surrendered. The battle lasted five months, one week, and three days.", "summary": "Stalingrad is a stand-alone real-time tactics game for the PC developed by Russian company DTF Games. The game features two campaigns based around the events in southern Russia between summer 1942 and early 1943. The game has two playable modes, first one is by default the RKKA (Workers' and Peasants' Red Army) campaign which follows the Red Army's progress as it liberated Stalingrad and destroyed the 6th Army. And the second mode is the Wehrmacht campaign, which has the player commanding the 6th Army as it approached the city and the battles for the city itself. The game maps themselves are reproduced from historical tactical maps and actual aerial photography taken during the period that the campaign covers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/great-battles-of-wwii-stalingrad", "videos": [{"id": 10484, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FLlQZrSJH6g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLlQZrSJH6g", "title": "Stalingrad (Real-Time Strategy) - 2005 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FLlQZrSJH6g/sddefault.jpg"}]}
