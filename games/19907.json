After making his way back up the station, Tom witnesses a fellow firemen get abducted and killed by a Longleg. Startled, Tom gathers his wits, and fights his way to fellow firefighter Smitty, the only other survivor. The two eventually make it out of the station, and into the war-torn streets of Staten Island.", "summary": "Resistance: Burning Skies is a unique Resistance experience developed specifically for PS Vita that takes full advantage of the system's dual analog sticks and features an all-new hero and story written by William C.
