Maia will not be yours!\" before disappearing with the lovely princess to be.\n\nPrince Rhys, beside himself with grief and anger begins to set off with an army to find his bride and to destroy all of the last remaining Layan descendants but is soon stopped by his father, the king, and is told to cool his heels in the dungeon beneath the castle. He is soon let free though by Lena who wishes him well on his journey to find his bride.\n\nThroughout Rhys's quest to find his fianc\u00e9, he finds relics of the legendary war and makes alliances with strange bedfellows and old friends. His progeny take the story from after he finds Maia and soon realize that the world in which they live and history itself isn't what it appears to be.", "summary": "Just as you\u2019re about to marry Maia, the mysterious woman you found on the shore, a winged dragon grabs her and disappears.
