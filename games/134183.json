Brutal concoctions of environmental hazards, platforming, and lethal enemies force the player to stay attentive, quick, and adapt.\n* Carefully thought out level design. The player's experience is crafted by strategically placed dangers, risks, and rewards.\n* Beautiful retro pixel art paying homage to the early 90's such as Sonic, Mario, and Kirby.\n* A very expressive soundtrack which also pays tribute to the early 90's. Infectious melodic hooks and driving beats wrapped up in a 16-bit package.\n* 20+ levels to blaze through. Seasoned players who are skilled can speed through levels at record time.\n* Quick sessions and instantaneous respawn leaves no time for the player's skill to depreciate. There is enough punishment for the player to endure, why sit through a drawn out dying sequence.\n* Automatic Saving so none of your progress will be lost.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kunoi", "videos": [{"id": 60764, "video_id": "2i2fqbbxwus", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i2fqbbxwus", "title": "Kunoi Kickstarter Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2i2fqbbxwus/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 60770, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2i2fqbbxwus", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i2fqbbxwus", "title": "Kunoi Kickstarter Commercial", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2i2fqbbxwus/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
