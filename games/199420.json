However, holding the fire button down for a few seconds will charge the sword; and upon releasing it, it shoots a larger fireball that does a fair amount of damage. During the game, you collect items that increases your speed and give you more firepower.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, you have to destroy a boss in order to proceed to the next one. Between each chapter, you can watch an intermission that details what is happening at the temple.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/phelios--1", "videos": [{"id": 67641, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "rMihPEyJXF4"}]}
