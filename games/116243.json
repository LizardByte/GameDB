Earn money to upgrade it, to buy more cogs and gear, such as engines, pumps, hammers or wagons. Think as an engineering genius and you'll become an ultimate tycoon. \n \nThe way you combine the details into an awesome steampunk contraption, affects your income. The exploration never ends: once the laboratory is fully equipped, the Portal to the other steampunk/dieselpunk/gaslamp fantasy worlds appears. Clockwork cities, Flying islands, zeppelins, windmills, factories, bridges and much more technological content awaits for you! Just like in the books by Jules Verne and Herbert Wells or in the movies about flying castle or walking mechanical cities. \n \nSteampunk Idle Spinner is a fusion of builder and incremental idle game genres. It means that when the game is closed, these awesome steampunk machines will still be generating income for you. The mines dig for resources, factories produce goods, balloons and zeppelins fly and explore the territory, and once you are back into the game you'll see the results and you will be able to issue new orders and continue building and researching.", "summary": "A world of mad science and incredible contraptions is waiting for you!
