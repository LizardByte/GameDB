Prequel to all the other Darius games.  There's a prologue?  Wait...there's a plot?  IN A SHMUP?!  MADNESS!  NO PLOT~!\r\n\r\nSame ol' Darius goodness.  This game expands on capturing (first appeared in Darius Gaiden) and introduces the Alpha Beam, which allows you to plow through enemies, bullets, and clash with boss Beta Beams.  During this clash, it turns into a button-mashing contest.  Winner gets a bigger beam and can wreck more havoc.  Some bosses have powerful Alpha Beams that require INSANE button-mashing.  Fourfold beam counter is just plain epic (as far as I know,  the only boss that has it is Fire Fossil.)  Also, capturing captains and inputting a motion will make them use a special attack.  I move around a lot to figure out the input.  Captured enemies can be used as a shield, prepping the Alpha Beam, or used as a bomb.  Oh, and this game is REALLY, REALLY HARD! (then again, it IS a Darius game)  It becomes a bullet hell in later stages. X_X Gaiden is easier IMO (even though Hard!Fatty Glutton and Rusty Hammer aren't the funnest bosses).  End game rank is judged by how much is destroyed and boss accuracy (spamming shots = lower rating).  In short:  doing really, really good.\r\nOh, and Zuntata...Adam...B.T. Dutch...\r\n\r\nIn this longplay...or something, I show all zones on Normal difficulty so don't mind any inconsistencies.  I also beam counter bosses.  For insane beam counters, I abuse autofire, something I REALLY don't use.  Some bosses were played with skills.  Some...not so much. -_-  Can't help that a kazillion things are thrown all over the place.  There MAY be some slight audio desync.  I had a hard time encoding this.\r\n\r\nNo skills involved, but you already know that. =P -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA14X_3ggQ4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA14X_3ggQ4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA14X_3ggQ4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SA14X_3ggQ4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [089] G-Darius", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\r\n\r\nPlayed By: Tsunao\r\n\r\n\"You will see the creation of new lives.\"\r\n\r\nFishy shmup by Taito and probably the best game in the series (either this or Gaiden).\r\n\r\nSomething about creatures...and the making of the Silver Hawk...and some other stuff.
