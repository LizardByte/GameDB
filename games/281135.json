The bad news: Dr. Wily shows up to ruin the fun, and basically everything at the festival tries to kill our hero... wait, didn't we go through this exact routine already?!\n\nMaGMML1 Remastered is a full-fledged remake of the original MaGMML1, rebuilding it completely in a new game engine in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of subsequent contests.\n\nWhile the entries are the same beyond engine fixes and extremely minor tweaks, the entire rest of the game has been completely revamped! The hubs, tier bosses, extras, you name it, have all been completely redone, all in a totally functional, smooth 60 FPS. Of course, the remake doesn't fix most of the problems that you might have with the entries themselves, but the playing experience is (hopefully) much improved, so new generations of people interested in the series can experience its roots without being dumped into a pit by Rush Jet!\n\nTons of quality life features have been added as well, be it Skip Teleporters or leaderboards inspired by MaGMML2, or new options such as being able to toggle lives on and off and being able to choose if you want to view the very outdated judge comments or instead innocently pretend MaGMML1's judge rubric didn't exist.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/make-a-good-mega-man-level-contest-remastered", "videos": [{"id": 103863, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "3G1Z7B2N85c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G1Z7B2N85c", "title": "Make a Good Mega Man Level 1 Remastered - Released!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3G1Z7B2N85c/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 10041, "name": "Make a Good Mega Man Level"}]}
