At the time of release, Nero was the only playable character, but after a new update Dante was added as a playable character. Although the plot for the most part is largely similar to the console version, Capcom has tweaked the story and added some minor differences to the overall plot, a large one being that Nero and Dante's stories have been split into two separate narratives rather than one continuous one.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
