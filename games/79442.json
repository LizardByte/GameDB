(loosely translated to \"Good Luck, Driver!!\") is an electric train driving simulation game developed and released by Taito for arcades in Japan on October 2000.\n\nA spin-off of the Densha de Go! series (and using the same engine as Densha de Go! 3 Tsuukin-hen), Ganbare Unten-shi!! focuses on light rail transit with two routes: the Enoshima Electric Railway and the Iyo Railway.\n\nWhile much of the game is the same as the main series, it modifies the braking and throttling controls for added precision and adds controls for operating the vehicle's doors. Due to street traffic, maintaining a timetable is not as strict as previous entries and the time-based penalty system is replaced with a \"lives\"-based one.\n\nThe game was later ported to both the PlayStation 2 (on July 25, 2002) and PC (by Unbalance on June 5, 2003) as Densha de Go! Ryojou-hen (loosely translated to \"Go by Train! Emotional Travel Edition\"). This version features features an updated graphics engine (based on Densha de Go! Shinkansen) and adds four additional routes: two from the Keifuku Electric Railroad and two from the Hakodate Transportation Bureau.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/densha-de-go-ryojou-hen", "videos": [{"id": 48753, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ZolYcqqZV_g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZolYcqqZV_g", "title": "\u96fb\u8eca\u3067GO\uff01\u65c5\u60c5\u7de8\u3000\u6c5f\u30ce\u5cf6\u96fb\u9244", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZolYcqqZV_g/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
