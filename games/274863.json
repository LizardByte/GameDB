The rules are simple: send a ring to opponent's side,\ndon't touch the net or ground. Hedgehog have to jump to strike the ring, but\nthree consecutive contacts with it is a fault. Match is played to 15 points.\n\nLeft player is Sonic the Hedgehog, right player is Shadow the Hedgehog. Both\nare controlled by players using joysticks or cursor keys. Press [ 1 ] in the\nmain menu to choose Sonic's controls, press [ 2 ] to pick Shadow's controls.\nPress [ S ] to start match. Note that there is an easter egg in the game!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/volleyring"}
