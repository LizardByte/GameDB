Ya, we hate them too. Enjoy a video of pure freedom!\n\nSign-up for alpha on our website & join our community Discord, links below!\n\nJoin the Insula family:\n\n\u2b55 Website:  https://insulagame.com/\n\u2b55 Discord:  https://discord.gg/playinsula\n\u2b55 Twitter:  https://twitter.com/PlayInsula\n\u2b55 Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/PlayInsula\n\u2b55 Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/playinsula/\n\u2b55 Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/playinsula\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Insula today: https://bit.ly/InsulaYouTubeSub\n\nWelcome to Insula!\n\nThat was the tagline\u2014humanities\u2019 new hope.  At least, until they all disappeared, working with a mysterious organization known as H\u01ceid\u00e0o (\"HighDow\" \u6d77\u76d7), you are tasked with exploring Insula and discovering what really happened to all the poor souls that had called this home.  To survive that, you will need some serious tech and no small amount of credits.\n\nYou know of one way to get that out here.  The Bounty Royale, a brutal, mechanized bounty-hunting bloodsport that runs autonomously right here down on the surface of Genesis.  To get started, you'll need to recover and repair one of the light and agile combat exo-suits that were used early on by the security forces on Insula.  If you survive, you can use your winnings to start amassing the tech you will need to build your own anthrobot, a fully mechanized combat-ready battle chassis that you control from afar via neural link.\n\nOne way or another, your only hope of making it home, relies on solving the mystery of a now-dead Insula.  All paths to that end, begin in the arena.\n\n\nCUSTOM-BUILT YOUR WAY\nCustomize your anthrobots & exosuits with a vast array of armor. Build them big and beefy or light and nimble; it's your style! And of course, no brand is complete without customizable paint jobs, logos, and programmed battle taunts!\n\n\nMELEE IS NOT A LAST RESORT\nCustomization and play style are essential; you can customize your combat just as you customize your armor and drones. Lay waste to your opposition with lightning-fast strikes from small dual wield energy blades, wreak havoc with the wide arcing swings of your polearm, or pound them into scrap with devastating blows from massive rocket hammers.\n\n\nDRONES AND ABILITIES\nOnce you've built your dream battle rig, finish it off by adding the perfect companion drone. They\u2019ll provide data recording, scan analysis, and resource extraction. They also offer specific skills to use during combat. Armor repair, energy shields, advanced tracking, recon, and even stealth, pick one that's right for you!\n\n\nPLAYER BOUNTIES\nYou're not just fighting for bragging rights. Bounties are the heart and soul of Insula: Bounty Royale. Each opponent has a bounty on their head. Putting them in the ground means creds in your pocket and upgrades! Upgrade your base, bot, & your lifestyle! Be mindful of your notoriety, though. The more you take, the more you're worth, and the more others will want to add you to their trophy list!\n\n\nGOING VERTICAL\nOur arena designs are unique; they span massive spaces with just as much verticality as horizontal space. But don't fret, every combatant has their very own fully customizable flight rig! Combat is designed with fast-paced, acrobatic aerial maneuvering in mind!\n\n\nPRIVATE ISLANDS\nPrivate customizable and upgradable base that provides story advancement and lore discovery through seamlessly integrated discoveries and achievements during the multiplayer arena matches, not to mention a way to display your hard-earned achievements as part of the base decor\n\n\n\n\n\n#BountyRoyale #BattleRoyale #SciFi #IndieDev #IndieGame #GameDev #UnrealEngine", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zsFw5W1krxY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zsFw5W1krxY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zsFw5W1krxY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zsFw5W1krxY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zsFw5W1krxY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Insula: Bounty Royale - Tight Spaces!", "description": "Insula: Bounty Royale is currently in Pre-Alpha stage.
