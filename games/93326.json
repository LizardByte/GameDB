It is a space trading and combat game with real-time strategy elements.\n\nThe game plays in fictional alternative reality in the future, several hundred years ahead. The game starts when the eponymous space ship, the \"Ironseed\", flees a theocracy on Mars. The ship is crewed by disembodied, digitized rebels originally scheduled for termination. In hastily fleeing, the ship suffers damage and gets lost in time and space. The crew finds itself in unknown space somewhere in the Milky Way with a badly damaged ship and nearly depleted fuel reserves. First objective is therefore finding resources for ship repairs and fuel while gathering intelligence about the surrounding space and also their own history. After encountering other alien species and learning about some greater threat, the ultimate goal becomes to forge an alliance of several alien races to counter this threat.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-seed", "videos": [{"id": 100817, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ckKqY0c-ilI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckKqY0c-ilI", "title": "Iron Seed gameplay (PC Game, 1994)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ckKqY0c-ilI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
