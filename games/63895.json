This year, Totomono is taking their students to Toki no Gakuen. You will be trained as an adventurer. The key to the story is held in the hands of three transfer students. Get to know their personality and their strengths, and see how their relationships develop throughout the game. The vast range of character customization options is back. Besides their jobs and appearances, the player can customize their characters to the most minute of details. The biggest change in this instalment is that adventures are no longer confined to a 3D dungeon. Characters move around the field as sprites, so you have a better idea of your environment.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shin-ken-to-mahou-to-gakuen-mono-toki-no-gakuen"}
