Facing an overwhelming threat at home, humanity sends an expedition to the Pegasus Galaxy in a desperate attempt to find a refuge for the population of Earth, only to find themselves in the middle of an interstellar war they inadvertently started.\n\nAs you lead one of these fleets, your mission soon transitions from exploration to governance, conquest, and eventually a fight for survival. Players will experience a challenging story where nothing is self-evident and every decision will have its consequences.\n\nBuilding on the legacy of the grand strategy genre, The Pegasus Expedition adds a strong narrative side to the classic 4X-gameplay which involves managing your diplomatic ties, armies, economy and scientific development.\n\nWishlist the game now: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1521070/The_Pegasus_Expedition/\nhttps://www.gog.com/game/the_pegasus_expedition\nhttps://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-pegasus-expedition-224279\n\nFollow us:\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/FulqrumPublishing\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/FulqrumPublishing\nWebsite: http://www.FulqrumPublishing.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FulqrumPublishing/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FulqrumPub\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/FulqrumPublishing/\n\n#strategy #ThePegasusExpedition #gaming #4X", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y73QXRc6jLc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y73QXRc6jLc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y73QXRc6jLc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y73QXRc6jLc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y73QXRc6jLc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Pegasus Expedition - Early Access Release Date Trailer", "description": "The Pegasus Expedition, the narrative-driven Sci-fi 4X strategy launches into Early Access on October 20 - wishlist now!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1521070/The_Pegasus_Expedition/\n\nFull 20-hour story campaign with variable endings available immediately; new scenarios, features and more set for Early Access.
