Blocks move upward in Fall, to the right in Winter, downward in Spring, and to the left in Summer. Every 5 turns, a new grid is randomly selected as the next grid to play in. Game level, speed, and scores increase as you destroy more rows of blocks. Build and destroy until the Whirlygig becomes too fast to handle."}
