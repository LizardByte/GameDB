You can switch between first and third-person viewpoints while piloting a space craft with the goal to drive back the invaders. The ship goes forward automatically and needs to avoid obstacles and destroy enemies in space.\n\nIn first-person mode, you move the ship to line-up the reticule and shoot incoming objects such as asteroids or enemies. In third-person view, you have a bit more control as you can move the reticule. Occasionally power-ups will appear giving numerous abilities like electro bombs..\n\nLG originally announced a PC port of the game as well, but never followed up on the promise.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/armageddon", "videos": [{"id": 101061, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "uNbgtT_HLbs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNbgtT_HLbs", "title": "3do \u00b7 ARMAGEDDON \uc544\ub9c8\uac8c\ub3c8 (LG Software) 1996", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNbgtT_HLbs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
