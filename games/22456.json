Your only chance at freedom is to earn enough money in the arena to buy yourself back. Whether in a lowly arena on the outskirts of the Empire or in the Colosseum itself, a wide variety of opponents await: heavily armed charioteers, wild bulls, fellow gladiators and more. In a series of battles, from battle royales to one-on-one duels, you must entertain the crowds by spilling blood.\n\nAfter battles, it's time to train. A series of minigames improves your attributes and your diet perfects your body. Study your rankings, play around with your special skills, and await the next battle.\n\nColosseum: Road to Freedom is a self-described Action RPG, controlled in the third-person and works as a gladiator simulator.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/colosseum-road-to-freedom", "videos": [{"id": 81479, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iEoLVSmD6SE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEoLVSmD6SE", "title": "Colosseum: Road to Freedom - Trailer E3 2005", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iEoLVSmD6SE/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 4712, "name": "Gladiator"}]}
