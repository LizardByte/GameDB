While asking the question \n\"what if the Gods lived among the human population?\" \n \nCore Gameplay Mechanics \n \n- Build cities with unique buildings \nEvery building you build in Divine Intervention is unique we have an algorithm that generates random interior and exterior so that no structure is the same. This works very well with the fact that the player can shift to a 3rd person adventure mode and enter every building he has built \n \n \n- Fight meaningful battles: \nThe player will be able to engage in both siege and land wars with other cities however he has to be careful because every soldier he loses will make him weaker. Therefore, the player is forced to be strategic on when he goes to war and when he should choose another option. \n \n- Convert villages using a missionary approach: \nThe player will be able to interact with villages he does not yet control in an attempt to convert them sometimes even create cults that will start riots in the cities. However to achieve this the player has to make sure he doesn't get caught by other gods or villagers who are loyal to their beliefs. \n \nThe player also has to catch other Gods doing the same to his village. \n- Craft and upgrade your villagers and your own gear: \nThe player will be able to find artifacts, pieces of armor and weapons and get them crafted to use by himself and his villagers this is a part of the progression system that is built into the game. \n \n- Craft and upgrade your spells: \nThe player will be able to combine our five elements: Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and aether to create new and interesting spells \n \n- Select your Titan: \nThe player will be able to find and choose many different Titans who all have unique traits and abilities. The Titan will change appearance and behavior depending on the player's choices. Making it a unique experience for every player who plays the game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/divine-intervention"}
