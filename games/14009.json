As soon as they can, the ingredients dash out of the pantry dragging all the sorts of nasties, found in the bottom of drawers and cupboards, with them, to escape, and run wild.\nPoor old Charlie!\nHe has to daze the ingredients with his flour bombs and knock them into the mixing bowl, because if they go into the dustbins they will be eaten by the bin monster, who doesn't care one little bit where he throws any rubbish.\nShould any rubbish or nasties get into the cake mix then the \"ingredients needed\" counter will change, and Charlie will have to work quicker and faster, if he's going to bake his cake.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cookie"}
