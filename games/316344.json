In the process of this invasion, he successfully locates The Space Colony ARK\u2019s case files, in which he finds written documents by Gerald, stating that he\u2019d discovered a method to siphon chaos energy, & use it on himself, & hopefully Maria. It stated that the Chaos Emeralds could heal the user if use correctly, a method of which he planned to use as a cure for Maria\u2019s sickness.\n\nThere is also a section in the document which states that he had found out how to use chaos energy in the same way Shadow & the \u201cAncient Hedgehog Hero\u201d from the paintings in Hidden Palace could. Bestowing himself with a great power unlike anything he\u2019d ever seen. It was part of what allowed him to create such powerful beings with such little time as he had been using the emeralds to grant himself enhanced speed & strength.\n\nWith this newfound discovery, Dr. Eggman vows to find a way to use the emeralds in the same way his father did, and exact revenge on Sonic & Friends on equal terms. In order to distract Sonic & Friends from catching onto his plan, he creates a tournament with the Master Emerald as the grand prize, something which was easily stolen from Knuckles. After word of the tournament is spread through an interrupted TV broadcast, Sonic & Friends all enter the tournament in hopes of ensuring that the heroes will take the Emerald back to Angel Island in the end.", "summary": "Sonic Fighting Heroes: King of The Rings (SFH: KOTR) is a MUGEN-based 2D Fighting Game, which has been in development since 2017.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-fighting-heroes-king-of-the-ring", "videos": [{"id": 128683, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JMXqt2OaAF8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMXqt2OaAF8", "title": "Sonic Fighting Heroes: King of The Ring V3.2.2| Sonic Preview 2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMXqt2OaAF8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
