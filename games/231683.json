Several months after becoming champion of the Kanto Region, Red is called back by Blue to help on a secret mystery-solving mission! In Red's absence the Kanto region has been overtaken by a strange mist that mutates Pokemon into shocking new forms, and the military has instated a lockdown! Are you a bad enough detective to discover the origin of the mutations and save Kanto?\n\nThis hack is based on a fansite from the late 90s called The Pokemon Factory\". On it, fans would email in their ideas for new Pokemon to the site's artists who would make sprites and Pokedex entries of them to be displayed. These Pokedex mockups have made the rounds on the internet in the years since, with some even gaining notoriety as \"Pokegods\".", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-factory-adventure"}
