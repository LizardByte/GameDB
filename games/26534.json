With this, there was a period of peace and stability in the world.\n\nAs the ages passed by, there was one among the Gaia who called herself \"The Witch\". Over time, she grew in tremendous power and with a ruthless ambition, rallied the people of Gaia to rebel against the world.\n\nNot all the people of Gaia heeded this call however and the world was thrown into chaos. It was only through the combined efforts of the three races of Deva, Asura and Gaia that \"The Witch\" was finally captured and burnt alive. It was a victorious outcome of a unity between the three races.\n\nNow at the present time, the three races continue to co-exist with each other in the world of Rappelz but dark rumors have surfaced about the second coming of \"The Witch\" and the return of her fanatics.", "summary": "Rappelz is set in a medieval fantasy world, dominated by three races: the Deva (who represent light), the Asura (who represent darkness), and the Gaia (humans that possess an affinity with nature).", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rappelz", "videos": [{"id": 102102, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "H3VlvJnYjgw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3VlvJnYjgw", "title": "Rappelz - Epic 9.1: Masquerade Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H3VlvJnYjgw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 102103, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JFu-UnURX_c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFu-UnURX_c", "title": "Rappelz Epic VIII Part 3 : Omen - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JFu-UnURX_c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
