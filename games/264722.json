There, an anonymous user first spoke about an old and unknown anime called \"Go for a Punch.\" Despite the efforts of those interested in recovering this anime since 2011, the original video never saw the light of day.\n\nThe plot of the video was as follows:\n\"A group of school teenagers finds themselves locked inside a closed room, a public restroom with no doors or windows to escape from. As they debate the possibility of never being able to leave that restroom, they progressively lose their sanity to the point of resorting to suicide due to desperation and hunger...\"\nThe Visual Novel will pick up on the mentioned plot, introducing slight twists and changes to the story, following the pattern usually found in Lost Media discoveries.\n\nIt is a realm where human memory often falters, allowing for diverse interpretations to emerge from those imperfect recollections. These variations add depth and originality to the unfolding narrative, creating a captivating and ever-evolving experience.", "summary": "Four students find themselves trapped in the restroom of an abandoned school; the door is locked, and there's no way out except to cling to hope or face death.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/go-for-a-punch-saki-sanobashi"}
