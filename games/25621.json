In short, this condition leaves her with a perpetual sense of being empty, hollow, and incomplete. As a result, she has never been able to experience satisfaction, fulfillment, or happiness, and has not been able to experience emotions in the same capacity as other people. As she grew older, she learned to pretend to be a normal person in order to avoid drawing negative attention from others, but was never able to feel any degree of empathy towards other human beings.\n\nAyano attends a post-highschool academy called \"Akademi.\" On the first day of her second year at Akademi, Ayano came into physical contact with a young man named Taro Yamada. In that moment, she gained the ability to experience everything that had been missing from her life; she felt complete, she felt fulfilled, and she felt powerful emotions. Meeting Taro was like seeing color for the first time, hearing music for the first time, and feeling warmth for the first time. In his presence, she felt overwhelmed with euphoria...but, as soon as they were apart, the feelings of emptiness returned. After just one meeting, Ayano had become hopelessly addicted to Taro's presence, and came to rely on him in order to feel alive.\n\nThen, Ayano saw something horrible...something that terrified her and infuriated her at the same time. It was a young woman who clearly had deep feelings for Taro. If Taro entered a relationship with this girl, then Ayano might lose him forever...\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Ayano knew exactly what had to be done. This girl - her rival - had to be eliminated as soon as possible, by any means necessary, no matter what the cost.", "summary": "Yandere Simulator is a stealth game about stalking a boy and secretly eliminating any girl who has a crush on him, while maintaining the image of an innocent schoolgirl.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yandere-simulator", "videos": [{"id": 88078, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "mAXJjQMz8-s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXJjQMz8-s", "title": "Yandere Simulator's New Introduction Cutscene", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mAXJjQMz8-s/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88079, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "_-L9YNEtYnI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-L9YNEtYnI", "title": "1980s Mode Announcement Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_-L9YNEtYnI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88080, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "-3WdzFRetEY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3WdzFRetEY", "title": "Osana Release Date Announcement", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-3WdzFRetEY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 88081, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "UC-Bj2IZUb4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-Bj2IZUb4", "title": "Yandere Simulator Live-Action Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UC-Bj2IZUb4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 92464, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "ldPfoynz5Qc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldPfoynz5Qc", "title": "Delinquent Update Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ldPfoynz5Qc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 92465, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Aa7ovZGvY6o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa7ovZGvY6o", "title": "Yandere Simulator Rival Introduction Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aa7ovZGvY6o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
