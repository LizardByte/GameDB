Liquids (water, oil, and lava) fall from 'droppers' and will bounce around the walls of a puzzle. You move and rotate the various puzzle pieces in order to divert the flow of the falling droplets so that they can reach their target. The faster you complete each level, the more bonuses you will receive, the higher position in the high scores table you get.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}]}
