The bandits start arguing with each other as one of them is tired of carrying the cage while the other one wants to keep going. With both bandits distracted, the Rogue drops in and takes them down easily. He breaks the old man free but rebuffs the geezer's gratitude, proclaiming that he only cares about loot. The Rogue takes off to look into who's behind all these kidnappings...and earn a buttload of money along the way!", "summary": "Rogue Soul 2 is an action platformer game developed by SoulGame Studio. It's the sequel to Rogue Soul.\nMuch like its predecessor, Rogue Soul 2 is a platformer game in which you control the titular hero, Rogue Soul, who runs automatically, and wreak havoc on enemies who would rather have him dead. However, Rogue Soul 2 is more story-driven and has a set of levels to be completed in linear progression rather than simply trying to get the best score you can. The game also has many other bonus modes that can be unlocked by reaching various milestones in the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rogue-soul-2", "videos": [{"id": 113457, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "_omkH4FdpiU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_omkH4FdpiU", "title": "Rogue Soul 2 Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_omkH4FdpiU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
