{"id": "atLJs5pxDEE", "snippet": {"title": "Gobliiins 1 (1991)", "description": "The Gobliiins series consists of four puzzle adventure games developed and released by Coktel Vision (and later Sierra On-Line) in the early 1990s for the Amiga, Atari ST, PC and Mac platforms. The fourth title was released in 2009. The unique visual look of the series and its characters was contributed by Pierre Gilhodes, a French artist who gave his famous signature style to many of Coktel Vision's other games.\r\n\r\nThe games mix elements of adventure and puzzle gaming. In essence, the player must find the solution to each area (or level), consisting of one or more screens, in order to progress to the next.\r\n\r\nAn original aspect of the series is that the player usually controls multiple goblins as player characters, each of whom has a unique set of abilities (the number of letter i's in the word \"Goblin\" of the title indicates the number of characters that the player may control). The player may only control one character at a time but, depending on the specific scene, may switch characters at will. The original Gobliiins features a shared health system for all three characters, which meant that leaving characters in the wrong place could be detrimental, though this feature is not implemented in the sequels.\r\n\r\nAll games are available in CD format. The first three include voices instead of the \"goblinish\" talk that featured on the floppy disk versions.\r\n\r\nIn Gobliiins the player controls a team of three different goblins, each with a unique skill. The first goblin, Asgard (BoBo in the US release), is a warrior who is more brawn than brain, and whose skill is punching, causing various things to break or fall over. He is also the only one who can climb other objects than stairs and ladders. The second, Ignatius (US: Hooter), is a magician who can 'zap' things with magic with a wide variety of usually unexpected effects, which include objects moving, growing, or becoming alive. The third, Oups (US: Dwayne), is a technician and is the only one of the three that can pick up and use items.[2]\r\n\r\nThe game is linear and consists of 22 levels, each of which occupies a single screen. The puzzles on each level must be successfully solved in order to progress to the next.[2]\r\n\r\nSeveral actions may harm the goblin involved, including leaving them in an unsafe place, using incorrect items, or interacting with items with the wrong characters, thus reducing their shared life meter. When the meter runs out, the game ends in defeat (though all levels can be completed without loss of life).\r\n\r\nReception\r\n\r\nGerman magazine Powerplay gave the game a rating of 70% for the PC version and 69% for the Amiga and Atari ST versions.[3]\r\n\r\nThe game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #190 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/atLJs5pxDEE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/atLJs5pxDEE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/atLJs5pxDEE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Gobliiins 1 (1991)", "description": "The Gobliiins series consists of four puzzle adventure games developed and released by Coktel Vision (and later Sierra On-Line) in the early 1990s for the Amiga, Atari ST, PC and Mac platforms.
