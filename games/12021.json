Their vain and terrible queen, who managed to surpass the rest in depravity, seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers from all the other witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in the 1990s, a young English teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who just might break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.\n\nAfter breaking out from his prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming to a halt in a cavern maze. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.", "summary": "Long ago in a land far from our own in time, space and dimension, there lived of the most wicked and evil witches that the universe had ever known. They ruled the now forgotten Land of Enchantia. The inhabitants of Enchantia prayed for the day when the evil hold over them would be vanquished and they could finally live in peace.\nOne of witches had found a spell that would ensure her constant youth. However the main ingredient was a live male child. Male children lived in another dimension, another time, another world. The witch would need a portal and more magic than she possesed. She needed to trick all the other witches in Enchantia into lending her their power so she could make each one young again. She now had enough power to invoke the rejuvenation spell.\n\nOn one particular day our hero, Brad was playing baseball with his sister Jenny. Back in Enchantia the evil witch is looking at the field through the portal. Hungrily and excitedly she incants a summoning spell. Back in the field Jenny pitches a ball towards Brad, he swings the bat in a wide arc and....bang!!!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/curse-of-enchantia", "videos": [{"id": 48236, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Y4fjvZLXVDM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4fjvZLXVDM", "title": "PC Longplay [497] Curse of Enchantia", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4fjvZLXVDM/sddefault.jpg"}]}
