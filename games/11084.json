There are over 100 single player levels and 36 Co-Op levels connected through a gradually unlocking map screen ensuring there is always a variety of levels to choose from. Progress through the mansion is punctuated by comic book cut scenes and the occassional boss encounter. Every room in Shuggy's castle is different, letting Shuggy travel in time, swing on ropes, turn to a zombie, shrink, grow, fly, teleport and more.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-adventures-of-shuggy", "videos": [{"id": 21915, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VbvJzt59zwc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbvJzt59zwc", "title": "The Adventures of Shuggy trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VbvJzt59zwc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
