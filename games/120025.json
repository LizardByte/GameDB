Yet even as the conflict still rumbles on the horizon like a distant thunderstorm, a new terror has arisen.\n\nPeculiar tales and strange lambent mists swirl around the twisted spires of Erator cathedral, where it is said the usurper Baron Siegwar is raising an army. For many years he was considered an eccentric, shut away in his gloomy cloistered galleries, absorbed by a mania for the mystical arts. Adventurers, charlatans and mercenaries travelled across continents to court him with arcane and esoteric wonders, and his appetite for morbid curiosities was an obsession that kept him from his stately duties.\n\nNow, rumours have emerged that his courtiers have turned murderous, attacking the nearby villages and towns with an uncommon bloodlust. Survivors swear that these marauders possess inhuman strength, and that their eyes are empty swirling voids. Worse still, those that are struck down soon rise again to take up their swords and continue their rampage\u2026\n\nOnce cast into a dungeon for defying orders of the King, you have found a means of escape and emerge blinking into a devastated land. Now you must take up your sword and defend the realm that made you a prisoner before all is lost.", "summary": "Grab your sword and purge the land of evil forces in Usurpator.
