They were offered as a part of Happy Meals for a limited time in 2003. There is a single button on the game which allows the player to jump.\n\nThe objective of the game was to grind down the rails with Shadow, avoiding gaps by pressing the jump button. No directional pad was needed as Shadow moved automatically. After clearing 15 gaps the level and speed increase. Four levels is the maximum amount of levels. If the player falls into gaps 10 times in a single level the game ends.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-grinder"}
