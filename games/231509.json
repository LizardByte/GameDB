However, the game was delayed several times and ended up being ultimately cancelled, as SETA ran into financial constraints. During development, the game seemingly switched from having an Nintendo 64 base release to being a planned launch title for the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive, a peripheral for the Nintendo 64 console. It was also intended to be released on SETA's Aleck 64 arcade board.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rev-limit"}
