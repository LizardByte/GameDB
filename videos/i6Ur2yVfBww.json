It was also ported to many computer and game console home systems.\n\nBad Dudes is a side-scrolling beat 'em up where the players are set in the role of the titular duo tasked with rescuing \"President Ronnie\" from ninja kidnappers. It was met with commercial success, and a generally positive to mixed critical reception. It has since become widely known for its general premise and introductory cut scene.\n\nThe gameplay of Bad Dudes is roughly similar to the 1985 Konami side-scrolling arcade game Rush'n Attack, the 1984 side-scrolling beat-'em-up Kung Fu Master, and the 1987 side-scrolling arcade game Shinobi, but allows up to two players to play at once.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i6Ur2yVfBww/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i6Ur2yVfBww/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i6Ur2yVfBww/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i6Ur2yVfBww/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i6Ur2yVfBww/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bad Dudes (1989) [NES] Complete Playthrough", "description": "Originally released in arcades as Bad Dudes Vs.
