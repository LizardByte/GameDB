But perhaps it was Fate which drove you to seek shelter in the offices of Wayfarer Inc. In their subterranean laboratories, you discover a machine which opens up a portal to another world. Wayfarer had just had enough time to send one expedition thought the gate before they had evacuated.\n\nSeeking escape from the Kill Gang beating down the doors, you activate the device, open the portal, and step through...\n\nYou are greeted by a lush and dangerous world of verdant forest and acid lakes, rocky crags and networks of caves. Up on a high plateau, you see a geodesic dome shimmering under a pink sky. Perhaps if you can reach it, you may find the first expedition... or at least find out what became of them.", "summary": "90s-style shooter meets Metroidvania.
