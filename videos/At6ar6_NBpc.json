After escaping from the spaceship, they must traverse various bizarre locations to find their way home.\n\nThe Lost Vikings is a puzzle-platform video game developed by Silicon & Synapse (now Blizzard Entertainment) and published by Interplay. It was originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992, then subsequently released for the Amiga, Amiga CD32, MS-DOS, and Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis systems the next year, and to GBA in 2003.\n\nThe game features infinite opportunities of retries in case the player loses one of the Vikings. All three Vikings (Erik, Baleog and Olaf) have three health points which they can lose by getting hurt by enemies or by falling from great heights, and the ability to carry and use items, mainly keys, bombs, and food (which restore health points). Each of the Vikings has a unique set of abilities. Erik can run faster than the other two, can jump, and can bash through some walls (and enemies) with his helmet. Baleog can kill enemies with his sword, or from a distance with his bow (and a \"life-time supply of arrows\" ). The bow can also be used to hit switches from a distance. Olaf can block enemies and their projectiles with his shield, and use his shield as a hang glider. Olaf's shield can also be used as a stepping stone for Erik to enable him to reach higher ground, which would not be possible without the shield.\n\nIn 2014 the game was added to Battle.net as a free download emulated through DOSBox.\n\nIn 2015, The Lost Vikings were added as a playable hero in Heroes of the Storm, allowing players to control the three Vikings as individual units, making a unique departure from the typical heroes available.\n\nA sequel in 1997 was released as Lost Vikings 2: Norse by Norsewest/Norse by Norsewest: The Return Of Lost Vikings. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/At6ar6_NBpc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/At6ar6_NBpc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/At6ar6_NBpc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga 500 Longplay [097] The Lost Vikings", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Reinc\n\nThree Vikings get kidnapped by Tomator, emperor of the alien Croutonian empire, for an inter-galactic zoo.
