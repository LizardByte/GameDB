Sadly I was not able to get anyone to make sounds for the jam, so it's a silent game.\n\nAlthough the game didn't turn out to be as fun as I wanted, I am quite happy with what I was able to accomplish in a short time with a game engine I only recently started using. I had so many ideas for how to make the game better, improve the levels and also how to improve the walking IK, but just ran out of time. That happens quite a lot with game jams and actual game development, so it was not a surprise!\n\nYou can find out more information about the game here: https://mrflamey.itch.io/magnet-mechs", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZD19RcKqUw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZD19RcKqUw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZD19RcKqUw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZD19RcKqUw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZD19RcKqUw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Magnet Mechs (Mech Jam II build)", "description": "This is the final release of the game I made for Mech Jam II, a game jam that took place on itch.io recently and lasted two weeks.
