Your boat is small... and your destination shrouded. Follow the moon and greet your fellow travellers with care.\n\nYour destiny awaits beyond the westbound lights... in the island's cavernous depths. Be not afeard... the isle is full of noises.\n\nThe Isle is Full of Noises is a '#flatgame'. There's intentionally no interaction or even collisions, except for moving the pieces around the screen. It's focused on presenting a game as the most raw and immediate combination of movement, art and sound. The Flat Game manifesto says that all you need to make a game and to present an idea is a couple hours, a laptop, and some markers."}
