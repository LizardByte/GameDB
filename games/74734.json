As Uther, the disgraced Knight Commander, you must lead your misfit band of companions throughout quests riddled with trials. Forge uneasy alliances to acquire the mythical Excalibur sword and defeat the sinister power-obsessed duke of Wessex. \n \nProve your worth as a tactician by exploring all five realms and dangerous locations, such as a frozen fortress hiding a dark secret, an ancient abbey turned into a hideous torture chamber and the mystical island of Avalon. Survive ambushes and rescue those in need by making use of each hero\u2019s abilities to solve puzzles and vanquish your foes. It is up to you define the fate of Britannia\u2026 But at what cost? \n \nCombat in Sword Legacy: Omen is always a challenge. As a strategist, you will need to plan your course of action with four heroes at a time.
