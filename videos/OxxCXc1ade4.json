The story follows Charles, a hedgehog scholar on a mission by the lion king to save the monarchy, but his decisions could end up helping reformists or even to bring about anarchy.\r\n\nSTORY\r\n\nThe story revolves around an ancient myth that forms the basis of the Animal Kingdom\u2019s caste system - the myth of the Ark Fantastic. As the myth goes, the ark was built by lions millennia ago to save all animals from a great flood. The king\u2019s gambit is that, amidst whispers of reform and revolution, a reputable scholar such as Charles proving the existence of the mythical ark might sway animals toward a royalist stance, and thus uphold the monarchy.\r\n\nCharles is accompanied by the king\u2019s trusted advisor Philippe the Fox and the captain of the royal guard - Andre the Boar. Their task will lead them to the fringes of the Kingdom and beyond, in search of elusive truth.\r\n\nGAMEPLAY\r\n\nThe player progresses through the game by solving the Kingdom\u2019s various problems and mysteries, but his method of solving them is a scientific one - he publishes compelling arguments in the Animal Kingdom\u2019s scientific papers to prove his theories and disprove those of others. Only arguments with sound logic and solid evidence will have the power to sway public opinion and change the course of history. \r\n\nThe evidence itself can be found by talking to the local denizens (after learning their language, such as squirrelese), by using scientific equipment (a microscope, or a chemist kit), or, as a true scholar, by \u201cstanding on the shoulders of giants\u201d and using evidence from the works of other scholars found in libraries across the Kingdom.\r\n\nThe player\u2019s main challenge will be finding all the relevant evidence and then choosing the right conclusions, which are then published and reviewed by his peers, potentially resulting in a boost to his scholarly reputation.\r\n\nAdditionally, since Charles\u2019 scientific conclusions can have large-scale consequences on the Animal Kingdom and the monarchy in particular, there is a looming moral dilemma over whether the player should publish a certain argument or not.\r\n\nTHEMES AND INSPIRATIONS\r\n\nWe draw inspiration for the game from modern fables of classic literature, such as Animal Farm or Watership Down, as well as deep story-driven games from the roleplaying and adventure game genres, and games with unique and experimental gameplay mechanics.\r\n\nOur goal is to use the game to explore various types of society (monarchy, democracy, anarchy) and to tackle questions such as how rule is legitimized, what role myths play in the shaping of society, and so on.\r\n\nThe animation is drawn frame-by-frame to be reminiscent of early animated classics, and the music takes cues from 19th century romanticism with the use of leitmotifs inspired by Wagner and gesamtkunstwerk opera.\r\n\nThe game is developed using open-source software, such as the painting tool Krita and the Godot game engine. Gamechuck studio is also a sponsor to both Krita and Godot Engine and, in the case of Godot Engine, actively contributes to its development.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxCXc1ade4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxCXc1ade4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxCXc1ade4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxCXc1ade4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OxxCXc1ade4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Trip the Ark Fantastic Teaser Trailer", "description": "\"Under our homes and under our hearths, civilization itself stands on a story.
