The basics are extremely simple: two teams, one ball. The team that carries the ball into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown, the team with the most touchdowns at the end of the game is the winner. However, it\u2019s how you decide to do this that makes things interesting, the ends justify the means! It\u2019s not just the players you have at your disposal either. You can bribe the referee to look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying opponents and hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the crowd\u2026 Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies.\n\nThere are many races to accommodate every player\u2019s profile (23 in the Chaos Edition, 20 in the Legendary Edition, 9 in the Standard Edition) and even more strategies for experimenting. Winning a game requires a strong game-sense and a lot of self-control.\n\nFor the player's enjoyment, omnipresent humour and the use of spells, weapons, and other non-regulatory actions place Blood Bowl outside of the classic sport simulation genre.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blood-bowl", "videos": [{"id": 13857, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "t3xsSN7UEFI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3xsSN7UEFI", "title": "Blood Bowl Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t3xsSN7UEFI/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 869, "name": "Blood Bowl"}]}
