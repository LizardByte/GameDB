There is also a Map08 containing what I had made of Map07 before I lost my way with the project (the actual Map07 in the wad is a simple \"The End\" bookmark style map). Each map has a distinct style from each other and was limited to using a 32 grid size for linedef and things placement, similar to my favourite Eternal mapset (though allowing myself rotation for a bit of flexibility. Map06 breaks the grid a bit and Map08 a lot). Testing is done using mostly Crispy with DelphiDoom using the voxel pack to help with thing placement.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nuclear-chunks"}
