This is way more than a basic mod. Sound is okay (though you can spot a few lifted from Sega Rally Championship, and presumably other games too), and graphics are acceptable (not sure where the car models have originated from, but they look good).\n\nThere's no weather/time-of-day (though some tracks the lighting seems to evolve as you race). There's also no co-driver, so you need to memorise stages/tracks to get the best lap.\n\nYou do have a headlight option though, plus a handbrake (and MP3 player, if you need it!) as well as multiple camera views... although recording the TV camera view was hard, as there are no replays, so it's recorded it as I drove the stage (to a time limit which you can't seem to switch off in LAN mode!).\n\nNote: the mouse pointer annoyingly flickers into view a few times, as I forgot to remove it from the capture. Also it's important to note that this mod doesn't seem to work in the latest version of Half-Life on Steam (I tried the often suggested \"use WinXP compatibility on hl.exe\", but that didn't help), so I'm running here using a copy of Game Of The Year edition, which I found online.\n\nThis is part of the Every PC Rally Game playlist, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYDobL0b26ugFuXASCIC9qmFb9_k4_fqU", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-thG_ISz-ek/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-thG_ISz-ek/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-thG_ISz-ek/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-thG_ISz-ek/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-thG_ISz-ek/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Half-Life Rally (2004) - Every PC Rally Game", "description": "Half-Life Rally by Half-Life Rally Team, 2004.\n\nCreated in 2004 by half a dozen developers, Half-Life Rally is a fairly good mod, bringing a full-on rally game into the Half-Life engine.\n\nFeaturing 10 cars (all unlicensed, though for some reason the Ford Focus has become a Foam Locast with tweaked colours!) and 13 tracks - a mix of A-to-B rally routes, circuits, speed test and multiplayer car-tag-with-time-bomb modes, this game has a fair few things to try.\n\nAdditionally you can upgrade cars by winning cash in the races!
