This episode is built upon Quoth code and monsters. It comes with \"dark ambient\" music which adds to the feeling. The levels are huge, and the number of monsters in each one is extreme. An essential release, but clearly not for everyone.\n\nThis episode is three-hour-long for experienced players to clear.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 66375, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "f9ll4TmU3Xw"}]}
