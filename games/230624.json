I feel so stressed! I should watch porn at times like these!!\nToday I'm watching BDSM!! You are finally enjoying time alone. The moment you play the recently downloaded video out of the secret folders that are organized by genre, actor, and manufacturer. A beautiful man's face fills the screen instead of an actor from porn.\n\n\"I have no bad feelings for you, but you should die here.\"\n\n\"?!?!?!\"\n\nA strange man is climbing out of the screen like a scene in a horror movie and trying to kill me?\n\nJust when the man who unfolded his six wings and completely extricated himself from the screen swung his scythe and tried to cut my throat. Suddenly, a cozy smell like a cat's sunny fur behind my ear, and a black shadow as soft as a blanket enveloped my body. Then, a firm hand gripped my waist. A strange man's sweet voice rang in my ears.\n\n\"Is it an angel trait to kill people you have no feelings for and not feel embarrassed?\"\n\nAnd another strange man saved me from the porn guy... I mean, the angel...\n\nNo, wait. That was an angel?! Then who are you?!\nThe man who saved me shone his scarlet eyes and smiled at my question.\n\"I am the devil who came to save you, child of Solomon. Let's go to hell together.\"\n\nWhen he saw me turn deathly pale at the mention of hell, the man who called himself a devil as if saying 'you know nothing'.\n\n\"What in hell is bad?\"\n\nThe reason angels and devils came down to earth.\nThe sweet yet terrible relationship between them and myself.\nAll the answers are in the 'hell' that you are heading for!", "summary": "What in Hell is Bad? is an upcoming adult defense otome game for mobile devices.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}]}
