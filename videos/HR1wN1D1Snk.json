Your objective is to kill every enemy that crosses your path and clear each stage with the highest score possible. Shou wields dual handguns for ranged attacks and a couple of martial art moves for melee combat, and your arsenal also includes special moves triggered by specific controller motions and a \"super\" bar that allows you to call forth Shou's Maid ally who can spray the screen with her chain-gun. As an additional gameplay feature you can continue to juggle enemies after you have defeated them for \"overkill\" combos, which rises your super bar and adds for extra-scores.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzxHKbKxYksiToRD67xxiZjGq-vKjOS0a\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Game_Curiosity", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HR1wN1D1Snk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HR1wN1D1Snk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HR1wN1D1Snk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HR1wN1D1Snk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HR1wN1D1Snk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Blood-over- (Windows) \u2014 Playthrough (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc)", "description": "Blood-over- Gameplay | \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc \u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u52d5\u753b \nDeveloper: 9thNight\nGenre: Action\nReleased: 2006\nPlatform: Windows\n\nDescription from Mobygames: \nBlood-over- puts you in the shoes of Shou, an accomplished Free-Hunter (freelance agents that get paid to fight the forces of darkness) as she wades through several stages filled with zombies, demons and other supernatural creatures killing everything in her sight.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling brawler with the addition of gunplay and auto-targeting.
