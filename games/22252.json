This hotel of the undead is filled with a bizarre group of guests -- along with Gregory and a mischievous little punk kid called James. Your goal is to steal the soul fragment (contained in milk bottles) that each guest holds. Doing so will, as Death informed you, get you out of the hotel, and apparently fill you in on why you were out walking about in the forest in the first place. You obtain the soul fragments by interacting with guests and solving basic puzzles. The game ends when you've run out of spirit as indicated by a spirit meter.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gregory-horror-show", "videos": [{"id": 10143, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IJP3Nhbq2hE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJP3Nhbq2hE", "title": "Let's Play Gregory Horror Show, Part 0: Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IJP3Nhbq2hE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
