It's one of the few flash games I've played that uses 3D models to good effect, not to mention the awesome music and sound effects. Though when I first played it, I was on a crappy iMac and it ran so slow that it was impossible to lose; so it poses a bit more of a challenge than I remember.\n\nA few things I want to mention about the game:\n- You'll notice when I hit the take button, (L| and |R) appear, this indicates which hand the weapon you pick up will go to (once it's cycled through the other ones).\n- There's a small bug when you have the shotgun equipped in your left hand in that whenever you hit take, it will fire the shotgun. (1:57)\n- The \"mice\" use a modified Super Mario pipe sound effect when they appear from the ground, though I'm sure you noticed it too.\n- You are forced to murder the fishing teddy bears before you can progress. :(\n\nHope you enjoyed it!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w3sVJC3UIi4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w3sVJC3UIi4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w3sVJC3UIi4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w3sVJC3UIi4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w3sVJC3UIi4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Let's Play - Gunny Bunny - Mice Murder", "description": "Yes, I am completely silent after the introduction.\n\nThis is an awesome little flash rail-shooter that I found many years ago (probably 2003, when it was released) and fell in love with.
