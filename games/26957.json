You're meant to try and survive, and kill as many enemies as you can. There are demons and sinners who want to kill you as soon as they see you. You are armed with just a very, very powerful melee weapon, and grenades, health drops and stuff to build with(which you can snap together like in minecraft) and your wits.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brimstone--1", "videos": [{"id": 11884, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "131ynFGwVD8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=131ynFGwVD8", "title": "[Outdated] Brimstone Update 0.1 Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/131ynFGwVD8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
