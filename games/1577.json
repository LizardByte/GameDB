A sorcerer, known as Ripto, has invaded the world of Avalar and is wreaking havoc on its citizens with his magic. Idols come to life and attack their creators, Eskimos are encased in ice cubes, and a civilization of seahorses has had its water confiscated. Spyro must travel through the land of Avalar, undoing the damage done by Ripto and ultimately defeating him.", "summary": "Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! is the second game in the Spyro the Dragon series. In this game, Spyro is placed in the land of Avalar rather than the Dragon Worlds. Gameplay flows like the original game Spyro the Dragon, with few variations in control and Spyro's main abilities intact. The only notable difference is the removal of Spyro's side-rolling ability, previously activated by L1 and R1.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spyro-2-ripto-s-rage", "videos": [{"id": 2368, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JieD38Dn3QA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JieD38Dn3QA", "title": "Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!
