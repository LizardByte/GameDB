You know this is a lost cause, enemy forces are overwhelming and sooner or later your time will come. So, if you gonna go, do it with style, and pave yourself through piles of fallen monsters before they squash you! There's just one thing that matters - how long can YOU survive?\n\nIn I, Zombie you play as the leader of a zombie horde and your goal is to infect all humans on the map. Whenever you infect a human you turn him into a one of your kind and you can use him against armed soldiers. You're also able to command your horde to either attack the enemies, follow you or wait for orders. Each scenario requires tactical approach and careful planning to achieve success."}
