Due to personal matters and lack of ideas I am putting work on Eizoku on indefinite hiatus. I may or may not return to it to flesh it out but I hope that many people can still enjoy it in it's current form. \n \nI've optimized the game as best as I can but unfortunately games that seem to have older or lower quality graphics cards have framerate issues. \n \nDonations are greatly appreciated as I have been unemployed for close to a year and need to keep myself afloat to keep doing what I love."}
