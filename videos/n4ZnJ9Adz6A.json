{"id": "n4ZnJ9Adz6A", "snippet": {"title": "The Smurfs (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Infogrames' 1994 NES game, The Smurfs. \n\nThis Smurfs was a pretty late-gen NES title, and was only produced for PAL territories. I was surprised when i learned that - I loved this game,  and I was surprised that it never came out here after we moved back to the states . As a little kid, I seem to remember The Smurfs appearing much more often on American TV than British. Of course, that might have been a consequence of having a whole four channels - the Spice Girls hadn't introduced the fifth yet lol). I think it's a bit sad that much of the world never got to see this, because this game is absolutely superb. \n\nIt's a simple, no frills platformer that relies on super-precision jumping (and does it well), but the graphics are really excellent, and that soundtrack is the stuff of legends. \n\nPlaying this again was a really happy throwback to my much younger self. To anyone who missed it the first time around,  give this a go. It deserves the chance!\n____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n4ZnJ9Adz6A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n4ZnJ9Adz6A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n4ZnJ9Adz6A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n4ZnJ9Adz6A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n4ZnJ9Adz6A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "The Smurfs (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Infogrames' 1994 NES game, The Smurfs. \n\nThis Smurfs was a pretty late-gen NES title, and was only produced for PAL territories.
