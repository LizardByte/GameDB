It featured much simplified gameplay and graphics, designed for the mobile devices of the time. \n \nThe mobile game features similar gameplay to the PC version, albeit on a smaller scale. Three modes are available: a tutorial, a campaign split into three campaigns of seven scenarios each, and random map. Villagers gather food, wood, gold, and stone as resources, and military units can be trained. The player must progress through four different Ages: Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age, and Imperial Age. \n \nAge of Empires II Mobile Deluxe Edition was released in 2006. It adds two new civilizations: Persians and Japanese.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/age-of-empires-ii-mobile", "videos": [{"id": 47675, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Hm1ZcMhB-BY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm1ZcMhB-BY", "title": "Age of Empires 2 java gameplay (Tutorial in description)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hm1ZcMhB-BY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
