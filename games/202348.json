Just like the original Witoru and its few fangames, this work's design is minimalistic and \u200balso contains various parodies and references to Japanese pop culture.\n\nIn this game, the player takes the role of a girl named Otetsuki who cannot leave her room. As with most traditional Yume Nikki fangames, the player's objective is to collect effects and explore the dream worlds.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yume-iro"}
