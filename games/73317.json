There are 8 unique alien characters that you can choose and compete against. Each alien has different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Mr. Mune (a caterpillar-like alien) has many legs enabling him be very good at shooting events but also makes it difficult for him in racing events.\n\nYou can either compete against a friend by sharing the keyboard or against the computer. There are a total of 15 different events to compete in and you have the choice of tackling a selected few, or going through the whole series. You also have the option of practicing first to get the hang of things.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-olympics", "videos": [{"id": 62435, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "V_XsAQulUhw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_XsAQulUhw", "title": "Alien Olympics (Dark Technologies) (MS-DOS) [1994] [PC Longplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V_XsAQulUhw/sddefault.jpg"}]}
