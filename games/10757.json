This game isn\u2019t for cowboys. It\u2019s not about how many kills you get or how big the explosion is. It\u2019s also not about the Police being mere cannon fodder as is the case with just about all games on the market. It\u2019s about being an effective Police Officer in a City like most cities around the World. It\u2019s about doing things the right way. It\u2019s about showing how difficult it is but also how rewarding it is to be a good Police Officer. \n \nWe want to continue to honor the work Police Officers do. This game brings with it the opportunity to feel what it\u2019s like and to experience what Police experience. Our mission is to show Police for what we believe they are; real people doing a real job. On that Journey there will also be massive highs for our players to really enjoy the experience. \n \nWhen ever you ask a Police Officer about their job, they say \u201cI love what I do, I love being a Police officer\u201d. This game needs to have the same effect. We want Police fans to LOVE jumping into their patrol car and to experience a whole new open world whilst waiting for thousands of random events to pop up at a moment\u2019s notice.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/police-1013"}
