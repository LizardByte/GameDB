If you're caught, residents will call the police even sooner... or take the law into their own hands.\n\nLoot wacky cartoon houses from the safety of your home! Lockpick, cut the power, tie up residents, and steal everything that isn't nailed down.\n\nPark your car out of sight to avoid detection, or at the front door for a quick getaway. Crank your handbrake to drift back onto the highway!\n\nDon't get too cozy: houses take on a different configuration every round, with new themes, layouts, and hauls for you to get acquainted with.\n\nThese hand-drawn residents may not be the smartest, but they aren\u2019t dumb. Denizens hear noises, see lockpicked doors, notice large stolen items, and will call the police - or hunt you themselves.\n\nEnter wherever, and leave whenever: Climb in through the basement, or take a trampoline straight to the roof! Get the midnight bonus for leaving early, or evade the cops for more loot.\n\nLevel up your gear from the Town Hub between runs with perks - lockpick faster, delay the cops\u2019 arrival, or unlock special tools!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/keepsake-county", "videos": [{"id": 94477, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "d6Ekcv9rfbU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Ekcv9rfbU", "title": "Keepsake County | Invading Steam & Twitch with a new free Steam Demo | Stealth Fest 2023", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d6Ekcv9rfbU/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 94478, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "n68tixIJVII", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n68tixIJVII", "title": "Keepsake County is now in Beta!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n68tixIJVII/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
