Even though he was confident in his skills, she was a top-ranked and beat him handily. As a result, he had to join the cyber-research club that she was the leader of. It was a relatively new club, but it soon became lively with the addition of his osananajimi and student council deputy leader Kuon, his dependable imouto Rin and classmate Kotone.\n\nAt the start of summer vacation, Yoshito was asked by the club\u2019s advisor Kanae to help test out a love simulation game that\u2019s in development. However, all the female avatars in the game were played by the girls in the cyber-research club! Once it was revealed that his avatar had an AI which mimicked his personality, they interacted with him in ways that they normally wouldn\u2019t in real life. Traversing the line between reality and imagination, he could see the true feelings of the heroines who are not honest with their feelings. Their summer love story begins now.", "summary": "The world of Natsuiro Kokoro Log is surrounded by romance, which is carried out through two different realities: the real world and what happens digitally.
