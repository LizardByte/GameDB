Put together a bunch of monsters to make for a challenging fight and your efforts will be equally rewarded!\n\nChoose from multiple classes, such as knights and mages, pick your characters to control those classes, like grandma or kid brother, and take on the loads of quests, monsters, items and equipment littered throughout Knights of Pen & Paper. Blacksmiths, enchanters, mining, gathering, hidden treasures and a whole lot more await, giving players a lot of room to personalise their gameplay experience.\n\nDon\u2019t wait any longer, the Pen & Paper world needs you!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/knights-of-pen-and-paper-bundle", "collections": [{"id": 1403, "name": "Knights of Pen and Paper"}]}
