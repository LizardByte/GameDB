The crew encounters a powerful artifact of obvious alien design, and after Charlie activates it, the rest of the game follows him as he travels back-and-forth from the Joplin to an alien planet whose mysteries he begins to discover.\n\nAs Charlie continues his journey, he learns about his mission, the intra-governmental agreement that sent him out to the outer reaches of the Solar System, and the conflict that he encounters on the alien world. With the help of his crew, he also starts to figure out how to undo the awful events of the early portion of the game by harnessing the changes that he begins to undergo.", "summary": "Midnight Star is a first-person shooter for iOS from Industrial Toys.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/midnight-star"}
