The enemies still have all but their front sprites missing, but they retain their gory deaths when killed by a strong hit or weapon.\n\nThis version also has hidden two-player link-up cooperative and deathmatch modes, accessible only through the unlockable cheat menu. While this port shares the FMV scenes and most of the Redbook audio music from the other CD-ROM versions, it also includes some new music tracks."}
