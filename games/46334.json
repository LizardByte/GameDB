Unlike other versions, this port presents several changes when compared to the original game, a result of having been adapted following closely the Mega Drive port of Strider. Despite this, the game is still plagued by shoddy programming and uninspired gameplay, product of the higher-ups being only interested in getting the game \"written and out as fast as possible\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/journey-from-darkness-strider-returns"}
