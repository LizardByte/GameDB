It's an Ocean game, through and through, and you'll probably notice the difference pretty quickly. This was one of those games that Sunsoft published shortly before focusing on their own in-house developed games.\n\nPlatoon is based on the 1987 computer game (C64, Amiga), that was in turn, obviously based on the massive 1986 Hollywood Vietnam War movie with Willem Defoe and Tom Berrenger. It's a good port of an okay game, but at least it's so schizophrenic in it's gameplay style that you'll hardly have time to get bored before it's over. \n\nIt starts off in Level 1 with finding explosives to take out a bridge in a jungle maze, platform style. Level 2 switches to the tunnels dug underground, where (playing surprisingly smoothly from a first-person perspective) you have to find supplies before finding the exit. Leaving the tunnels, Level 3 puts you in a bunker, launching flares and taking out enemy soldiers in the middle of the night before moving onto search & destroy mission for the final level, looking rather like the 3D stages from Contra. \n\nThere's nothing particularly good or bad to say about the gameplay. It works. The graphics are surprisingly good, though the game that its based on probably is to thank - even in most of Ocean's games played like utter rubbish, they usually looked and sounded great. The perfect for instance here is the ending - that string of cinematics is pretty impressive, resembling Freedom Force's intro in a number of ways. \n\nThe game is also extremely easy. I remember as a kid being forever stuck in the first stage, but after a while, a few friends and I decided to make maps to get through it so we could stop blindly stumbling through hoping to get lucky. It worked very well, and afterward I played it so much that even today, I still have the layout burned into my memory. \n\n\n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qiXkbQ17frY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qiXkbQ17frY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qiXkbQ17frY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qiXkbQ17frY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qiXkbQ17frY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Platoon (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sunsoft's 1988 NES game, Platoon. \n\nFor the full review, soundtrack, and screenshot gallery, be sure to check out http://www.nintendocomplete.com/platoon\n\nWhile this game does prominently carry the Sunsoft logo, don't let that fool you.
