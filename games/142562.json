Armed with a camera, a dai-jo staff, and fierce determination, it's your job to save your planet and its inhabitants. \n \nFrom Dust \n \nFrom Dust is the latest original game concept by Eric Chahi, creator of the cult classic, \"Another World / Out of this World\". \n \nImmerse yourself in a world as exotically beautiful as it is dangerous! You control the destiny of a primitive tribe against the backdrop of a world in constant evolution-a universe where mighty Nature reclaims what is hers; and your mastery of the elements is your people's only chance of survival. \n \nOutland \n \nIn the middle of Balance and Chaos, now stands one man whose efforts may bridge the ancient divide, or doom the world to destruction. \n \nThe award-winning studio Housemarque, maker of Super Stardust HD, has teamed up with Ubisoft to create an ambitious platformer inspired by epic adventures such as the Prince of Persia series. Each player's adventure will take him between light and darkness and force him to adapt to an ever-changing world.", "videos": [{"id": 44640, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "yxNipz4Rmxs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxNipz4Rmxs", "title": "Triple Pack Beyond Good & Evil HD + Outland + From Dust -- Launch Trailer Official  [UK]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yxNipz4Rmxs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
