Welcome to the Tunnels! Lights out!\n\n\u201cMetro 2033: Wars\u201d is a turn-based, open-world, strategy game, based on the story of Dmitry Glukhovsky's best-selling novel series, \u201cMetro 2033.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the year 2033 and the entirety of the world has been reduced to nuclear rubble. Humanity is nearing extinction and radiation is making even the most basic surface dwelling, uninhabitable. New life forms have arisen that are far better adapted to this new dark, damp and alien-like world. Bands of survivors live on without ever knowing the warmth of sunlight, and whether or not they are the last ones left on Earth. The Moscow Metro is the reluctant home for this new humanity and one you protect at all costs.\n\nMetro Stations have become city-states run by new and emerging Factions, uniting its members around ideas, religions, water, or simply the need to survive. Your daily existence centers around gathering resources necessary for survival, repelling attacks of mutants, exploring and conquering new metro stations and developing armed mercenary units when the need arises. To survive, you'll have to build necessary facilities at Stations, establish diplomatic relations with your neighbors and uphold the economy of your little underground state.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metro-2033-wars"}
