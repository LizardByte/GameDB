The demo of trouble of Tabu is life now! You can download it from steam and it contains the first 30% of the game. \n\nSo what is Trouble of Tabu? ToT is a mixture of a Foddian game and a platformer. In general Foddian games are very unforgiving and has a constant threat of losing huge chunks of progress. Trouble of Tabu is not different in this regard.\n\nI've been working on this project for over 3 years and very excited to be able to share the demo with you all! I hope you like it and please don't forget to give feedback once you have finished the demo. \n\nAlso if you could share it with your friends and family I would be very grateful as well. Finally, if you could leave a nice comment on steam I could/would almost kiss you. Really. \n\nGood luck and have fun!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z14KjhaWJj4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z14KjhaWJj4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z14KjhaWJj4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z14KjhaWJj4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z14KjhaWJj4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Trouble of Tabu - Play the Demo now!", "description": "Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1950530/Trouble_of_Tabu/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/gZAve6Gm2e\n\nThank you so much for being here and sharing this special moment with me.
