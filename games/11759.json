While game retains the action elements from previous Onimusha, it offers a more varied amount of weapons as well as the option of going back to previous stage to unlock new content. The game also introduces a 3D camera as well as the ability to continuously fight alongside AI controlled characters who move depending on the player's orders. Dawn of Dreams was announced by Capcom due to high fan demand and several Capcom members realizing they could expand the action elements from Onimusha after working in Shadow of Rome. The game was designed in order to appeal to skilled gamers rather than the general market which resulted in appealing designs rather than realistic.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/onimusha-dawn-of-dreams", "videos": [{"id": 5215, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JCIeyjVL8Ik", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCIeyjVL8Ik", "title": "Onimusha Dawn of Dreams \u2022 Trailer E3 2005 \u2022 PS2", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JCIeyjVL8Ik/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
