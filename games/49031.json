They include: \n-Second 3: Your position shifts when you stay in one spot for more than 3 seconds. \n-Ice Stage: The play field becomes slippery, and its's tough to stop where you want! \n-Hide: Some of the squares on the panel are blank until you land there (but the Cat still knows what they are!) \n-Break: ALL the squares are blank; choose this for a test of memory as well as speed! \n- 60 levels, 240 round in all, including 60 bonus rounds \n- Password feature \n- Pause function lets you resume the game where you left off \n- Beware the Black Hole and Star squares that challenge your every move \n- Hook up the Game Link for 2-player action \n \nPick up Panel Bingo today ... don't let that nasty Cat win!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/panel-action-bingo"}
