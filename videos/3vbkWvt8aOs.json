It is reminiscent of an old-school 80s console computer game. It\u2019s a simple pixel-perfect endless runner game. \n\n\u25b8 Storyline \n\nEverything was peaceful until one day Vivaldia wakes up to discover that her city has been taken over by the big evil machines who want to steal everyone\u2019s identity and turn people into numbers. If humans don\u2019t fight back, their future looks bleak.\n\nIn the face of adversity, Vivaldia grows strong and takes on the enemy. She fights to save the humans of the city.\n\nRiding her cybernetic ninja one-wheeler called the CyclePunk, Vivaldia outruns and outsmarts the big evil machines. At times, it looks like an impossible battle to win but through courage and strength, Vivaldia triumphs. The evil is overcome and the humans can claim their city and future back.
