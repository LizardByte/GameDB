The storm was triggered when the imaginary world collided with reality, and everything within it started to flood into the real world.\n\nHowever, certain secluded human communities managed to survive the apocalypse and the altered world that emerged from it. Answering a mysterious call, these people converged on the peninsula that would become known as Asgartha, with the aim of building a new shared civilization together.\n\nIt is now about 500 years after the cataclysm, and humanity has finally decided to venture beyond the frontiers of its new home. To do this, it has launched the Rediscovery Endeavor, the greatest initiative in its history. Beyond the boundaries of Asgartha, humanity knows that a magical phenomenon known as the Tumult continues to alter the world.\n\nUntil now, these ever-changing lands have been too hostile for anyone venturing into them, but humanity can now turn to the Exalts: pairs of explorers who can use their powers to survive in these unstable environments. Exalts have learned to master Alteration, the power to bring their imagination to life within reality. To do this, they capture and use Mana, the same energy that feeds the Tumult.\n\nThrough these teams of scouts, humanity intends to explore the unknown. Yet the Exalts' mission also has another purpose: They seek the legendary source of the Tumult in hopes that they can permanently stabilize the chaos in the world.", "summary": "Altered is a trading card game from French publisher Equinox.
