The naval combat game allows you to set up battle squadron groups, their formations and management, with realistic ship models and characteristics, as well as advanced ballistic and weapon models. \n\n(Alternative History) In the second half of 1880s, the policy of imperialism in the tropical Pacific led to a local naval conflict between the U.S., Chile, the German Empire and the Kingdom of Spain.\n\nNone of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the quick clash of colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule Oceania."}
