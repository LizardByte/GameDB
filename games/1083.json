Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player can pick up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wipeout", "videos": [{"id": 14038, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "GRKWc6XxiXk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRKWc6XxiXk", "title": "wipeout trailer - 1995, pc.avi", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GRKWc6XxiXk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
