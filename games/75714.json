It's been a long time since they have eaten, and they each have their favorite \"foods\". To survive, you may have to offer them parts of yourself. Your teeth, your hair. I hope you weren't too \"attached\" to them. You won't be for long. The doors and windows are locked and there is no way out. Make your offering to them. Give them your pound of flesh. Or they will take much more than that."}
