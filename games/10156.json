As you meet with both sides of the dispute, you can use deception, betrayal, or combat to shape the outcome of the conflict. Pick up dozens of different swords, each representing a different fighting style.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/way-of-the-samurai"}
