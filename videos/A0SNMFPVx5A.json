Play in single-player or with up to 15 friends in the online cooperative multiplayer mode.\n\nDesign your dream rail network from the ground up. Scout the best route, lay down embankments, and build tracks, switches, turntables, bridges, and more! Then cross the vast, open landscape in finely detailed locomotives and wagons. Interact with regulators, valves, brakes, couplers, and many more features in first-person view as you drive your vehicles. But you won't simply be driving around aimlessly! Your task is to transport goods like timber, ore, coal, oil, and various other freight for a broad variety of industries. Earn money for every successful shipment and invest in new vehicles or upgrade and customize your existing locomotives. Plus: build stations, yards, and other infrastructure along your routes to service your trains with fuel, water, and sand.\n\nEnjoy a realistic railroad experience with the advanced Unreal Engine physics system for deep railroad simulation. All collisions and forces are rendered dynamically in real time, making the train driving experience much more immersive. So, be careful about derailing your train! And to top it all off, you can play Railroads Online with up to 16 players on a server and enjoy the ultimate train simulation in multiplayer sessions with your friends. Lay tracks together and cooperate to move trains seamlessly or share the work while you play independently. It\u2019s also possible to save and load your progress, so you can enjoy the best tracks or most creative layouts again and again.\n\nIf you like trains, start your journey today!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0SNMFPVx5A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0SNMFPVx5A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0SNMFPVx5A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0SNMFPVx5A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0SNMFPVx5A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Railroads Online \u2013 Pioneer DLC Trailer", "description": "Railroads Online is now available on PlayStation 5 & Xbox Series X|S and PC!
