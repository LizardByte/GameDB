Or for a bigger punch use the slingshot to send boulders, exploding barrels, and even pigs to fend off their advances. As the days and seasons go by, the vikings get smarter, building shields, slides, and moving war machines to get past your defenses. That\u2019s where you use coins gathered in play to upgrade your fortifications and ammunition. It\u2019s gonna be a heckuva fight."}
