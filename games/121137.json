But even then nobody could expect that it would happen so fast.\n\nBy the Christmas of 2097, the area of land had reduced ten times. By then the Governments completely lost the opportunity to control people with liberal methods, as a consequence, military dictatorship was introduced to oppose crime syndicates.\n\nThose who survived got used to dividing the land into zones according to the quality of life.\n\nThe Green Zone is in the center on a hill. The place of rich people and government. An island of old life built on the bones.\n\nThe Blue Zone is steel reservations with hundreds of storeys under the Green Zone. The people who live in this Zone have to work hard to survive, but who can call it life?\n\nThe Grey Zone is an old city. It was a miracle that it was not flooded, but the miracle had an effect only on buildings and roads while the democratic foundations sank in the ocean together with the rule of law.\n\nThe Red Zone is a slum area that is behind the old city. It is inhabited with those who cannot afford living even in the old city.\n\nThe Black Zone is parts of land unsuitable for living of people.", "summary": "You are going to try your luck in the role of a private detective Stan Ingram and try to solve a tricky case of suicide.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-unclearness", "videos": [{"id": 29424, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cY1nloMNy6U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY1nloMNy6U", "title": "\"THE UNCLEARNESS\" - official trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cY1nloMNy6U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
