With his help, he goes after King Einon, a former pupil of the dragon hunter, who has turned to evil.\n\nDragonHeart's gameplay is quite similar to the Golden Axe series. Hack'n'slash your way through the nine levels of the game, killing dragons, befriending Draco and then going after Einon with Draco's help (who will toast everything in the way with his flame breath).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragonheart-fire-and-steel", "videos": [{"id": 56317, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8EGadkdkPYs"}]}
