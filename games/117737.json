However, during the burial, Cecep is left to make a key decision which would decide his fate. Should he choose the wrong one, something will await him. While he continues his job, the night turns dreadful; desperate wails and cries for help echo from the graveyard. Along the way, Cecep should learn what he did wrong and pay for this mistake.\n\nExplore the vast setting of an authentic Indonesian local cemetery with a spine-chilling atmosphere. Look deeper as you learn about what you should and shouldn't do in the cemetery. Be careful not to make a mistake when you do something that is outside of your expectation.\n\nThe decisions you make in the game will lead you to different routes and endings. As you play the game, you can choose to run away from the very beginning or continue the game with various conditions to end the game. You can choose to be a responsible man, be a coward, or rude towards your surroundings. In the second folklore, you\u2019ll also be able to choose the journey you want to take. Just imagine, if you were in that situation, what would you do?", "summary": "Continuing with the belief that horror should not be always about big, catastrophic tragedy and can be done just as effectively when set close to everyday life, Pamali incorporates authentic Indonesian day-to-day activities, cultural phenomena, myths, and taboos which shape the horror itself. The game also gives the players opportunity to define their own game experience based on the choices they make during gameplay.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pamali-indonesian-folklore-horror-the-tied-corpse"}
