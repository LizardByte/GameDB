In the RallyCross class, meanwhile, the Zenden Cup is a perfect addition, with its compact boxy chassis and aerodynamic flair housing a powerful engine \u2013 the ideal mix of speed and handling for our off-road events. The Jackson Adventurer, meanwhile, is a bigger beast for the Unlimited Class that\u2019s low on the unnecessary extras and big on shock absorbers, suspension and speed for those big jumps. Finally, the Jackson Eulogy \u2013 the most unique of our new cars, with an estate chassis decked out with custom details and performance upgrades, dropping into our Classic Rally class.\n\nEach of the four cars will feature in a new thread of 25 Career events for all players to take on, available in the new \u2018Uproar\u2019 option in Career. Every event either takes place at night-time or features dynamically changing weather that includes night racing, meaning a fresh test of your nerve, reaction and skill. The 25 events will take you across the globe in new race scenarios for New York, Nepal, Italy, South Africa and more locations.\n\nTwo new sponsors are also added into Career mode in the Uproar Content Pack: PUMA and OffRoad Xtreme. Race through Career events when signed to these sponsors to unlock new items, including unique liveries, player profile options and custom livery patterns, to show your style on the track.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dirt-5-uproar-content-pack", "videos": [{"id": 109377, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "9hy3VaQxyTs"}]}
