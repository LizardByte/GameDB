It covers Egyptians, Aztecs and Vikings. The premise is that it shows children the ropes of the people's lives in those time periods in case the player should become one of them. The program mostly consists of interconnected, narrated slides which contain explanations about the subject in question.\n\nIt also contains a quiz. Here the player chooses a difficulty level (which only changes the number of wrong guesses before the game is over) and is presented with 10 multiple-choice questions. The goal is to answer all questions before all wrong guesses are spent. When a wrong answer was chosen, the game creates a link to the appropriate slide. After reading it, the player can switch to the quiz and try again. Normally the quiz covers only one time period except for the masterquiz option which is about all three periods.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/how-would-you-survive", "videos": [{"id": 116258, "name": "Demonstration", "video_id": "A0rXl2JkYFY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0rXl2JkYFY", "title": "The Computer Chronicles - Computers and Kids (1995)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0rXl2JkYFY/sddefault.jpg"}]}
