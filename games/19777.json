Your destiny is to acquire the Amulet of Yendor for your God and attain immortality.\n\nAfter recognising your destiny, you have set off to the entrance of the Mazes of Menace. The amulet is thought to be somewhere beneath the Valley of the Dead.\n\nThankfully, very few actions are mandatory, many features are randomized, and there are many ways to achieve almost anything. This adds to the strategic challenge and makes the game interesting to replay. As a side effect, there is almost no \"story\" in the sense of most other games.", "summary": "SLASH'EM is a variant of NetHack based on NetHack version 3.3.1. The object of the game is the same: to fetch the Amulet of Yendor from the bottom of the Gehennom and offer it to your god.\n\nCompared to vanilla NetHack, SLASH'EM contains five new roles and five new races for the player to choose from, several new special levels, several new monsters, new items and new artifacts, and other changes. The main dungeon is longer in SLASH'EM than in NetHack but the Gehennom is shorter.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}]}
