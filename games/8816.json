In the Screencheat arena, fast reaction times aren\u2019t enough to keep you alive. When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent\u2019s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks.\n\nScreencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre. When everyone\u2019s used to playing by the rules, can you adapt to unconventional gaming quick enough to get the upper hand?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}]}
