The resulting depression catapults society into a desperate age of class stratification, with workers at the bottom struggling to make ends meet. Julia Miyamoto, the player character, is a temp worker doing her best to get by in the bad economy. She takes a gig at the Galaxy Crisis Management Organization, where she discovers that she has an incredible talent for cleaning up other people's messes, and sets out to prove herself.
