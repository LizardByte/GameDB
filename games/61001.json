The other two games are Pok\u00e9mon Pok\u00e9 Ball Launcher and Pok\u00e9mon Seek & Find. Pok\u00e9mon Team Rocket Blast Off is a simple game in which players have to catch falling Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThe game consists of Ash and May holding a tarp to catch the Pok\u00e9mon tossed by the Team Rocket trio from their balloon. They drop both Pok\u00e9mon and sandbags. The player moves Ash and May by moving the mouse. Pok\u00e9mon may drop at different speeds and angles, and if their path hits a screen border, they will bounce off of it. They will also bounce back up in the air if they hit the edge of the tarp.\n\nCatching a Pok\u00e9mon earns one point, but missing a Pok\u00e9mon or catching a sandbag causes a deduction of points. Points are represented by Pok\u00e9 Balls that fill a bar on the left-hand side, and will never be negative. Levels 2 and 3 also have time limits.\n\nThe game is won once the player obtains nineteen points. Winning the game results in Team Rocket's balloon bursting, causing the trio to blast off.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-team-rocket-blast-off"}
