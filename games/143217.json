The game is extremely similar to the Atari classic, with solid graphics instead vector graphics. In fixed screens, the player takes the control of a space ship with the mission to eliminate all the asteroids present in the screen to reach the next level. When an asteroid is reached by a shot, it is broken in multiple pieces. If the player's ship touches one of these pieces a life is lost. In advanced levels the player will must destroy armed enemy spaceships in addition to asteroids. The ten best scores are archived in the high scores table."}
