Some maps were seriously reworked, others were created from scratch and went a long way of development, or were transferred from other projects. The overall style of the project is very heterogeneous, and is a mixture of highly detailed and lengthy work, adjacent to the short and minimalist, practically unchanged speed mapping. The maps are divided into three thematic episodes describing the beginning of the invasion on earth, the journey into the realm of demons, and return to the our world that is already covered with ice.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloodspeed"}
