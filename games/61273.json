Right after you put it on, no matter how much you struggle, you will easily lose your mind and go insane.\"\nIt's that kind of frightening ring.\nHowever as long as you don't put it on, nothing bad will happen.\n\nUnder pressure from Ruen, Satsuki took on the request to find the Heliotrope ring without taking it too seriously.\n\nFrom that day the demon and human would start working together.\n\nSince meeting Ruen,\nNo, More like since finding that ring, It seems like the world has been swallowed by a dream.", "summary": "Sora Yume is a visual novel released in 2008.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sora-yume", "videos": [{"id": 34424, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "NLkSnTWsOoM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLkSnTWsOoM", "title": "\u30bd\u30e9\u30e6\u30e1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NLkSnTWsOoM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
