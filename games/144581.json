This does not make sense, why did so many people have to perish before action was taken to close down the mine, and how could so many sneak in when the mine is under constant surveillance? \n \nThe Purple Lavender mine is scheduled to be cemented in tomorrow morning. This gives me enough time to quickly get in, document the area, and get out. Something is being hidden, and I intend to find out what. \n \nHere is what I know so far about the Purple Lavender Mine: \n1) It is reported to have 6 depths, however, I do not believe this has been confirmed. \n2) There is a rumor, the deeper you descend, the more messed up things you will experience. Supposedly the pressure starts to mess with your head. \n3) The original miners 70 or so years ago are a mystery. Nobody knows who they were or who their families were. \n \nAll that is left to do is to set out and hope for the best\u2026", "summary": "There are 6 depths to descend; the further you go, the more terror you will experience.
