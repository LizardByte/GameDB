The player controls a party of 6 adventurers, chosen from orc, human, dwarf, elf, and gnome races. Characters can be fighters, clerics, thieves, or mages. The goal is to explore a large 1st person wire-frame maze. The player must travel continually downwards to eventually procure the Crystal Orb. A menu-driven down with a store, magic shop, and adventurer's guild sits atop the dungeon. Combat is text-based, with player and enemies parties taking turns attacking.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
