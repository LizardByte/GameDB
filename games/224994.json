{"id": 224994, "name": "Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms", "summary": "Kingdoms is a clever tile-laying game by top eurogame designer, Reiner Knizia. In a medieval kingdom, you must scout out resources and hazards to decide where to build your mightiest castles. Commit too soon and you might discover a tribe of ogres right next door, but commit too late, and your opponents will grab up all the real estate!\nSix different opponents, each with their own personality, challenge you at a variety of difficulty levels to make the game very replayable.\nKingdoms is built on the same successful MobileEuroCard platform that was used to create Reiner Knizia's High Society and Reiner Knizia's Money. Simple gestures allow you to grab and move tiles. Everything is animated, for a colorful play experience.\nThis newest version uses Game Center for leaderboards and achievements. We plan multiplayer play for a future release."}
