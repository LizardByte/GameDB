Gang Wars has a control configuration that is composed of two attack buttons (punch and kick), as well a jump button to fight against enemies or overcome obstacles. Players have access to a repertoire of techniques by pushing these buttons individually or in combination. Unlike Double Dragon, Gang Wars has fire arms (much like SNK's P.O.W.: Prisoners of War, except Gang Wars has both an assault rifle and a flamethrower), has a small amount of blood, has cut scenes, has two completely different playable characters and has a feature for customizing three fighting statistics (Power, Speed and Guard) for both players. Players will earn a certain number of points for increasing their fighting statistics.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gang-wars", "videos": [{"id": 2434, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Us-AZu_GffU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us-AZu_GffU", "title": "Gang Wars gameplay HD", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Us-AZu_GffU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
