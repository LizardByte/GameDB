Enter Sophia Take, the rightful heir to the misappropriated masterpieces and, now, a would-be cat burglar to boot!\n\nTo reclaim her inheritance, players must help Sophia embark on an exciting and daring heist adventure packed with fast-paced thieving action. Armed only with a talent for misdirection and the friendship of two like-minded portrait purloiners, she sets out to steal back what was once hers\u2026\n\nPacked with thought-proving dilemmas and high-security measures, The Marvellous Miss Take turns the stealth genre on its head by using organised chaos to keep players on their toes. Successfully pilfering portraits isn\u2019t as easy as it may seem: wandering guards decide their patrol routes on the fly, security cameras keep watch over everything and even innocent gallery goers just visiting to admire the art might raise the alarm if they see something suspicious. Only by using quick wits and even quicker reflexes can players hope to grab the loot and escape unseen \u2013 there\u2019s no option for violence and the clock ticking!", "summary": "The stealth genre gets turned on its head in The Marvellous Miss Take - the only heist adventure that invites you to steal with style!
