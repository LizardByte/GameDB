From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.\n\nHaving just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N9YvopAJEgo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N9YvopAJEgo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N9YvopAJEgo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N9YvopAJEgo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N9YvopAJEgo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "GTA Vice City - Full Game Walkthrough in 4K", "description": "Grand Theft Auto Vice City Full Game Walkthrough / Guide video with all 62 missions - 4K Ultra HD 60 fps [Played on PC]\n\nRockstar Games Walkthrough Videos Playlist: https://bit.ly/2RP61Bl\n\n\u25ba YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/GTASeriesVideos\n\u25ba INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/GTASeriesNews\n\u25ba FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/GTASeriesNews\n\u25ba TWITTER: https://twitter.com/GTASeries\n\u25ba DISCORD: https://discord.gg/GTASeries\n\n0:00 Intro & Mission #1 - In the beginning...\n6:11 Mission #2 - An Old Friend\n7:32 Mission #3 - The Party\n13:36 Mission #4 - Back Alley Brawl\n19:41 Mission #5 - Jury Fury\n23:56 Mission #6 - Riot\n27:19 Mission #7 - Treacherous Swine\n30:30 Mission #8 - Mall Shootout\n33:44 Mission #9 - Guardian Angels\n39:46 Mission #10 - Four Iron\n42:43 Mission #11 - Demolition Man\n49:21 Mission #12 - The Chase\n54:56 Mission #13 - Phnom Penh '86\n59:49 Mission #14 - Sir, Yes Sir!\n1:03:43 Mission #15 - Two Bit Hit\n1:06:50 Mission #16 - The Fastest Boat\n1:10:00 Mission #17 - Supply & Demand\n1:15:05 Mission #18 - Death Row\n1:20:55 Mission #19 - All Hands On Deck!\n1:26:05 Mission #20 - Rub Out\n1:31:22 Mission #21 - Shakedown\n1:35:47 Mission #22 - Bar Brawl\n1:40:06 Mission #23 - Cop Land\n1:46:02 Mission #24 - Love Juice\n1:51:05 Mission #25 - Psycho Killer\n1:53:36 Mission #26 - Alloy Wheels of Steel\n1:56:22 Mission #27 - Messing with the Man\n1:58:55 Mission #28 - Hog Tied\n2:02:56 Mission #29 - Publicity Tour\n2:08:31 Mission #30 - Stunt Boat Challenge\n2:13:35 Mission #31 - Cannon Fodder\n2:17:43 Mission #32 - Naval Engagement\n2:22:13 Mission #33 - Juju Scramble\n2:26:00 Mission #34 - Bombs Away!\n2:29:25 Mission #35 - Dirty Lickin's\n2:31:49 Mission #36 - Trojan Voodoo\n2:36:28 Mission #37 - Road Kill\n2:37:40 Mission #38 - Waste the Wife\n2:40:01 Mission #39 - Autocide\n2:43:57 Mission #40 - Check Out at the Check In\n2:47:44 Mission #41 - No Escape?\n2:53:01 Mission #42 - The Shootist\n3:00:16 Mission #43 - The Driver\n3:04:05 Mission #44 - The Job\n3:12:52 Mission #45 - Loose Ends\n3:17:03 Mission #46 - Gun Runner\n3:21:28 Mission #47 - Boomshine Saigon\n3:24:19 Mission #48 - Sunshine Autos\n3:25:52 Mission #49 - V.I.P.\n3:30:14 Mission #50 - Friendly Rivalry\n3:32:54 Mission #51 - Cabmaggedon\n3:36:16 Mission #52 - Spilling the Beans\n3:43:53 Mission #53 - Hit the Courier\n3:47:48 Mission #54 - Pole Position Club\n3:48:31 Mission #55 - Checkpoint Charlie\n3:52:15 Mission #56 - Distribution\n3:54:46 Mission #57 - Recruitment Drive\n4:00:23 Mission #58 - Dildo Dodo\n4:05:00 Mission #59 - Martha's Mug Shot\n4:12:13 Mission #60 - G-spotlight\n4:18:31 Mission #61 - Cap the Collector\n4:21:44 Ending / Final Mission #62 - Keep your Friends Close...\n4:29:59 End Credits\n4:35:42 Post Ending Phone Calls\n\nMODS\n- CLEO (https://cleo.li/)\n- Widescreen fix (https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp)\n- Project 2DFX (https://thirteenag.github.io/p2dfx)\n- SilentPATCH (https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch) \n\n#GTAViceCity #RockstarGames #GTASeriesVideos\n\nABOUT US\n\nGTA Series Videos is a dedicated fan-channel in no way tied to Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive.\n\nHere you can find all the latest news, video walkthroughs and official trailers of the most successful video games published by Rockstar Games, including Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne, L.A.
