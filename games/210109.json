After an uneasy peace, they have both decided to conquer the entire land. But is it their own idea, or has the wizard Horus corrupted them both?\n\nBattle for Eastland is a real-time strategy game, with a large number of magical forces. Each of the two sides has a distinct class list, and ranges from the basic (shamans and warriors), to the magical (dragons and golems). In total, 30 different troops are included. In addition, as a powerful wizard, you have the ability to drop game-changing spells on the battlefield, running off a recharging mana bar. By having your troops kill enemies, you will increase in level, which gives you access to the higher-end troops, spells, and research. Your experience is kept between battles in the campaign and skirmishes, opening up new tactics as time goes on. Single-player campaigns for both Draco and Phoenix are included, and previous levels may be replayed at any time. Also, 16 multi-player and skirmish maps are included. Finally, a level editor will let you create your own levels.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mythical-warriors-battle-for-eastland"}
