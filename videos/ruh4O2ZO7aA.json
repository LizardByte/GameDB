Released for the PlayStation Vita, it is a spin-off of the Silent Hill video game series. It features a player-created protagonist who receives the titular book on their birthday, which contains their entire life story, and makes changes to it with unforeseen and often unfavorable consequences. Book of Memories features gameplay elements from role-playing games: as the player character traverses the dungeons and defeats monsters there, they gain experience points and thus improve their respective abilities. The character progresses from each themed level by collecting pieces of a puzzle and then solving the puzzle. Five endings are available based on the character's alignment; the sixth is a joke ending in the tradition of previous Silent Hill games.\n\nBook of Memories entered development in summer 2010. Konami intended for the game's content to be oriented towards short multiplayer sessions on a handheld console, which was a departure from the single-player gameplay of previous Silent Hill titles. The narrative concept of Book of Memories was inspired by the fictional Book of Lost Memories in Silent Hill game lore, with the Book of Memories conceptualized as the literal story of a person's life. Daniel Licht returned to score its soundtrack; Rob King and voice actor Troy Baker contributed a track, which featured vocals by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Baker's background vocals. Upon release, Book of Memories received mixed reviews. Critics remarked on its departure from the perceived trappings of the Silent Hill franchise, and were divided on its place within the series: some wrote that it succeeded as an enjoyable dungeon crawler, while others criticized it as neither a faithful Silent Hill title nor a good dungeon crawler.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ruh4O2ZO7aA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ruh4O2ZO7aA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ruh4O2ZO7aA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ruh4O2ZO7aA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ruh4O2ZO7aA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Silent Hill: Book of Memories - Longplay [PSVita]", "description": "Longplay Playlists: \n\nNintendo Entertainment System [NES]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuA21NejABKJ45xA5B4yBukk\n\nSuper Nintendo Entertainment System [SNES]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuC-n39eblYPHMjwiovNOwX6\n\nNintendo 64 [N64]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuBq-yWdOrJyfkcxOIrOfGrS\n\nGameCube [GC]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6OuOtW13E8&list=PLBJxr3mmntuAXDy_v7z7V-FavPBYAKJCj\n\nNintendo Wii [Wii]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVPnwT8Xap8&list=PLBJxr3mmntuDTPGvEKrtwqrGmwEQNFryW\n\nNintendo Wii U [WiiU]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cccn_8QNkR0&list=PLBJxr3mmntuCXJBvCjQ2h76LNw1Sanc_n\n\nNintendo Switch [Switch]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpahC1d-RF8&list=PLBJxr3mmntuDpkOSJLQ6ILq3Ub3QAoHsB\n\nGameBoy [GB]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuACvnvqURkHwbf-TIvBd7OG\n\nGameBoy Color [GBC]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO0Lc6MAKW4&list=PLBJxr3mmntuDGzmv5lwpdvtMV_umGBfMZ\n\nGameBoy Advance [GBA]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuCGqshiCDesydMNkKsGmaeZ\n\nPlaystation 1 [PS1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmVmk-_m21k&list=PLBJxr3mmntuDcrOYtYtIXoLOliuunNONx\n\nPlaystation 2 [PS2]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuCIV4Ci4dRwo3wbmkWNhQWS\n\nPlaystation 3 [PS3]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuBJRLndKASQI2PRxvkfIo4c\n\nPlaystation 4 [PS4]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuBpikBbSkry2X5nU6z1pqvS\n\nPlaystation Portable [PSP]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuChbrjTTvLDa4T2893GV-Wj\n\nPlaystation Vita [PSVita]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuCvXpwRJ3VthV6yrbnr11yG\n\nSega Genisis / Mega Drive\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9zEuaBQaQo&list=PLBJxr3mmntuAriYfkerIppuEj438vNGnT\n\nSega 32x\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i1ALxfEROc&list=PLBJxr3mmntuDDjZ43RA4jOgcrNPDgyasc\n\nPC\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJxr3mmntuBuZxsFH6POafq2YLFPqIZt\n\nSilent Hill: Book of Memories is a 2012 dungeon crawler video game developed by WayForward Technologies and published by Konami.
