Little did you know, it was not a \u2018normal\u2019 day at all! You find Team Rocket has infested your town and is trying to steal the Professor\u2019s Pokemon. And upon bumping into one of the grunts, he uses his Drowzee to just randomly teleport you away to a random island. Not that he cares what happens to you afterwards!\n\nAnd this is where the main plot of the game starts. You find yourself in the beach of an uninhabited, nameless island and now your mission is to head back home!\n\nVenture into the bunch of islands you find around you by surfing amidst them and gradually discover the dark secrets of the islands. Collect pieces of information from different sources and puzzle-piece them together to unveil the dark, gruesome mysteries that remained hidden within the islands, about which the rest of the world had never known! Theorize some of the unexplained mysteries and realize the others through clues scattered around the island.", "summary": "Pokemon Stranded departs from traditional Pokemon games in a number of ways. To begin with, there are no Gyms or traditional Pokemon Trainers, no badges, no Pokemon Centers or Marts, and so forth. In addition, the game\u2019s main story will be relatively short and straightforward, but there will be thousands of side stories to follow along the way. The majority of game updates will focus on adding new side quests.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-stranded"}
