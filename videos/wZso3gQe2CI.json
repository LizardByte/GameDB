I did like it, but apparently, the game improves if you check out all the bonus stuff so... I'll do that... maybe.\n\nI didn't get all the endings here since there was no walkthrough (well, there is but I only knew about it after recording. More excuse for you to play it, eh? There's bonus content behind getting all of them I think.)\n\nIf there's one game I'd recommend you check out yourself it's this one. I didn't go over a lot of the story and I think the context from the other endings is really good to know. \n\nSince this was my first playthrough I was unaware of what I had to do mostly. But after recording I did go back and do all the other things and I recommend you do too.\n\nCool game I'd say. The art is nice and I recommend you pick this up.
