Although the game is named after Macross Frontier, all current Macross series (with the exception of Macross II: Lovers Again) are included. Players create two pilots (a main pilot and a wingman) and fight in the many memorable battles of the Macross timeline.\nThe developers, Artdink, are also known for the Gundam Battle PSP series. Macross Ace Frontier uses a slightly modified version of the Gundam Battle engine, and therefore has many notable similarities to Gundam Battle Universe.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/macross-ace-frontier"}
