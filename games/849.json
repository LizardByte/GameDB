The game is the second in a series of Rise of Nations games by Big Huge Games.\n\nThrones and Patriots expanded on a variety of features in the original game, such as new monuments (called \"Wonders\"), nations, governments, and campaigns. It adds six nations, 4 new conquer-the-world modes, and the \"Patriot\" special general unit and the senate building. Gameplay still remains similar to Rise of Nations, with its wide span of ages and players still manage and expand their nations at the macro and micro levels. However, Thrones and Patriots has campaigns which offer more turn-based strategy features than the original and the ability to make decisions outside of combat. Up to eight players can play in multiplayer matches, with artificial intelligence being able to fill slots at the server host's choice. Various features were added to the game in an attempt to balance gameplay, including the addition of armed caravans and merchants.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rise-of-nations-thrones-patriots"}
