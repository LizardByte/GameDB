Soon after his arrival, the Spartan spots a basilisk climbing over the city walls and gives chase. During his chase, Kratos confronts the Persian King inside the city and kills him. Taking the King's power to summon the Efreet, he then encounters the basilisk and kills it. After defeating the basilisk, he witnesses the sun fall from the sky, plunging the world in darkness. Following the dim remaining light on the horizon, Kratos fights his way through the city of Marathon, along the way encountering the black fog of Morpheus, which now covers the land in darkness.\n\nGod of War: Ghost of Sparta\nThe Oracle foretold that the demise of Olympus would come not from the Titans; but by a Marked Warrior, a mortal. The Olympian Gods Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares sieges a village of Sparta and interrupts the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand to watch over him, and kidnaps Deimos. Kratos attempts to stop Ares but is swept aside and scarred across his right eye by the violent Olympian. Ares prepares to kill the young Kratos for attacking him. Athena stops Ares and tells him they only came for the Marked Warrior, not to take the boy's life. Taken to the Domain of Death, Deimos is imprisoned and tortured by the God of Death, Thanatos.", "summary": "God of War: Origins Collection (known as God of War Collection \u2013 Volume II in Europe and Australia) is a remastered port of the two PlayStation Portable instalments in the series\u2014Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta\u2014for the PlayStation 3 on a single Blu-ray Disc.\n\nGod of War: Origins Collection features native 1080p high-definition video, anti-aliased graphics at 60 frames per second, DualShock 3 rumble features, Trophies, and is the only God of War release to feature Stereoscopic 3D.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-origins-collection", "videos": [{"id": 39218, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "as3FIAbR4zI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as3FIAbR4zI", "title": "God of War Origins Collection (PS3)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/as3FIAbR4zI/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
