A. is a superior game to Robo Aleste, but I think its one of those games thats going to have mixed opinions.  All the Aleste games seem to follow same formula with each game evolving from the previous and with Robo Aleste the last in the series I think its final form is the better game.\r\n\r\nHard Difficulty was selected to play.  The bosses still seem rarther simple in that they seem to follow a fixed pattern/firing stratagy.  Robo Aleste was a little more frantic so you endup just dodging shots more then actually shooting the boss.\r\n\r\nAs YTube only supports 30 fps, I have uploaded an interpolated version, otherwise you dont see all the gfx/effects. This causes the image to dim and blur abit so to see the 60 fps version you can watch or download from Archive.org via the Longplays site.\r\n\r\nTechnical Note: For some reason, the Gens Avi recorder put out files with different fps rates when splitting (60/50). When forced into nosplit, the resulting file is 60 fps but the first 5 mins of video is a corrupted mess (gfx and audio).  I had to record the first level in camtasia and compine the two files.  Ive not encountered this issue before. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDoac4j2E2g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDoac4j2E2g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDoac4j2E2g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kDoac4j2E2g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [138] M.
