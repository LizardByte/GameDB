Each level is a new, larger, random maze to solve. Find tools and supplies abandoned by earlier, failed expeditions, try to avoid the traps, and encounter dangerous animals and the fearsome Guardians as you seek the three sacred Talismans of Ra the Sun-God. This faithful, retro-styled recreation of the original shareware classic from 1987 also offers optional new game features including new tools and hazards, and controls that allow you to tone down Animal Ferocity and the dangers of traps to suit your preference.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scarab-of-ra"}
