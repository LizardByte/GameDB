Use power slams, irish whips, elbow drops, atomic drops, pile drivers and moves off the ropes to earn that win!\nEarly challengers will start out easy, but will become increasingly difficult as you fight your way to a title bout. As the game becomes more difficult, you must decide whether to go for the raw power ring out, or methodically pound your foe into into a daze and then go for the ring out. Let the mayhem begin!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tumble-wrestling"}
