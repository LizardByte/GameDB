The \u201cUnited Peoples Front,\u201d designated by the US Government as a terror group, claimed responsibility for this hostage incident. The situation is still ongoing, further investigation and situation reports are under the jurisdiction of FISA. \n\nThe events on the offshore oil rig comes shortly after the failed assassination attempt of newly elected governor Whitfield. The LSPD is still working closely with the Highway Patrol, Protective Services, and Federal Officials to ensure Governor Whitfield's safety following the failed assassination attempt during a political event at LSPD HQ last month.  \n\nLSPD intel which helped dictate this policy change continues to indicate an abnormally high risk of criminal activity off the immediate coast of Los Sue\u00f1os, emboldened by the remoteness of offshore environments. Three of the new areas we are focusing our maritime efforts on are: natural resource production, island operations, and watercraft. \n\nNew LSPD maritime capabilities, in cooperation with the Los Sue\u00f1os C.O.A.S.T. (California Offshore Air and Sea Team), facilitated a rapid response to the hostage incident on HeavyWell A-101. A UH-60 helicopter is now allocated for rapid response and reconnaissance with our SWAT teams. Separate from exclusive maritime V.B.S.S. and ATLAS equipment, there are additions to the general SWAT armory: the MK17, GA51, M14S-16, MP5SD6, and G3 rifles are intended to help address the need for all SWAT units to handle increasingly dangerous threats at distance.  \n\nThe V.B.S.S (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) exclusive uniform gear is requisitioned from Naval Special Operations unit surplus: Eli-Tec Helmet, Phoenix Flight Suit, TP-1E Carrier, Pheonix Gloves, and Panama Boots. \n \nThe uniform for the ATLAS Association, supplied to the LSPD via a tactical support network: Sallet T5X Helmet, Phantasm LS-911 Carrier, ATLAS PRO Top, OxFort Pilot Hard Knuckles, ATLAS PRO Pants, Salmon 4D GTX Boots. \n\nDisclaimer: Base game required to play Dark Waters DLC.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbxznEErPZQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbxznEErPZQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbxznEErPZQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbxznEErPZQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BbxznEErPZQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ready or Not: Dark Waters - Official Trailer", "description": "Ready or Not: Dark Waters sets the challenge of bringing order to chaos within amphibious operations whilst also navigating turbulent weather/environmental conditions on the open sea.
