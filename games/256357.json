Your task is to rearrange board tiles using pre-defined operations to assembly either compact image or pattern. One could say that game mechanics is a combination of the jigsaw puzzle and the 15-puzzle.\nThe game features 96 hand-crafted levels divided into 5 level sets that ensure that the difficulty curve is not so steep. But do not be fooled - to finish all the levels is definitively not a piece of cake. When in trouble, try to spot a hidden trick that each level has in it.\nThere are 3 game modes: jigsaw-like image assembly, number tiles ordering and pattern recreation. Does the level count seem to low? Feel free to generate a random level for each game mode with the in-build level generator.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flipinity"}
