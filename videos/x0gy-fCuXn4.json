{"id": "x0gy-fCuXn4", "snippet": {"title": "WinBack: Covert Operations [Ps2] - Trailer", "description": "WinBack (known as WinBack: Covert Operations in North America and Operation: WinBack in Australia and Europe) is a third-person shooter video game developed by Koei's Omega Force studio for the Nintendo 64 in 1999 and PlayStation 2 in 2000-2001. A second game with no related storyline, WinBack 2: Project Poseidon, produced by Cavia for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox game consoles, was released on April 25, 2006.\n\nThe story follows one Jean-Luc Cougar, a secret agent infiltrating a laser satellite's command center. Gameplay revolves around its innovative cover system, in which the player takes cover behind corners and then ducks out to shoot. The player cannot move while shooting; instead, the control stick is used to aim, a task made easier by the fact that every weapon is equipped with a laser sight.\n\n\n\nDevice:\nPlaystation Classic\nBleemsync 1.2\nOTG\nSandisk Cruzer Blade 128 GB\n\nCapture:\nEzcap 284 hd video capture", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0gy-fCuXn4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0gy-fCuXn4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0gy-fCuXn4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0gy-fCuXn4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x0gy-fCuXn4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "WinBack: Covert Operations [Ps2] - Trailer", "description": "WinBack (known as WinBack: Covert Operations in North America and Operation: WinBack in Australia and Europe) is a third-person shooter video game developed by Koei's Omega Force studio for the Nintendo 64 in 1999 and PlayStation 2 in 2000-2001.
