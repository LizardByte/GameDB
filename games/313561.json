The mod featured a wide variety of maps, new progression, unique camos, remastered weapons, custom attachments, and more. The original MW2 killstreaks made a return as well, completely changing the way Modern Warfare Remastered feels and plays.\n\nOn August 15th, 2024, just one day before the mod was set to release, Activision Publishing, Inc. sent a cease-and-desist letter to the members of the H2M-Mod team, effectively rendering the mod defunct. While the mod team ceased all activity on the project, a playtester leaked a build of the mod, making it available to the public.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/h2-multiplayer-mod", "videos": [{"id": 122680, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "VwBEmMPxuRU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBEmMPxuRU", "title": "H2M-MOD Official Trailer (MW2 Remastered Mod)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VwBEmMPxuRU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
