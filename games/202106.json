The system of acrobation and movement around the space station is even juicier now, enriched by combat mechanics (you can shoot space robots!), and the new architecture of levels, that encourages exploration and checking every corner of the station.\n\nIt will be densely packed with skirmishes, jumping, collecting upgrades, and mediocre jokes! In short: we want to deliver modern Metroidvania in VR!\n\nWe arrive at an abandoned space station where we have detected some traces of activity. Who manages the station, why did its defensive robots decide to attack us and how to get out of it at all?\n\nWe'll find out on our next acrobatic adventure. We will be accompanied by our faithful companion controlled by artificial intelligence - Alsha. Her voice will guide us through new challenges, helping us survive in difficult situations and giving us encouragement when needed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yupitergrad-2-the-lost-station", "videos": [{"id": 68405, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "2MwVVpluOck", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwVVpluOck", "title": "Yupitergrad 2: The Lost Station - Reveal Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2MwVVpluOck/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
