It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. \n \nYou are squire to Lady Catherine of the King's Own Retainers, sent on a secret mission across England to find the heir at any cost. Your search has brought you to the Fair at Crook\u2019s Field\u2014but you discover a much stranger festival being held on the outskirts. The Goblin Market is in full swing, and any one of its denizens might hold a clue to finding the Prince, or offer experiences you can hardly dream of. \n \nWill you be tempted by the fortune-teller and her young apprentice? Dazzled by the alchemist and his golden promises? Drawn into the tent of marvels, and to the dancers who hide behind their veils? Or will you stay loyal to your Lady Catherine\u2014and perhaps even become more than a squire to her. \n \nThe Market, so they tell you, can provide all these things and more\u2014as long as you\u2019re prepared to pay the price\u2026", "summary": "You are squire to Lady Catherine of the King's Own Retainers, sent on a secret mission across England to find the heir at any cost.
