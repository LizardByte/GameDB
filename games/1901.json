Command & Conquer would have been available exclusively on Electronic Arts' Origin distribution service.\n\nThe game was originally announced as Command & Conquer: Generals 2, a direct sequel to 2003's Command & Conquer: Generals. It was then re-purposed in August 2012 as what would have been the first in a series of free-to-play games set in the Command & Conquer universe. The skirmish multiplayer platform was slated for release for free around Christmas 2013, with 'pay per play' campaign missions releasing by Q1 2014.\n\nHowever, on October 29, 2013, EA ceased development of Command & Conquer and shut down Victory Games, citing negative feedback over the economy-based experience as a reason", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 1716, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "80_x6bmzluc"}, {"id": 1717, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "q3CXrvuBHAU"}]}
