But when vocalist Leila begins seeing bad omens, she\u2019s sure their trip will be completely doomed~\n\nDitzy and skittish Leila is Pupula Duplex's bassist and lead vocalist. She lives by self-imposed superstitions, so when she starts picking up on omens and strange happenings, she realizes their visit to an old Astoria house will only end in doom. Will this self-identified Cassandra be vindicated?\n\nPupula Duplex's spunky and handsome founder, drummer, and front man. The old house's mysteries are no match for Brodie's relentless optimism, but he's too airheaded to figure out any of the answers himself. Still, he'll keep the rest of the band happy!\n\nElegant and meticulous Pupula Duplex's keyboardist sheds her sophisticated attitude only when given the chance to rock out. Vyvienne refuses to let a mere haunting get her down.\n\nDakota is mercurial, mysterious, and crass - great qualities for the lead guitar and backup vocalist. Our gothy rockette relishes in teasing Leila, so the strange goings-on in the \"haunted\" house are an unexpected delight. An insatiable appetite for mischief disguises the keen and perceptive mind beneath.", "summary": "The young members of Pupula Duplex, a hungry new punk band from the Portland area, gets far more than they bargained for when their weekend lodging in a 140-year-old house quickly leads them somewhere out of time haunted by a desperate and dreaming intelligence.\n\nWandering long hallways stocked with strange clocks that never display the same time twice, the musicians must cooperate to uncover the truth of this strange house and its former residents to escape \u2014 all while getting themselves ready for their upcoming gig!", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/haunted-house-of-rock"}
