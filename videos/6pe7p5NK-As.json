Yet nobody reviewed the PS4 version at all. Both versions were reviewed by four critics each, which four critic reviews is the minimum for tallying the reviews together for the overall score.\n\nThe highest score for the Xbox One version comes from TheXboxHub, who gave it 3 stars (which is 60 on Metacritic), stating that \"Well priced, full of content and even delivering a local multiplayer option, you won\u2019t be wowed by what this brings to the motorsport scene, but it\u2019s worth a look if you\u2019ve exhausted all other racing options.\" Likewise, the Switch version's highest score on Metacritic is from PureNintendo, which gave it an 8/10. As Kristie Summers, who wrote the review, puts it: \"Ultimate Racing 2D is a simple game that gets the core features of the top-down racing genre just right.\"\n\nThe lowest score for the Xbox One version comes from Xbox Tavern, who gave it a 3.9/10, stating that the game \"sadly belies the actual experience on offer here. While there\u2019s an impressive number of vehicles and tracks, the actual racing part feels flat, uninspiring and, quite frankly, boring. Multiplayer could be good for a laugh, but even that will wear thin before long. Racing fans may be able to eke out some more enjoyment, but for others just looking for a fun little run around you\u2019re best off steering clear of this title.\"\nOver on the Switch camp, the lowest score comes from Nintendo Life, as it gave the game a 4/10, saying that \"top-down racers, whilst never boasting the same level of depth as their 3D counterparts, are reliably accessible. They tend to put a playful spin on what is otherwise an often daunting gameplay experience for newcomers, allowing almost anyone to dive right in immediately. Ultimate Racing 2D succeeds in this respect, boasting simplistic gameplay that is incredibly easy to get to grips with. The problem, though, is that it isn\u2019t much fun \u2013 at all.\"\n\nDespite the PS4 version not getting any attention from critics (let alone PlayStation-centric ones), it does have a global player rating of 4.07 out of 5, at least according to its page on PlayStation Store, with 60% of the 104 ratings being 5 star ratings, while 15% gave it 4 stars. 13% of PS4 owners who played the game gave it 1 star, while only 2% gave it 2 stars.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pe7p5NK-As/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pe7p5NK-As/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pe7p5NK-As/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pe7p5NK-As/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pe7p5NK-As/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Ultimate Racing 2D - PlayStation 4 Gameplay", "description": "Ultimate Racing 2D is the ultimate top-down racing game, with 35 racing classes, over 45 tracks, career mode, championship mode and local multiplayer.\n\nMake your way from Karts to Formula Racing in the extensive career mode, play local multiplayer with up to 8 players or create your own custom championship.
