To see a fixed version of this walkthrough, please click/tap here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKlfDblDSRU\n\nA walkthrough of the second and final Tonka video game developed by Data Design Interactive. I haven't seen one on YouTube yet, so this is the first one. It is one of my all-time favorite Tonka video games of my childhood. It's also my first walkthrough video of a Tonka PC game.\n\nLevel-by-level comments:\n\nCareer Mode: This is actually the professional mode, as Tonka Joe, the one and only character in the game, considers it. I played through all the default tracks and unlocked all the additional body designs, paint jobs, decals, and sets of wheels. Inspired by various highlights of Monster Jam and Bigfoot 4x4 from over the years, I pulled off a diverse variety of stunt and freestyle movements. It mostly went well.\n\nEdit Tracks: This section speaks for itself.\n\nQuick Start Mode: This is the section of the game for newbies to start off with. I would have selected it early on, but I figured that I would go for the Career Mode first since that's the primary section of the game.\n\nThis is one of the best Data Design Interactive video games in my opinion since it has an interesting variety of activities, and it's a great way especially for kids to get interested in monster truck video games. However, when played on Windows XP, it's notoriously complicated to both complete the training levels and start driving in large custom tracks without the game crashing to the desktop every single time due to stability flaws. You'd think an official patch for it would have been released. Otherwise, it is fantastic!\n\nThis is also my last video game walkthrough of the year 2021.
