With Nory by your side, you must traverse through the unknown - solving puzzles, exploring crazy environments and doing your darnedest to survive.\n\nThe world is overrun with dark, shadowy monsters. Sure, it would be lovely if we could just talk to these things and hash out our differences - but trust me, they aren\u2019t exactly known for being emotionally reasonable. Who are they? What do they want? What are they? Why are they such jerks? Why so many freakin' questions??? We don\u2019t yet know - best defend yourself by throwing a punch or twelve at these absolute maniacs.", "summary": "This cute adventure platformer follows a tiny blob named Teeto and his obnoxious bunny companion Nory.
