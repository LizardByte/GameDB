Gunthro is a third-generation smitemaster, and a rather ugly man. Smitemasters are hard-bitten, muscled veteran dungeon exterminators that slay hideous beasties in dark places for a living. You know Gunthro will get the job done, and you'll happily pay him for it because you can tell he's The Guy. When the Rasarun king is slain by an officer of Tueno, Gunthro is recruited by Rasarus to defend his country and reclaim its honor. However, as Gunthro searches deeper, he will find that things are not quite as they seem.\n\nDROD: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder is designed as an entry-level offering to the DROD world, with both new players and veterans in mind. The level layout is designed to be more forgiving, with multiple hub areas to explore. The game starts easy, has a smooth learning curve and an integrated online hints system. If DROD has seemed too difficult for you to get far into, then you should be pleased by the design that went into this game, making for a delightful blend of fun and challenge. Each room is a unique, hand-crafted puzzle that you solve by clearing out all the monsters. Game mechanics are turn-based, and by making moves as fast or as slow as you like, you can experience the action and solve puzzles at your own pace. The game features all-new puzzle elements and enhanced level crafting abilities that add more depth to the previous offerings in the franchise.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUb5y9-Z5Xk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUb5y9-Z5Xk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUb5y9-Z5Xk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUb5y9-Z5Xk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PUb5y9-Z5Xk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "DROD 4: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder trailer", "description": "http://www.gog.com/game/drod_4_gunthro_and_the_epic_blunder\n\nBeethro Budkin recounts an epic tale of adventure to his nephews about his grandfather, Gunthro Budkin, and his exploits in the dangerous nation of Rasarus.
