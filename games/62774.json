Farmland and tax revenues decreased, and when the mobs appeared in the palace and attacked the empress, the emperor ordered the commander of the imperial guard, General Suyou, to eliminate the mobs.\n\n30 years later,\n\nIn the second year of the reign of King Yeongwi, even after the first mob eradication, the mobs gradually increased in number in caves and other places, and they began to attack villages again. However, when the old emperor died and a young emperor ascended to the throne, the country became dominated by traitors, and the crown prince Dong So deceived the young emperor and seized power. Dong So did not care about the people's suffering from the mobs, and only focused his efforts on maintaining his own power, strengthening only the imperial guard.\n\nAt this time, King Sura, who was the lord of a small castle in the province as a member of the royal family, recruited an army with the great monk Dharma and prepared for the second operation to eliminate the mobs.", "summary": "In 1998 Wemade Entertainment released their first game under the Mir franchise, sadly no one outside of South Korea and China got opportunity to play.
