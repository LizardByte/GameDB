Take the lead in this physiologically-intense performance on a stage set for one. Watch as layers of knowledge and emotion slough off in swaths of paper and splinters of wood. Grab hold of your surroundings and rouse them to life. What you uncover will disturb, titillate, and reveal something unseen within yourself.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/reveal--1"}
