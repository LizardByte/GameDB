Probably difficulty levels, but I'm not sure. \"Innocent\" could sound like a difficulty, like the easiest one, but \"latin lover\" sounds like it would change how the music sound/plays. I did a quick test on the first level with the different settings, didn't notice much difference. Should maybe have played the whole first stage, as I only quickly had a look/listen. So, maybe they DO alter the music? Or... maybe it is just difficulty (probably), donno. Couldn't find the manual for the game :(\n\nNo real ending/outro to the game, it just resets back to the menu, so I was told to add something in the end so it didn't just go from displaying the score to nothing.\n\nWeird how there is a code system (for levels), but I was only given a code ONCE, it was on level 4 (Cry of Love), that goes to level 5. Wonder why the other levels doesn't give a code. I don't even get one if I lose on a level. So, it seems like only one code is obtainable in the game.\n\nI find this female android hot :P\n\nSome comments:\n\nTrenton Webb (Amiga Format 15 (Oct 1990)):\nExtase is a deactivated android that's been discovered in an alien system.

One of the most original games and one of the best games of all time. It will have its shrine one day in the museums. This game is unique so far in that it really perfected interactive soundscapes, creating a synergistic experience that's just indescribable. Every action you take in the game has a sound effect that is rendered in such a way as to perfectly match the background music in tempo and style, off-beat, on-beat, everything! On top, each level has its own completely unique sound fx and music, getting wilder and faster as you progress to get the android closer to consciousness. And what kind of futuristic and awesome avant-garde new wave sound this game delivers. The player creates his own soundscapes, dragging himself further and further into this games \"noir\" ambience.\n\nbVork - 2007-03-16 (Lemon Amiga)\nUnique, beautiful, and enthralling. The interactive music is fantastic, and one of the many reasons I think St\u00e9phane Picq is the greatest game music composer ever. The graphics are beautifully minimalist. The android somehow manages to blur the line between pretty and creepy. The gameplay itself is a lot of fun. The computer AI is very good and even reacts to what you do. If you leave it alone, it'll leave you alone. But if you start causing sparks and stealing parts, it'll do the same to you. Two-player mode is a lot of fun too, because of the sheer chaos that can ensue (and the wonderful music caused by that chaos). \n\n10/10. Absolutely perfect in everything it does.\n\nDirk_the_Daring - 2005-08-07 (Lemon Amiga)\nForget Rez, Extase is the first game with real interactive music. Every sound in Extase (all of them with explendid quality) are desingned to create the background music for each level (and they change on every level), u have to see it to believe.\nThe game is based on the great puzzle game of Purple Saturn Day, but more advanced and complex\n\n\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extase_(video_game)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EBgoJj091z8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EBgoJj091z8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EBgoJj091z8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EBgoJj091z8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EBgoJj091z8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Amiga Longplay [031] Extase", "description": "Questions?: http://youtu.be/aZ1bcsIgwWM\n\nWhat a great game :)\n\nI wonder what the different things (innocent/latin lover/young cannibal) are for.
