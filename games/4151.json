Bustin' Out was released for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and N-Gage in the fourth quarter of 2003. As the title suggests, the Sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game."}
