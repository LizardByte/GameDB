It can be played by one to eight people, with the computer taking the remaining positions. The Kingdom of Illuria, after some severe internal disputes, has setthed under a sullen and uneasy peace. This truce has now disappeared, along with the arch-mage who imposed it. The eight empires of Illuria realize that this is their chance for total domination, a very unstable situation. Forces are being mobilized for conquest, and only one Supreme Warlord will prevail.\n\nYour objectives in Warlords are brutally simple: to eliminate all organized opposition to your rule. To do this, you will have to control all eighty cities in the lands of Illuria, and thereby eliminate all seven opponents. There are many ways to achieve this, and brute force is just one of them. you might ally with dragons or wizards, or have your Heros search out and wield magical swords that will tip the battle in your favour. Clever military tactics and even economic warfare are possibilities too.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/warlords--1"}
