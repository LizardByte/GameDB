A pointless irritating game from the golden era of amiga gaming which should be forgotten alongside the software house and all programmers that were involved in making this game.\n\nYear of release: 1987\n\nOne of the most pointless, irritating waste of space games i have ever played! Totally unplayable, have no idea what the bloody hell i'm doing in the 2nd & 3rd satges, it's just not worth the disk space it uses. Has one of the most patronising laughs when you fail, if you do nothing he turns to you yodels at you which makes you wanna seem him drown in acid, plus the annoying whistle noises when you jump,...ANNOYING, IRRITATING...FUCKING HATE THIS CRUDDY GAME.\nBad Cat?! More like bad game.\n\nHope all you Amiga fans enjoy this upload...YEAH RIGHT!\n\nPlease note: NONE of my game uploads are emulated in any way whatsoever, they are 100% original recordings by myself taken directly from the original hardware the game was intended for, that way you know you're watching the real thing.\nI will also always state weather i am using any cheats in the game, if not mentioned then i am not using any.\nCheck out my channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/ZEUSDAZ/videos), dedicated to gamers who loved the games of yesteryear.\n\nFeel free to leave comments on my channel and vid's.\n\nKeeping the memory of the Amiga and it's cool games alive!!!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DmCgTNgGTyc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DmCgTNgGTyc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DmCgTNgGTyc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DmCgTNgGTyc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "BAD CAT (AMIGA)", "description": "Zeus presents Bad Cat (un-emulated) for the Amiga A500.
