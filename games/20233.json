In multiplayer mode, they can compete directly with up to three friends or family members on split screen - delivering a gripping \"just one more go\" experience. Summer Stars also leaves it up to the players to decide how far they will be physically involved in the gameplay: the game supports traditional arcade-style controls, as well as motion control via Kinect for Xbox 360, PlayStation Move or Wii.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/summer-stars-2012"}
