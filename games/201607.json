She is a recent graduate of the police academy, an excellent student, and an exceptional athlete. On this morning, she wakes up thinking that this day will be just like any other; unaware that her new assignment on the recent terror attacks plaguing the city will place her directly in the path of an evil genius.\n\nCOPS 2170: The Power of Law is a hybrid of RPG and tactical strategy.
