It\u2019s a sort of dungeon-crawler story-driven, , but you don\u2019t need to know anything about Etrian Odyssey or Made in Abyss in order to fully enjoy this game!\n\nOn the island of Talrega lies the entrance to the Yggdrasil labyrinth, a gigantic desert carved from the roots of the tree of life over millennia; filled with treasures and other valuable items, it attracted explorers from everywhere. What are you looking for? Fame? Money? Or do you just want to test your coaching skills by tackling the maze? What\u2019s at the end?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-odyssey"}
