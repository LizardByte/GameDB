Guess what? They're at war.\n\nBut the war isn't the real point here, it's just what is happening at the time. The player will experience the perspectives of several individuals in a nationalistic and hostile environment. Why do they fight in wars? Are their reasons for fighting good enough? Are they really fighting for what they think they are fighting for?\n\nStep into the shoes of a lowly villager, Dahnzell, entranced by images of glory and a reclusive prince, Nero, starved of answers for profound questions in a fight for clarity and change.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rune-rhetoric"}
