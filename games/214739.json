They include all the usual features you'd expect in this sort of hack; stronger trainers, the ability to catch and train any Pok\u00e9mon you want, and easier access to powerful items. Training most Pok\u00e9mon in the hacks is also much easier; they'll learn egg moves by simply levelling up, won't need to be traded to evolve, and will hatch from eggs extremely quickly. Trainers and wild Pok\u00e9mon are designed around leaving the EXP Share ON from the moment you get it, so switching it off too often isn't recommended. The hacks also allow the use of any Pok\u00e9mon in all modes in the Battle Tree, so you can get some use out of all those Ultra Wormhole Legendaries."}
