Players will be able to launch shield-first into the fray with the superior force of the world's first Super-Soldier at their fingertips and they will need every bit of that strength to overcome a castle that's both an acrobatic playground for the Captain's physical prowess and a house of mystery with enemies and danger at every turn.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/captain-america-super-soldier", "videos": [{"id": 31850, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xqHTljziw6c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHTljziw6c", "title": "Captain America: Super Soldier Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xqHTljziw6c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
