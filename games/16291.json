But as you investigate further, you may notice some suspicious activity including animals that would not normally be found in an area like this and some inconsistencies that lead to more questions. It is up to you to discover the answers.\n\nCraft items, quench your thirst, satisfy your hunger, fend off animals\u2026 What will you really need to escape the island?
