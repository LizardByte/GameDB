As an astronaut, you are assigned the duty of rocketing to the asteroid and blowing it up.", "summary": "An asteroid is on collision course with Earth and it's up to the player to prevent the inevitable catastrophe. \"Mission Asteroid\" is the third text adventure with graphical illustrations by Sierra.
