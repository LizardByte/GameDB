After developing many licensed fighters, The Rumble Fish series was Dimps' first real foray into a 2D competitive fighter which paved the way for their eventual hand in Street Fighter IV & V's development. The game has never seen an official console release and was originally only available on Atomiswave hardware, but in 2012 an updated version was released on the NesicaxLive distribution system in arcades. In November 2020 the Atomiswave version was unofficially ported to the Dreamcast by yzb, allowing players to play the game on physical hardware without having to acquire an actual arcade board.\n\nThe game features unique vector animations, many complex and engaging system mechanics, and a strong cast of characters with varied and interesting playstyles. Combined with its open-ended chain combo system, The Rumble Fish 2 a fun game to pick up and learn but has enough intricacies to entice those looking for something deeper.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-rumble-fish-2", "videos": [{"id": 71962, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "uH53jJexqXI"}, {"id": 71963, "name": "The Rumble Fish 1 & 2 console announcement 2022", "video_id": "1vbvPnSdP2s"}]}
