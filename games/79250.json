The game now has all the club teams of Europe included, with many new features that have never been seen before.\n\nOver 90% of all in-game graphics have been massively enhanced including all player models and textures and improved crowds and stadiums. The in-game animation system has been thoroughly tweaked for a much smoother overall look to the game. There's also a brilliant, new, stylish look to the even bigger and more comprehensive menu system. New close-up penalty shootouts in full 3D gameplay is more silky smooth than ever with improved aftertouch, much improved tackling, a burst of speed for defenders and the ability to wash whites at a much lower temperature. An improved in-game sound system lets you hear the sounds of the game more clearly.\n\nOver 200 European Club Teams are included, all with accurate player skills, etc., from the English, Scottish, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Dutch and Belgian leagues. Plus the clubs can play in all European Club Tournaments and European Tournament Qualifiers that are for all international European sides.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensible-soccer-european-club-edition", "videos": [{"id": 54057, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "R7ZkzhKr3wI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7ZkzhKr3wI", "title": "Sensible Soccer '98 European Club Edition - World Cup Goals", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R7ZkzhKr3wI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
