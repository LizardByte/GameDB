It is a one-on-one spaceship combat game with each player controlling a ship at the top or bottom of the screen. Between the players is a stream of innocent space ship traffic limiting the possibility of getting a clean shot.\n\nWhen your fuel reaches a high number (like 75 or so) your laser will reach the other side of the screen to get your opponent. Once you fire your laser your fuel drops sharply and you must wait for it to build before you can shoot at your opponent again.\n\nSpace War is Konami's first known original video game design. It was licensed by Taito, who released it as Space Laser (in Europe), and by Game Plan, who released it as Intruder (in North America)."}
