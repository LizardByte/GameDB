You compete with friends or against the computer by placing letters on a board to form interlocking words. You can choose between \"traditional\" play, where new letters must be placed adjacent to existing ones, or \"vertical\" play where new letters can also be placed on top of existing letters to modify the words underneath. The game includes 50 levels, 4 levels of artificial intelligence, and a vast vocabulary of over 180,000 words with either UK or US spelling.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/crosscraze"}
