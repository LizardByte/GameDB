Unfortunately I just realized I could have enabled \"Secret Found\" message on the options yet I never did by the time I finished. And given that this was my second playthrough, well I don't have all the time in the world.\n\nAnyways, here is Hacx in its entirety, enjoy. Also if you're wondering why the texture change MAP15, I was doing my second playthrough on PrBoom+ launching Hacx as an IWAD but that resulted in skipping MAP31, so I decided to use Hacx as a PWAD for Doom 2 (with the save file still working thankfully) in order to play MAP31. It's kind of weird but nothing too big of an issue.\n\nMAP01 - 0:00\nMAP02 - 15:08\nMAP03 - 32:14\nMAP04 - 40:37\nMAP05 - 49:42\nMAP06 - 55:01\nMAP07 - 1:07:10\nMAP08 - 1:19:06\nMAP09 - 1:36:45\nMAP10 - 1:44:31\nMAP11 - 2:00:15\nMAP12 - 2:06:07\nMAP13 - 2:30:06\nMAP14 - 2:39:21\nMAP15 - 2:43:47\nMAP31 - 2:54:23\nMAP16 - 2:57:22\nMAP17 - 2:58:55\nMAP18 - 3:06:33\nMAP19 - 3:08:01\nMAP20 - 3:12:53", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9ipvi8FUls/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9ipvi8FUls/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9ipvi8FUls/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9ipvi8FUls/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9ipvi8FUls/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "HacX: Twitch 'n Kill - Full Playthrough (100%)", "description": "More About HacX Here & Download Links: http://www.drnostromo.com/hacx/\nidgames Archive: https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/hacx/\n\nA full playthrough of Hacx: Twitch 'n Kill with all (possible) secrets earned.
