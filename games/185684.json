The latest version, REbirth edition, is no longer standalone, but it enhances the experience even more and brings you the possibility of playing in areas from other classic Resident Evil titles. Now randomization has been included, which means that items, enemies, door locks and cutscenes will vary (slightly or greatly) every time you start a new playthrough. In addition to this, the order in which you go to the different areas and the choices you make will also affect the story and gameplay. \"Replayable\" is the perfect adjective for this mod. This is a must-play for any fan of classic Resident Evil games. Right now only the first episode (2-3 hours long) is available for this updated version, but episodes 2 and 3 are being worked on, and they will bring even more novelties."}
