This single-player adventure game takes place in a facility on the distant planet of Kepler 37-D, where you have been sent to repair utility systems and get the facility ready for its new owners. You\u2019ll have to use the various computer systems throughout the facility to gather information and aid you in your job. \n \nThe job gets dangerous when the facility is unexpectedly attacked by some hideous unknown creatures. Now the pressure is on as you try to repair the communications unit so you can call for the transport ship. Fortunately, the facility is equipped with auto-defense turrets, which you\u2019ll have to manage wisely to keep the creatures from breaching the facility. You can also use the tank rover to easily dispatch of the creatures before they can get a chance to get through the walls. \n \nIf you're confident in your defenses you may even find a little time to go snooping around the facility while you're making your repairs and discover something interesting or useful. Depending on what you do during your assignment on Kepler 37-D, there are 9 possible endings that you can earn. Will you be happy with how it ends for you or will you try again for a better outcome?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/k37-d"}
