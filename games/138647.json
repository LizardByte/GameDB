This event is known as the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. Higurashi Mei begins ten years later, on June 1993. A girl who lost her family in the disaster, Ichiho Kimiyoshi, decided to visit her now abandoned hometown. There, she ended up discovering monsters she\u2019s never seen before. Ichiho desperately ran away, but got cornered. As she was about to be killed, Ichiho was saved by Tamurahime no Mikoto, who introduced herself as a goddess. Ichiho received from Tamurahime no Mikoto a special power which allows her to fight against the Tsukuyomi, the monsters. And as per Tamurahime no Mikoto\u2019s instructions, she headed towards the Furude shrine ceremonial tools\u2019 shed, the Saiguden. When she entered Saiguden, Ichiho suddenly found herself in a nostalgic, peaceful Hinamizawa. It seems like Ichiho time-traveled to before the disaster.", "summary": "Higurashi When They Cry Mei is a smartphone-based gacha game released in September 3, 2020.
