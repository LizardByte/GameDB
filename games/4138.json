The game was published by the Japanese video game developer Enix (now Square Enix) in Japan and brought to the U.S. by now-defunct 989 Studios.\n\nThe original Japanese game was titled Bust a Move: Dance & Rhythm Action (\u30d0\u30b9\u30c8 \u30a2 \u30e0\u30fc\u30d6 Dance & Rhythm Action Basuto a M\u016bbu Dance & Rhythm Action); in the U.S., it became Bust-A-Groove because the Japanese puzzle series Puzzle Bobble was already going under the name Bust-A-Move for its American incarnation. The game combined PaRappa the Rapper-like rhythm-based gameplay with fighting game elements, including special moves designed to damage the opponent and a focus on head-to-head competitive play.\n\nThe sequel, Bust a Groove 2, unlike its predecessor, was never released in Europe. A third game in the series, Dance Summit 2001 was only released in Japan on the PlayStation 2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
