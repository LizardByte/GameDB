Released on May 4, 2000, it added content, fixed bugs, and made gameplay changes in response to common player complaints.\n\nPrior to its release, the expansion was said to double the amount of room in the game, but that it would not use a duplicate of the map, rather it would be adding new content. It was later found in the previews that Renaissance simply added a mirror world under different rules. The current map became Felucca and Trammel was created, the first one with \"player vs. player killing\" allowed, and the second with only consensual combat.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultima-online-renaissance", "videos": [{"id": 131994, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "9HPfNR7QYBU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HPfNR7QYBU", "title": "Ultima Online Renaissance Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9HPfNR7QYBU/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 498, "name": "Ultima"}]}
