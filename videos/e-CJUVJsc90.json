{"id": "e-CJUVJsc90", "snippet": {"title": "Friday Night Funkin' VS Mickey Mouse - Wednesday's Infidelity Part 2 FULL Week + Cutscenes (FNF Mod)", "description": "Friday Night Funkin' VS Mickey Mouse - Wednesday's Infidelity Part 2 (FULL Week) is a mod created by Jhaix's Team: https://youtu.be/nczLJ61Sn5E \n\nThis Epic Mickey Mouse Mod is for the PC in 2160p Ultra HD, but this time we meet Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Cartoon, Mickey Imposter, and Donald Duck on a Wednesday. Check out Wednesday's infidelity - S Mouse Official Teaser trailer: https://youtu.be/AZOuPpiYhn4\n\nBoyfriend & Girlfriend has his Old Cartoon Style skin like in the VS Chira mod and that's because it's made by the same people. This part 2 of Wednesday's Infidelity is an incomplete build meaning it's not the full version they wanted to release, but they release Wednesday's Infidelity Part 2 early because they didn't want to delay it anymore and don't want leakers releasing Wednesday's infidelity part 2 leaked build. The full version will just have more things like remixes of some songs and some extra sprites, but it does not change much & after that let's hope we get a Wednesday's Infidelity Part 3. Check out Jhaix's channel for more updates. Now lets beat this mouse like how we beat sonic.exe.\n\nFinally, go and download the Mouse mod. His 3rd phase is epic. Oh yeah In this world, the mickey mouse has the same issues as the previous counterpart but we get a better understanding of what happened to the mouse. We can see one of mickey mouse's rivals with Minnie mouse. We'll be playing it on very hard mode for all VS Wednesday's Infidelity Part 2 songs.\n\nWednesday's Infidelity Download:\nhttps://gamejolt.com/games/wednesdayinfidelity/672074\n\nGame Note: Join us to see the adventure of Mickey Mouse, Bf will try his best to keep him happy, as they fight rap battles.\n\nAll Songs from Friday Night Funkin' VS Wednesday's Infidelity Mickey Mouse Part 2 FULL WEEK Mod Timestamp:\n00:00 Game Over Animation\n00:58 Menu\n01:08 Story 1\n01:17 Story 2\n01:22 Story 3\n01:33 Opening\n01:40 FNF Animation 1\n02:25 Wistfulness Song (VS Mickey Mouse 1st Phase)\n03:46 Mickey doesn't feel so good\n04:11 Dejection Song (VS Mickey Mouse 2nd Phase)\n05:21 Laughs 1\n06:46 FNF Animation 2\n07:00 Unknown Suffering Song (VS Mickey Mouse 3rd Phase)\n07:17 Laugh 2\n09:11 Watch out!\n09:55 FNF Animation 3\n10:20 Sunsets Song (Happy Mickey Mouse)\n12:07 Good Ending?\n13:11 Versiculus Iratus Song (Sad Demon vs Prisoner Mouse)\n13:52 Demon Laugh 1\n15:15 Demon Laugh 2\n16:18 NOO!!\n16:44 Carnival In Toyland Song (VS Puppet Mickey)\n18:31 Spring March Song (VS Puppet Mickey)\n21:30 Cravings Song (Vs Chedder)\n21:46 Father!\n23:51 Hunger Pangs Song\n24:21 Father, more!\n26:56 All Weeks | Freeplay\n27:18 Needle Mouse Song (VS Black Imposter)\n31:06 Unknown Defeat Song\n34:21 Too Slow Song\n35:06 Becomes Mouse.EXE\n35:55 I'll Get Everyone\n36:40 Final Transformation\n37:15 Loses\n37:29 Battered Song\n39:48 Accelerant Song\n41:23 Donald Ducks Joins in\n42:00 Donald Dies\n43:18 Vesania Song\n46:32 Kriman't Song (VS Sad Mokey)\n48:39 Kriman't Real Song (Crazy Mokey)\n51:43 Untold Loneliness Song (D-Side Oswald)\n55:02 Leak Song (Mickey vs Mod Leakers)\n55:38 Song Start\n56:46 Mickey Poem\n58:35 Oswald does it again lol\n58:46 Credit\n59:23 Clubhouse Song\n01:01:34 Corp Song\n01:03:19 Last day Song (Play bad = bad path)\n01:05:21 Heck Song\n01:07:01 Demon\n01:09:54 Bad Ending \n01:10:29 Game Over Animations\n01:11:41 Extra / Outro - CommunityGame\n\nMod Creators for VS Wednesday's Infidelity Mickey Mouse Part 2 below \nVS Wednesday's Infidelity V2 FULL WEEK (Cutscenes!)
