Players take on the role of V, a cyber-enhanced mercenary, and embark on a fight for survival filled with story-defining decisions, action-packed gameplay, and unforgettable characters, including rockerboy Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) and FIA sleeper agent Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba).\n\nThis new release is the perfect way to experience every story of the dark future; it also contains the free Update 2.0, which overhauled many of the game\u2019s systems, introducing dynamic skill trees, high-octane vehicle combat, and enhanced enemy and police AI \u2014 as well as adding new weapons, vehicles, and clothes. The release is bolstered with a set of previously released digital goodies available as part of the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d program, available to all who register.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition"}
