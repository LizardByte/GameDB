As a last resort, humanity uses the \"Time-Lock\". This mysterious Sirian artifact contains the power to transport a single person back to a chosen point in time. Because of his bravery in fighting these monsters, Sam \"Serious\" Stone is chosen to use the Time-Lock in hopes that he will defeat Mental and change the course of history.", "summary": "Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a visually upgraded and fully Steam supported remake version of the original high-adrenaline single-play and 16-player co-operative arcade-action FPS.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/serious-sam-hd-the-first-encounter", "videos": [{"id": 37820, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JTbwOukQlDY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTbwOukQlDY", "title": "Serious Sam HD Trailer [HD]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JTbwOukQlDY/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 99, "name": "Serious Sam"}]}
