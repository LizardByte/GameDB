Banbuds knocked it out of the park with that image of him lookin' at Reggie, loved it when I first saw and honestly kinda expected it being turned into a mod sooner or later! As with any joke mod, the music is INSANE, god I love this song a ton, especially with those dialogue breaks that always make me love the mod even more! The art was amazing too, both Banbuds and Reggie look really damn good and all the poses are super expressive, the background was really well made as well with that OneyPlays poster and all that hehe. Did have a bit of an issue with the chart, because there's a lone note at the part where the notes disappear, so I just had to mash and hope I hit it in that part, but other than that it was fantastic! Very cool and really funny mod, hope to see more stuff like this in the future!

Four arrows fly towards the screen forcing you to press them at the right time to the music. Hitting all the arrows in a song counts as a \"Full Combo\", which is very hard to do and takes a lot of time and practice to be able to do consistently and is the main gimmick of my channel, which I showcase in each video. I also include secrets and extra content that might\u2019ve been undiscovered and show them off through instructional and entertaining ways that can be used as guides, as well as occasionally adding my own input on things happening in the video, all done through my creative editing style that focuses on being concise and transformative. In the descriptions I give my in-depth opinion on the video game as well as timestamps for each part of the video.
