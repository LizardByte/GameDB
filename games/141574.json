But doesn\u2019t know he's a piece himself. He won't live long enough to work that out. I won't show him the mercy he showed me.\" - Vikhor \"Stitch\" Kuzmin\n\nThe deadly crack of machine gun fire wipes out a group of CIA analysts. The Perseus hitmen and their leader, Stitch, discover the CIA has created a set of Death Cards for the Perseus terrorist group.\n\nThis violence was years in the making, as Stitch has a score to settle with Russell Adler. Captured during the CIA raid on the Soviet experimental weapons site, Rebirth Island, led by Hudson, Weaver and Adler, Stitch lost his eye to Adler during interrogation. He has had plenty of time in the Gulag to contemplate how his revenge will play out.\n\nFollowing his trail, Adler leads a CIA capture team that includes Operator Zeyna Ossou to storm a New Jersey mall, only to discover that Stitch has been manufacturing enough Nova 6 nerve gas to throw the world off its axis. A trap has been prepared for Adler's team.\n\nRevenge is a dish best served cold.", "summary": "Season 1 is the first batch of post-launch content for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.
