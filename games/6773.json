The maximum level only lasts for a limited amount of shots.\n\nWhen certain ground enemies and buildings are destroyed, money bonuses appear which give a random amount of points each. When the player reaches the end of the stage, the player has to face a boss ship.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 2414, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "tYRq6hLG-VQ"}]}
