It was developed and published by Capcom in Japan only.\n\nPro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! (\"Pro Baseball? Murder Case!\") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops.\n\nThis game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pro-yakyuu-satsujin-jiken"}
