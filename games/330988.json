This version is said to be focused on anime and vocaloid music.\n\nNew Features:\nmaiberry\n- It is an in-game currency that integrates previous music tickets and mailmiles into one. When taking over from the previous work, 10,000 maiberries are automatically converted in batches.\n\nnew slide\n- BREAK notes are also applied at the beginning of the slide, and various slide methods are emerging, such as starting from one point and splitting into two or more, or spreading large.\n\nSegmented result window\n- The part showing the play results has been subdivided, so you can see the number of decisions taken by each note, how many records you have updated, and how many points you need to reach the next rank.\n\nChanges include:\n- Some of the changes are similar to CHUNITHM, developed by the same creators .\n- Change of song selection method\n- The music selection window has been changed from the previous category method to the folder method.\n- Previously, it was a way to start after selecting the difficulty level in the category, but from this time, it was changed to select songs and select difficulty. The previous method is also available, and it is also possible to select another song from the back of the difficulty selection screen.\n- Change of result window\n- The result window shows the scores from GreeN to ORANGE in the center, and instead of showing the achievement rate at the top and the rank at the bottom, it shows the achievement rate in the center, the song name and difficulty at the top, rank & full combo & SYNC on the right, and the rank at the bottom. The method of showing ratings has been changed. The score is displayed in small size on the top screen. Additionally, the achievement rate is displayed as a circular graph on the border of the entire central screen. This notation was used until FiNALE, the last version of the old script.\n- Break effect color change\n- From maimai to ~ ORANGE PLUS, the break effect color has been changed from blue to yellow.\n- Difficulty, rank system renewal\n- Difficulties from 7 to 11 were subdivided from the previous 12-level system, and 7+, 8+, 9+, 10+, 11+ difficulties were newly established. The highest level remains the same at 12 as before.\n- In line with the difficulty renewal, the EXPERT difficulty limit has been changed to 10+. All level 11 EXPERT songs are downgraded to 10+.\n- The rank system has become more detailed, and is shown in the following table.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maimai-pink", "videos": [{"id": 140238, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "MLTCLdHJkY4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLTCLdHJkY4", "title": "\u3010maimai\u3011PiNK\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u66f2\u3000\u300c\u30a2\u30fc\u30b8\u30a7\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30f3\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u300d\u3000from Sta feat.b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MLTCLdHJkY4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 140023, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ytUzw7zfiS8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytUzw7zfiS8", "title": "[maimai PiNK] Glorious Crown (MASTER) SSS 100.10%", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ytUzw7zfiS8/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 140021, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fPd9RtL5WxQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPd9RtL5WxQ", "title": "maimai PiNK [Re:MASTER] Night of Knights / Knight of Nights", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fPd9RtL5WxQ/sddefault.jpg"}]}
