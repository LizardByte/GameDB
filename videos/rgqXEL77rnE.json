Join Cal the golf ball as they battle and chase down the treacherous and dog-napping Bogeys.

Simply tap and drag on Cal to aim and increase their power, and release to send them flying! However, it\u2019s not as easy as simply getting to the hole, each course is patrolled and locked down by treacherous Bogeys! Buy Cal weapons from the shop, arm deadly traps and outsmart your foes to get the upper hand.\n\nDuring your adventure you\u2019ll travel across quaint towns, snowy crypts, fungal forests and more as you travel through utterly unique courses. Mastering each course and completing them in as few moves as possible rewards you with stars and crowns which you can use to increase your rank, unlocking new challenges and outfits for Cal.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgqXEL77rnE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgqXEL77rnE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgqXEL77rnE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgqXEL77rnE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgqXEL77rnE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Par for the Dungeon - Gameplay Trailer", "description": "Golf is boring, Par for the Dungeon is different.
