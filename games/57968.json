Find out who enchanted the statues and why in this charming game set in a small European town.", "summary": "The player interface and game mechanics provide traditional graphical adventure with on screen movement touch points, puzzles and hidden-object search style game play. Objects collected in inventory at the bottom of the screen require the player to drop or drag them onto other items in the scenes to activate or complete needed tasks. During the adventure you will also acquire friendly statues as tag along pets (rooster, gnomes, etc) that help aid in key actions needed to achieve puzzle solutions. An interactive map allows for quick travel to various locations previously explored to reduce scene movement and backtracking.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/royal-detective-lord-of-statues"}
