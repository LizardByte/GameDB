In deathmatch, compete in a free-for-all against other players to score the highest number of kills. In team deathmatch, work with your team to achieve the highest number of collective kills. \n\nThe weapon system in ev.io is a bit different than other browser shooters, like Krunker or Venge, in which you cannot pick up weapons on the map. In ev.io, you choose the primary weapon you start with: a hand cannon, auto rifle or laser rifle. Each of the different primary weapons falls into a different archetype. For example, the auto rifle does low damage but has a fast rate of fire. The laser rifle has high damage but a slow rate of fire. \n\nIn addition to choosing a primary weapon, you can also pick up weapons on the map. There are three possible weapons you pick up: the shotgun, sniper and rocket launcher. The pickup weapons are quite a bit stronger than your primary weapon, but have limited ammo. So you need to make your shots count to take full advantage of them. \n\nThe game also has a pretty complex ability system, which is mostly centered around movement and grenades.\n\nGrenades: You can choose 2 of any 3 grenades: smoke grenades, standard grenades and flash grenades. \n\nMovement: Spend 3 points in any 3: teleportation, jumping and sprint. You can spend 1 point in sprint for example, and 2 in teleport. If you spend all 3 in jumping, you can jump 3 times. \n\nJumping does not use stamina but other things, such as teleportation and sprinting do. The movement mechanics in ev.io are diverse. \n\nCompete on the leaderboard or visit the in-game store to unlock skins and other cosmetics (coming soon). You can also play private games with friends by hitting the share game link in the menu (hit M to access).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwdzCEbgxEQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwdzCEbgxEQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwdzCEbgxEQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwdzCEbgxEQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HwdzCEbgxEQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "ev.io - Launch Trailer - The Best New Browser Based Shooter", "description": "ev.io is a futuristic Halo-esque first person shooter in the browser. \n\n\u25b6 Play now: https://ev.io/\n\nThe game currently supports two game modes.
