Yes, male. Reiji is her older brother, unquestionably a man, but he is also her older sister. And her cat ears are indeed the genuine article \u2014 ones that appear and disappear thanks to a certain impetus, and can\u2019t be taken off. There are certain, complicated circumstances that led to this, but Reiji himself has accepted it. He neither corrects her, nor does he speak effeminately, as he continues his life.\n\nRegardless, this isn\u2019t exactly the daily routine of the Aoba household. Obviously a sister should refer to her brother as a brother, and her cat ears shouldn\u2019t even exist.\n\nOnce I resolve the problem of the fragments of divine power within me, the issue with Erika should be resolved as well \u2014 so Reiji thinks to himself in distress, once again.", "summary": "Aoba Reiji must avoid dying together with Nekogami-sama, the Cat God. A cat-eared girl named Nanahara Fuuko who calls herself a god saves Reiji\u2019s life. However, a sliver of the god\u2019s power still remains inside him. That power is something that shouldn\u2019t be inside of a human. At this rate, not only Reiji, but Fuuko who lacks her power, will both lose their lives. There, they decide to join forces to avoid this unwanted fate! According to Fuuko, her divine power is split into seven fragments, with three of those dwelling inside of Reiji. There\u2019s only one way to safely extract them: to shake Reiji\u2019s heart to the very core, by any means necessary.\n\nFortunately, their school, Mahiro Academy, is soon to go on summer vacation. They don\u2019t have much time left. This summer is going to be a frantic race for their lives!", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-seventh-sign-mr-dot-sister", "videos": [{"id": 137913, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "sz4tjb8hOdQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz4tjb8hOdQ", "title": "The Seventh Sign -Mr. Sister- OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sz4tjb8hOdQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
