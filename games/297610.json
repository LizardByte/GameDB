This Japanese-made role-playing game is heavily influenced by early Ultima installments, having a nearly identical visual style, interface, and gameplay system. The protagonist explores an overhead world map, visiting towns where weapons, armor, items and food can be bought. Food rations are necessary to have for preventing the hero from starving. Experience points and gold are obtained from defeating enemies. Interaction is performed by pressing keys corresponding to commands, such as Move, Question, Enter, etc.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/seiken-densetsu"}
