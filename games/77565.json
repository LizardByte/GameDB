It is a spin-off of the original Vid Grid, which was released in June 1994, and is the third and last entry in the franchise of the same name. \n \nSimilarly with the previous two titles, the main objective of the players is to resolve and finish a jigsaw puzzle on time before the music video that is being played on the background ends. Produced by series creator Norman Beil and conceived as a joint-venture between MCA Nashville and Jasmine Multimedia, Country Vid Grid puts emphasis on country music as its main theme unlike the original Vid Grid and Kid Vid Grid, which were themed after rock music and cartoons respectively. \n \nSongs included: \nTracy Byrd - Watermelon Crawl \nMark Chesnutt - It Sure Is Monday \nJoe Ely - Highways and Heartaches \nVince Gill - What the Cowgirls Do \nGeorge Jones - High-Tech Redneck \nThe Mavericks - What a Crying Shame \nReba McEntire - Why Haven't I Heard from You \nMarty Stuart - Kiss Me, I'm Gone \nTravis Tritt - Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man \nTrisha Yearwood - Wrong Side of Memphis", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/country-vid-grid"}
