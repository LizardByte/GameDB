No story, No background, No plot and No friends. It's just blast or be blasted.\n\nInspired by Williams arcade classic, Defender, Space Tripper delivers probably the most furious shoot 'em-up of the modern era, combined with state of the art graphics.\n\nIf you like your video games tough, then this is for you.\n\nEverything you need comes included. A fast, highly manoeuvrable craft. Enough gun to take out the universe. Absolutely loads of enemies to obliterate, and some seriously mean bosses. Nothing else comes close for that classic arcade experience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/space-tripper", "videos": [{"id": 140462, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xXDg7nxHEOE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXDg7nxHEOE", "title": "Space Tripper 2001 PC - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xXDg7nxHEOE/sddefault.jpg"}]}
