Each player then selects one of their opponents grid coordinates to attack. If part of an opponent ship is on that grid coordinate, it takes a hit. Once all the spaces a ship occupies have been hit, the ship sinks. Sink all of your opponent's ships and you win.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battleship--4"}
