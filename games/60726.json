Once a mighty nation, with the most powerful military in the world and a solid economy, but that time has long since passed following the enthronement of the current Empress Sheila Helman and the parting of the former Prince Patton Misnarge. Despite her status as an empress, she's nothing but a puppet, and the Prime Minister Stessel Romanov carries the actual power. Under his control, the nation is in utter corruption, with obscene levels of poverty and deaths for starvation.\n\nIt's the year LP0006, only four years since the presumed death of the exiled Prince, but rumours have been growing that he's not dead, and a Revolutionary Army is supposedly being formed under the name of this ghost from the past, returning from death to claim his legitimate right to the throne, along with many others that support him in his effort to remove Stessel from power.\n\nIn order to do so, Patton needs help from an old friend he met during the Collapse of Zeth of LP0004, a brutish yet powerful adventurer called Rance, who agreed to lend him his power and joins the Helman Revolutionary Army, with a few conditions. Patton has a deep trust over Rance, who's confident that under his guidance, the revolution will succeed in only 2 months.\n\nRance only has two goals, to find a secret and powerful item said to be stored within Helman's Royal Treasure that could potentially release Sill Plain from the eternal ice she's encased in, and to screw as many cute girls as physically possible, having made the Empress Sheila Helman herself his major goal.\n\nAnd so, the Helman Revolution begins...", "summary": "Rance IX: The Helmanian Revolution is the 12th game in Alicesoft's flagship Rance series.
