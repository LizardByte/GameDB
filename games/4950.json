Choose your character, jump aboard your Jet Ski and rip through the waves to the finish line. In this Kawasaki officially licensed game you get to race around scenic water way locations such as The Thames in London, the Canadian Rockies, through exotic islets in Taiwan, and of course the canals of Venice. There are also 8 Jet Skis to unlock as well as a few more characters, and you can even play with friends in multiplayer. There are usual racing tracks and modes such as Time Trials and Tournaments but there is also a stunt mode where you get to ride around modified layouts of the four locations and do various tricks off of ramps. This mode is also available in multiplayer mode.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kawasaki-jet-ski", "collections": [{"id": 5193, "name": "Kawasaki"}]}
