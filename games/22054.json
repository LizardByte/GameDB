However Achille proves too powerful and strikes down Maximo with one blast of his dark magic, killing him. Now floating in the underworld, Maximo is approached by Grim who reveals that Achille is drilling into the underworld to harvest souls, fueling his undead army. Feeling that he would be out of the job if there are no more dead, Grim makes a deal with Maximo to bring him back to life in exchange for stopping Achille's evil plans; sending him back to the earth in the process where his journey begins.", "summary": "The game is based in the Ghosts'n Goblins universe and features original character designs by Japanese illustrator Susumu Matsushita.\n\nThe character is controlled by the player and can move freely within areas by running, jumping, crouching, and performing other various motions.
