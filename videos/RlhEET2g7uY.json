During this vicious attack, her boyfriend, Major Jeffrey, is killed. From this moment on, it is Kitty against the world. Armed only with a pistol, she sets off to find the culprit of her boyfriend`s (and helicopter`s) demise. Desperate for help, she makes contact with headquarters, but as long as enemy air defence is in place over the island, they can not send reinforcements. During the course of her mission, Kitty crosses paths with an unscrupulous colonel, who, she finds out, is responsible for the downing of her helicopter and the death of her boyfriend. Together with his scientists, the Colonel is up to even more evil than meets the eye.\n\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 PC Hardware \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7 3770K @ 4.20 Ghz\nRAM: 16 GB\nGPU: Nvidia Geforce GTX 970\nOS:  Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\u2591\u2592\u2593 Recording HW/SW \u2593\u2592\u2591\n\nNvidia Shadowplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RlhEET2g7uY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RlhEET2g7uY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RlhEET2g7uY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RlhEET2g7uY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RlhEET2g7uY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "K-Hawk: Survival Instinct (2002) - PC Gameplay / Win 7 on Win 10 (VMware Workstation 12)", "description": "K-Hawk: Survival Instinct (2002) - PC Gameplay / Win 7 on Win 10 (VMware Workstation 12)\n\nSubscribe here \u25ba\u25ba\u25ba http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=FirstPlaysHD\nAlso SHARE, COMMENT, LIKE \u263a\n\nIn this Action-Adventure, players find themselves in the role of Kitty Hawk, a helicopter pilot who is shot down on an island in the Pacific.
