With the aid of Mr. Light, the player must retrieve the map pieces to Max Dublin's three treasures. The player must travel with Max Dublin to a number of exotic locales, and using the New Book of Knowledge Encyclopedia Volume A published by Grolier, must answer questions about these locations. Correctly answered questions help the player locate map pieces. As the player travels, they must spend money to refuel their plane, and they risk running out of fuel money before collecting all map pieces if they do not answer enough questions correctly. After collecting all pieces for the silver map, the player progresses to the more challenging gold and jewel maps. As the player searches for treasure, a mystery man wearing a bandanna attempts to sabotage the player's effort by stealing money or fuel if questions are answered incorrectly.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/seekit-max-dublins-treasure"}
