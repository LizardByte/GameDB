In it, you play as a dude marching through ancient castles with the realization that every myth and story ever made in the history of man is true and all of them are pissed off at you for having a pulse and four functional limbs.\nYou utilize a bow, some grenades, and a spear in order to fend them off, wandering deeper to stop the rise of the dark lord threatening to spread death, destruction, and hurt feelings all around.\n\nBeing a first-person shooter, you step into the eyes of a protagonist and wield whatever weapon he was smart enough to grab before wandering off on this death quest. Primary fire, well, fires whatever weapon you're using, while secondary fire lobs a grenade at whatever looks funny at you.\nRun around through seven maps, picking up items and stabbing dudes before reaching a boss at the end, and then stab the boss. Boss drops artifact, pick up artifact for more powers for your bow, and then move on to the next level to repeat as needed. After you do this seven times, you win!\nIf you play on Story Mode, occasionally there will be long walls of text about people talking about their feelings. If you play on Arcade mode, all of the boring text will be stripped out, leaving you free to stab enemies without hearing about their failed love life.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nocturne-in-yellow"}
