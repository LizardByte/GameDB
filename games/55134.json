The project was spearheaded by Stephen \"Scuba Steve\" Browning with additional help from Mike \"Cyb\" Watson, Julian Aubourg, and Kara \"Nanami\" Rader. The author of Action Doom dedicated a significant portion of time to creating blogged \"advertisements\" and held contests for various events to give away prizes that related to Action Doom.\n\nThe purpose of Action Doom was to not only create a modification for Doom, but to invent and market an imaginary product with the intent of simulating the environment surrounding the golden era of gaming of the early 90s. Coupled with the hopes of invigorating the stagnant Doom community, the author tried to generate as much hype and interest while showing almost no preliminary screenshots or information, leaving those items up to the community's imagination.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/action-doom"}
