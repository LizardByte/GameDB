However, here, instead of your own tail and walls, you will face hundreds of thousands of cunning worms that will do their best to eat both your food and you. Therefore you must be cautious, because the sly inhabitants of the Worm Arena will stop at nothing to gain mass and become tops. \n \nMake sure not to run into any other worm, avoid meeting giants that can trap you into circles, don\u2019t lose your mind when jumping into the thick of it, and always be alert - these are basically the main principles that will help you make your worm enormous and take your place in the Rating of the Arena of Wormax.io. \n \nWhile exploring the map, pick up boosters (magnets, mass conservation, health, telescopes and toxics - you can find detailed information about them in the Encyclopedia). Thanks to the bonuses they give, you will be able to grow your worm faster. Also, make sure to use the super skills (acceleration, stop and transparency). \n \nNew records will become closer after you pop into the Shop where you can use the points you\u2019ve earned to upgrade your worm. \n \nThe Wormax.io game offers an option of playing with friends. All you have to do is send them your personal link and play together straightaway!", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wormax-dot-io"}
