Instead of catching bombs before they hit the ground you have to catch suitacses which are thrown from a luggage carrousel gone haywire. The games becomes progressively harder as more and more suitcases are hurled towards the ground. In addition to that you can chose between two difficulty levels which let you control one or two baggage handlers. You should also watch out for suitcases containing bombs - failing to catch those results in instant death.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 15789, "name": "VR", "video_id": "hH6XgBGWAyY"}]}
