Ballora was a distraction, Funtime Foxy mimicked parents' voices, Bon-Bon was a parent-tracking device, Circus Baby lured children with ice cream, and Funtime Freddy was made to grab children and store them in their torsos. Eventually, Afton's plans backfired as his daughter was killed by his creations. The animatronics are now available for private birthday parties, but they want to escape. They devise a plan to pretend to be malfunctioning so they can be sent to the scooping room to have their endoskeletons removed.\n\nEnnard and Circus Baby merge their endoskeletons to create a hybrid animatronic and disembowel the player. If the player beats the game, they will return home and Ennard will be moving in front of the TV after the show ends. In Custom Night, the player's flesh slowly rotates to a purple color and Ennard ejects themselves from the player's body, but he is revived at Baby's urging. Michael Afton's son is introduced to the lore from a cutscene revealed once the player has completed the \"Golden Freddy\" preset on Very Hard.", "summary": "Welcome to Circus Baby's Pizza World, where family fun and interactivity go beyond anything you've seen at those *other* pizza places!
