Unlike traditional epic quests or world-spanning adventures, this game focuses on the simplicity of everyday life. Choose a profession, work, get married, raise kids, and eventually retire. At the beginning of the game, players have the freedom to explore the local area by navigating town with the D-pad and adjusting the screen size using the analog stick. Engage in activities like sword attacks with the \"X\" button and interact with fellow citizens using the \"O\" button. The passage of time occurs naturally, transitioning from day to night as you wander around town.\n\nStanding idly in the middle of town allows you to observe other citizens going about their daily routines. Occasionally, someone may approach your character, initiating a conversation or challenging you to a duel in a basic ring. The player's role is crucial in reflecting the voice of the people to establish a peaceful country. Success in this endeavor can lead to membership in the council or even becoming the chairman. Along the way, players can take on various jobs, learn martial arts to become stronger, and maintain a social life with the diverse inhabitants of Pluto.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/world-neverland-2-pluto-kyouwakoku-monogatari", "videos": [{"id": 25708, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "FzWRhqz9oPo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzWRhqz9oPo", "title": "\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 World Neverland 2 Plus: The Waktic Republic of Pluto | SEGA Dreamcast", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FzWRhqz9oPo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
