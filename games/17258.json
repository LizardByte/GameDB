The game was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. The player's objective is simple: solve basic arithmetic problems. Game variations determine whether the player solves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems, and whether he/she could select the top number (the console randomly selects the lower number). The player uses the joystick to enter a guess, with sound effects signaling whether it is right or wrong.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/basic-math", "videos": [{"id": 15445, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "va5C4PSgvrQ"}]}
