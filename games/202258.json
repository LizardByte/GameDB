The gameplay mechanics were partially inspired by Inscryption, being pretty straightforward and easy to learn.\n\nAfter choosing a starter deck, your goal is to travel through Kyoumu, challenging each of the Gym Leaders from the eight major cities in the region, building up your team to reach the ultimate goal, the Crystal League. Along the way, you'll be presented with numerous choices to expand your deck, strengthen your cards, give them unique special abilities, and battle other trainers.\n\nThe current release includes all of gens 1 and 2 (but with corresponding Fairy types). The game may be expanded with more content and generations in the future, but there are no plans currently for it. It is fully playable in its current state.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-crystal-league"}
