He waged war against two other powerful monarchs, Yandi and Chiyou, fighting for control over China. After a long time, the power of Yandi was reduced, and Chiyou disappeared, allowing Huangdi to become the emperor. But the war was not over. For centuries and millennia later it continued, taking different shapes - blood, battles and ambitions of warlocks would not end. In the Three Kingdoms era, 3rd century AD, the ancient war was revived once again. And so the seventeen-year-old boy Ji Xuan, proficient in sword fighting, and his older sister Ji Shuang, a master of demon-summoning, found themselves involved in a great conflict that will soon change their lives forever...\n\n\"Huanxiang Sanguozhi\", meaning Fantasy Story of Three Kingdoms, is based on historical events, featuring famous characters from the Three Kingdoms epoch, which became so popular in Asia thanks to Luo Guanzhong's classic novel. But the game gives a different interpretation to the story, involving fictional and supernatural characters and themes that were absent in other adaptations of the saga. The game plays like a traditional Asian RPG. You can set your combat style to be entirely turn-based, or with active time element, like in Final Fantasy games. The battles are viewed from isometric perspective, while navigation through the game world is done from a regular third person view. The enemies are visible in hostile areas, but appear randomly on the world map. The game allows you to choose between three difficulty levels.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/huanxiang-sanguozhi"}
