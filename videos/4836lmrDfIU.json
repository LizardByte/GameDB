This is the US 60fps release. I have previously recorded Ridge Racer Hi-Spec Demo which was the 50fps Pal release.\n\nThe game is an improved version of the original ridge racer release utilising an updated hi res engine using knowledge gained throughout the years of developing on PlayStation. The game uses interlaced mode which the emu doesn't handle that well and traditional tv broadcast de-interlacers do not work that well either. I have made a blended version of the video to hide the combing effect at the cost of image sharpness. This version is in 60fps but the extra performance comes at the cost of a vertical resolution of 456 where as the 50 fps pal version used a vertical resolution of 512.\n\nI start the video by showing a demo of the original ridge racer. I then load Turbo mode and show the background information on how this demo came into existence (Pause video if pages skip to fast). Then its onto the game.\n\n00:00:00 Dual in the original Ridge Racer\n\n00:05:22 Ridge Racer History and Info\n\n00:07:12 Ridge Racer Turbo.
