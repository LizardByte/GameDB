By tactically placing ownership markers and taking tiles, you will achieve the majority control required to influence the countries and powers of Europe.\n\nFour different opponents, each with their own personality, challenge you at a variety of difficulty levels to make the game very replayable.\nWeb of Power Card Game: The Duel is built on the same successful MobileEuroCard platform that was used to create Michael Schacht's Gold and Reiner Knizia's High Society, Kingdoms, Money, and Modern Art: The Card Game. Simple gestures allow you to take tiles and move markers. Everything is animated, for a colorful play experience.\nPreviously released as the tabletop game Richelieu, The Duel has now returned to its intended Dark Ages theming.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/michael-schachts-web-of-power-card-game-the-duel"}
