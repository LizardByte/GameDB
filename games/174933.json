The series is available on numerous platforms.\n\nThe game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage.\n\nThis version was also re-released in color as part of the Konami GB Collection Vol. 2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/parodius--3", "videos": [{"id": 55569, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "d4SVHPP7fEU"}]}
