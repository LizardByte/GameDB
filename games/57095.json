As such, the game contains elements from every earlier contest over those five years.\n\nThe title is based on the saying that if you take an infinite amount of monkeys and have them work on an infinite amount of typewriters, you'll end up with every story ever known to man. The result is an experimental adventure game containing zombies, angels, a chessboard, a moonbase, time travel and more.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/infinite-monkeys", "videos": [{"id": 59192, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "G2IwOAsdiqg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2IwOAsdiqg", "title": "Infinite Monkeys", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G2IwOAsdiqg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
