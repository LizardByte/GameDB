Dynamic track-changing and sophisticated path selection systems enable all the AI trains to function smartly without stepping on each other\u2019s paths. Since players will now rely entirely on signalling and track changing switches, the paths they take will be one among an exponential set of possibilities. This means they will find themselves stopping their trains on any of the platforms available at each station.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/indian-train-simulator", "videos": [{"id": 68438, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_-7Oxbg5EXk"}]}
