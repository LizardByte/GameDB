It was meant to be a temporary solution to an unavoidable crisis.\n\nIt was a good thing for decades, allowing humans to survive. But some of the Integrated saw this new form as the future of humanity. With no desire to reverse the process, the post-humanist Integrated stratified, calling themselves the Rayonne. Global war soon erupted, and Rayonne forces now seek to hunt down any remaining humans, forcing their integration, and destroying those who don\u2019t share their views.", "summary": "In Disintegration, you play an Integrated character named Romer.
