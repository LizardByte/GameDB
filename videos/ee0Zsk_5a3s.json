This game places an emphasis on freedom of movement and flow, maintian high speeds to enter boost mode to go even faster and collect rings to reduce the amount of time to enter boost mode. This is a very early build and pretty much everything is subject to change, several animations are unfinished and there may be physics bugs.\n\n\nControls can be checked and remapped in the settings menu\n\n\nControls:\n\nArrow Keys/Control Stick = Move\n\nZXC/ABX = Jump Buttons\n\nF/Y, Right Bumper, Right Trigger = Z Button (Action button)\n\nEnter/Start = Pause\n\n\nSonic has a variety of moves, figure out how to use them all together to keep up your flow and reach boost mode!\n\n\nActions:\n\nPress Up while rolling to uncurl\n\nPress Jump in the air to respin and insta shield\n\nPress and hold Jump in the air to dropdash\n\nPress the Action Button on the ground to use melee attacks\n\nPress the Action Button on the ground while running to use top kick\n\nPress the Action in the air and a directional input to use air actions - Sonic has different air actions depending on if he is spinning or free falling\n\n\nSpin actions:\n\nUp - Sonic Updraft\n\nSide - Air Dash\n\nDown - Bounce Attack\n\n\nFree Fall actions:\n\nUp - Hop Jump\n\nSide - Sonic Windmill\n\nDown - Sonic Rocket\n\n\nSonic also has some secret techniques, try to find them!\n\n\nThis demo includes 2 testing levels\n\n\nTest Zone is your standard open testing area where you can try out all of sonics moves. However there is an actual level here, to reach it, jump over the large slope to the right instead of going down it, you can't miss it (dont forget you can just press restart to return to the beginning). This level features several design styles from different Sonic games to test how this new Sonic plays in these environemnts\n\n\nBeta Simulation Zone is recreation of Cyberspace Zone Act 1 from the Classic Sonic Simulator version, a tried and true classic Sonic styled level with percise platforming. Though it is missing a few classic objects, you'll have to get creative with Sonic's new moves to navigate it\n\n\nYou can play both of these levels for the best time, score and both to get an A rank\n\n\nPlease keep in mind these levels are just meant to test how Sonic plays and do not reflect how the real levels will be designed\n\n\nIf you are interested in seeing this game grow faster we are always welcome for people to join and help with development\n\nYou can contact me by joining my discord:https://discord.gg/K6ZPXzxbVB server or dming me on twitter:https://x.com/GameringIy\n\nCredits:\nCreated by - Gameringly\n\nFramework used - Sonic Worlds Next\n\nSonic Sprites - LankP, Gameringly, Lucci Zeppeli, kan2975\n\nOther sprites - Gameringly\n\nTitle Screen Art - Pixel Mario, Gameringly\n\nresources used:\nAdventure styled HUD - FieryExplosion\nScramble For The Core 16 bit remix - JX\nFree Crush 40 instrumental - tailsmeboy\nSa2 sound effects rip - Piplupfan77\nClassic Sonic Sound rips - Mr Lange\nSonic Advance 2 sprites rip - Ice\nSonic Battle sprites rip - QuadFactor\n\n#Sonic #sonicfangame #SAGE2024", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ee0Zsk_5a3s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ee0Zsk_5a3s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ee0Zsk_5a3s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ee0Zsk_5a3s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ee0Zsk_5a3s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Sonic Into Cyberspace SAGE 2024 Demo Release Tralier", "description": "For Windows only, Android port coming hopefully soon\n\nGet the game here: https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/sonic-into-cyberspace-sage-2024-demo.2242/\n\nSonic Into Cyberspace is a 2D modern Sonic game that aims to evolve and expand upon the 2D Sonic formula.
