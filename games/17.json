In these dark times, the Brotherhood - your Brotherhood - is all that stands between the rekindled flame of civilization and the howling, radiated wasteland.\n\nYour weapons will become more than your tools, they will become your friends. You will use your skills to inspire the lowly and protect the weak... whether they like it or not. Your squadmates will be more dear to you than your kin and for those that survive there will be honor, respect and the spoils of war.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fallout-tactics-brotherhood-of-steel", "videos": [{"id": 292, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "1VJOo-2F_wk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VJOo-2F_wk", "title": "Fallout Tactics - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1VJOo-2F_wk/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 293, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "ncUp8nk1_lk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncUp8nk1_lk", "title": "FALLOUT - TACTICS - intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ncUp8nk1_lk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
