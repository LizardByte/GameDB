They spent the next few years on the terra forming of the red planet, developing new technologies and building up new civilisations. Somehow each of the three fractions \"Eurasian Dynasty\", \"United Civilised States\" and \"Lunar Corporation\" did this independently and separately from each other - but in the year 2160 something strange happens in this new world. Will the ED, UCS and LC join forces or continue their old war against each other? \n \nBesides the usual venues in the solar system, there are some strange looking locations: planets with moving and reflecting liquid surfaces. And beside the standard RTS - resources acquisition, base building and destruction of enemy bases, the year 2160 will have some adventure inspired tasks for the players.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 32335, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "7Y8kLsPFRk4"}]}
