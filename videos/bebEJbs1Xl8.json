Today I want to share my joy of reaching another thousand subscribers, honestly it's surreal to me how we keep growing up more and more. It's all so fun to see, to watch the comments and help whenever I can with questions people may ask, and to learn more about content creation the more I continue in my journey for this channel. So basically I'm gonna start using my reactions from a new microphone i bought for doing this work, one called TC-777 Tonor, it's very cheap but it's worth it for a starting point i'd say,  i've heard of the blue yeti for better voice accurary, but it's way too expensive for me. So i opted for the simple one, plus it's handy to use for my first time :D. \n\nAnyways i've been rambling for a bit on this description. To make this clear, this is a video reaction about Hyper Danganronpa Melancholy plus sharing my background a bit, How I describe myself and my whole reaction to this new system that I'm trying to test out through my voice. Hope you guys enjoy it and i'll make sure to continue the next part as soon as my voice recovers next week most likely \ud83d\ude02 if you guys want to see more and talk more about this game and about myself. If you have any questions for the next one, I'm all ears! Have a good time and take care out there everyone \ud83e\udd70!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bebEJbs1Xl8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bebEJbs1Xl8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bebEJbs1Xl8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bebEJbs1Xl8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bebEJbs1Xl8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Special 3K Subscribers | Hyper Danganronpa Melancholy [Prologue Pt.1]", "description": "Game made by Ruxyami : https://gamejolt.com/games/hdrm/652257\nHey y'all!
