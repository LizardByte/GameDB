If you ever get stuck on a puzzle you can explore somewhere else, then come back later, or you can open the settings menu and turn on hints.\n\nNearly all The Long Gate's puzzles are based on real world technologies, and it contains accurate depictions of quantum circuits and a 4-bit quantum computer, verified by scientists at D-Wave Systems, the world\u2019s first commercial quantum computer company. To progress through the game, you will learn the basic principles that form the backbones of each puzzle type. You do not need a technical background to finish the game, but if you have an interest in any STEM field these puzzles will be particularly interesting to you.\n\nThe Long Gate also features an original soundtrack by musician Nick Newman.", "summary": "The Long Gate is a challenging and beautiful single-player, first-person, puzzle game. On a mission from the enigmatic creators of this place, you will explore ancient caverns filled with mysterious devices and traverse relaxing oases of nature while learning to solve the three primary types of puzzles that wind through them. Repair the ancient circuits and unravel the mystery of what happened to their creators.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-long-gate"}
