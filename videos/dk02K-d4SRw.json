With online multiplayer for up to 4 players and global leaderboards.\n\nI'm a solo developer and I work on this game in my spare time for about 1 year now. I've been a big fan of WoW on the Commodore 64 and wanted to recreate the mood of this classic game, but give it some modern graphics and online multiplayer. I'm using the Unity Engine (Mirror and Steamworks for the multiplayer part)\n\nThe game is on a closed beta at the moment.\n\nLet me know, what you think!\nHere's the link to the Steam-Shop:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1548800/Wizard_Of_Walls/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dk02K-d4SRw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dk02K-d4SRw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dk02K-d4SRw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dk02K-d4SRw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dk02K-d4SRw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wizard Of Walls - Trailer", "description": "Wizard Of Walls is a top down dungeon shooter inspired by the old arcade classic \"Wizard Of Wor\".
