They were the strongest creatures\nand protected the islanders from evil demons. However, when they were about to die, they looked for\nworthy descendants to pass on their power. Since only other shark-demons were possible descendants,\nMaki and Temu were chosen. Both received one shark tooth from each of the three sacred sharks,\nwhich was believed to be the source of their power. This shark tooth allowed Maki and Temu to transform into their shark-form. After the death of the 3 holy sharks, it remained calm and peaceful for a while.\nHowever, when a strong storm caused the gate to the underworld to break open, Octo, the king of evil demons, managed to get to the upper world. He terrorized the islanders and destroyed entire islands to show off his power. Maki and Temu saw themselves as protectors and faced Octo in a great fight. Unfortunetly, they failed to defeat Octo. Octo stole their shark teeth and imprisoned them in his prison(Here the game starts for the player: Maki wakes up in his prison cell)\nMaki and Temu must escape the prison and recover their shark teeth guarded by Octo's Strongest subservients. Maki must travel all 3 dungeon islands and get his shark tooth back. At the End of the adventure, Maki faces Octo again and there is a final fight", "summary": "Makis Adventure is an Action- Platformer with shark demons.
