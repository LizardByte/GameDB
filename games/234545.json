Unlock and change personality traits throughout your Sims' lives as they cope with midlife crises, respond to family requests to move in, and more.

As they experience life together, there will be opportunities for both drama and unity that will affect family dynamics and Sims\u2019 relationships with their family members.", "summary": "Strengthen family bonds, make friends or enemies, and discover your Sims' truest selves with The Sims 4 Growing Together Expansion Pack.
