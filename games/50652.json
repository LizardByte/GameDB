DDI have incorporated two game styles; for first timers it's a case of hitting the A bottom when you are lined up, then moving your arm up and down before hitting the B bottom - simple. If you fancy a real challenge, you could try the Sim version where the hitting of the ball and its strength is down to you - once mastered, you will feel like a putting green King... Play through 74 crazy holes set over 4 wacky courses in Crazy Mini Golf.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kidz-sports-crazy-golf"}
