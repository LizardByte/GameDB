So, instead of just telling you what Noita does and how it works, here she is to tell you some fun ways to die, and you\u2019ll no doubt learn a thing or two about the game along the way. Enjoy these violent Nouta impressions.\n\nThis is the Noita early access version, but even this early in development you\u2019ll come to see just how intricately \u201cevery pixel is simulated\u201d in the roguelike. There\u2019s sand and dust that have physics, you can get soaked in different liquids, and fire will even bellow out smoke that acts as an actual object in-game. As you\u2019ll see in this Noita gameplay, that smoke can actually kill you via suffocation.\n\nThis is the Noita steam release, but developers Nolla Games have also made sure that you\u2019ll also be able to pick the game up on the Humble Store, itch.io, and GOG. This Noita test was using an Nvidia GTX 1660 graphics card, and that seems to pretty easily handle all of that pixel simulating.\n\nIf you enjoyed this Noita impressions video you could give it a like, and subscribe to Rock Paper Shotgun while you\u2019re at it to see more stuff like it.
