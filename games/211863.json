Traverse between these two realms and decide the fate of those who dare to oppose you, whether through destruction or reanimation.\n\nEach fallen foe can be reanimated and incorporated into your army, forging your legion of the dead. These reanimated creatures possess distinctive abilities, offering diverse ways to enhance your forces.\n\nIn this shadowy realm, formidable creatures will stop at nothing to stop your progress. Your creativity will be your greatest asset. Strategically select your spells, squad, and talents before each endeavor, then make decisive choices to overcome even the most daunting challenges.\n\nThe ability to deny death itself is the greatest secret of a Necromancer. Another mortal strike is merely a setback for Irea. Take a lesson from your death and don\u2019t let your enemies catch you the same way twice.", "summary": "Become a powerful battler necromancer and challenge death with your double-edged weapon.
