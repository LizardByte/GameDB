Only months later, it received a virtually arcade-perfect console port on the Sega Saturn. Considered the true sequel to the first game in the series, Cotton 2 also marks the introduction of two new primary characters: Appli, a young princess, and her anthropomorphic hat, Needle. Cotton 2 sees a return to traditional horizontal scrolling in the series, but it also stands out among shoot 'em ups in general for its unique gameplay system. With a heavy incorporation of Newtonian physics, Cotton 2 ultimately mixes elements of 2D platformers with traditional shoot 'em up gameplay. The first release of Cotton 2 on the Sega Saturn also included a mini-calendar for 1998.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cotton-2-magical-night-dreams", "videos": [{"id": 82780, "name": "Commercial", "video_id": "M3yauGlrL3U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3yauGlrL3U", "title": "\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8\u30f3 \uff12 (Cotton 2) PV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M3yauGlrL3U/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
