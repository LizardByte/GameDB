Control the action on the field and listen to the running commentary from the broadcast booth. It's a whole new game of sound and sight! The field zooms to a dazzling 6X close-up when the players cross the scrimmage line. You see every slamming interception, flying tackle and smash through the defensive wall! Up close and personal! Team up with another guy - you're the quarterback, he's the wide receiver. Call your strategy with over 50 plays in rain/snow, on grass/artificial field. Wide view shows all your receivers at once."}
