Enter Project ExZeus, humanity\u2019s last and best defense to repel the otherworldly menace and restore peace to our little blue planet using ultra high tech fighting robots! Take control of four different robots and blast those aliens back to where they came from in these action-focused high-flying 3D arcade style rail shooters! ExZeus In the year 2102 C.E. a massive, previously unknown asteroid entered Earth\u2019s orbit and began unleashing waves of attacks on the planet, killing thousands of people every day and devastating human civilization.
