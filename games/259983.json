One thing I know for sure \u2013 those pictures\u2026 I recognize them, they\u2019re\u2026 from my past, my ancestors. I\u2019ve seen them so many times, but were they here before? Is it possible that somebody changed them? Did I change them?\n\nThere\u2019s a machine I haven\u2019t seen before. There\u2019s a room I haven\u2019t been to, but I could swear I did.
