The third installment in the series is a bigger adventure than ever before, with loads of new monsters and items, many with unique effects and abilities. Character classes are better-differentiated and combat tactics are more subtle and interesting without sacrificing the hack'n'slash ethos that Gurk fans adore. The dedication to 8-bit culture remains fervent, with the complete 20-song soundtrack rendered with analog synth emulators that will evoke the classic sounds of the game systems of the 1980s. It's all enough to justify the outrageously steep $2 price tag, so pay up and get Gurkin'!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 67890, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "t5GS4uC0GL0"}]}
