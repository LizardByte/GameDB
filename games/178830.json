You control the eponymous barbarian Bert who must find his way through ramparts while fighting or evading numerically superior foes.\n\nBert the Barbarian is programmed in the DIV2 game development environment. Its was originally created as a DIV2 demo for a competition held by the PC Zone magazine, and won the first prize.\n\nHowever, the author, Anthony Flack, never expanded the game beyond two levels that will cycle indefinitely until you run out of continues. A Windows version is also available. Later, Bert the Barbarian was ported to other platforms, and may be also played in browser.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
