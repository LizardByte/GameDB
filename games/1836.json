Belial starts his journey with killing his prison warden (and later using his head as a weapon). After traveling through various hellish places and defeating countless demons he kills Cerberus and reaches Samael's lair. There, Belial defeats the fallen angel and rips his wings off as an act of vengeance.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 8995, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "K9CtYLP7wfY"}], "characters": [{"id": 1640, "name": "Voice Actor"}]}
