All those who would know are dead. \n \nAfter the first rocket attack, everything happened so fast. Retaliatory strikes were launched one after the other with only a few minutes intervals. On that day, millions of people died and the largest cities were razed to the ground. Those who survived had to face the world, which with each passing hour and day plunged into increasing chaos ... \nHowever, This Was Just the Beginning. \n \nThe vast majority of weapons that belong to the arsenal of \"The Last Day Weapons\" were not used for some unknown reason. Created to deter and not to be used, powerful enough to end life on our planet. \n \nAfter the war, which caused command centers to be destroyed and governments to cease to exist, this weapon remained without any control. One of the most dangerous units of this arsenal is the Arizona-12 secret submarine. \n \nWho will take control over it and what will it be used for?", "summary": "About This Game \n- Explore the sinister space of the Arizone-12 submarine \n- Discover the secret of events happened on a submarine during a nuclear war \n- Fight with weapons and surrounding objects, look for hiding places \n- Try not to get killed \n- Take control of the submarine", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
