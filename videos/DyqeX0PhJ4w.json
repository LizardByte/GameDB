{"id": "DyqeX0PhJ4w", "snippet": {"title": "Redneck Rampage - Gameplay [HD]", "description": "Redneck Rampage is a first person shooter made by Xatrix Entertainment and published by Interplay. It was released in 1997.\n\nThe game's plot revolves around two brothers, Leonard and Bubba, fighting through the fictional town of Hickston, Arkansas to rescue their prized pig Bessie and thwart an alien invasion. The brothers battle through such locales as a meat packing plant and a trailer park, and battle evil clones of their neighbors.\n\nRedneck Rampage is a first-person shooter and offers a variety of ways for the character to regenerate health or hit points. These power-ups consist moon pies, pork rinds, beer and liquor. A small supply of each can be carried for future use (the two exceptions were pork rinds and Delicious Googoo Clusters, which were used automatically upon being picked up). Each of these power-ups had distinct disadvantages: The more food the character ate, the more flatulent he became (represented by a \"gut\" meter in the user display), making it difficult to sneak up on enemies as the character would move forward and make a distinct fart sound frequently after eating. However, eating food did decrease the \"drunk meter\" slightly.\n\nWhen drinking alcohol, the health was restored and as an added benefit the character became somewhat less affected by enemy fire. This only worked to a minor degree, and the more the character drank, the less coordinated they became. This was measured on a \"drunk meter\" in the user display. Toward the high end of the meter, after consuming a large amount of alcohol, the character movements would become erratic and the user would have difficulty controlling the character as he moved in directions that did not correspond to the input on the keyboard. The in-game video would also become grainy and less viewable. At the maximum drunk level, the character would simply fall down, followed by the sounds of vomiting and the loss of all motor regardless of user input. All of these effects would pass after a few minutes as the character sobered up. During this time, the character can not use weapons and is essentially defenseless. The side effects of both power-up types forces the user to use them sparingly and gives another reason to avoid damage during gameplay. However, one other power-up, moonshine, gives the player increased speed for a brief amount of time, at the end of which both the \"drunk meter\" and the \"gut meter\" were reset to zero.\n\nThe game features music by psychobilly artists such as The Beat Farmers and Mojo Nixon.\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DyqeX0PhJ4w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DyqeX0PhJ4w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DyqeX0PhJ4w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DyqeX0PhJ4w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DyqeX0PhJ4w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Redneck Rampage - Gameplay [HD]", "description": "Redneck Rampage is a first person shooter made by Xatrix Entertainment and published by Interplay.
