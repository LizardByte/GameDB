This includes squad selection, formation tactics, and strategic decisions on playing style, such as choosing between defensive or attacking approaches and determining the passing game. The match day experience is presented through a top-down view of the entire pitch, with a scoreboard displayed on the side. Instead of detailed animations, the game represents the action through ball movement and text descriptions of key events, allowing players to follow the flow of the match. The ability to adjust game speed and make substitutions during matches adds an extra layer of tactical depth. With features like friendly matches between qualifiers and various management options including medical staff oversight, European Champions provides a detailed and engaging football management experience centered around the excitement of international tournaments.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/european-champions"}
