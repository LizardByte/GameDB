It is intricately linked to a host of weird phenomena that defy comprehension. Initially heralded as a catalyst for tech development, Rosetta's exploration of stardust ultimately triggered \"Starfall\": an eruption of the Great Ones burst forth from Rosetta's experimental monolith, disseminating \"Stardust\" far and wide. This unleashed a chain of anomalies: from biological mutations to societal disorder and the abrupt collapse of human civilization.\nHowever, a special group of individuals infected by stardust did not lose their sanity or mutate. Instead, they emerged with abilities and became known as \"Metas\". They soon became essential in the struggle against stardust and the endeavor to revive civilization.\n\nHowever, due to differing ideologies, the \"Metas\" split into different factions.\n\nSome, adhering to Rosetta\u2019s idea of continuously evolving by absorbing deviant energy, choose to continue to serve Rosetta, and are known as the \"Evolutionists\".\nSome admire the greatness of the Great One and escape Rosetta to welcome the arrival of the lords of the Great One, known as the \"Ascendants\".\nStill, others hope to explore a new order that harmonizes with the deviations and deviants. You are one of them, and the organization you belong to is known as the \"Mayfly\".\n\nIn a world teeming with deviations, the new order is written by you.", "summary": "Once Human is a multiplayer open-world survival game set in a strange, post-apocalyptic future.
