Expanding upon the motion picture release, experience hilarious interactions with your favorite characters and situations seen in the movie.\n\nShrek 2's storyline follows a similar, but slightly different plot compared to that of the movie. Shrek and Fiona are on a journey to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to visit Fiona's parents. Shrek's in-laws aren't too thrilled that a crude ogre is married to their beloved daughter, so the battle for acceptance ensues. The game also covers things not shown in the film. Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface (text and illustrations) shown before each level.\n\nTwo versions of the game were released for the PC; one developed by KnowWonder for younger audiences using Unreal Engine 2, and the other a port of the original console release under the title Shrek 2: Team Action which was developed by Beenox.\n\nGame Credits:\n\nMichael Lankerovich  Senior Engineer\nEduardo Franz  Art\nJeff Lander  Engine/Technology\nYukari Kaneko  Art\nAndrew Brinkworth  Character Art & Animation Lead\nAdrian Stephens  Engine/Technology\nJohan Kohler  Engine/Technology\nBrian Tuey  Design/Audio\nMatt Intrieri  Art\nStephen Hoogendyk  Animation\nMark Moseley  Voice - Donkey\nMel Fair  Voice - Magic Mirror\nJames Short  Programming\nJames Gooding  Programming\nMatt Whiting  Programming Lead\nJoby Otero  Art Direction/Project Lead\nAdam Yeager  Art\nKhang Pham  Art\nYaw Chang  Art\nShawn Foreman  Art\nChris Larsen  Art\nJohn Miller  Art\nWilliam Huang  Art\nLia Tjiong  Art\nShawn Shain  Art\nGerald Vera  Design Lead\nChristian G.
