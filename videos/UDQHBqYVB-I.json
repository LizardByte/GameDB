I know quality is low but, i don t have good graphics card to record in good quality. I think quality is normal. Yes its can be better but i do my best to record in this quality. Finaly lets talk about game. Plot in this game its just i guess memories characters about great battles they have. We create character (i already creat it but no show on video) who just our officer and we play mission memories with him and other characters. As in samurai warriors chronicles we can switch characters by touch icom on second screen (btw i don t record second screen because its drop fps too hard but i switch on him sometimes) and its very helpful in battles. So, yeah this is first video and in next part i try fix aspect ratio of the screen. Hope you enjoy this game as im.\n\nThank you for watching!.
