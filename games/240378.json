Released in 2008, it was the first Lemmings game to mention the tribes at all since The Lemmings Chronicles in 1994.\nDespite being about the tribes, the game lacks any real story. Much like The Lemmings Chronicles, the game only features 3 tribes.\n\nClassic Tribe, featuring 14 levels.\nMedieval Tribe, featuring 13 levels.\nSpace Tribe, featuring 16 levels.\n\nAdditionally, there are 4 separate Tutorial levels that teach the player the 8 classic skills, including a playground level with infinite time and infinite skills to play around with.\n\nUnlike its predecessor Lemmings Return, the mechanics are significantly different from the J2ME version of Lemmings. The 8 classic skills, for example, all function a bit differently from how they do in either of the former 2 games. The level structure, however, is entirely identical to Lemmings. The number of lemmings in each level does not depend on how many the player saved in the previous level; each level simply has a save requirement the player must meet. The levels can have anywhere from 1 to 20 lemmings.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lemmings-tribes"}
