Beneath the ancient burial mound, known locally as Barrow Hill, a forgotten myth awakes.\n\nJoin the adventure, and uncover the secrets of the past. The legends of the Ancient world will live again; renewed, refreshed and hungry. Time has no meaning, as the sun sets low across the landscape.\n\nCome to Barrow Hill and solve the mystery of the Druid's Circle.\n\nStranded on the lonely road, which leads up to the Barrow, you must make your way through the trees, and darkening landscape, and out onto the Barrow itself.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the well-known archaeologist, Conrad Morse, you will discover that the barrow is more than just a mound of earth and a collection of forgotten standing stones.\n\nHowever, not all archaeology is constructive, for some things should be left buried and undisturbed. Perhaps it is too late for that\u2026", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/barrow-hill-curse-of-the-ancient-circle", "videos": [{"id": 79764, "video_id": "NpuJiJBZQiQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpuJiJBZQiQ", "title": "Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NpuJiJBZQiQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 79765, "video_id": "vhcNCTYqHs4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhcNCTYqHs4", "title": "Barrow Hill: Curse of the Ancient Circle - Gameplay Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vhcNCTYqHs4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
