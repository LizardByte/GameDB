Yet all these rebellions needed someone to unite them in this pivotal moment. Someone who knew the enemy better than anyone else, because he was once part of them. Someone who had learned from his past mistakes and was now ready to make things right.\n\nAfter a failed attempt at bringing peace in Heathmoor, the one who was once called Holden Cross was now simply known as 'Gryphon'. He had forgone his former name and faction years ago. He became a mercenary to fight for those who could not bear the toll of war anymore, no matter which faction they belonged to. Under his guidance, rebels from all factions formed the Chimera Alliance, a full-blown army with the means to defy the Order of Horkos and stop their Corruption.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/for-honor-season-16-mayhem", "videos": [{"id": 51890, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IWXX8fa9350", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWXX8fa9350", "title": "For Honor: Year 4 Season 4 Mayhem Launch | Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWXX8fa9350/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 51891, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TlGbOrWa3Qk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlGbOrWa3Qk", "title": "For Honor: Gryphon Reveal Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TlGbOrWa3Qk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
