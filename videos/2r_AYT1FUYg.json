Trailer", "description": "Wario receives an antique globe and telescope that allow him to travel to the once-idyllic Shake Dimension, now conquered by the tyrannical pirate, the Shake King. With the assistance of his longtime rival, Captain Syrup, he must rescue the Merfles, denizens of the Shake Dimension imprisoned by the Shake King. Only by defeating the bosses of all five continents of this strange world can Wario find and confront the Shake King, rescue Queen Merelda, queen of the Merfles, and, most importantly, claim the Bottomless Coin Sack, a never-ending supply of gold.\nHow to progress through the game: Each stage has Wario navigating an obstacle course of dangers and traps to find an imprisoned Merfle. Once he frees the little fellow, the countdown begins and he must find his way back to the starting gate before time runs out. Wario must also defeat a boss in each continent, and then buy a map of the next continent from Captain Syrup. Once all five continents' bosses have been defeated, Wario takes on the Shake King himself.\n\nVisit my channel at:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/josegruiz80?feature=mhee \nfor more Wii and Wii U News, Trailers, Reviews, and More.\nDON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2r_AYT1FUYg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2r_AYT1FUYg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2r_AYT1FUYg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2r_AYT1FUYg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2r_AYT1FUYg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Wario Land: Shake It!
