The WAD is a sequel to WOOO, and just like its predecessor, the WAD relies on ridiculous enemy placement, gratuitous abuse of ZDoom features, and intentionally terrible map design. The WAD was uploaded on /idgames archive on September 1, 2014. At the Cacowards 2014 it became a runner-up for the Mockaward. The sequel, Wooo 3, was released two years later.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wooo-2"}
