Once the planet has been consumed, the alien takes the form of the entire planet and seeks to devour other planets within the galaxy. The galactic military tries to fight the alien, but to no avail as Parasitis destroys the entire galactic military, except for one hospital ship. It is then discovered that Princess Maria has been devoured as well. The galactic military decides to send out their best fighter, \"Second Lieutenant Nazal\", to attempt to enter Parasitis' body and rescue Princess Maria before it's too late.", "summary": "Abadox is a video game for the NES, subtitled The Deadly Inner War. It is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up in the vein of Gradius and R-Type. The game is notable for its unique visual design, as the game takes place inside the intestinal tract of a giant alien organism. Abadox is also known to be difficult, since it takes one hit from an enemy projectile to be killed. In Abadox, if a player is killed, one must restart from a checkpoint passed before death.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/abadox-the-deadly-inner-war", "videos": [{"id": 38457, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "iqryl5lj7Uo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqryl5lj7Uo", "title": "Abadox (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iqryl5lj7Uo/sddefault.jpg"}]}
