This is an artificially created asteroid field where asteroids have been tractored to form a planar field around the Alpha, Bravo, Gamma and Delta space stations for easier mining, trading and colonization. The Asteroid Belt is huge. Forming artificial fields with a high density of asteroids was a practical political decision in the year 2047 to enable colonization of the Belt. There are several artificial asteroid fields in the Belt. The main field and the ring field have been designated training zones where Ensign-level pilots may practice. The ring field is a smaller asteroid field that is suitable for high-speed training. In the center of the ring field is the blue Ring Station, which is a command station for research, training and habitats.", "summary": "The year is 2051. Multiple large corporations are engaged in mining operations in the Belt. The need for good pilots and new ships is high. Cryaxion Corporation develops experimental new ships designed for the Belt and train pilots for their ships. Having signed up for the pilot training program at Cryaxion, you are now stationed there until you reach the advanced pilot ranks. You are advised to achieve as well as you can; your future will depend on it.\n\nYou can optionally also use the Virtual Reality (VR) Mode to use the game with Google Cardboard or Google Daydream.\n\nEngage in hours of sci-fi adventure experiences with 50 challenging missions, trading at space stations, running cargo and trekking the belt.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 74364, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "w5Erkx9Cvbs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Erkx9Cvbs", "title": "iOS App Preview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w5Erkx9Cvbs/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
