One day Kazuya goes outside, enjoying the good weather, when an unknown girl appears and says she is the sister of Mai, one of the heroines of the first game. It looks like PSYCO, the evil brain-washing power, is back! And not just anywhere, but in a girls high school! Kazuya readily agrees to liberate the poor girls from the curse of PSYCO.\n\nHorny Sweeper 2: Joshik\u014d Kiki Ippatsu plays very similarly to the first game. It is a top-down turn-based strategy game in which the player navigates Kazuya and the liberated girls on the large battle fields and attacks when enemies are in range. The difference is that in the sequel, characters gain experience points from each attack, rather than automatically leveling up after large battles, which grants this game a definite role-playing angle. There are more girls (including old acquaintances from the first game) and more attacks to choose from", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/horny-sweeper-2"}
