And it's here that Arche may discover something amazing about elemental stones... and herself.\"", "summary": "\"Fortune Summoners is a side-scrolling, real-time Action RPG made from the mold of some of gaming's most famous and beloved classic side-scrollers and combined with modern design sensibilities.
