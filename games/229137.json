Sitting roughly in the center of this disc lies the massive main continent of Pyrathia. Few men can claim to have seen the edge of the world, because oceans surround the continent and stretch as far as superstitious sailors will go, with but the occasional island to\ninterrupt the sea. Even those who have magically traveled to the edge have not reported seeing anything worth the effort of such exploration.\n\nCertainly the most populous section of the world, Pyrathians simply assume that they are also the most civilized. And at one time this may have been the case, for far back in the mists of time it is rumored that one empire ruled the entire continent with all races living in peace and harmony.\nA Splintered Realm\n\nBut in the present, that legendary empire lies shattered into many pieces constantly fighting for dominance in a variety of shifting alliances. The largest is the lawless sprawl of Uxmal in the center of the continent. Uxmal acts as a buffer between some of the more aggressive nations. Radiating outward are smaller kingdoms. The dark and militant Empire of the Bright Star lies to the east. Necromancers of the Northern Wastes practice their dark magics to the north. The tolerant but ever besieged Kingdom of Taslamar spans the northwest. The fae races of the Ayamaoan Alliance thrive in the forests and fields the southwest. The serene but exotic Dominion of Zhenshi reigns in the south, near the desert. Beneath all of these kingdoms lie the Deep Realm. There, deep-elves war with the dwarves and their gnomish allies for supremacy.\n\nFar from safe and peaceful, Pyrathia is a treacherous place to live but it certainly helps to create a hearty breed of adventurers\u2026", "summary": "Shattered Kingdoms (SK) is a text-based sword and sorcery fantasy role playing game, played online by many people at the same time who each assume the identity of a different character.\n\nOur players are readers and gamers \u2013 those compelled by adventure, role play and being a part of an ongoing saga story line. The world of Pyrathia is filled with turmoil and conflict. The political and physical landscapes can change over time. Some of these changes are the direct efforts of players through their mortal characters. Other changes are beyond their control as the gods and other powerful forces have real influence on the realm.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shattered-kingdoms"}
