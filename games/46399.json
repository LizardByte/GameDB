It is notable for being a 3D first person shooter - one of the few available for the Sega Mega Drive and the only game of this genre for the Sega Mega-CD.\n\nThe game takes up most of the screen, with much smaller borders than similar games such as Zero Tolerance, a very impressive technical achievement. A two player splitscreen mode is also available. However, the game also suffers from slowdown and some of the texture data of the Mega Drive version looks corrupted but this was fixed with the Mega-CD version.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bloodshot"}
