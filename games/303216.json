Players choose the fighting style of their avatar with choices that include a kung-fu, ninja, samurai, and zombie style. Each style comes with a low and high projectile move and each character also has a dash and jump move, however performing a move will drain some energy that the move costs to do so the player can't constantly do the same move over and over until the move meter refills. The game also has destructible environments where the player can knock their opponent into a building. Players can also design their own arenas to do battle in.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/avatar-dairansen"}
