Based on the internet myth, Backroom Beyond goes further and makes the player wonder if that journey is about something more personal than anything else.\n\nThe narrative has two main points. Drawings tell part of the game's story on the walls. The drawings have no defined authorship, which gives them an extra degree of strangeness. The second point is the existence of The Guide, a being that instigates the players to think about their actions in real life.\n\nThe game basically has one objective throughout its 40-level journey: place the red box over the red button and open the door to the next level. It seems simple at first, but it's not. Each environment has its own logic. If the players feel frustrated because something went wrong in their strategy, they can press the \u201cwake up again\" button, which will return them to the beginning of the level.\n\n\nSite: https://whitevortex.com.br/backroombeyond\nSite: https://whitevortex.com.br/backroombeyond/\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062820/Backroom_Beyond/\nTrailer do jogo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZKbzxEYNkw\nScreenshots: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1cMOv7jmMp6qtDxNe3C9GSmrXe-9m8RIN\n\n\nP\u00e9rolas Irregulares song is a courtesy of TERCEIRO MUNDO BOM:\n\nThe indie band from Rio de Janeiro plays the best quality rock with themes that go through love, personal discoveries, society, and everything packed with beautiful melodies.
