Centuries of destructive exploitation by a race long gone, reduced what was once a paradise into a world inhabited only by machines. Those machines, robots of all shapes and sizes, rebuilt Scrapland into an awe-inspiring metropolis of glittering greatness.\n\nAs the robots rebuilt the world they also created a new class of citizens: policemen, bankers, priests, and civil servants. This fledgling society was transformed dramatically by the discovery of a device dubbed \u201cThe Great Database\u201d. With it the robots could easily revive any expired or nonfunctional automaton. Death became a thing of the past.\n\nAgainst this backdrop you join the story of an outsider named D-Tritus who arrives at Scrapland amid a string of bizarre murders. D-Tritus lands a job investigating the killings and eventually becomes entangled in a web of conspiracy that only his quick wits and a little help from his friends will save him from.", "summary": "The cult game that marked MercurySteam's origins returns; a sci-fi adventure with memorable characters, powerful ships and humor!
