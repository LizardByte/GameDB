Following the failure of Citadel the Red Army will almost always be on the offensive.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this campaign is of course the defeat of the Third Reich in the Battle of Berlin. But Red Storm does not stop there - players can opt for another battle after the fall of Berlin and take their core army to the Far East to defeat Japanese forces in the last major Soviet offensive of World War 2 in Manchuria."}
