Sega) subscription service, a service in which members pay 300\u00a5 a month for access of an exclusive library of Sega games. This game is known for its very high difficulty compared to its sister games, both Puyo Puyo Fever and Puyo Puyo Fever 2. Like both games, it has a RunRun, WakuWaku and HaraHara course. According to the Suwa3 website, only Amitie and Raffina are playable in the game.\n\nThis Puyo game is considered as \"lost media\" due to the fact that a few sources have provided minimal information regarding Puyo Puyo Fever Habanero.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-fever-habanero"}
