This will allow you to focus on piloting your Core to be mobile and reactive, so that at every moment you will be able to flee or run after your opponents. You will also have to be careful of your shooting accuracy to eject and destroy your enemies. \n \nMoreover, thanks to our customization options, you will be able to control a teapot or a light bulb, as well as a skull or a pig. Your Core\u2019s armor and its lights are also customizable. \n \nA game of BattleCore Arena is played according to the \"3v3 Backup\" rules. \nAs its name implies, two teams of three players compete against each other. Each team has 10 backup points, and when a player is ejected from the arena, he reappears consuming one backup point. \nOnce a team drops to 0 backup point, its players cannot reappear, reducing the number of players at the end of the game, for a final rise in tension.", "summary": "In BattleCore Arena, you assume the role of a Core in a world ruled by physics! Jump, dash, fire, explode and eject your enemies from the arena before you suffer the same fate! \nBecause we love you, we prepared 2 game modes for you, with different rules!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battlecore-arena", "videos": [{"id": 26408, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "uWwnT4hUyYs"}]}
