The battle resulted the largest number of casualties in any battle of the entire war, and was the turning point of the American Civil War.

The first day ended with the Confederates in control of the town of Gettysburg but they had failed to push on to take the high ground. Day two was a day of a series of actions at both ends of the battlefield at Culp's Hill and Little Round Top. Day three ended with the disaster of Pickett's Charge.", "summary": "Civil War: Gettysburg is a strategy game taking place during the Civil War.
