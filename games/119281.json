Taking initial user input for the players' names, personality traits and measurements, it equips them with appropriate adjectives and behaviors and points them in the direction of the player's garret. \n \nActual game input overlooks the strengths of a text parser, with viable options including various combinations of vanilla erogenous zones with hands and mouths. When the arousal levels of both parties is sufficient (both the male being flagged with \"hard\" status and the woman with \"wet\" -- indicated by the game via the report command) simulated penetration is allowed.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "videos": [{"id": 27814, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "DxqAm_I3o_I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxqAm_I3o_I", "title": "Soft Porn II: DOS Gaming", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DxqAm_I3o_I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
