The original was a long and difficult game, with 100 levels but High Voltage Software thought it would be a good idea to add 28 more levels and those last 28 levels can be maddeningly difficult.  After about 80 levels the Warp power ups stop dropping and its a long slog to the end.  The power ups them selves follow a fixed pattern of Laser weapon, 2000 points then jump ability. Once jump is obtained its usually an easy ride to the next level ...but not always.  Thankfully extra lives are given out like candy in this game so even though on some levels, especially later levels where I die a lot, I have plenty of lives to keep going.  I had one hell of a migraine after finishing with this game.\n\nOnce the game is complete I enter a cheat mode to enable some more options.

I show the hidden music track on the second and third stage of this mode.
