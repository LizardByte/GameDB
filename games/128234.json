With the help of alchemy, he made a potion of gravity and was captured by his own invention - the strength of the potion was so great that it consumed his planet. In the name of his salvation, the wizard sacrificed his soul to the altar, granting immortality and power over nature. His abode was destroyed, and then he created a powerful alliance, code-named V-Five, incorporating the five most dangerous and vicious creatures. They invaded our land and plunged the world into chaos. Nothing could resist them, only the power imprisoned in ancient monoliths. There is only one way to eradicate evil - to find the altar and free the Dark Spirit that is imprisoned in it.", "summary": "VVVVV is a colorful, dynamic platform action with puzzle elements, made in retro style.
