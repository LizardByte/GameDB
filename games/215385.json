There are a few assembly hacks which cannot be achieved within the editor alone, but they are few in number and mostly for cosmetic purposes.\n\nIt may seem at first that the changes are limited to gameplay and the plot is unchanged, but don\u2019t worry, there is a point in the plot after which it branches from the original and begins an entirely new chain of events."}
