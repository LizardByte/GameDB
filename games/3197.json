The following day, King Granseal falls sick when he is attacked by an unknown creature and Sir Astral, the court's advisor, along with his apprentices, Bowie the squire, Sarah the healer and Chester the knight, investigate these events at the castle. They find that the door to the Tower of Ancients has been unlocked and stands open.\n\nGreeting their arrival in the tower are devils named \"Gizmos\" springing forth to attack, though their ultimate intentions are unknown. Upon their defeat, the Gizmo that appears to be the leader flees. It is discovered thereafter to have possessed King Granseal. Sir Astral and the nascent Shining Force visit the king, finding him possessed. Sir Astral exorcises the demon, which promptly flees. The Minister, in place of King Granseal who is looking over a fainted Astral, then orders the slaying of the Gizmo by a platoon of Granseal's soldiers.\n\nWhen the true danger of the opened door is realized, the Shining Force must fight against the invading armies of Zeon to find the Holy Sword and the stolen jewels so that they may once again defeat and reseal the Devil King Zeon in Arc Valley.", "summary": "As a student of Astral the wizard, you and your friends study all the usual subjects: reading, writing, and sword fighting. As your time at school draws to an end, dark events are taking place on the island of Grans. The two Jewels which seal the Door to Darkness have been stolen, allowing a creature of awesome power to be unleashed. Finding where the Jewels were taken, and why, is a task only the bravest of adventurers can undertake.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 2032, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CcAw8zztbyA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcAw8zztbyA", "title": "Shining Force 2 II Sega Genesis Mega Drive Video Game Japanese Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CcAw8zztbyA/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
