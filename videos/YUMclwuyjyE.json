The Aurora stone has been stolen from the great Lighthouse by an unknown and shadowy creature. Without its light, the Driftlands will be destroyed.\n\nEnter Oscura our highly unlikely hero. He is the keeper of the lighthouse, and possesses a mysterious eternally glowing hand. Oscura must travel the lands and gather the shards to restore the Aurora stone - before it is too late and darkness befalls on the whole universe.\n\nCLASSIC PLATFORMING MEETS MODERN DESIGN\nInspired by early platformers from the 1990's, Oscura delivers a stripped down platforming experience through the filter of modern game and art design.\n\nBUILT FOR TOUCH\nBuilt for touch devices from the ground up, Oscura: Second Shadow is optimised and designed around the capabilities and limitations of touch to ensure that the controls are never at fault.\n\nDARK FAIRYTALE WORLD\nDive into the world of the Driftlands, where engineering meets nature and strange creatures stalk. With the Aurora stone shattered, Oscura's glowing hand and the shards of the stone are the only light sources, creating a stark and beautiful silhouette art style.\n\nHAUNTINGLY STYLIZED LEVELS\nJourney through 20 challenging levels, each crafted by hand rather than using tile-sets.\n\nAN UNLIKELY HERO\nSlight of frame and without any weaponry or brute force, Oscura must rely on his wits and reflexes to avoid foes and hazards alike. He's no hero, just doing his job.\n\nCHALLENGES TO KEEP YOU COMING BACK\nCompleting levels is one thing, collecting all four stars for each level is quite another. Replay levels to perfect your run and beat the goals for time, collecting cogs, shards and getting through without dying.\n\nOscura: Second Shadow is a Universal App and is compatible with iPod 4, iPod 5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad Mini, iPad Mini Retina.\n\niOS 5.11 or later OS version is required.\n\n*****************************\n\nOscura: Second Shadow from Creator Ole Alfheim is a game by the Chocolate Liberation Front and is proudly presented by Surprise Attack Games - Remarkable Games from Independent Creators\n\nVisit our site - http://surpriseattackgames.com\nFollow us on twitter: http://twitter.com/supattackgames or http://twitter.com/oscuragame\nFind us on facebook at http://facebook.com/surpriseattack or http://facebook.com/oscuragame\n\nEmail us with questions, support queries or ideas at support@surpriseattackgames.com\n\n*****************************\n\niTunes Store Page:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/oscura-second-shadow/id883528597\n\nHomepage:\n\nhttp://oscuragame.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUMclwuyjyE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUMclwuyjyE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUMclwuyjyE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUMclwuyjyE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUMclwuyjyE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Official Oscura Second Shadow Launch Trailer", "description": "Oscura Second Shadow by Surprise Attack Games\n\nClassic platforming meets modern design in a game built and optimised for touch controls.\n\nThe Driftlands are a gothic and frightening place at the best of times....And this is not the best of times.
