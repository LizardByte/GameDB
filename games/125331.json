Some of the Originators chose to use this newfound creation of life for their own benefit, wanting to further their own technologies or enslave them to a life of labor. These political defectors would come to be known as the Consumers and this rift in ideologies grew rampant, eventually sparking an intergalactic civil war. \n \nThe Consumers, having harnessed the power to stabilize black holes, created their ultimate weapon to turn the tides of war; the Grimmstar.
