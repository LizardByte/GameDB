As The Answer is a continuation of the story of Persona 3, it is recommended to play The Journey first. Furthermore, the content of this extra scenario is mainly combat oriented and does not involve any daily life or Social Link mechanics.\n\nThe chapter is only available in one difficulty setting, which is supposed to be on par with Persona 3's Hard mode. The gameplay is approximately 30 hours long and has Aigis be the playable character in place of the protagonist. The story follows SEES on a new adventure involving a new dungeon, Abyss of Time, which has locked SEES in an infinite time loop within the dormitory. It also introduces a new party member named Metis, a robotic AI similar to Aigis.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/persona-3-the-answer", "videos": [{"id": 88768, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "VlfXOT_68tc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlfXOT_68tc", "title": "Persona 3 FES The Answer Boss Metis", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VlfXOT_68tc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
