It is a short beat 'em up in the vein of Final Fight, where a black stickman must traverse the animator's desk, beating up purple stickmen along the way. The hero has several attacks available: a regular punch or kick, a flying kick, a throw, and a roundhouse kick which knocks down all nearby enemies but costs a part of the hero's life bar. After making it through several fights, the hero climbs on top of the artist's computer to confront the final boss who has multiple health bars.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fight-man"}
