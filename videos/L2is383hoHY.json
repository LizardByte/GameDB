Intense close quarters confrontations, high lethality, tactics, team play, and tension are at the center of the experience.\n \n The multiplayer gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege sets the new bar for intense firefights and expert strategy in the rich legacy of past Rainbow Six Games.\n \n THE SIEGE GAMEPLAY\n For the first time in Rainbow Six, players witl engage in sieges, a brand-new style of assault. Enemies now have the means to transform their environments into strongholds: they can trap, fortify, and create defensive systems to prevent breach by Rainbow teams. \n \n To face this challenge, players have a level of freedom unrivaled by any previous Rainbow Six game. Combining tactical maps, observation drones, and a new rappel system, Rainbow teams have more options than ever before to plan, attacks, and diffuse these situations. \n \n COUNTER TERRORIST UNITS\n Counter terrorist operatives are trained to handle extreme situations, such as hostage rescue, with surgical precision. As \u201cshort range\u201d specialists, their training is concentrated on indoor environments. Operating in tight formations, they are experts of close quarter combat, demolitions, and coordinated assaults. Rainbow Six Siege will include operators coming from five of the most worldwide renowned CTU: the British SAS, the American SWAT, the French GIGN, the German GSG9 and Russian SPETSNAZ.\n \n These Operators are specialists with their own expertise within Siege operations. Each has their own unique personality & specialty. Some are focused on assault whereas others are defense-oriented. They can be combined within the same team to create new team strategies.\n \n PROCEDURAL DESTRUCTION\n Destruction is at the heart of the siege gameplay. Players now have the unprecedented ability to destroy environments. Walls can be shattered, opening new lines of fire, and ceiling and floors can be breached, creating new access points. Everything in the environment reacts realistically, dynamically, and uniquely based on the size and caliber of bullets you are using or the amount of explosives you have set. In Rainbow Six Siege, destruction is meaningful and mastering it is often the key to victory. \n \nRainbow Six Siege: Operation Para Bellum - Maestro | Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]\n https://www.youtube.com/UbisoftNA", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2is383hoHY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2is383hoHY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2is383hoHY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2is383hoHY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2is383hoHY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Rainbow Six Siege: Operation Para Bellum - Maestro | Trailer | Ubisoft [NA]", "description": "Born and raised in Rome, member of the Gruppo di Intervento Speciale (G.I.S) and now a representative of the Italian Units in Team Rainbow.
