Caskets constantly rise from the background and produce zombies. If the the casket is blown up by the statue before the zombies are released, then the casket will drop AP. When the White Swan appears, the background will fade to white as in The Unfinished Swan. Ink blots will then splatter onto the background to create platforms when the whiteout ends. The statue of the King and the city from The Unfinished Swan will appear in the background when the first whiteout ends.\n\nA Gargoyle statue from MediEvil: Resurrection appears near the foreground and will taunt and wisecrack at the players, producing a unique line of dialogue for some characters in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/playstation-all-stars-battle-royale-graveyard", "videos": [{"id": 121978, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "O7c_NBoli64", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7c_NBoli64", "title": "Playstation All Stars Battle Royale - DLC: Graveyard Stage Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O7c_NBoli64/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
