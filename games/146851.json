She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.\n\nHow could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up?

What starts as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system.
