They must build and manage a secure and autonomous camp, with the help of a large range of structures unlocked through discoveries and events, as well as repair and upgrade their vehicles to ensure the group's survival in a world infested with the dead.\n\nTo do this, they will need to journey out into the vast region of Nayati River in search of the many resources, construction materials, vehicles, documents, weapons and armor found throughout the area, all while fighting the hordes of the dead roaming everywhere. And also to start looking for the dozens of missing who will join the ranks of the community, to find each a place in the group according to their skills and personalities.\n\nBut the infestation of the dead in the region cannot go unanswered! The survivors will have to summon their courage, their sense of organization and their wits to head the investigation over the course of a perilous adventure, which will lead them to the four corners of the region in hope of putting an end to the crisis and unraveling the mysteries of the legend of Nayati River!", "summary": "A single-player game of adventure and survival, set in a vast region infested with the dead.
