MacMan is guarding some prisoners trapped behind a wall. As if by magic, holes of different shapes and sizes appear in the wall. Children help MacMan stop his prisoners escaping by selecting shapes of the appropriate area, then manipulating them by rotation and/or reflection to fit each hole. If they are too slow, the prisoners break out and terrible things happen to MacMan!\n\nThe program features suberb special graphics effects, and a range of six difficulty levels.\n\nThis software was developed by educationalists and has been tried and tested in schools and homes. The program was written by Intelligent Software, creators of high quality educational software. For 5-9 year olds.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/macman-and-the-great-escape"}
