It was released in February 2021, following an initial three-episode release in November 2016. It was designed by Ofisil, who also composed the soundtrack for it.\nThis mapset acts as a retelling of the original events that unfolded in The Ultimate Doom; the maps are designed with traditional gameplay in mind, combining action, exploration and atmosphere on abstract and semi-realistic environments, with the custom made OST occasionally adding a slight horror vibe.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doom-damnation"}
