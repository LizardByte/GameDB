Inspired by recent indie gems and classic fan-favorites of the genre, Horace seeks to make an emotional connection through storytelling and features full cut scenes throughout to create a cinematic platform experience. Horace also comes packed with a host of mini games peppered throughout, many of which are inspired by classic games in pop culture history.
