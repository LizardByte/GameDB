Be careful not to rush, or you may lose your footing, but don't hesitate for too long - the beam may just slip out from under you.\n\nThis game is designed to be challenging. It will test your willingness to endure stress and your patience.\n\nThere is no save feature, but there are \"safe\" areas where you can go to rest before you take on the next beam. The game is complete when all beams have been crossed.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cornbread-png"}
