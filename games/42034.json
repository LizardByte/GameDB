The game was exclusive to the PC Engine and was released soon after another mecha strategy game from Masaya: Gaiflame.\n\nIn each scenario, the Serds - a league of specialized attack mecha - are deployed from their HQ ship Altea. The Serds all have single-letter code-names and different specializations: for example, the G-Serd wields a laser sword for devastating melee attacks and can move quickly, while the B-Serd is capable of long-range mortar attacks but has limited movement. The eponymous X-Serd is the most powerful of the team."}
