He thinks he hasn't beaten Bowser all that long ago, but when he talks to the Toad in front of him at the start of the game, he reveals that Mario has been dreaming of saving Peach from Bowser by doing easy adventures, but now he has to face the real world, which is anything but nice. Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser years ago, and he used her magic powers to destroy the world, which resulted in an adventure that is anything but easy. There are now many more lava pits, lava falls, bottomless pits, and other hazards. Mario must now save Princess Peach and defeat Bowser by facing the truly challenging levels that await in this game.", "summary": "A significantly more challenging remake of Super Mario 74, and one of the first kaizo Super Mario 64 rom hacks.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-74-extreme-edition", "videos": [{"id": 36875, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "68DiXV9c1oc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68DiXV9c1oc", "title": "Super Mario 74 Extreme Edition Release Trailer [WITH DOWNLOAD LINKS]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/68DiXV9c1oc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
