Scavenging through the remains of civilization are the Mutants, deformed humanoids and animals alike, searching for salvation or just something to eat. To survive, you and your companions must venture out to explore the Zone.\n\nMaybe one day you will find the Eden of legends, the ancients\u2019 haven in the middle of hell. That\u2019s where truth awaits, the stories say. Maybe you will find your answers there.\n\nThen again, maybe it\u2019s all bullshit.", "summary": "Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a tactical adventure game combining turn-based combat with real-time exploration, story, stealth, and strategy.\nExplore a post-human Earth where mankind has been eradicated by climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics.
