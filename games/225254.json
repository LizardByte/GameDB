The game appears to generate battle stats for your drawing seemingly at random. Other design/manga carts can be mounted and used for additional stamps in addition to those included with this cartridge. The package also contains very simple animation and drawing programs that you can mess around with if you insert the cartridge by itself with no addons."}
