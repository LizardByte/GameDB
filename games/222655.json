This installment introduces the ability to run along walls, the Rain Storm ability, and others, giving Dante even more freedom to defeat enemies in style. You can also play as the new character, Lucia, who uses speed as a weapon against enemies, as opposed to Dante who relies on power. The bonus mode, Bloody Palace, also makes its first appearance here.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/devil-may-cry-2--1"}
