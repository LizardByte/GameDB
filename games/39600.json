To start, players chooses between three big Japanese rally-spec vehicles\u2014the Mitsubishi Lancer, the Subaru Impreza, and the Toyota Celica\u2014which vary in their Speed, Control, and Body stats. \n \nIn each racing stage, the player needs to get to the finish line in the shortest time possible. If the clock hits zero, the player loses and the game is over unless they can continue. While driving, the time is hindered by barrels, puddles, slippery ice, cones and other obstacles in the player's path. Even other cars driving can be an obstacle. Also the player has to keep straight when driving up slopes, or the car will swerve and crash. The player can gain more time if they make it through checkpoints in between the starting and finishing points. The player can also take shortcuts. Before making a turn, the player will always get an immediate warning on the screen with a voice saying which direction the player ought to turn and certain warnings. \n \nAside from the starting Practice stage, there are six other stages to be conquered: European, African, Snow Land, Southern Hemisphere, Scandinavian, and Great Britain."}
