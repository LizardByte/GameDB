Each character takes turns playing a card from his or her hand onto the table, and only cards of the same color may be placed on one another. However, some cards are given two colors and may be used to switch whichever card the next player must lay. If a player is unable to place a card, he or she must draw cards until they can play. The game ends when a player no longer has any cards in his or her hand. In addition to featuring the Whis card game, the game is accompanied by several small story sequences involving characters from Tales of Eternia.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tales-of-mobile-whis-battle"}
