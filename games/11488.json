With his father gravely ill and the world turning its back on a once happy-go-lucky clown, Dropsy will need to help those in need, hug total strangers, and unravel dark and shameful secrets from his past on the way to redemption. Oh, and Dropsy can also talk to animals.\n\nDropsy is a non-traditional take on the classic point and click adventure formula starring the game\u2019s perpetually carefree namesake clown as he explores a richly detailed world full of colorful characters and sinister secrets, doling out hugs along the way. Rather than lead players on a singular narrative path, players are free to choose which avenues of adventure they want to explore in an open world setting and can piece the puzzles and story together however they choose.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dropsy", "videos": [{"id": 76157, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "It72E3EbJNk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It72E3EbJNk", "title": "Dropsy - Launch Trailer [Sing-A-Long Edition]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/It72E3EbJNk/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 76158, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "g274C7bfjws", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g274C7bfjws", "title": "Dropsy | Available Now on Nintendo Switch", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g274C7bfjws/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
