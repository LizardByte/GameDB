As the leader of the Global Health Organization (GHO) your task is to contain the spread of a virus and save humanity before it is too late. In addition to crisis management, the game provides the players with information on how to behave in the event of an epidemic, what actions to take, and how to protect themselves and their loved ones in the most effective way. The game is based on the data published by WHO and on the information acquired from experts and consultants. Through your actions, you will be able to see how difficult it is to manage during a crisis, what impact various decisions can have on an effective fight against a global epidemic, which can be caused by listening to charlatans or the lack of appropriate medical equipment.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/virus-the-outbreak"}
