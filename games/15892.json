Determined to follow in your father's footsteps, you make a vow to your mother to attend the Magic School in Selas. When starting, you can choose the occupation of the character, and you can choose a teacher from among some of the magicians while playing the game.\n\nYou are joined on your journey by Feyr, a bard, Romal, a knight, Lot, a priest, and many others. As you progress as a mage, you are sent on quests to explore ruins and uncover spells. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Kuroizel and the evil Veranede Tribe are plotting something, and it's up to you to find out what. This old school RPG is strictly fantasy. It has the nostalgic feel of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.\n\nSee if you can spot the advert by developer and publisher Hot-B for another of their products in the game! Despite its rather pedestrian roots, the game takes several surprising twists towards the end, and is generally worth sticking it out even if the wrap-up (or lack thereof) is a bit of a let down. As a note, there\u2019s more game past \u201cTHE END.\u201d Also as a note, do set your window speed to \u201cfast\u201d in the in-game options menus - it\u2019ll improve your experience dramatically.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ancient-magic-bazuu-mahou-sekai", "videos": [{"id": 43117, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "kLdOl4FgatY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLdOl4FgatY", "title": "Ancient Magic: Bazoo!
