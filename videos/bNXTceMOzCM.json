The audio is ok and you can adjust the volume while playing if the main track becomes boring. The playability is ok, War Heli came with a good feature: you could save the game to the disk and continue later. This balanced the frustrating fact that you must go back to the beginning of the level if you get hit by the enemy's bullets,\nHere you'll find gameplay of level one and part of level two.\n\nAll footage taken from original hardware machines and upscaled to 1080P.\n\nLet me know what do you think about the video in the comments below but, most important, Enjoy!!!\nIf you liked the video, please consider giving a thumb's up and maybe also subscribe. \n\nThanks for watching.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bNXTceMOzCM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bNXTceMOzCM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bNXTceMOzCM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bNXTceMOzCM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bNXTceMOzCM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "War Heli - Atari ST", "description": "In this video, War Heli, released in 1987 for the Atari ST by Argonics.\nTwo Swiss crackers M.
