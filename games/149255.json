The city would be called KindFolx.\n\n5 years later, Ozma would pass away, and as agreed, a Monsterfolk would take his place at the head of the city as a sign of trust and faith by the humans. Darlocke, a cruel general of the monster army, would bring about a new wave of human hatred. Oppression would begin, and homelessness, violence, and slavery inflicted on humans would soar.\n\nNow, in order to prevent these growing atrocities from inciting another war, a team of adventurers have banned together to put everything on the line to overthrow Darlocke in the heart of the city.\n\nWill you and the Adventurers Guild be able to successfully destroy the evil in the deepest parts of KindFolx?", "summary": "KindFolx, a city where Humankind and Monsterfolx live in peace has been taken over by a cruel Monsterfolk General and given birth to a new era of human oppression and violence.
