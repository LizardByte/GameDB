He has stopped boos from taking over and even giant frogs. However, not long ago, he foiled the attempt of two otherworldly beings named Racter and Magna, from distorting his world's magnetic field. Mario bested Racter, but not before he could call for help.\n\nMario must now face off against an enemy like no other he has seen... two enemies! He must be quick, for they have built a devious super weapon that could very well turn the Mushroom Kingdom and more into nothing more than a parking lot! He's not alone though, traveling with him is yet another otherworldly being who seems to know the two villains.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-devious-four-chronicles-3-the-crater"}
