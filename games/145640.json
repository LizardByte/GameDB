Despite being developed in Korea, the game conveys the typical Chinese Wuxia atmosphere quite well with its oriental music and a graphics style that would look hideous in most other contexts with its low-end plastic doll render sprites, but here it just fits together perfectly.\n\nGameplay follows the standard Final Fantasy formula with random battles and ATB combat, although not without some unique twists. There's a cryptic healing item system based on a characters Yin/Yang alignment and more elaborate combat placement settings than is usual for the genre. Dungeons tend to be a bit on the dull side, with lots of same looking rooms and hallways.\n\nThe game is almost comically incompletable: Very early on, it just stops unlocking new areas and instead respawns the same boss over again each time his lair is entered."}
