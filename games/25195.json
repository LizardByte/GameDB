The city has survived for four hundred years, longer than most of its citizens can remember. A few whisper about the time of the great plague; a time when the desperate survivors grew so afraid of their fleshly bodies that they encased themselves in metal ones - bodies that would rust and break down, but never sicken and die. Since then they have waited, counting the days as the city falls into ruin.\n\nAtto was only eight years old when his body was encased in metal. He remembers nothing of the time before. He only knows that someone must have given him his beautiful pocket watch, and a restless urge to fix things.\n\nMilli is a masterpiece of mechanical ingenuity. She has detailed knowledge of the workings of Watchtower. And more importantly: of time itself. Yet, she knows nothing of her origins, except that she was meant for a great purpose.", "summary": "Clockwork, set in the great mechanical city of Watchtower, is a story about unlikely friends coming together to try to fix an imperfect world. The city\u2019s mysterious past is questioned when Atto\u2019s trusty pocket watch suddenly wakes up and introduces itself as Milli. Renewed with a sense of purpose, Atto and Milli must explore the city, control time and confront terrifying bosses, before it\u2019s too late.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clockwork", "videos": [{"id": 10591, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eAgnI7UVmyc"}, {"id": 10592, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "z2fLOlQxA8w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2fLOlQxA8w", "title": "Clockwork - PC Gameplay Walkthrough (Steam Indie Puzzle Platformer Game 2016) (No Commentary)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z2fLOlQxA8w/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
