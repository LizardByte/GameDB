She was soon drawn to Vlad\u2019s intense charisma, and he in turn came to rely upon her unquestioning support and devotion absolutely; what began as a marriage of convenience transformed into a partnership of legend. As she lay dying from a wasting disease, Vlad granted her the Blood Kiss, and she joined him in eternal undeath.\n\nNow, Isabella is a powerful Vampire in her own right, and may be seen stalking the front lines bearing the Blood Chalice of Bathori. When she joins Vlad on the same battlefield, their combat prowess is multiplied, each standing shoulder to shoulder with their beloved in death!", "summary": "Introducing the daughter of the mad Count Otto von Drak, Legendary Lord Isabella von Carstein.\n\nBeginning play with ownership of Western Sylvania, Isabella may now be chosen to command a Grand Campaign as the leader of the Von Carstein family.
