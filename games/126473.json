But as the story begins to unfold, players will realize that they may have signed up for more than they bargained for. Malfunctioning animatronics are delivered to their doorsteps for a series of frightening encounters. The inbox provides many tips for dealing with this, as well as some emails, not meant to be sent to the player.\n\nOne series of emails tells the story of a man named Luis trying to inform a woman, Ness, about red-flag reports triggered by her harmful and offensive search words. The emails suggest that she is under the control of William Afton, one of Fazbear Entertainment's co-founders and secretly a child serial killer, who was presumed to have died in a fire several years ago. Ness is heavily implied to be Vanny from Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted, as \"Ness\" is short for Vanessa (which is presumably Vanny's real name), and Vanny was also possessed by Afton after encountering a digital form of him while play-testing one of Fazbear's products. Another series of emails tells the story of the employees at Fazbear Entertainment scanning the circuit boards of old animatronics for \"The Freddy Fazbear Virtual Experience\".", "summary": "Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s AR: Special Delivery is the next terrifying installment in the FNAF franchise.

Through the game, players subscribe to Fazbear Entertainment\u2019s brand new \u201cFazbear Funtime Service\u201d and get their favorite animatronics on-demand. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the visiting animatronics malfunction and attack subscribers instead of entertaining them.\n\nPlayers must confront an endless stream of hostile animatronics that will follow them wherever they go. The question is, how long can players survive?
