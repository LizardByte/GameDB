Meanwhile, in space, an alien satellite docks with a satellite, leading Soundwave to order Sideways and Demolishor to intercept a NEST convoy. Sideways steals the convoy\u2019s cargo, and Demolishor causes widespread destruction. As Decepticons take control of a NEST gun and target planes, Optimus Prime leaps into action, engaging Decepticon forces in Shanghai while trying to avoid attacks from both the gun and ground-based missiles. After a fierce battle, Prime orders Bumblebee and Ironhide to pursue Sideways and Demolishor, respectively.\n\nIronhide engages in a brutal fight with Demolishor, smashing through Decepticon drones and using his surroundings to defeat the larger foe. After a series of intense confrontations, Ironhide finally destroys Demolishor. Meanwhile, Bumblebee tracks Sideways through the city, engaging in a chase across the rooftops. As Sideways escapes, Bumblebee is momentarily delayed but manages to catch up just as Sideways calls for backup from Soundwave. Despite a fierce battle, Sideways is carried away by Starscream, and Bumblebee reports the failure to Optimus.\n\nStarscream attacks a NEST platform, targeting generators that power the shields protecting Megatron's crushed form. After a successful strike, he allows Sideways to enter the platform. However, Megatron is reactivated, and Devastator is sent to Shanghai to cause chaos. Optimus, Bumblebee, and Ironhide are dispatched to stop the massive threat. Optimus engages Devastator, with the help of NEST\u2019s energy canisters, ultimately defeating the colossal Decepticon after a fierce battle. Optimus uncovers a piece of Cybertronian technology buried by Devastator, setting the Autobots on a mission to locate Bumblebee, who is still in enemy hands.\n\nAs the story progresses, the Autobots face several challenges, with Megatron\u2019s plans escalating, Starscream\u2019s machinations continuing, and battles intensifying across Shanghai. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, work tirelessly to stop Megatron\u2019s forces and recover vital technology. The situation becomes increasingly dire, culminating in a final showdown where the Autobots must face their most significant threats yet, leading to an epic conclusion where the fate of the battle and their mission is decided.", "summary": "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a video game adaptation of the film, developed by Krome Studios for the Wii and PlayStation 2. The game shares several developers with the previous Armada-based title, following Krome Studios' acquisition of Melbourne House in 2006. The gameplay and features of this version differ significantly from those in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 releases. The game received generally negative reviews due to its limited transformation mechanics, linear level design, and repetitive gameplay elements.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen--1", "videos": [{"id": 142789, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "h21rChpAVzQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h21rChpAVzQ", "title": "PS2 Longplay [021] Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Full Game Walkthrough", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h21rChpAVzQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 3197, "name": "Transformers"}]}
