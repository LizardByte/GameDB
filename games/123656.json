You can decide to keep artefacts for your collection or to auction them off to travel even further or get even better gear.\n\nTreasure Hunter Simulator is not a hardcore metal detector simulator, but rather a mix of arcade and simulation. With streamlined detector mechanics the game is enjoyable not only for the fans of the genre, but casual gamers as well. Simple, intuitive gameplay elements combined with beautiful landscapes make for a truly enjoyable experience.", "summary": "Dive into the exciting world of finding long forgotten treasures.
