Hard Reset Redux is coming June 3 to PC, PS4, and Xbox One.\n\nThe world as we know it has ceased to exist. Surrounded by vast, hostile wastelands, the remnants of humankind's dwindling population live within the closed city of Bezoar, but the walls have been breached. As a CLN soldier, you are all that stands between the hive mind machines of The Sanctuary and total extinction.\n\nNo level grinding fluff. No pointlessly tacked-on multiplayer. Just a hardcore, no-#@%$-given, single-player FPS. Hard Reset Redux re-energizes Flying Wild Hog's cyberpunk shooter for a new audience with an upgraded visual engine and rebalanced gameplay, along with new enemies and weaponry. \n\nFor more information about Hard Reset Redux please visit http://store.steampowered.com/app/407810 and follow us on Twitter, @GambitiousInc or like us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/FlyingWildHog.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wi5FpyYt8kM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wi5FpyYt8kM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wi5FpyYt8kM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wi5FpyYt8kM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wi5FpyYt8kM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Hard Reset Redux - 15 Minutes of Bang Bang Boom!", "description": "Unapologetically over-the-top and forged from old-school brutality, a modern classic FPS returns to show the kids how it's done.
