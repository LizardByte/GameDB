{"id": "vWAI47TzQaM", "snippet": {"title": "Plotting (Arcade) - Gameplay", "description": "In this video, I'm doing a gameplay video of a game that I remembered playing Flipull on a Multicart for the NES and Game Boy. That game is: Plotting for the Arcade. This game was developed and published by Taito, it was released in the Arcade in 1989. Plotting (aka Flipull) was also ported to many home computers and one handheld console. Flipull was released for the NES (aka Famicom) and Game Boy. Plotting was released for the Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, GX4000 and ZX Spectrum. In 2005, Flipull/Plotting was re-released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and the PC as part of Taito Legends. Plotting/Flipull is a tile-matching puzzle game that bears strong graphical and some gameplay similarities to Puzznic. Originating in the arcades, Plotting involves several different types of blocks, bearing symbols such as squares, circles and crosses. Using a small yellow object to direct a block across onto a particular section of a shaped wall. It will then rebound onto a set of blocks at a particular angle, with the intention of removing similar blocks it touches. This is done against a time limit, and there are special blocks to help out with extra lives. About my gameplay video of this game: The game can be tricky, because if you get a block that you can't remove, you'll lose a life. I almost completed stage 6, but unfortunately if you have no more moves left and it's game over. Overall, Plotting/Flipull is a fun tile-matching puzzle game with some decent challenge if you like one of those kind of puzzle games. I hope you enjoy this gameplay video of Plotting for the Arcade and thanks for watching!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vWAI47TzQaM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vWAI47TzQaM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vWAI47TzQaM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vWAI47TzQaM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vWAI47TzQaM/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Plotting (Arcade) - Gameplay", "description": "In this video, I'm doing a gameplay video of a game that I remembered playing Flipull on a Multicart for the NES and Game Boy.
