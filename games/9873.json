In recent times, Moonrises have been rare, sometimes separated by centuries, and their corruption lasting mere days. But that\u2019s changing now, as the cycle intensifies once again, and the world faces an age of danger and uncertainty. \n \nNow it\u2019s time for you to set off on a grand adventure to protect your world and fulfill your destiny to become a master Warden.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moonrise", "videos": [{"id": 4119, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "wOuLFx5X5eM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOuLFx5X5eM", "title": "Moonrise\u2122 -   iOS,Android   (HD) Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wOuLFx5X5eM/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 4115, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "tcexqY64iuw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcexqY64iuw", "title": "Moonrise, a New RPG Unveiled at PAX Prime!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tcexqY64iuw/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 4116, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Ja6B3572LSM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja6B3572LSM", "title": "Moonrise PvP Fight", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ja6B3572LSM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
