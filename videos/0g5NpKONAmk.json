(No one has stolen anything from anyone- it's simply a collaboration)\n\nI spent around 2 months working on this short. It would have been a lot quicker, but some of the Dota 2 assets are broken and take a lot of time and workarounds to fix. Additionally, I had to cut out around a minute's worth of scenes to make the short work with the audio track I bought (which you can find here - http://audiojungle.net/item/blockbuster-trailer-version-2/7149063)\n\nThe actual tournament event is over now, but is available for streaming online and you can catch up with some of the Top Plays on the DotaCinema channel!\n\nAnyway, i'll be back working on TF2 videos now this is released! Teasers probably coming soon ;)\n\nhttp://www.lozeng3r.com/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0g5NpKONAmk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0g5NpKONAmk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0g5NpKONAmk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0g5NpKONAmk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0g5NpKONAmk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Dota 2 - Like a Game of Chess - The International TI4 Trailer (SFM)", "description": "If you enjoy these shorts and my work, please consider supporting me on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/lozeng3r\n\nI'm also available for hire if you are a Workshop contributor and would like a promo video made for a new item set/courier you're working on!\n\nYou may have already seen this video on DotaCinema's channel- I am the original creator of the animation and worked together with them to bring the short/trailer to a larger audience before the event!
