In the beginning millions of lives were lost, allied soldiers were simply slaughtered by the seemly unstoppable PNA Death Droids. It was a stroke of luck, or pure chance while operating in total darkness that we were able to build a weapon capable of pushing the PNA filth back into the dirt.\nUsing intel gained from a captured PNA scientist, the first Mech Skeleton was activated. Our soldiers finally had the super human abilities needed to rise up against the enemy. Initially the program was considered a great success, with the PNA crippled Mech Skeleton pilots were feared on the battlefield. Until recently, when things changed. Allied forces have been trying to pass off the recent strange behaviour as a small glitch in the system, nothing to worry about. However this is no glitch. The Mech Skeleton program and the technology driving must not be trusted.", "summary": "Mech Skeleton is an HTC Vive game mixing intense first person shooter action with hide and seek stealth.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mech-skeleton", "videos": [{"id": 13231, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "XxbJm9MZWPY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxbJm9MZWPY", "title": "Mech Skeleton", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XxbJm9MZWPY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
