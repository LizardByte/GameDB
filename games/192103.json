Bathe it, feed it, teach it to pirate random underwater treasure, and give it all the love and attention it needs to grow to an adult before you send it off into the world to fulfill its mystical destiny. But don't worry your pretty, air-breathing head off. For every axolotl adult you release to the mystical unknown, you'll get a brand new axolotl egg that you can hatch and play with."}
