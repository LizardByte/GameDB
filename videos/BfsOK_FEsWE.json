{"id": "BfsOK_FEsWE", "snippet": {"title": "[SM64 HACK] Mario's Trip in China release! The second Chinese SM64 hack", "description": "Thank you very much for playing my hack Mario's Trip in China!\n\nThis is the second SM64 hack from China, and the authors are Liu Zijun and 104. In this hack, you'll see many fantastic things that you've never seen before. While you are playing, you'll have a chance to travel to many places in China and enjoy glorious views and diverse cultures without spending time and money! \n\nWonderful, right?\n\nMore than that, if you've played our first hack Slask's Adventure, you would've seen many thrilling boss fights -- theses fights are remastered into something even more interesting in this hack. Also, I learned how to make objects with the advanced approach called ASM, and then I created many unprecedented objects in this hack. I hope you all enjoy them! (I'll release my config file together with the hack so that you can check how I used the custom objects and the ASM code. You can open it with rom manager and transport all the interesting things I've made into your own hacks!)\n\nThis hack is NOT a 100% kaizo hack. It's designed for all players, no matter if you are a newcomer or a master in SM64. Most parts of this hack are pretty easy, and I'm sure you could unlock and enter all the courses (70 stars requirement) without suffering. But there are also many challenges left for experienced players, and the final course (B3) is super kaizo with fast-moving quicksands and lavas, which elevate it to a new level of difficulty that even TWDE EE Reds don't have. Even if TWDE is conquered savestateless (It's on you pluto!), I don't think my hack will be beaten in this way. I would say the TAS videos of the final course could bring players a different kind of enjoyment tho.\n\nHighlights of this fantastic tour in China:\nNJ Shark with a star\nC1 King Bob-omb on quicksand that needs hidden timed boxes to fight\nWC Flying across the Manta rings\nC2 Wiggler boss in a toxic room with falling platforms over quicksand\nC4 Penguin race on thin roads\nB1 Great models of Chinese Palaces made by 104\nC5 Wall-kicks on moving walls and running on falling roads\nC6 Scuttlebug boss on rotating quicksand battlefield and Ocarina-of-Time-style labyrinth\nC7 Whomp King on rotating quicksand battlefield; quick climbing when it moves up\nMC Lava bouncing Boos\nC8 Eyerock fight on quicksand \nB2 Limited camera to search hidden road\nVC Shooting to the flying Klepto\nC9 Quick swimming across the sea; hole with many hungry fish\nC10 Moving walls (thins) and only 0.5s slide\nC11 Unagi and Koopa race in cave\nC12 Ukiki grabbing on lava and wall kicking labyrinth\nC13 Narrow paths with lava and horizontal wind\nC14 Many new use of moving objects (Go and Try!)\nC15 Bully fight on quicksand with toxic\nB3 I've mentioned above!\n\nThere's still pretty much to say. Just Try and Enjoy!\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThanks Pilzinsel64 and ZenonX for developing Great Tool Rom Manager, Kaze and scuttlebug_raiser for ASM codes and tutorials.\n\nThanks kazte789 for play-testing, Focus_SR for making the final course Reds!\n\nThanks Nintendo for the wonderful SM64!\n\nThanks all the plays and hackers from all over the world who helped me and supported my hack!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfsOK_FEsWE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfsOK_FEsWE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfsOK_FEsWE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfsOK_FEsWE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BfsOK_FEsWE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "[SM64 HACK] Mario's Trip in China release!
