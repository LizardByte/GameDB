Sorry, I didn't have much thoughts during the game to warrant subtitles. But the creeper in the thumbnail is not clickbait. Trust me.\n\nGame: Bevel's Painting (\u30d9\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u7d75)\nFind the game here: https://vgperson.com/games/bevelspainting.htm\nOriginal creator: Maninu\nRelease Date: 2014\nEngine: RPG Maker VX\nI do NOT own anything on this video, all credit to their respective creators.\n\nIf the creator wants me to take this down, please tell me.\n\u3082\u3057\u30af\u30ea\u30a8\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3053\u308c\u3092\u524a\u9664\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u671b\u3080\u306a\u3089\u3001\u79c1\u306b\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\u3002 (DeepL)\n\nGame translated by vgperson.\n\nNo subtitles, sorry. Since I couldn't really come up with anything to talk about. Sorry.\n\nI think this game is extremely neat and I wanted to replay it. So I did and I made a video since I don't think this is a game that's talked about a lot? At least I haven't seen much.\n\nWhich is shocking since you can play as the Minecraft Creeper in it. It's very funny to me but maybe it isn't for anyone else. My sense of humor is very strange lol\n\nI think the way this game is structured is really interesting, there's no dialogue but there are 9 endings depending on what items you use and when. \n\nI tried to go for the second ending in this video first but I forgot to read some requirements for it. (vgperson's walkthrough on their site is extensive but kind of a pain sometimes if you don't read it fully. Whoops.)\n\nThe game also has it's own language Bevelese which you are given a cipher for when you download the game. I didn't feel like translating the Bevelese here since that takes a good while and I think Manly has a video with all of them translated? Or something I don't remember.\n\nThis game is very Yume Nikki-inspired. But I think it works. It's still very much its own thing. \n\nI try not to usually do this but since the ending structure in this game is wack, I did have a walkthrough fully on hand. \n\nHowever, if you play this blind I recommend just playing it without following a walkthrough. See what end you get and all. And then maybe look at the Endings chart to see what to do differently. (There's one on vgperson's site.)\n\nI do really like this game and I think it's very underrated. It's quite unique compared to it's more popular adversaries but I feel like it should be experienced by more people.\n\nI only got 2 main game endings out of 10. So if you want to see those perhaps you could play this? Please. I want more people to know about this game PLEASE. (Do what you want, lol. I don't really care.)\n\nTimestamps\n\n00:00 Main Game (Just Playing through)\n39:39 Main Game (Getting another ending!)\n1:06:30 Extra Scenario (The one with the Creeper aw man)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Gweqgk4dhg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Gweqgk4dhg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Gweqgk4dhg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Gweqgk4dhg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Gweqgk4dhg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Bevel's Painting | Japanese RPG Horror | No Commentary", "description": "\"A girl enters a world of her own creation.\"\nMy thoughts are in the description.
