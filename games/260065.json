The editor and its assistant Cuppit are all part of the game; anyone involved in game or level design should appreciate the humor.\n\nThe editor is an exercise of twisted logic and lateral thinking. You have to see it to believe it; with its offbeat controls, inventory items that kill you, and intentional misspellings, it's the weirdest thing since sliced bread!\n\nMETA is based on Adventure Game Studio, the platform for most of our games, and is runner-up for two AGS Awards.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/meta--1", "videos": [{"id": 95088, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "xK5492pmUf8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5492pmUf8", "title": "META", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xK5492pmUf8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
