Dust off your wood grained Atari and shove the old school classic arcade cartridge of MAZE CRAZE in there and play against your friends (or your mates if you are from the UK) it's a 2 two player game.\n\nMAZE CRAZE claims to be a game of cops and robbers, but I think it's more like a video game version of The Shining. You play as one of two blocks who need to escape from the maze first. It sounds stupid but this classic game is a lot of fun as a unique party game.\n\nBe sure to watch the original Classic Game Room episodes. Classic Game Room was the original classic video game review show on the Internet in 1999-2000, now on DVD. The HD series is reviewing PS3, Genesis, NES, Atari and Xbox 360.
