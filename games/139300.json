We are super happy to see the success of Among Us, which many of our team has been playing - and that has inspired us to finish our version and hopefully push the envelope on the whole social mystery genre!\n\nWith that said, we welcome everyone in this discord to try the game and help give us feedback, suggestions, and more! We've been working on this for quite some time and I'm excited for everyone to try it out and let us know what you think!", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/betrayal-dot-io"}
