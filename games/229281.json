Kingsley, in the role of the Story Teller, offers a pleasant, pleasurable stroll through an Amazon village and its surroundings. The story follows jungle-boy Kiyeko's effort to retrieve the Night, stolen by a couple of snakes reminiscent of Disney's bad-guy animal characters, through 11 different animated scenes - from Kiyeko's village in the Amazon jungle, through the forest, to the snakes' lair, and back again. The well-drawn graphics, which integrate 3D backgrounds with 3D animations, and movie-style quality of the title are lovely to look at, regardless of your age.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}]}
