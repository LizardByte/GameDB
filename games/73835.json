Your task is to command the ship, dictating what your crew is doing - repair work, navigation, preparation for battle and preparation for boarding other ships have to be balanced. Different ranks change the way you play the campaigns.\n\nCampaigns include The Wooden Walls of England (fight as the British in the Anglo-French wars in the Channel) or John Paul Jones (where you play the hero role, and lead the American Navy). There are also 20 smaller campaigns to play through. A few distinct multiplayer modes exist to to challenge your mates, and answer the age-old question \"Who is the best captain?\" A scenario editor completes the package.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/man-of-war-ii-chains-of-command"}
