The game is very loosely based on the movie, and each level just consits of shooting hoops in a half court (sorry to any basketball fans for my lack of terminology). The idea of the game is to outlast your opponent or be first to score 21 points. Sounds a lot easier than it is. \nNow i played this game at Earls Court in London UK at the Live 95 festival (in 1995) and i thought it was great. Playing it today i have mixed views. \nFirstly the graphics struggle when played on a large screen tv, i reccomend using a smaller tv, or shrinking the screen. And secondly the gameplay gets a little tedious, as the cpu characters just seem to never miss the hoop. Finally the storyline is terrible, you get presented with 1 liners that make little sense, and characters that have nothing to do with the movie. \nMy final thought would be that White Men Cant Jump is not a bad game, its far better than Shaq Fu on the Snes, but for the price, theres better jag games to invest in.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HN5Vi5jyMY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HN5Vi5jyMY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HN5Vi5jyMY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8HN5Vi5jyMY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "White Men Cant Jump Atari Jaguar Gameplay (High Voltage Software / Trimark )", "description": "In this video i test out the single player competition mode on the Atari Jaguar game called White Men Cant Jump.
