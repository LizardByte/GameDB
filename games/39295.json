It made its debut in Japan in 1994 and later reached North America and Europe in 1995.\n\nThe game, inspired by the X-Men comic book series, marks Capcom's first foray into creating a fighting game featuring characters licensed from Marvel Comics. Timed with the popularity of the mid-1990s X-Men animated series, the game incorporates voice actors from the show reprising their respective roles.\n\nSet against the backdrop of the \"Fatal Attractions\" storyline from the comics, the game's narrative revolves around players taking on the roles of various X-Men characters or their adversaries in a battle against the antagonist Magneto. The gameplay involves one-on-one fighting matches, where players face off against different characters in the game. The ultimate challenge comes in the form of battles against Juggernaut and Magneto.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-children-of-the-atom"}
