But instead, there is an ASMR soundtrack, a stylish minimalistic design and a relaxing atmosphere inside!\n\nAbstractism was delisted on Steam on July 30th, 2018 after players like YouTuber SidAlpha began investigating the game\u2019s high CPU and GPU usage. Investigators discovered the game was running cryptocurrency mining software and the developers encouraged players to leave the game running in the background to accrue in-game items.\n\nAt the same time, the developers were engaging in the practice of releasing Steam Marketplace items that very closely mimicked sought after items from other popular titles. By offering these items to unsuspecting players on Steam, they would sell the item and then alter the appearance and description.\n\nIn response, Valve pulled the game from the Steam store on July 30th and banned the developer from the service. At the time they also instituted a system of confirmation messages that players needed to click in order to confirm item trade offers for games that Steam has identified they have never played."}
