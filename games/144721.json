Here, various items get put in front of Snorlax and you have to press the A button to eat it. The sooner you press the A Button, the more points you will get. However, there is a catch. Sometimes, a Pichu will be put in front of Snorlax. If you get Snorlax to try to bite, then Pichu uses Thundershock and the game ends. The amount of items you eat is kept track of, as is your overall score, which is then kept in a Top 5 ranking so you can try and beat your best score.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-mini-snorlaxs-lunch-time", "videos": [{"id": 46715, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "SNNwcB-oTSM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNNwcB-oTSM", "title": "Snorlax's Lunch Time (PM) - High Score Attempt #1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SNNwcB-oTSM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
