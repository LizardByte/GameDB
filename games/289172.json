Train, gather magical equipment, and transform into stronger monsters while on your quest to protect your home.", "summary": "Vanguard Monsters is a Roguelite Autobattler where you raise a party of monsters, collect treasure, and do battle to fend off the invading forces of the Void. Battles happen automatically, with anywhere between 1 to 6 monsters on either side of the field. Each monster attacks or uses their ability when their respect charge meters fill, so you will need to choose the best formation at the start of the battle to tackle what unique challenges the enemies present each time. You move a monster in battle but theres a cooldown on this, so time it wisely to protect someone weak or concentrate damage on a big threat! When a monster reaches 0 hp it will be unable to fight for the rest of that battle and your party will accrue a wound. Gain too many wounds and your monsters will be unable to continue their quest.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vanguard-monsters"}
