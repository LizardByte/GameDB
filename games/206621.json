They are grouped by the following categories: Space, Historic, Monster, Sports, and Places.\n\nThe tables themselves run on the Balls of Steel game engine. Like that game, each of these pinball tables is presented in an overhead view with a \"dot pixel\" display at the bottom of the screen which relays the player's score, messages and bonuses.\n\nThe \"goal\" of each table varies with the theme but generally the player is expected to shoot & ricochet their pinball into specific places in specific orders. The player's controls are to move the paddle on the left, move the paddle on the right, launch a new ball and \"tilt\" (shake) the pinball machine.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-pinball--1"}
