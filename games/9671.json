The player starts with a three-heart life gauge and one spell attack. The player can increase Princess's lives by collecting golden tokens (which look like the Princess's face), gaining one life for every three coins collected. The player can also increase health by finding heart containers in treasure chests. Spells can be obtained throughout the game and are important for advancing further.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
