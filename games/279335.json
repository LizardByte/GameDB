The player controls a bird, depicted as a pixelated creature, and the goal is to navigate it through a succession of pipes. Tapping the screen makes the bird flap its wings, forcing it to ascend momentarily. The trick lies in timing these taps to keep the bird aloft and manage it between the openings in the pipes. The game is noted for its brutal difficulty, requiring precision and quick reflexes. Each successful pass through a set of pipes awards the player a point, and the objective is to achieve the maximum score possible before inevitably crashing with a pipe.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/promise-plane--1", "videos": [{"id": 102814, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "GMybwf6l_hM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMybwf6l_hM", "title": "Promise Plane [Gameplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GMybwf6l_hM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
