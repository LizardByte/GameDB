The game features higher resolution graphics and more detailed character models. It adds two new robots, the nurse-like Pixel and the crab-like Cancer, along with a few new bosses and hidden characters. It also adds various new arena types of different shapes (the original game only had standard square arenas), including completely walled-in ones, as well as arenas with low barriers that the opponent can be juggled over to lead to a ring out. Rounds are now considerably shorter, and the robot's armor easier to knock off.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zero-divide-2-the-secret-wish", "videos": [{"id": 33660, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "kUix2SAlNQM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUix2SAlNQM", "title": "Zero Divide 2: The Secret Wish - Japanese Import - PS1 Full Story Mode Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kUix2SAlNQM/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
