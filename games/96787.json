Visit various construction sites and pick up dirt, boulders and rubble by driving the Skid Loader! Then drive the loaded Dump Truck to various locations to dump the load! Use a Wrecking Ball Truck to help knock down a building, lift boulders using giant crane, and crush rubble with a gigantic masher bulldozer! A real treat for those little Dump Truck and Bulldozer enthusiasts and a great way to encourage curiosity and interaction for all. Touch the driver and he honks the horn. Touch a cloud as it passes by and it smiles and hums. The neighborhood is interactive. When your child touches people, animals, or vehicles they make sounds and perform actions. Its like a moving story book!"}
