A group of reputable mappers has been gathered together to form a \u201cvanilla feel\u201d episode. The goal was to create an \u201cunofficial 6th\u201d episode, to follow Quake\u2019s unofficial 5th, Dimension of the Past. The focus was to design a series of various themed maps, where Ranger is traveling through time to stop the evil that is tainting the time continuum. Main maps had to include at least one quad, stay within the range of 100 enemies (more if multiple quads exist), and not use external models or sounds; however, skyboxes, colored lighting, and the fog were okay. Mappers for the episode include the following: Bal, Fairweather, FifthElephant, Greenwood, JCR, Jpal, Markie Music, Nolcoz, Rhoq, and ZungryWare. Due to the use of the progs_dump mod, some minor, \u201cquality of life\u201d changes have been made. Epochs of Enmity also includes an original soundtrack.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/epochs-of-enmity", "videos": [{"id": 66144, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IjfIQGDzOuo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjfIQGDzOuo", "title": "Epochs of Enmity Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IjfIQGDzOuo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
