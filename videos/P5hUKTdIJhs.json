I've completed 62 levels (another 20 off-screen) and the game still goes on and on and on... Levels seem repeating themselves, so there's no point in playing it more. If you lose all your lives - you must play it from the very beginning and you can't get more, than 9 lives, just like powerups. Some people played through 186 levels and there was no end at all... I think, at some point you get score, that can't be displayed or maybe you can get to the level, where the game crashes, but there's no point in it - it never ends normally, there is no story or something. And to be honest, it gets really boring after maybe 20 levels and for some players even earlier.\n\n----------------------------------\nJava playlist:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNGa1kVSWDk1SigG7rMHRQcYLnmtfOVtS\nPlayed on PC using J2Me Loader emulator on BlueStacks Android emulator.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P5hUKTdIJhs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P5hUKTdIJhs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P5hUKTdIJhs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Spider-Man 3: Puzzle 2007 (Java) - Longplay", "description": "Well, this game is infinite.
