With a love for Pok\u00e9mon battle, and a burning desire to be the very best, he takes on the region\u2019s Gym Leaders, and eventually conquers the Pok\u00e9mon League. A well-trodden tale if there ever was one\u2026 but it is far from the whole story.\n\nBehind Red\u2019s seemingly simplistic Pok\u00e9mon adventures lies a darker, more sinister plot \u2013 one that its original hero never hears of, but which holds significance for both him and the fate of the Kanto region. Sociopathic scientists, revenge-hungry nurses and corrupt Gym Leaders are just a few of the characters who show their true colors once Red turns his back, and the very people who appeared most friendly and considerate through his na\u00efve eyes may in fact be secretly harboring the most malicious of intentions.\n\nWhat is the connection between Lance, Giovanni and Professor Oak? What exactly happened during the Great Pok\u00e9mon War? How was the mysterious Mewtwo created? Not to mention: what is the fate of the hundreds of Trainers Red so ruthlessly defeat? The answers lie in the story behind the story, and it begins deep in Kanto\u2019s criminal underworld\u2026", "summary": "Play as a member of Team Rocket!\n\nIn Pok\u00e9mon FireRed: Rocket Edition, you will cheat, lie and steal your way to the top as you engage with the thriving gang scene of the Kanto region.
