The song is a \"conduction song\" (\u4f1d\u5c0e\u697d\u66f2) that can be \"conducted\" to other players by playing it with them in multiplayer mode.\n-- This is the first time the conduction mechanic is introduced since DX; it was called \"shared song\" (\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2\u697d\u66f2) before DX versions.\n- Players with grades of \u4e8c\u6bb5 or higher in maimai \u3067\u3089\u3063\u304f\u3059 PLUS would be reset to \u521d\u6bb5.\n- \u30aa\u30c8\u30e2\u30c0\u30c1\u5bfe\u6226 can't be played on the first credit of maimai \u3067\u3089\u3063\u304f\u3059 Splash.\n\nIn regular song folders, a bubble appears above the jacket of songs chosen for Friend Matching, touching which would bring the player to the Friend Matching folder.

These are the first Standard charts added since maimai \u3067\u3089\u3063\u304f\u3059. They were added in three waves, the first beginning on October 23rd, 2020.\n\nOn September 25th, version 1.11 was released, which expanded the timing adjustment feature.\n- The timing adjust feature that existed before DX1.10 was renamed \"timing adjust A\". The feature itself isn't changed; it changes the position that the BGM and charts start playing at, and changes the timing that the notes reach the judgment line.\n- \"Timing adjust B\" is added. It adjusts the timing by changing the judgment position relative to the judgment line.\n\nThe icon for \"FULL SYNC DX\" is changed from \"FDX\" to \"FSD\".", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maimai-dx-splash", "videos": [{"id": 140517, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "xY_pCFzg1qA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY_pCFzg1qA", "title": "[maimai dx splash] Mutation ( life 10 )", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xY_pCFzg1qA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 140518, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "HNCBWCfk9qE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNCBWCfk9qE", "title": "[maimai DX \u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5] Title & Demo Loop (Asia Version)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HNCBWCfk9qE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
