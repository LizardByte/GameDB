This hack allows the player to turn into Super Sonic in said game after collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds, mimicking its prequels Sonic 2, Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. The rules are borrowed from the latter two games, so the player must double jump to transform and also must not have a shield in that moment, besides the basic requirements (having all emeralds and 50 rings).\n\nAll of Super Sonic's behaviour is implemented: a custom palette, a transformation pose with a fading palette, invincibility (with stars), speed shoes and a music change upon transformation. Rings drain while transformed as well. Super Sonic can still be killed by getting crushed by some falling platforms, however, so he isn't completely immune to death.\n\nThis hack is based off Sonic 3D: No Flickies, and as such it shares the same gameplay rules.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-sonic-in-sonic-3d"}
