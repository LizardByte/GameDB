A selfish clan that studied magic and a noble clan that was virtuous. Many years, they dwelled in discord until one day the sorcercers of the evil clan conjured a portal to a hidden dimension.\n\nThrough the portal there came strange beings whom the sorcerers sought to enslave. But these beings were strong. With their superior technology, they exterminated their enemies and took over the peaceful folk. Yet, in spite of all odds, the alien order has had to lose control.\n\nThe clans have made gains and risen. As their old disagreements reemerge they now race to rebuild their dominions while the aliens seek for their way back from out of chaos.", "summary": "In traditional MOBA games, players play on flat surface map.\nThis game takes the concept further and places all gameplay on surfaces of planets.\n\nSuch feature gives the gamer very high level of immersion and a \u201ccosmological\u201d vibe.\nThis also opens up a greater range of PvP dynamics impossible for traditional battlefields.\n\nAll action in this game happens in tug of war style supremacy between three well-balanced factions.\nThese factions are tasked with capturing enemy structures, acquiring units and wealth.\n\nPlayers control champions and compete against others using skill, arms and magic.\n\nFinally, players have the META goal.\nThroughout gameplay, everyone contributes cumulatively to the development of their faction\u2019s position in the world.\nAs factions get stronger, they acquire abilities to explore and to settle new planets. The goal is to conquer all of them.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/masters-of-conquest"}
