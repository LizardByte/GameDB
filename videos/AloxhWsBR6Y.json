The game is played in Anime mode which plays through the main story of the game.  The game has an interesting mechanic where you gain xp all the time you play.  If you lose/die, you keep your xp level and continue to try again and again util you are levelled up enough to beat the area you are having trouble with.  You have a lot of secondary weapons that level up as you go and I do try to show them all, but not necessarily at the most efficient time.  These weapons also level up through use.\n\nThere are a couple of other game modes like trial/score attack and also battle mode where you play in an almost rpg style to level up one of 3 mechs.  The bosses in the game are not particularly difficult with an easy recognisable shot pattern and it never goes all bullet hell on you.  There are probably more efficiant ways to kill them than I have shown though.  The game has three movement speed settings but even on slowest, the controls feel twitchy and it is way to easy to overshoot where you want to be when dodging shots.\n\n00:52:36  Sakuraigar Mode.  This is a weird playthrough of the main story mode again but played from the perspective of a child playing out the storyline of the game with her friends in what seems to be a fantasy cosplay setting. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AloxhWsBR6Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AloxhWsBR6Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AloxhWsBR6Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PC-FX Longplay [02] Tyoushin Heiki Zeroigar (Fan Translation)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nGod-Fighter Zeroigar, an English  Fan Translation of the Japanese original game  Tyoushin Heiki Zeroigar.\n\nA nice Shoot em up with plenty of FMV sequences to add to the story.
