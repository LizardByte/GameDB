Don\u2019t get too near them, as they can kill Dexter too but luckily they move more slowly than the other enemies.\n\n2) \"Bolt-generators\" (e.g. 18:49 & 20:38) \u2013 They look like power drops for bonus points, but when there is nothing directly below them, they start producing bolts constantly.\n\nI was hoping to clear this game in one run but I really messed up at Level 66 (27:02) cos I suddenly couldn\u2019t see how to get around those bolts.
