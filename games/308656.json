Some the glitches were that collision was off, and enemies spawned less frequently, it was removed on October 30th of 2010.\n\nOne user managed to grab it in time, and played the hack for themselves, and it wasn't just glitches that they saw.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-unl", "videos": [{"id": 119712, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "REVOR-9DwlQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REVOR-9DwlQ", "title": "S\u00d8NIC.UNC [Sonic 1 Unlicenced Creepypasta]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REVOR-9DwlQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
