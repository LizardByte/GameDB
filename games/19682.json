The discs were included along with the kit. The game features \"a few playable level via level select with a complete working debug mode,\" but there is no music or sound in them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ecco-2-sentinels-of-the-universe", "videos": [{"id": 8599, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "eLToimxrzYI"}]}
