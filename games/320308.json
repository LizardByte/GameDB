The natives here speak Japanese, however thanks to higher powers you're able to communicate with them in English. Although, if you so wish, you can enable settings from the in-game menu that let you experience parts of the game in Japanese (or romaji). These settings can be toggled on or off at any time, so players that want to turn Tinymon into a full-fledged learning experience can enjoy toggling these settings on at their own pace, as they become more comfortable with their Japanese skills (which you'll have opportunities to learn and practice in the game). Of course, you can leave all of these settings off, and experience the full game in English. Alternatively, you can toggle all of these settings on, and experience the game in complete Japanese.\nTinymon's world setting is greatly inspired by Japanese culture, meaning you can learn about the real world Japan. Thus, Tinymon provides for a laid back experience that focuses on exploration, and education of Japan's locations, customs, culture, and language (to those that are willing). We will even teach you how to use the trains system, some things you should avoid doing in Japan, and the first things you should do after landing in the Japanese airport! (Some of them even should be done before leaving the airport).", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tinymon"}
