The main reasons for this were the fact that the game was too old (it could not be placed on Google Play anymore), and the fact that they were lacking the source code of the game. They plan a new mobile version, but it will be compatible with Flash, and thus will not be the same PA anymore. That's why this wiki will only get minimal updates, to keep the spirit of PA alive!\n\nExplore the world of Galaxy Life, build a space colony, attack enemies, grab items and rule the universe. Galaxy Life is full of interesting planets and characters. You'd be surprised how big Galaxy Life is! In this free to play MMO strategy game that mixes traditional easy-to-play casual gameplay mechanics with touches of more traditional genres and features like tower defense, RTS, or several competitive PvP features in a persistent on-line Galaxy. You play together with others or your friends and take on evil, so gather your friends to fight evil in this Galaxy Life social game!", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/galaxy-life--1", "videos": [{"id": 134944, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "puSm9Xvny10", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSm9Xvny10", "title": "Official Release Trailer Galaxy Life (2022)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/puSm9Xvny10/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
