His quest won't be easy - he'll have to master the seasons themselves if he's to turn back the evil tide.", "summary": "Transform the world around you with the Rod of Seasons, and create order from chaos. Stop a power-hungry general named Onox, and rescue Din, the Oracle of Seasons, to save the troubled land of Holodrum.\n\nChange the seasons to overcome puzzling obstacles. If Link finds a small plant at the bottom of a cliff, change the season to summer, and Link can use the newly grown Deku Flower to boost up to the top. If Link faces a deep lake, use the Rod of Seasons to shift into winter, letting Link walk over the ice.\n\nReleased on the Game Boy Color system in 2001, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons represent the pinnacle of classic 2D Zelda gameplay.\n\nWhen played together, these two games offer an ultimate adventure not possible when each game is experienced on its own. The games feature a link system that unlocks access to additional content that you can't access any other way.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 15523, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "iqScK_AQDoY"}, {"id": 15524, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "_73CVfAvZ0A"}]}
