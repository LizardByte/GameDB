The rounds do not get any more confusing because the cats move in preset patterns - and the main strategy that is used to get past them, is comprised of a difficult way to more or less stand still. There are a total of thirty-one distinct rounds that the player can continue through even if he runs out of lives", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hopping-mappy"}
