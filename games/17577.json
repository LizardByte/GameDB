Little by little, life returned back to normal.\n\nThe story begins, when a young neophyte journeys north, to learn from an eccentric wizard, one of the most ancient and powerful Guild\u2019s members. The apprentice doesn\u2019t know yet, that his teacher-to-be is one of the Keepers, and that his destiny is to become a catalyst for the events, that will make Daenmor shudder\u2026\n\nBattle Mages: Sign of Darkness is an enthralling journey to the world of original game. It offers four new campaigns, covering dramatic events that took place in Daenmor long before the Shadow of Warlock spread over the land. The player will discover the mysteries of the Order of the Keepers, confront treacherous plans of the elves, lead vengeful Orcs to the battle, oppose the creatures of Chaos, and of course the darkness will raise its flag over the green hills of Daenmor under his command.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-mages-sign-of-darkness"}
