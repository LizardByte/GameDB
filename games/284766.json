While the sultan is fighting a war in a foreign land, his vizier Jaffar, a wizard, seizes power.

Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her to become his wife, or she would die within 60 minutes (extended to 120 minutes in the Super NES version, which has longer and harder levels). The game's unnamed protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown prisoner into the palace dungeons. In order to free her, he must escape the dungeons, get to the palace tower and defeat Jaffar before time runs out. But in addition to guards, various traps and dungeons, the protagonist is further hindered by his own doppelg\u00e4nger, an apparition of his own self that is conjured out of a magic mirror.", "summary": "The game is set in ancient Persia.
