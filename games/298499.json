Solomonars are wizards, blessed with the power of controlling the weather. It is said that each Solomonar is able to control a Balaur, a giant winged snake, which has the ability to enhance their already supernatural powers. One legend states that these wizards travel from village to village, usually dressed as beggars, and ask for food or shelter. Denying their request will bring bad weather over the village, but they also offer rewards to those who help.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/one-good-turn-deserves-another"}
