It was released in 1995 and is one of the more obscure Maxis products.\n\nThe game has two main modes.

Items include display boxes, graphing windows, random number generators, and mathematical tools ranging from addition and subtraction to Boolean logic gates and trigonometric functions. The arrangement of the items on screen doesn't matter, but the connections do: a numerical constant box could be connected to a mathematical function; connected to a graph, which would display a horizontal line; input as a color value on an RGB monitor; or even used to trigger a sound effect.\n\nI do not own anything in this video, it was reuploaded from archive.org: http://www.archive.org/details/012416", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m5iooep4Eg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m5iooep4Eg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1m5iooep4Eg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Widget Workshop Promo (1995)", "description": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:\n\nWidget Workshop: A Mad Scientist's Laboratory is a hands-on science kit, for use on the computer and off.
