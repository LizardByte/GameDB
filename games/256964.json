It also added the Tough Break Campaign, a three-month contract campaign which allows players to complete 26 skill-based challenges to unlock one-of-a-kind weapons and exclusive weapon and cosmetic cases. To participate in the Tough Break Campaign, players had to obtain the Tough Break Campaign Pass, which was available for purchase in the Mann Co. Store. Players were invited to fulfill contracts ostensibly handed out by Miss Pauling via postcards on her state-mandated vacation.\n\nAdditional content was further added in the December 22, 2015 Patch, such as the Festivizer.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/team-fortress-2-the-tough-break-update"}
