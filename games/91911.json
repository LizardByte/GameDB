Each turn you must flood some of Atlantis, and then drop a meteor somewhere nearby. Both affect how the population moves - mostly in fear! But you are still trying to save them, not kill them!\n\nForce the Atlanteans to run to one of the few safe spots on the island; either the highest ground possible, or onto a raft or boat. See just how bad you feel when you see them swimming in the ocean.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aah-little-atlantis"}
