I never had the pleasure of playing this one back in 1996 but I sure wish I did after playing this game for a little while.\n\nThe vibes I got from it whilst playing for the 40 odd minutes for the video above was it kinda reminded me of a certain Super Nintendo game, Earthbound, rather than an mmo and set in ancient China/Korea/Japan time. The controls are a little awkward to get used to with the fighting, which gets annoying after a while. The chasing one monster to kill cos it keeps moving and you keep missing gets old pretty quick.\n\nGraphically the game has aged extremely well, considering it was released just 1 year after 'Meridian 59' and that game ain't looking so great these days. It's colour scheme for graphics, building, monsters, trees, etc.. screams Earthbound to me, which is great.\n\nThe music was nice, it stands out for the theme of the game and the tracks that play in some areas are very nice and melodic.\n\nIf you want try the game out yourself you can play this game here: http://www.nexustk.com/index.html\n\nDon't forget to Like, Comment, and Subscribe to my Channel !!\n\nThanks.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7l5qgPzmCs0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7l5qgPzmCs0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7l5qgPzmCs0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7l5qgPzmCs0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7l5qgPzmCs0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Nexus - The Kingdom of the Winds (Gameplay, mmo, 1996)", "description": "Nexus - The Kingdom of the Winds, alternatively known as Nexus TK, or just Nexus is still a great looking mmo, even after all these years.
