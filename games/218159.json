It used to create strange, magical items. But one day it collected all the items it had created and sealed itself.\n\nSince then the tower has been deep asleep in the fairy village. Legend says that it is the remains of aliens who came to the earth from the outer space. Also, the villagers worship it as crops and plants grow big around the tower.\n\nBut then something unusual happened. The magical items were blown off with the power of the tower as the sealed door at the steeple suddenly opened. Therefore, the magical items were scattered all over the human world again.\n\nThe scattered items have very strong magic powers that might destroy the world order if someone uses them without proper care. You must collect the items and store them in the tower to seal them until the proper time comes. To achieve this, you must first retrieve the power of the tower.\n\nThere are four gates in the tower that are for the Water, Earth, Light, and Wind Spirits, respectively. The tower works only through the union of the power of all four spirits.\n\nRetrieve the missing devices of Fairy Tower to save the world!", "summary": "Fairy Tower is a digital pinball game made by Japanese developer LittleWing and published in 2007.
