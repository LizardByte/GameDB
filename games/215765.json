They are all just as strong as the enemies, and nothing more, so using them may be a bit more difficult than the usual FE unit fare. The gameplay and setup of the hack were very inspired by my experiences with fe1/11.\n\nThe challenge, then, is making your way through all 21 chapters successfully while getting invested in this group of nobodies trying to make their way through a cruel and harsh world of bloodshed and war. I hope you enjoy!", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/iron-emblem"}
