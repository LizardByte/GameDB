The game uses a party of 3 characters.\n\nThe dungeon crawling uses grid-based movement and a first-person perspective for exploration but switches to third-person for interactions with NPCs, points of interest or combat encounters.\nEnemies are visible and don't appear to roam in the current gameplay. Encounters also doesn't appear to add extra enemies when combat begins.\nCombat is turn-based and characters have a stamina meter, it can get dangerous if not managed as even blocking requires a set amount. The enemy's actions are indicated above them to help the player decide on their actions each turn.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/potato-flowers-in-full-bloom", "videos": [{"id": 41194, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "W9PZPTVEXH8"}, {"id": 41195, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "bhMGaCJuC2c"}, {"id": 41196, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "e4dV-krX_qU"}, {"id": 50327, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kdtF6WRHxDg"}]}
