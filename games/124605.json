On his journey home, he fights Tampo's brain. Upon arrival at his house, he gets a bowl of chicken soup with a dumpling. 1-Up informs Stinkoman that Pan Pan has been kidnapped, and Stinkoman chokes on a chicken bone. He is determined to challenge the chicken whose bone he choked on. After beating the chicken, Brody, he goes outside and encounters a short wall. He jumps into space to get over the wall, which turns out to be another robot, Stlunko. After beating the robot, Stinkoman takes its stone fist and uses it as his powerup. 1-Up goes out to rescue Pan Pan, and takes Stinkoman's Power Crunch (a cassette tape) through the Lava Zone. To save his favorite Power Crunch, Stinkoman must protect 1-Up from above. His powerup fist breaks while he fights a lava snake named Saargtsson, to Stinkoman's dismay.\n\n1-Up still wants to save Pan Pan, and Stinkoman isn't willing to help, so 1-Up goes to the moon on his own, where he gets kidnapped by a shadowy figure\u2014 the same one that kidnapped Pan Pan. Meanwhile, Stinkoman takes a vacation to the Pink Cloud Zone for recreational challenges. The shadowy figure presses a red button to teleport Stinkoman to an icy place, then inside a wall. He blasts a section out of the wall and escapes to the Negative Zone, a glitchy level. There, he finds out that 1-Up and Pan Pan are at level 10, where the red button is. This leads Stinkoman to believe that they red buttoned him, so he goes to level 10 to get revenge. An evil jungle separates him from level 10 (an evil fortress), so he uses his ship, the Stinkowing, to fly through. The shadowy figure tries to stop him by sending a fleet of robotic sea creatures. Eventually, Stinkoman finally makes it to the evil fortress.", "summary": "\"Blue hair, anyone? Stinkoman's always got fightings and challenges to keep him busy.

This game is based on the classic Capcom Mega Man series. It also parodies the poor Japanese to English translations common to video games of that era, similar to those that appear on the current Games Menu. The game is currently unfinished, but on January 6, 2018, @StrongBadActual announced that its final level is scheduled to release in 2018. A further announcement coming on December 28, 2018 stated that the release will be in 2019, and another pushed it back to 2020, concluding after a 15-year hiatus.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/stinkoman-20x6", "videos": [{"id": 33217, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "qz26_WtRzAk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz26_WtRzAk", "title": "Stinkoman 20X6: Level 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qz26_WtRzAk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
