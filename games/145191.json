Almost all the GameCube's real-time cut scenes were converted into movie files in order to maintain a better quality. Furthermore, voices and sound effects quality outside the cut-scenes had been reduced due to disc space being quickly used and audio RAM constraints. Capcom added new content made specifically for this port to compensate for the late release, such as minigames, documentaries and costumes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-4--2", "videos": [{"id": 47213, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "tSbf7PfpV6I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSbf7PfpV6I", "title": "Resident Evil 4 Professional Mode Gameplay PS2 1080p", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tSbf7PfpV6I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
