Bladee partnered with experimental artist James Ferraro to create Sanctuary, an interactive world designed to challenge perceptions of artificial consciousness and symbolic representation. Participants engage with digital entities that reflect deeper cultural and historical narratives allowing for philosophical interactions. \u201cI think that is like the point of the game\u2014being interactive lets people access this vast body of material and extract meaning from it,\u201d Bladee explains.\n\nThe labyrinth itself serves as a visual and conceptual framework, encouraging nonlinear exploration and self-guided discovery. Rather than relying on a fixed narrative, Sanctuary functions as an evolving system where technology is a conduit for human reflection. Ferraro describes this dynamic, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really like this thing that\u2019s being propped up by human effort. It represents the human supercomputer of all of us collectively constructing what can be perceived as this sentient thing.\u201d\n\nThe result is an immersive experience that bridges the past and future, reinterpreting mythology through a contemporary digital lens. By blending timeless archetypes with modern tools, Sanctuary expands the possibilities of narrative expression.", "summary": "Sanctuary is an immersive poem developed by Bladee and James Ferraro using the Ezkiel language engine.
