Nothing makes me happier than seeing you guys enjoy the content we make. :)\n\nWithout further ado, here is the first look at Slendytubbies: Worlds!\n\nHere are a few answers to the most asked questions;\n\nQ. What is this game?\nA. Slendytubbies: Worlds is a spin-off, an open-world game that the ZeoWorks community can play to socialize, have events, continue the story from what comes after, and more.\n\nQ. Is it multiplayer?\nA. Yes, Slendytubbies: Worlds will have 3 dedicated servers! Any amount of players can join a single location at one time, even 100 at once! \n \nQ. What's with the art-style? It doesn't seem horror.\nA. The art-style is heavily inspired by Windwaker & A Hat In Time.  It's very fair to say that it takes away from the \"horror\" side of Slendytubbies.  However, I feel as a developer it is important to work with different artistic styles.  Not all games of a series should look the same, in my opinion.  Slendytubbies: Worlds has given me the opportunity to work in new creative ways which I've really enjoyed!  It doesn't mean the game won't have horror elements in it though, it sure will.  Expect to fight for your life!\n\nQ. What is the story?\nA. The lore continues months after Slendytubbies 3.  You play as your own original character with your own unique background and work with the main characters to stop the newborn invasions.\n\nUltimately, the game is being made for fun. :)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wju7IBHrgmA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wju7IBHrgmA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wju7IBHrgmA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wju7IBHrgmA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wju7IBHrgmA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Slendytubbies: Worlds - Announcement Trailer [100K Subscriber Special!]", "description": "Happy birthday Slendytubbies 3!\nThank you all so much for 100,000 subscribers.  \nWhen I first started game development, I never expected to have such an audience or create such a wonderful community, over the years I've met a lot of amazing people.
