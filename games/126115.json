Experiment with Unit Alchemy and turn villagers into one-of-a-kind fighters like Samurai Cannoneers, Bandits, Geisha, and scores of other mythical warriors. Defend your people against the hordes of barbarians, evil magicians, and deadly ninjas. \nThe package includes the original Battle Realms and its Winter of the Wolf expansion that focuses on the Wolf clan and serves as a prequel to the original campaign. \nSeize tactical advantages in a living world teeming with life - birds fly when startled, wolves attack troops, and higher ground offers increased power to ranged attacks. \nCommand the power of Zen - your Zen Masters wield fantastic powers in the heat of battle.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-realms-plus-winter-of-the-wolf", "videos": [{"id": 41215, "name": "Relaunch Trailer", "video_id": "Syg6KlLfDO4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syg6KlLfDO4", "title": "Battle Realms Relaunch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Syg6KlLfDO4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
