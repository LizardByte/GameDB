Witches celebrate Samhain, a Celtic festival from the old religion, conjuring the dead and communing with the spirits. Nigel Danvers, ghost-hunter, knows all about the ghosts that dwell in the darkness, he has seen plenty to convince him there are dark forces at work. So, why is Halloween so different? Dusting down his old ghost-hunting gadgets, Nigel gets to work. Something is haunting the guest rooms above the local harbour side pub, The Bear. Who or what hides in the shadowy corners of the old Inn? What is the presence at the end of the Harbour Wall? Nigel has one night to find out, before the veil returns to full strength, and the Halloween Horror is gone, for another year.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-crown-midnight-horror", "videos": [{"id": 90349, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "cd625F2YjXE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd625F2YjXE", "title": "The Last Crown: Midnight Horror Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cd625F2YjXE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
