You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/moonsweeper", "videos": [{"id": 10972, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "cyIabMzGNpo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyIabMzGNpo", "title": "Moonsweeper for the Atari 2600", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cyIabMzGNpo/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 110110, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "62yRQFj0kas", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62yRQFj0kas", "title": "Moonsweeper Review ColecoVision", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/62yRQFj0kas/sddefault.jpg"}]}
