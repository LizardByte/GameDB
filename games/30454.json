Well, there was a pair of heavily armed hijackers, and a suicide bomber that managed to get get past airport security. Strangely enough, the hijackers and the suicide bomber had conflicting interests, spending roughly an hour arguing where they were going to crash the plane.\n\nNeedless to say, the plane was destroyed after they finished arguing, I'm pretty sure everyone that was unfortunate enough to have been a passenger of that flight is gone as well.\n\nI don't know how many days have passed that incident and I don't particularly care.
