The town\u2019s people have asked you to battle the AstaroK and his evil friends in their hideout - an old castle on the edge of town.\n\nYou need to fight your way in the dark castle of the evil AstaroK, by casting runes that will release different powers depending on the combinations cast. You start with a limited arsenal of skills but will be able to acquire more advanced skills with the SP (Skill Points) that you gain by winning battles in the dark castle. You may also win gold too if you are lucky! When you win a battle, you can continue further into the dungeon or head back to town to buy more supplies with your winnings.\n\nBe careful, if you are defeated in a battle you will be warp back to town but with half of the SP that you gained during the game. You will also forfeit a helmet or potion as punishment.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-curse-of-astarok"}
