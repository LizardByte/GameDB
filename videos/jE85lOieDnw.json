It was released to show the power of the Gamecube to developers and was included in an early version of the Dolphin SDK. Its a neat demo and it shows off some cool effects like the bump and shadow, local lighting and Anti-Aliasing!\n\nAt 5:36 you can see an unreleased pink Gamecube.\nThis was running on the Wii  and all the music you hear is from the demo.\n\nMore info:\nThe tech demo has 2 modes, normal and auto. For this video I showcased the manual mode and this is where you can control the arrow. In auto mode the demo plays like a video, going threw the different rooms. You can also access the debug settings and change the how the GameCube renders the game and more! \n\nThanks for watching;D\n\nIf you wondering what that blue and red bar does, it shows you the CPU and RAM the Cube/Wii is using.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jE85lOieDnw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jE85lOieDnw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jE85lOieDnw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "princess peachs's castle (gamecube tech demo!)- normal mode", "description": "Hey!
