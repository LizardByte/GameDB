You must visit nine locations and shoot all the bad guys that appear on the screen in various places, by controlling a cross-hair and shooting them. Civilian's also appear and these cannot be shot or you lose points at the end of each location. To complete a location you must stay alive while a timer counts down, and when it reaches zero then you move to the next location. As you shoot, the bad guys will shoot back after a short time and if you are hit then you lose one of four lives and the location starts again."}
