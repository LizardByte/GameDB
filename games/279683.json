Exodus is a big and bold sci-fi RPG that deals with time dilation, the idea that time passes more slowly than we're used to during high-velocity travel, causing interstellar explorers to outlive their friends and family back home.\n\nIn Exodus, humanity has been forced to abandon Earth and establish a new civilization in a hostile galaxy. Players are the Traveler, a person tasked with exploring far-off solar systems for advanced alien technology. What the Traveler counts in days, the rest of humanity experiences in decades. With this conceit, players' choices will cause butterfly effects to ripple across humanity's new planet, particularly in the lives of their own loved ones, and the Traveler will watch these play out over generations.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/exodus--6", "videos": [{"id": 103148, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "jsCvugLI61I", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsCvugLI61I", "title": "EXODUS Cinematic Reveal Trailer (#TheGameAwards 2023)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jsCvugLI61I/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
