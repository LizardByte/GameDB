I made a basic version on the computer, created a few levels and then forgot about it. This year however, I decided to turn it into a proper app that people can download and play. After many hours of work (and sleepless nights) I am finally happy to announce that the game is ready! \n \nBlox is a simple puzzle game where you need to slide blocks around to make them all green. As you play the game, you will uncover new block types that make the levels more challenging. There are 80 puzzles to solve and some of them are quite tricky. \n \nYou can download the game through Google Play and play it on any Android device. I really hope that you enjoy playing this. If you like the game then please spread the word and share it with your friends. Finally, I would like to thank all my friends and family who helped and supported me in this journey. \n \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xyz.iaptest", "summary": "Fun puzzle game for the whole family. Move the blocks around to make them all green. Now, can you do it in the least number of moves? \n \nChallenge yourself with 80 original levels in 4 unique level packs. As you progress through the game, levels become incrementally harder and new block types are revealed. Simple to play, but tricky to master.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-blox", "videos": [{"id": 24058, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "psR-MuFjQXo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psR-MuFjQXo", "title": "Super Blox game preview", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/psR-MuFjQXo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
