You land on the building`s 80th floor setback, finding nobody there to greet you. When you enter the building, the main door snaps shut behind you, and you narrowly escape being killed by the building`s security system.\n\nYou find the receptionist hiding behind her desk. She tells you that Genoq`s head scientist, Derrida, has been demanding the package you`re carrying. His last panicked message came over an hour ago. This package is more important than you could have thought.\nYou realize that there is only one course of action, that you `must` bring the package to Derrida, and, if at all possible, rescue any survivors you find along the way.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/d-slash-generation--1"}
