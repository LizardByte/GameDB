Though complete strangers who are each motivated by a different sense of purpose, the three have been drawn to the capital by a common goal - to begin the examination process that will test their eligibility to become masters of one of the many magical towers dotted across the land, which serve to protect humanity from the threat of the Iblis, a violent race of magical monsters.\n\nUnfortunately, the examination rules stipulate that only a three person team can participate. And faced with stiff competition from other teams who have come to the capital with the same goal, the three young women quickly find themselves bound together by necessity. Yet little by little, this necessity gives way to trust, and eventually even friendship. And soon, the trio must call on all that they possess to overcome not only mounting deadlines, but a lurking shadow that creeps ever more swiftly across the lands...", "summary": "Tricolore Crise (which is read as the English word \"crisis\") is a Japan-only Dreamcast RPG developed by HuneX, a prolific developer of visual novels as well as the Blue Breaker series.\n\nBoasting an ATB-influenced battle system and a slew of mostly optional story events loosely set to a calendar, this open-ended fantasy tale in the vein of the early Atelier games tasks the player with guiding a newly formed team of three young women through the examination process that will test whether they are worthy to become masters of one of many magical towers that protect human civilisation from the threat of the Iblis, a savage, menacing, and mysterious race of magical monsters.\n\nThe player may only control one of the three protagonists at any given time, but may switch freely between them, with certain events only being accessible to certain characters. The three may also each be accompanied in their quest by up to two Mitsukai, or \"Angels\". These guardian spirits can be freely altered and developed by the player, giving the game elements of a monster raising sim.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tricolore-crise"}
