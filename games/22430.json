Each character possesses a unique personality and special abilities - use them to claim victory as you spin from one challenging arena to the next, battling for dominance in this action-packed fighting game.\n\nBlade Ballet is simple enough for anyone to pick up a controller and jump into the fray, but players must master the timing and unique abilities of each bot to come out on top. This makes the game easily accessible to new players, while allowing for a high skill ceiling to truly compete with your friends. Much of the Blade Ballet gameplay revolves around the innovative \u201cblade spin\u201d mechanic \u2013 players control their rotation to sneak past their opponents\u2019 defenses and secure the kill. Each arena also introduces new game mechanics that players must incorporate into their strategies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blade-ballet", "videos": [{"id": 9342, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "NaO0T-pruyU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaO0T-pruyU", "title": "Blade Ballet - Reveal Trailer | PS4", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NaO0T-pruyU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
