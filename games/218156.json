But something went wrong, and the ship had to make an emergency landing on Earth.\n\nThe alien crew tried to repair the ship, but the parts they needed could not be made. The aliens were marooned! Their only choice was to make Earth their new home.\n\nThe aliens knew they would look like monsters to the people of Earth. To avoid frightening them, the aliens learned to change their appearance and blend in with human society.\n\nOccasionally someone saw one of the aliens without a disguise and tried to tell other people about them. No one believed these stories, however; they are now found only in legends (and supermarket tabloids).\n\nNow the aliens' time has come. The evolution of Earth's technology has made it possible to repair their ship and return to their planet.\n\nBut the repairs are expensive! Other aliens might use mind-control to get what they need, but our aliens are too fond of the people of Earth. They have decided to form a traveling carnival called MONSTER FAIR. They will barnstorm their way around the world, raise BIG MONEY, and prepare their ship for the trip home.\n\nYou are a guide of MONSTER FAIR. Your job is to help your guests have fun and spend money so the dream will come true.", "summary": "Monster Fair is a digital pinball game created by Japanese developer LittleWing in 2004.
