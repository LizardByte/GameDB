The school wants you to win the national dance championship. The girls are not used to disciplined practices, and the student club president is against you. The biggest problem, however, is that you enter the championship as pairs, and the girl you want to dance with would most certainly prefer pairing up with another girl than dancing with you. However, protecting the club is your job, so swallow your pride and dance on.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/love-tore-mint"}
