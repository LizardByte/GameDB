She has never been out of the castle, just a pure little girl. She has never talked to boys and fallen in love. The Devil blood has been taken over from generations to generations, but she doesn't have enough power to take over the position. The current Devil gets weaker, and it's time to transfer the position to the successor. One day, the news comes out that someone, who lives in the human world, is nominated for the next Devil. Soon after the news comes out, a terrorist group attacks the castle, and Ashe runs out of the castle with Kyle. They run away into the forest, and accidentally fall into the hole to the human world and lose their magic power. They roam around the human world, and bump into twin brothers Leni and Seizh, who are the nominees for the Devil. Ashe asks them to come to the Devil world as soon as possible, but they are not interested in the position. Also, the people in the human world start the Devil hunting, and they lose their way back to the Devil world. Ashe and Kyle start to live at the twins house, but they seem to have a secret...? What will await them in the end..., a pure love story or...?", "summary": "An adult visual novel otome game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/under-the-moon", "videos": [{"id": 68924, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "_IgyPTsmMfo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IgyPTsmMfo", "title": "Under the Moon OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_IgyPTsmMfo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
