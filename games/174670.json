The goal of the game is to move all your tiles to the opposite side of the game board while your computer opponent or your friend awaiting his/her turn does the same with their tiles. You can use your tiles to surround and entrap the opponents tiles forcing them to restart at the beginning with that tile and naturally they can do the same to you.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aggression"}
