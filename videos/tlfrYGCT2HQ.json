In 1964, newspapers published pictures of frescoes of the Serbian monastery Visoki Decani. These photographs became a sensation. One of the frescoes depicted objects similar to spaceships. The first human space flight was made recently, but these images are dated to the 14th century! However, scientists were sceptical of this. In their opinion these are allegorical images of the sun and the moon. \n\nBut the scientists were wrong, it was spaceships, and now we see some similar ones again. Kira and Rika has been sent to Earth to clean up five cities for criminals, as part of their sentence, before they can be allowed to come home again. \n\nThe blonde girl is Kira and the red haired is Rika. Both girls can punch high, kick low, and make a roundhouse kick if attacked from behind. With every punch you accumulate energy, which you can see on the Super Strike bar in the middle of the screen. When this is flashing you have charged max and can throw a fireball. You then have to get some distance between you and the enemies, and to activate it simply hold down fire button for a few seconds.\n\nRika is more powerfull having a brutal flying kick and she can do normal jumping. Kira can not do this but she is faster in fights and can do some very fast back handspring flick flacks. \n\nIt is different which of the girls that are best to fight the different enemies. You will learn that while playing, and you can switch between them anytime you like by pressing one of the fire buttons.\n\nThe five cities all have their different types of enemies. E.g. in Bronx you are attacked by punks on skateboards and in Ustyuzhna you have to watch out for big Russian bears. During the quest you will encounter criminals with several different weapons like; whips, guns, baseball bats, knifes, barrels etc.\n\nThere are 3 items to collect:\n\n- Bottle: Refills some of your energy bar\n- Battery: Charges your Super Strike bar to max\n- X50 (Extra Points)\n\nMost of the time you are walking from left to right, but later on you will also have to climb ladders and interact with some items.\n\nWhen you are done in a city you take your spaceship and fly to the next. This is kind of a chill down and relax part, because there is no energy bar for your spaceship, so nothing can go wrong in these four levels.\n\nYou can't manouvre as much around as in the Renegade series, Double Dragon, Golden Axe and Shadow Warriors that are 2.5D games, Angels are more related to 2D games like Kung-Fu Master and Fighting Warrior, but it is still a pretty good and very tactical game. You have to figure out when to switch between Kira and Rika, depending on the enemies, but also depending on how much energy each has left. When one of them has little energy left, switch to the other, and switch back when you find a bottle. Also at some points on the later levels you have to play with the correct character to be able to proceed.\n\nIt is pretty simple to pull off the moves, but the tactics has to be right to be able to complete this game. Be sure to put some variation in your attacks, else the enemies will learn your pattern and avoid being hit.\n\nFor a full color game it runs at a pretty high speed, and there is a lot of nice animations. The background looks fantastic with highly detailed graphics, driving cars, flashing lights, and lots of other great details.\n\nAnother important feature, most new games are missing, which also is pulling up the final rating, is the 2 player mode. You can play co-op in this game with a friend! (but watch out because you can hit each other).\n\nIn 48K mode, you get full gameplay with one additional loading after the third level. In 128K mode, the game uses many additional features: additional types of enemies, a variety of punches, cutscenes, effects, in-game AY music, advanced intro and final cut and more.\n\nStory, graphics and code by ZOSYA entertainment in 2021.\n\nMusic:\nIntro: Original score by Galaxy Map.
