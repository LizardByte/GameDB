It is similar to Sega Rally Championship in design, but uses touring cars instead of rally cars. Unlike Sega Rally Championship, Sega Touring Car Championship has never seen a sequel, and it considered a far less successful game for a variety of reasons, most notably the steep difficulty curve and often awkward car handing.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-touring-car-championship"}
