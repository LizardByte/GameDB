Lana has just regained consciousness in the midst of all the mayhem. The world she once identified with seems to have been torn to Hell, and most of the people she knew have now become part of a wild horde. Lana feels the virus beginning to infect her and knows she must run as far as possible to escape the nightmare. But then there is Amy, a seemingly defenseless eight-year-old autistic girl who has curious powers. Together, they must fight or run from the infected humans, demons and the military, in the hope of not only saving each other, but also the future of humanity.", "summary": "From the original creator of Flashback, Amy is an innovative survival horror title. The cooperative gameplay featured in Amy is a deep and unique system that requires players to strategize in order to protect Amy and keep both characters alive. Unlike other games with a secondary character, Amy is neither a super warrior, nor a docile character that follows along. Players must use Amy's size and special abilities to their advantage by keeping her close in order to ward off the virus, and having her complete tasks that Lana can't. For both to survive, Lana must stop at nothing to keep Amy safe.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/amy", "videos": [{"id": 1836, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8-so0EZupSw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-so0EZupSw", "title": "Amy - Official Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8-so0EZupSw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
