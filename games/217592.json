The Olympic Peninsula became the staging ground for promising new technologies, but these utopian creations came at great cost: severe radiation, environmental collapse, and supernatural horrors. The government walled off the area and established the Olympic Exclusion Zone. What happened inside was never disclosed.\n\nRumors and stories about the Zone run rampant, compelling you to go and explore its perimeter. Your plans go awry and you\u2019re now stuck inside \u2013 you don\u2019t know it yet, but the only way out is through. You find a barely running station wagon deep in the woods, miraculously unlocked and able to make the trip down the hill into the valley. Here you come across an abandoned auto shop which becomes your base of operations, where you safely repair and improve your car between runs. Do your best to survive, solve mysteries, and search for a way out \u2014 or become part of the ongoing legends of the Zone.", "summary": "Pacific Drive is a run-based, first-person driving survival game.
