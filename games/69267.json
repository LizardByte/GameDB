Renamed Phantasy Star Complete Collection, this version includes the Phantasy Star II Text Adventures series, released exclusively to the Sega Meganet network, with the first of the eight games (the one following the adventures of Rolf) available to be played without unlocking. It also includes the two Game Gear titles of the series, Phantasy Star Gaiden and Phantasy Star Adventure. Unlike the GBA version, it includes all four titles of the original series. While, unlike the Sega Ages titles Phantasy Star Generation 1 and Phantasy Star Generation 2, the games are mainly untouched, several options that are not available in the Sega Saturn version are included. These options can drastically alter the games, both visually (with graphical options ranging from changing resolution, interlacing, smoothness and scanlines) and in gameplay. The changes in gameplay can alter the speed of the characters (much like the option available for Phantasy Star II and Phantasy Star III in the Saturn version, but available to all games) and also the difficulty, by changing how much money and experience the player gets from fights, which can drastically reduce the time necessary to complete the games. There are also options to change the type of machine and localization of the games, making it possible to play them in their Japanese version as well as their English localized counterparts. This compilation was released on PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in 2012.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "videos": [{"id": 39547, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "u_qdAiLGMxI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_qdAiLGMxI", "title": "Sega Ages 2500 Vol. #32 - Phantasy Star Collection - PS2 & JP Psn", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u_qdAiLGMxI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39548, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "ARuAXMH1ZrU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARuAXMH1ZrU", "title": "SEGA AGES 2500 Vol.32: Phantasy Star Complete Collection All Phantasy Star Intros 1-4 (JPN) | PS2 |", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ARuAXMH1ZrU/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
