It had Mario's face in it, which could be squeezed in various ways, similar to the title screen of Super Mario 64, although the touch screen was used instead. Some ideas for moving Mario's face around have been removed from the real game. A Wario face was also available. It was reworked into the title screen of Super Mario 64 DS, albeit quite differently. The top screen uses graphics similar to Super Mario Bros. in Super Mario All-Stars.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marios-face"}
