For example - play at night(real night) and wait for Wild Moon appear. Or place Grass sticker somewhere on the game screen to Wild Sheep appear. After that type of elements appear you need to tame them by combining them with Stickerizer. This will create normal sticker and of course increase you discovered elements number. But not all Wild elements are so easy to find.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sticker-craft"}
