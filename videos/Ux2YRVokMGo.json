The project originated as a small demo made during a game jam at a division of Sony San Diego, and was gradually expanded upon. The game was planned to be free to play with optional microtransactions, and would have featured three game modes as well as six classes of gnome.  The game's main mode would have been a standard death match mode that pitted teams of good and evil gnomes against each other. The game was ultimately cancelled due to the studio as a whole not bringing in enough revenue, which was partly due to Sony San Diego's MOBA game Kill Strain under performing.\n\nLiam Robertson is a video game researcher and archiver.
