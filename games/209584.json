Build It! Play It! is a 3D variation of The Incredible Machine. You solve puzzles by arranging an assortment of levers, belts, motors and other items to achieve a goal. The game comes with timed levels and a sandbox mode. You can fully rotate the camera to observe your constructions and there are 8 settings for more than 50 game levels, along with a few tutorials.\n\nThe goal is to move a fuzzy monster to a designated spot in the level, using items such as flashlights, basketballs, trampolines and fans. The game depends on gravity as the primary key to all puzzles. The solutions require a pre-selected array of pieces to be arranged in certain ways. The game comes with a \"Builder\", a construction set where you can design your own levels with over 65 parts in the toybox. These can be exported and shared online.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gadgets-design-it-build-it-play-it", "videos": [{"id": 141043, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "X_yKZ3QBYP4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_yKZ3QBYP4", "title": "Gadgets: Design It!
