Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.\n\nThe final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.", "summary": "Beverly Hills Cop is a video game developed by Tynesoft and published in 1990. The story is loosely based on the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop. The player controls Axel Foley in four distinct sub-games: a side-scrolling action game, a driving game, an overhead view shooter, and a first person shooter. The game was released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS.
