He notices small puddles of black goop on the path and follows them, eventually stopping at a mass of black graffiti shaped like Shadow Mario's logo from Super Mario Sunshine. The graffiti expands to create a portal that Mario falls through, transporting him to Lake Lapcat, where a rainstorm is occurring.\n\nShortly after Mario lands, he encounters Bowser, who has become a larger and more powerful form known as Fury Bowser. Mario finds a Cat Shine in the surrounding area, which clears the goop off of a nearby lighthouse. Fury Bowser is blinded by the beam of light that shines from the lighthouse, and retreats into the Fury Sun in the middle of Lake Lapcat. Immediately afterward, several islands emerge from the water.\nAfter Fury Bowser retreats, the storm clears and Mario finds a panicking Bowser Jr., who explains why Bowser transformed. He shows Mario a picture he painted of his father and paints it black with his Magic Paintbrush, showing that Bowser Jr. was the one who corrupted Bowser. He realizes that both he and his father are in trouble, reluctantly asking Mario to help him, but clarifying this would not happen under normal circumstances. Mario agrees to do so, with Bowser Jr. joining him for the rest of the adventure.", "summary": "Team up with Bowser Jr. in a free-roaming 3D adventure to stop his dad\u2019s rampage.
