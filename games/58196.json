The player is presented with a vertical playfield that consists of pins and other kinds of obstacles. The player drops coins from the top of the screen by tapping the screen. These will then bounce around until they reach one of five buckets at the bottom. Each level has a number of bad pennies and to move on to the next, the player has to hit all of them. The game is played with the touchscreen and the player simply taps where he wants the coins to drop. Up to five coins can be dropped at once. By hitting all buckets the player gets a coin frenzy. This means that five bonus coins automatically gets dropped. Each level has a number of pins that the player gets points for hitting. They then change color and when all pins have changed colour, the points awarded goes up. Some levels have girl coins that have to be rescued. This is often done by destroying Breakout-like bricks so that the coins can fall down to the bottom.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/coin-drop"}
