Described by testers as unforgiving, brutal, and thematically on-point, the game has gone through extensive balancing to get it to a stage where it is no longer unfair, but FUNfair.\n\nThe game is purposefully light on story, basing itself around a battle between a lone ninja and an Evil Ninja Clan helmed by a diaper-wearing Sumo. Expect to suffer not just due to the game's difficulty, but due to seeing the boss in a giant diaper.\nThe story effectively boils down to - See Ninja, Fight Ninja, Be Ninja.\n\nFlash of the Blade contains 11 fast-paced, ferocious levels, 5 deadly weapons, and 6 grueling enemy types.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/flash-of-the-blade-x", "videos": [{"id": 119062, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KIcpXKZaKxc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcpXKZaKxc", "title": "FLASH OF THE BLADE X - Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KIcpXKZaKxc/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
