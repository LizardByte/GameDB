The experiment is led by a rather calm yet eccentric doctor named Voldritch who will help you through the experiment and ease your mind leaving you, well, mindless.", "summary": "This game is not really intended for first time recreational hypnosis, LavLabs has an introduction to hypnosis and Mezmaglitter's new age route is better suited.\n\nThis is a sci fi visual novel intended to hypnotize you with suggestions/triggers and a bonus QnA at the end. For those not familiar with hypnosis, the game is suppose to relax you and make you calmer (think of it similar to a guided meditation app but with a science-y theme). I didn't make it with the intention for people new to hypnosis at all. Please research hypnosis before doing it, especially recreational hypnosis.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/doctor-voldritchs-experiment"}
