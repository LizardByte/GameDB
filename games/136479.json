Go South into Portbury docks and take in the magnificent Clifton Suspension Bridge or take a heavy freight load past Filton Airport, where Concorde G-BOAF resides opposite the magnificent Brabazon hangars.\n\nDo you feel like taking a trip back to the past? Drive to the Bristol Harbour Railway where you can travel up and down the dockside railway and see Brunel's famous SS Great Britain and the M Shed Museum which occupies the former Bristol Industrial Museum building.\n\nOr maybe you'd prefer a trip into the future? Portishead railway station is subject to a great deal of debate at the moment with ongoing campaigns to re-open the line and its stations at Pill and Portishead to ease traffic on the A369. The line has been included, with the station at Pill bought back to life and the lines laid and station buildings placed at Portishead station.\n\nIf you want to do some good old fashioned shunting, there's plenty of scope for that too, with the docks at Avonmouth and Portbury, coaling yards at Avonmouth, and shunting yards at Stoke Gifford and east of Bristol Temple Meads.\n\nBristol and Avonmouth includes a total of 21 stations and features 15 scenarios, ten using default stock, and five using stock from Just Trains, as well as four Free Roams.", "themes": [{"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012-bristol-to-avonmouth"}
