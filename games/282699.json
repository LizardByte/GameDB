After the project was declined by Konami it was converted into a stand-alone survival-horror title Broken Covenant.\nThe game was supposed to take place in the American Soutwest where Alessa's powers and corruption began to spread outside of Silent Hill. A splinter group of Silent Hill cult relocated its operations to an abandoned military base just outside Coyote Flats, Arizona continuing pursuing their main goal of conjuring Samael. Players would assume the role of Father Hector Santos, an El Paso, Texas priest in desperate search of his nine-year-old niece, Anna who has been handed over to the Cult as a conduit for demonic rituals as they believe she might be the next Alessa.\n\nBroken Covenant was supposed to be published in episodic format. After it failed to seek any interest from other publishers it was shelved for good.\n\n(Source: silenthillmemories)", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/broken-covenant", "videos": [{"id": 104975, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "N8wS2nUxYcY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8wS2nUxYcY", "title": "Silent Hill PS3 / Broken Covenant : The Lost Pitch (2006)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N8wS2nUxYcY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
