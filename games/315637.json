The aim of this hack isn't to troll or torture the player, but rather to provide an extremely difficult challenge in a fair and interesting way. Players will need to employ a wide range of Kaizo and Item Abuse skills. Shell, spring, and p-switch tricks are used alongside tight platforming and jump control. Beginners will likely be very frustrated, but seasoned players will hopefully find a fresh, fun challenge. There are however, a few Kaizo boxes (both marked and un-marked) and few tricks and traps along the way. The game also features optional coins to collect for \"100%\" runs, and some secret rooms and surprises to discover. There's even a checkpoint-save room so console players can rest without fear of losing any progress! Extensive play-testing has been done by myself and others to confirm that the entire game is indeed RTA-viable. I hope you enjoy it!\nEdit - Had to fix a few more potential music problems that would lead to crashes. Everything should be solid now.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-search-for-salmon"}
