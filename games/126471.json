If that\u2019s not enough, one day he wakes up only to find out that he spent all his money on a shabby tavern. Sure, he knows taverns. But running one? That\u2019s no role for a leading hero, right? That\u2019s a commoner\u2019s job! And to make things even worse, suddenly some teenager claims to be his daughter. Will Emyr be able to get his adventuring career back on track? Will he defeat his dreadful foe? And finally, can he answer the challenges of responsible parenthood? As they say, old habits die hard...", "summary": "In this game, you will be tasked with preparing various treats and delivering them to the customers. Grab items and combine ingredients in compounds.
