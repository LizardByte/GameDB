Join the Undisputed Heavyweight President of Style (he paid us to say that) as he punches deadly snakes, topples omnivorous monarchs, and reads grammatically-mangled emails, in five adventure-packed action-sodes he's positive will bring him fame, fortune, and babes. Or at least more fan mail.\r\n\r\nSBCG4AP is a new episodic game series starring Strong Bad and the rest of the crew from the Homestarrunner.com cartoons. The games are being developed by Telltale Games, the same company who has been tirelessly turning out Sam & Max episodes since 2006.\r\n\r\nWho is Strong Bad? What is Homestarrunner.com?\r\nHomestarrunner.com is a cartoon created by Mike and Matt Chapman in 1999, and Strong Bad is the series' most popular character. He's an awesome guy who enjoys answering emails from random fans, beating up his younger brother, and messing with people. It's kind of hard to explain. Just visit homestarrunner.com and see for yourself.\r\n\r\n(Oh, also Strong Bad was voted Sexiest Man Alive by Salon.com. Which is a little weird, since he's a cartoon character who goes around wearing a lucha libre mask and no shirt, but we try not to be judgmental.)\r\n\r\nWho is this game for?\r\nAttractive people.\r\n\r\nNo, really. What will the gameplay be like?\r\nThese are story games, with weird plots and tons of dialogue conceived through a mind-meld between the guys who make the Homestarrunner.com cartoons and the team who brought you Sam & Max Seasons One and Two. In each SBCG4AP episode, you take control of Strong Bad and interact with other characters in beloved locations such as Strong Bad's basement, Bub's Concession Stand, and The Stick. Besides talking to other characters and messing with their minds, you'll also get to dress up in funny costumes, check email on Strong Bad's trusty Lappy 486, and play arcade-style mini games such as the timeless Snake Boxer 5.\r\n\r\nAre you doing anything special for WiiWare?\r\nSBCG4AP was designed specifically for WiiWare, and we're cooking up some fun ways to use the controller. We'll also be taking advantage of Wii Connect24 with some special features that will tie the episodes together and let you communicate with friends.\r\n\r\neDome - http://www.edome.net", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MpxstzZrpw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MpxstzZrpw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MpxstzZrpw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People trailer PC/Wii", "description": "eDome - http://www.edome.net\r\n\r\nStrong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People trailer PC/Wii\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/uutiset/telltalelta-homestar-runner-peli-mutta-vain-viehattaville-ihmisille\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/bully-scholarship-edition\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/the-golden-compass\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/frontlines-fuel-of-war\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/close-combat-modern-tactics\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/mass-effect-bring-down-the-sky\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/sam-max-episode-204-chariots-of-the-dogs\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/nostradamus-the-last-prophecy\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/professor-layton-and-the-curious-village\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/sam-max-episode-203-night-of-the-raving-dead\r\n\r\nhttp://plaza.fi/edome/arvostelut/sam-max-season-2-jaksot-1-ja-2\r\n\r\nANNOUNCING STRONG BAD'S COOL GAME FOR ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nBrand new episodic game series for WiiWare and PC!\r\n\r\nAfter years of snarkily sulking in the shadow of internet megacelebrity Homestar Runner, Strong Bad the Awesome is finally ready for his video game close-up.
