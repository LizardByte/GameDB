So Mario had a thought of visiting Present Island To get the Golden Present. So Mario took the Mushroom Cruiser and headed over there.\n\nSomewhere in the Koopa Kingdom...\n\nBowser Jr.: Daddy daddy! Did you get me a present for my birhtday?\nBowser: It's your bir- I mean yes! I did! It's going to be a suprise.\nBowser Jr.: Yay!\n\nSo Bowser took his Koopa Clown Car and rushed to Present Island and just saw Mario getting a present.\n\nBowser: Arrrgh! What is Mario doing there?! I guess it's time to realease the Koopa Army on him.\n\nBowser laughs. Then he took out a radio and called the Koopa Army to raid Present Island to get the Golden Present. Mario just notices that is is unnormal seeing the Koopa army here.\n\nThis is where the game starts.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marios-super-present-adventure"}
