UV is designed to be somewhat challenging, but fair (think mid Valiant to mid Sunlust difficulty-wise). HMP should be very accessible to most players, while HNTR is a walk in the park for those who just want to enjoy a snowy landscape. Whichever difficulty you choose, expect to receive a buffed weapon roster that should help you to deal with the opposing monster forces.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sleepwalking"}
