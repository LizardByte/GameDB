At the start of the game, the players can choose how many players their team has (three or five) - and in both modes, they will have to insert another coin at the end of each period to continue. This was also the first Namco game to feature Greek text; on the continuing screen, one of the players on the losing team says \"ODCH\" (\u039f\u0394\u03a7) as the ten-second timer counts down for another coin.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/face-off"}
