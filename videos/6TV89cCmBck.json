This is where the backpack comes in; without the limitless inventory seen in other RPGs how will the player surpass the challenges that enemies and the environment present to them? The larger your backpack, the more prepared you can be. However, carrying too much encumbering equipment will leave you vulnerable in a surprise attack. Which pack you carry can be just as much a deciding factor as the weapon you bring into battle and your chosen fighting style.\n\nAdditionally, the player\u2019s map-reading skills will be put to the test. Exploring the corners of Aurai with nothing but a backpack provides a thrilling experience that can be described as the peak of adventuring! You decide if you want to travel light or not, but you will have to make sure you are able to adapt to your environment. Aurai has four distinct regions that you will need to navigate with the help of your trusty compass, your map, and your ability to locate landmarks. The game will not do that for you. Not to worry, though. With preparation, you will be able to overcome most challenges that OUTWARD will throw at you.\n\nOutward will be available on PS4, X1, and PC on March 26th, 2019!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6TV89cCmBck/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6TV89cCmBck/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6TV89cCmBck/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6TV89cCmBck/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6TV89cCmBck/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "OUTWARD - Dev Diary Wanderlust", "description": "OUTWARD is a hardcore RPG that tempers fantasy elements with realism. \n\nAs a player, you must survive against natural dangers like hunger, disease, and the elements as well as monsters and brigands.
