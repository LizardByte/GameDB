It gained critical acclaim due to its original concept of being one of the first snowmobile racing titles. The series currently consists of two games, both of which are named simply Sled Storm. \n \nThe game features snowmobiles (referred to as sleds), stunts and fourteen snow-covered courses consisting of slippery slopes, inclement weather and treacherous cliffs. Six racers were selectable from the outset and two more were unlockable, each of which had different snowmobile handling attributes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sled-storm--1", "videos": [{"id": 20996, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "36nPts_qji0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36nPts_qji0", "title": "Sled Storm (PS1) Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/36nPts_qji0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
