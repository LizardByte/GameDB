The story centers around four young men in the band Alida who attained phenomenal success with their first CD release. Loads of money coupled with wild imagination resulted in the band\u2019s construction of a guitar-shaped island theme park. Alida was abandoned when money woes and paranoia set in and the band split up. Now, several years later, the band\u2019s manager suggests a reunion on the island. Soon thereafter band member Arin leaves for the island and is not heard from again. His wife Julia sends you to Alida to find Arin and bring him home."}
