Robos that failed to create unique niches are overhauled (Ray Mk III, Sassy Stunners, Wild Soldiers, Trick Flyers, even Little Raiders) power differences exist in greater variety (and are given to the player in descriptions), stat divergence is increased between members of the same groups, weakening stat anomalies are fixed, and all robos have unique descriptions to tell you their strengths or about their robo class. See the readme, because nearly all robos have changed.\n\nOverall the robo selection process should feel more open in viable options, and choosing within a robo class a more nuanced decision.\n\nCertain weak guns (even Basic!) are made to be more usable, Gravity Gun and Burrow Bomb are fixed/nerfed, a new bomb is ready to be used, a new illegal robo and gun are present, and a few battles are now different.\n\nNO DIRT. Battles do not get robos dirty!\n\nNo more slow start! Nearly all legal parts are buyable within the first 3 shops, including robos. Special Ray models are available at markup but you can also wait to get them cheaper on Encephalon Isle (or through the police missions as normal with X-Ray).\n\nThe main character also has an overworld palette change mostly to let you know the mod worked.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
