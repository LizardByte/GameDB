The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \"graphics\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and the first game incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror.\n\n3D Monster Maze puts the player in a maze with one exit and a hostile monster, the Tyrannosaurus rex. There, the player must traverse the maze, from the first-person perspective, and escape through the exit without being eaten.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
