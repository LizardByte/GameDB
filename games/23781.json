In each room, the player uses items from the magic toolbox (such as a magic wand or magic paint brush) in order to restore and further customize various pieces of the room. Further, each room has a larger challenge for restoration that allows for a higher level of creativity. For example, in the grand foyer, the player must create a new mosaic for the floor by selecting a pattern, filling in the blocks to the right places, and filling in between the blocks.\n\nOnce a room has been completely restored, the player is able to use a magical magnifying glass to carefully search the room for 1 of the 6 missing gems. Once all 6 rooms have been restored and all 6 gems have been collected, Rapunzel must conquer the garden hedge maze and use the gems to rescue Prince Stefan.\n\nIn addition to the active play mode, there is a passive storybook mode. This game teaches early reading skills to young children.", "summary": "Barbie plays Rapunzel.
