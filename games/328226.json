While they are homing in on the player, not only do the planes fire down on the player, but they also release parachutes containing bombs that must be dealt with before they reach the surface. Once the player manages to kill the last airplane, the game proceeds to the next pattern. If the player loses all their lives, the game ends.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sky-chuter"}
