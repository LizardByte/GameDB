It is the second game based on the 1989 sci-fi movie GunHed, the first being Blazing Lazers for the TurboGrafx-16. Aratanaru Tatakai is closer to the movie: the players re-activate GUNHED mech units to defeat the supercomputer Kyron-5 and its enforcer Aerobot. Each player chooses where on 8JO, the island base of Kyron-5, to deploy their GUNHED models, and then fights opponents in real-time combat while collecting robot pieces along the way to build stronger robotic armies. The game culminates with a fight against the powerful Aerobot.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gunhed-aratanaru-tatakai"}
