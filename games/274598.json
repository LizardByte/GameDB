Doted upon by the spirits of her animistic ancestors, the fledgeling shamaness swirls and glissades through the immaculate landscape with unfettered carefreeness, her eyes bright as a sky after rain and her elfin form brimming with numinous potential.\n[h3]Mark of Shamaness:[/h3]\nYour skills and normal attacks apply a stacking Mark of Shamaness on enemies. Once the Mark has reached 8 stacks, your next normal attack will cause it to detonate, dealing damage.\nYou can absorb Mark of Shamaness from enemies by slaying them or holding down dodge, converting the Marks into Shamanic Mana. Once your Shamanic Mana is full, you gain the ability to transform into the Whisper of Spirit by holding down dodge.\n[h3]Whisper of Spirit:[/h3]\nYou take on the form of a windborne plume that can freely traverse the environment, dealing high damage to enemies in your path and slowing them. Once the form ends, dodge will be unusable for a time.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/otherworld-legends-ourania"}
