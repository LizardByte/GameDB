As you progress through the game, you play as three different characters, each involved in the mystery in different ways. There's Jacques, a young goldsmith, Pierre, a young horseman who wants to join the King's Army, and Rosemonde, a dancer. Most of the game is a straightforward point-and-click adventure game, where you talk to people for information and clues, and find items that you use to solve puzzles. There are also a few arcade-like elements, such as climbing up a chimney and target practice with a bow and arrow. The game progresses in a series of chapters. In each chapter, you must perform a certain task with at least two characters in order to proceed. \n \nThis game contains animated cutscenes and voice over work.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/paris-1313-the-mystery-of-notre-dame-cathedral"}
