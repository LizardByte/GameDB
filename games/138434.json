The game is simple but will keep you busy for hours, and thats a promise!\n\nThe game consists of a 20x12 playfield which is filled with various types of blocks. Your job is to make the blue blocks disappear from the playfield by stepping on them. There are five main types of block, each of which behave differently.\n\nThe first levels are for 'easy entertainment'. At first the levels are small, then get bigger and harder at each stage. Even if you do not read the instructions here, you should be able to handle the game when you start at level 1. To make everything a bit more tricky keep track of the time, but don't panic.\n\nIf you solve a level without fault you will get a 'well done'. This 'well done' is worth one extra chance, otherwise you will just get a 'done' without any bonus. A 'well done' is the only possibility in this game to get an extra life.\n\nXump has participated in the 16 Days Coding Competition.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xump-the-final-run", "videos": [{"id": 88304, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "eUvhiDI1wfQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUvhiDI1wfQ", "title": "Xump - The Final Run | by Retroguru (Official Trailer)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eUvhiDI1wfQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
