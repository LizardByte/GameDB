The drop of the quarter in the top-mounted acceptor activates the computer to present a single-tone sound. When the sound occurs, the corresponding button lights to give a visual clue. Then the game pauses long enough for the player to \"confirm\" the sound to the computer by pressing the same button that lit. Oops! Wrong button? ERROR number one\u2026 and a lighted window tells the player he's goofed. Then another chance\u2026 the sound and lighted button are repeated by the computer. Another pause \u2026 right! You've hit the right button(s) in the right sequence, and the game goes on to another sound sequence. Every correct player response adds an additional sound/note to the sequence. \"Beep \u2013 beep \u2013 bloop \u2013 beep \u2013 bloop\" \u2026 Did you correctly repeat those sounds when the buttons lit? Sorry, only three errors per game. You'll have to insert another 25\u00a2 and try again!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/touch-me"}
