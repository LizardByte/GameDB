The gameplay is a mixture of a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up and Breakout. The player can collect money, which unlocks various bonuses, as well as Arkanoid-style power-ups that include a fireball that will go straight through blocks instead of being deflected. They can also send the bat forward a short distance, which helps to collect items, defeat enemies and hit the ball.\n\nThe game was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom in 1994.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/zig-zag-cat-ostrich-club-mo-oosawagi-da"}
