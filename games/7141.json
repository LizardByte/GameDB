Unlike its predecessor, it offers a more rally-oriented gameplay. The twelve selectable high-performance road cars of the previous game have been replaced with four rally cars. The game features an improved graphics engine (SVGA) and various tracks including England, Switzerland, Egypt, Colombia, and others. These tracks may be slippery or contain various obstacles and scenery objects such as birds, helicopters, cows, etc. Split-screen head-to-head competitive two-player mode is available.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
