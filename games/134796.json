After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect.\n\nEverything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest.\n\nAlthough Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common...\n\nWill you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?", "summary": "Wish on shooting stars while you enjoy a weekend getaway at the beach!", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/starlight-shores", "videos": [{"id": 65285, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "anzq0aTNOzA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anzq0aTNOzA", "title": "Starlight Shores Release Trailer (Visual Novel)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/anzq0aTNOzA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
