Top 10 in 32 countries!\n\nIn Machine World your imagination is the limit. Build houses or other structures using the cranes and semi trailer. Dig anywhere with the excavator and the terrain will deform: create holes, trenches or hills. The roads are also destructible! There are lots of details in the world: An opening bridge with gates and signals, lots of props like cones and road blocks - strobe lights on vehicles and lots of objects to build with.\n\nThe controls have two modes - one easy mode suitable for children or casual play and one realistic mode (with different control standards, SAE & ISO). \nSpoken help is always just a tap away. Easy to learn, harder to master. \n\nView the gameplay video at www.trinogames.com, where you can also follow the development of new (free) updates!\n\n** #1 Game in Norway, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and others.
