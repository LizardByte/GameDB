The gameplay would have revolved around using a tilt sensor in the Saturn analog pad, similar to what Nights: Journey of Dreams did with the Nintendo Wii remote. Development started on the Saturn, and eventually moved to the Dreamcast. The project was cancelled, and the technology used for the control scheme was used as a prototype for the motion-sensing technology in Samba De Amigo for the Dreamcast.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/air-nights"}
