You need to build roads, power infrastructure and zone lots. Do well and people will move into your city, do poorly and they\u2019ll abandon it, leaving you with no revenue and a lot of useless roads to maintain (similar to some actual cities, actually). It\u2019s a game about balance above all else. \n   The fun of the game comes from keeping everything running \u2013 revenue, crime, transportation, entertainment. Help prod the city to growth, and remember, you need more police stations than you think. \n   You can also help growth by adjusting the budget. There\u2019s not a lot of control \u2013 at least, not compared to modern incarnations \u2013 but it\u2019s interesting to see what effect tweaking things can have. Raise taxes and people will leave, lower taxes and you won\u2019t be able to fund anything. \n   As mentioned earlier, you can also play various scenarios. I enjoyed the layout of Hamburg \u2013 it roughly corresponds to the real city \u2013 until it was bombed to oblivion.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/micropolis"}
