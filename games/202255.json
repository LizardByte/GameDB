The catch is that Eggman only gets destroyed when the timer runs down to 0 (unless it's a draw at that time, then, it will wait for another hit). The player with the most hits at the end of the timer wins. The player can also win if the other player dies before the timer runs out (if respawn mode is off).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-bash"}
