We take the gameplay of RPGs and squash them into 4v4 PVP matches. Players choose to play as either the Heroes or the Villains and compete to write their own story. Each team will help raise their own Mythic Beast during each match and level it up as the match progresses. Players choose their favorite animals to play as and a class to fit their play style. In each match players level up, complete side-quests, fight monsters, fight the enemy team, and finish it off with an epic final boss fight. If the Heroes successfully complete all their side quests, they will face off against the Villains in one last epic clash. Each team's Mythic Beasts are taken over by their respective teams; with each member of the team taking on a different role. What will your Hero Tail be?", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hero-tails", "videos": [{"id": 47934, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "UWWyiI_GGL4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWWyiI_GGL4", "title": "Hero Tails - All In One Match Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UWWyiI_GGL4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47935, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "CXRtisW1yIE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXRtisW1yIE", "title": "Hero Tails - Map Fly Through of Heroes Side", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CXRtisW1yIE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47936, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "AdMxsBU95hA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdMxsBU95hA", "title": "Hero Tails - Map Fly Trough of Villains Side", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AdMxsBU95hA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 47937, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "-lhjVJ3bl1c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lhjVJ3bl1c", "title": "Hero Tails - On your final day", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-lhjVJ3bl1c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
