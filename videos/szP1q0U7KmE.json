This is not an emulator.  This footage was recorded directly from my front-loading NES using a real Donkey Kong Classics cartridge.  \n\nDonkey Kong Classics was one of the earliest games I remember owning for my NES.  My mother was probably a fan of Donkey Kong and decided to pick up this cartridge so we could play the game(s) at home.  That's the best I can surmise at least.  I was simply too young at the time to remember exactly how we got this game (I may have around 4 years old).  But I'm betting that it at least came from a family member.\n\nThis cartridge is pretty cool because it contains two games in one: Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.  Donkey Kong itself is a short game, but it's still fun, and it's definitely a classic.  I remember playing this game a lot as a kid.  I never played it in the arcades until years later, but I knew about the game back in the late '80s thanks to this cartridge.  \n\nI later found out that the NES port of Donkey Kong was missing one of the levels from the arcade game.  Even so, it was still a great deal, and when you consider that there was a black-box Donkey Kong-only cartridge that was released before this one, you can see why it was worth picking up back then.\n\nIn this video I completed one cycle of the game on Mode B, which is the hard mode.  Like the arcade version, this version repeats endlessly, so there's no way to beat the game.\n\nRecorded with the Hauppauge HD PVR and a composite connection at 60 frames per second.  I used a Toshiba model D-R550 DVD Recorder to upconvert the NES's native 240p signal to 480i so that the Hauppauge could capture the console's audio/video signal.\n\nI'm using an NES Advantage Joystick.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/szP1q0U7KmE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/szP1q0U7KmE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/szP1q0U7KmE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/szP1q0U7KmE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/szP1q0U7KmE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Donkey Kong Classics - Donkey Kong Playthrough (Actual NES Capture)", "description": "This is a capture of me playing through Donkey Kong on the NES.
