Impressed by your victorious battles and leadership skills, the king offers you a chance of a lifetime - sail on a crusader ship to a new island and start a settlement there.\n\nYou will be in charge of both the settlement\u2019s military and economy. Your goal is to build up the crusader settlement, profit from trade and farming, and then use the income to improve your army and defenses. Strong walls manned by archers and ballistas will help you withstand constant enemy attacks. To defend your settlement, you will need to train your army, upgrade equipment, and research new unit types to grow your empire.\n\nThen, once your economy is up and running and your crusader army grows in size and power, it\u2019s time to go on the offensive and start expanding your stronghold.
