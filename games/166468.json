It stars Kazaguruma and Jose.\n\nUnlike other fangames, Kudaranu Mousou No introduces the concept of linear locations. Instead of exploring the entire dream world at once, the player is required to enter worlds and collect effects one at a time in order to reach an ending.\n\nThe initial version was created with RPG Maker 2000, but later (Ver.0.03) the game was renewed with WOLF RPG Editor."}
