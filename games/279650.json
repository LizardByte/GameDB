Betrayed, we rallied behind Tar, the leader of the Reborn rebellion. In its aftermath the fury of Mother Nature was unleashed and our society collapsed. Now Tar calls us to uncover the truth and finish the fight. But beware - not everyone can be trusted.\n\nSince the collapse, the world has been turned to ruin with scarce resources and enemies lurking everywhere. Explore the vast open land of Colton County, scavenging for valuable loot essential for your survival in this hostile environment overtaken by warring factions, enemy players, and extreme forces of nature.\n\nEarth has changed into an emergent battleground where rules are set by a dynamic weather condition system. Prepare to take on unpredictable tornadoes, lightning strikes, apocalyptic storms and other hazards that will significantly impact your gameplay experience, resulting in no two sessions ever feeling the same.\n\nExo-rigs are the ultimate platform of survival. Customize your loadout, use and combine their unique abilities to fit your playstyle and team strategy. As you progress, you'll expand your tactical toolbox with new mods, allowing additional synergies with forces of nature and using them to your advantage. Scavenge, craft, or loot them from enemy players if needed.\n\nColton County became an unforgiving place where only the most seasoned rebels could recover the rarest resources. Careful preparation and planning will be required to get the most out of your runs. Adjust your pace and be tactical about when you want to engage in combat, as high rewards yield high risks.", "summary": "Exoborne is an open-world, tactical extraction shooter set in a world torn apart by extreme forces of nature.
