You can move anywhere but cannot pass through walls or the outer perimeter. If you press fire, you can see a spotlighted area of the maze and by holding down the button, you can move the joystick around to see more maze. You must find the exit before the timer, which begins counting down as soon as you move, reaches zero. In the maze, there is a box that will give you more time. If the timer reaches zero, game is over. Once you exit the maze, you get any remaining time as your score. If you never used the spotlight in that maze, your score is doubled.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/encaved"}
