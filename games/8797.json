As the barrier between our worlds begins to crack under their scrutiny, helpless Eyalites have begun to disappear, whisked up to serve as their slaves and playthings. They imbue these victims with magical powers to better survive the ensuing stresses - can you use your new-found abilities to escape the legions of Mal'Rok?", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tales-of-majeyal-ashes-of-urhrok", "videos": [{"id": 44528, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "I7vFQPUDndI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7vFQPUDndI", "title": "Tales of Maj'Eyal: Ashes of Urh'Rok DLC trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I7vFQPUDndI/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 1185, "name": "Tales of Maj'Eyal"}]}
