Long had his people known hardship, and he journeyed to distant lands in search of treasure that might ease their suffering. No prize was so great as the Scarab Bracelet. The crowning jewel of a lost civilization, the relic\u2019s magic promised to fill Valkenheim\u2019s tables with meat and mead once more. And so Bolthorn betrayed a friend to steal it.\n\nOn his return, an odd sickness took hold of the Viking. Fell omens seemed to stalk his every step. Strange weather ravaged Valkenheim and the land\u2019s meagre harvest withered. The phenomena spread across Heathmoor, its people falling like grass before the scythe. Doomed to deliver death rather than salvation, Bolthorn tried to cast off the Scarab Bracelet to no avail. It had found a new home.", "summary": "Includes Testing Grounds, Justice of Pharaohs (Seasonal Event), Bolthorn's Curse Raider Skin, New Seasonal Customization and a new Battle Pass.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/for-honor-season-22-curse-of-the-scarab", "videos": [{"id": 77226, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BGTQTNvMftE"}]}
