It's a hack in which you can create your own team\nwith the characters of Dragon Ball Z.\n\nThe title is basic, I didn't look for a specific title...\nActually, I just wanted to have fun by making this game.\n\nHere are the main modifications:\n-Pokemons are replaced by \"fighters\". There are 147 fighters.\n\n-There are 167 attacks including 137 new attacks (techniques from Dbz)\nwith new animations of course, and 30 old attacks (from Pok\u00e9mon, like Headbutt for example).\n\n-I added new maps for some cities. I didn't change all the maps, only some of them.\n\n-I've changed some overworld sprites too. (mini-sprites on the maps)\n\n-Many items were added. (capsules, senzu...etc) The list is in the thread.\n\n\nMaybe this is not the perfect game but I've made it alone. It took me many time to do it, then there can be some defects.\n\nI don't speak english perfectly, so I did my best but the texts may be wrong sometimes.\nThe Trainer Tower is not modified, I need more time to change \nthe trainers. (But it doesn't matter very much)\nThere is also a little problem with the attack animations during dual battles, so don't be surprised if some attacks are weird in a dual battle.\n\nI tested the game and it works without any problem. There are only some glitches but I'm going to fix it later.\n\nThe save:\nIt's the same problem with the other pokemon games. You have to adjust the settings on VBA.\nGo to \"options\" ; \"emulator\" ; \"save type\" and choose Automatic and Flash 128K. Then, put the files (emulator and rom) in the same folder. There must not be a save file (\".sav\") in the folder before opening the rom.\nThen you should be able to save. You can search on Google too if you can't do it.\n\nIf you're on Android: Use the emulator Myboy Free and go to Settings, advanced, cartridge type and choose 128. The save should work like that.\nYou can also watch this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV-KmED_XR8\n\nAnother thing: download Type Resistance Editor if you want to change the type advantages: http://www.mediafire.com/download/341bbeouc2c9eyj/TypeResistanceEditor_for_DBZ_TT.exe\n\nIf you want more information, go to the thread on Pokecommunity.\non the wikia managed by PureRage,  or on the facebook page.
