Your father is the priest of the small shrine you live in, and you have to follow several important rules that he has set up to keep the village safe. These are the rules: you know what is best for the villagers, so they have to do whatever you and your family say, you cannot go upstairs, you must give blood every Sunday, and you cannot go into the forest.\n\nThis specific Sunday, you play as Chi as she goes on a quest with her puppy, Mitsuru, to get markers so that she can draw some pictures. You complete some minor favors, and get your blood drawn so you're able to get said markers. However, as you're walking home, the evening goes terribly wrong as Mitsuru runs into the forest. With this, in order to save your dog, you have no choice but to run in after her...\n\nRun after her into a forest that no one returns from.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chi"}
