Its story takes place at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Players become one of the 12 key figures of the time, like Ryouma Sakamoto, Kaishuu Katsu, and Takamori Saigou. They guide Japan to freedom by using persuasion and force to unify the 13 domains under one ideal, whether that is loyalty to the shogunate or the emperor, or even to the public opinion."}
