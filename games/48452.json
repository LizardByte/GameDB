A team was assembled from eight countries around the world, and split into two spaceships for the mission, dubbed the \u201cNebula\u201d and the \u201cCorona.\u201d They would depart from the Space Station Jesus. A primary objective of the mission was to collect gas samples from the tail of Halley\u2019s Comet. These samples were to be gathered not only for the advancement of materials science or astronomy, but also to test the theory that life on Earth may have been seeded by comets. The knowledge the crew gained had the potential to solve one of the last enigmas of biology. Immediately after extracting the gas from the comet, however, communications from the spaceship Nebula mysteriously stops.", "summary": "JESUS: Kyoufu no Bio Monster is a port of the popular computer game Jesus for Famicom.\n\nSome changes were made to the story development and dialogue (for example, the partner you act with in the latter half of the story can be chosen in the PC version, but in the Famicom version it is fixed to Elline), and some adult-oriented graphics and scenes were changed or removed due to the age group of Famicom users.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jesus-kyoufu-no-bio-monster"}
