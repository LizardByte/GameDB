The game starts with the screen saying \"Size Does Matter!\", followed by Godzilla's roar and an animation showing an iguana looking into the distance as a nuclear bomb goes off, engulfing the screen. The score then shows up, and when the player gets his or her ball in a special place cutscenes can occur, like when getting the taxi, a man shouting \"Hey taxi!\" to a taxi visible on screen only to have Godzilla's foot land on the taxi and give the player a Multiball Bonus, where they can complete it for 5,000,000 points. The only goal in this game is to get a higher high score.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 38082, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "11UqGjtCaZ4"}]}
