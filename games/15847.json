The team was only given ten months to finish the game, a relatively short time for a non-sequel console game (especially in 2005), as it had to be out in time for the movie's theatrical premier. Still, Terminal Reality rose to the task and managed to create a complete \u00c6on Flux game in less than a year, due in part to the fact that the developer created much of the game using an engine they had already built for their previous title, BloodRayne 2, which cut down on development time dramatically. Nine years after the first ill-fated attempt and five years after the second, an \u00c6on Flux game was finally completed and released to the market in November 2005.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 6620, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "o4FKiFMo5Z8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4FKiFMo5Z8", "title": "Aeon Flux PSX (cancelled) Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o4FKiFMo5Z8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
