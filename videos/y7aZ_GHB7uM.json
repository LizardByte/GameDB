It contains dark themes not suitable for children under the age of 13. Viewer Discretion is advised.\n\nWell this is something I wasn't expecting to do! Celebrate an anniversary of an obscure SNK game that I only knew about via watching a video on it. As I have only now learned by way of dinking around on Wikipedia and the SNK Wiki respectively. I'm not sure if you know this, but I have a lot of interest in Japan-exclusive video games, especially those during the SNES, Genesis, and Playstation 1 era of games. Also, GBA and Nintendo DS. Simply put, these are the kinds of games that didn't get the wide release to North America and PAL Regions, for a number of reasons... being late in the console's life, strange imagery that wouldn't be able to pass in other territories, or no reason at all. But then comes a Japan exclusive game that is so weird and fascinating, that I just have to talk about it. A fighting game spin-off that is a 3D adventure game in the vein of Clock Tower and Resident Evil, starring Athena Asamyia of Psycho Soldier fame! The game I am of course talking about is SNK and Yumekobo's Athena: Awakening from the ordinary life!\n\nFor those not in the know... and by that I mean all of you, Awakening from the ordinary life is a 3D Adventure game starring Athena Asamiya from the Psycho Solder series. Resembling games such as Resident Evil and Clock Tower 2, Athena gets involved in an adventure that involves government conspiracies, rapidly progressing science and demonic clowns, as she develops psycho powers. It's a rather unique game that is on the short side despite being spread across 3 PS1 Discs. The game is not connected to Psycho Soldier or any KOF games, but if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say it's sort of a darker reimagining of Psycho Soldier with a different continuity.\n\nI first discovered the game via YouTube user @GuileWinQuote, who did a video on this obscure game, detailing the story with phone translations, as there has not been an English fan translation for this game as of now. It is an entertaining video and I recommend that you watch it if you are an SNK fan! Ever since watching that video, I've had the game in the back of my mind. I even started to watch the TV Drama adapted from the game, just for curiosity's sake. I've also wanted to try and snag a copy of it from either eBay or Buyee... I still have a listing of the trial CD for the game on my eBay account's recently viewed section.\n\nRecently, I have been looking up the game again, this time on the Internet Archive, and I came across a TV commercial for the game. It's quite surreal, and has some animation unique to this ad, such as Athena face to face with a W.A.D. mech, a dinosaur attacking the screen and W.A.D. Soldiers mobilizing. It comes to us from a Japanese Twitter user named \u30a2\u30bf\u30ea\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\uff08\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ac\u30c1\u30e3\u30ac\u30c1\u30e3\uff57, whose name roughly translates to \"Atari Shock (Retro Game Gacha Gacha)\" on Google Translate. His twitter has since been deleted, but the ad has been archived by Internet Archive user chris85 along with a bunch of other ads the Retro Game Gacha Gacha Twitter page uploaded. Links will be in the description below.\n\nThe quality is a bit 50/50, as it was a Twitter video upload, but I think it looks good for what it is. What better way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Athena: Awakening from the ordinary life than with what I do best? Oh, yeah... the game was a March 1999 release! Wikipedia says that it released on March 4th, while the SNK Wiki doesn't specify the date. I'm not sure how well this dark take on Athena Asamiya sold, as this was 2 years before the initial bankruptcy SNK would suffer.\n\nGuileWinQuote's video on Awakening from the ordinary life: https://youtu.be/ckQodSnOZGI?si=SYKQ-Y0qRvW5V5Ys\n\nOriginal uploader: chris85 on Internet Archive\nOriginal Credit: \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ac\u30c1\u30e3\u30ac\u30c1\u30e3\uff57 on Twitter\nOriginal Source: https://archive.org/details/twitter-1240039824821633024\n\nUploaded for entertainment and curation purposes only.
