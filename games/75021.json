It is a 2D top-down shooter taking place out in space in a galactic junkyard. In this setting, the players are trying to survive by constructing space ships. \n \nThe game is round-based and each round is divided up into two phases: build phase and battle phase. During the build phase, each player gets a number of components and has to assemble a spaceship from them within a certain time limit. During the battle phase, the players pilot the ships. They battle against the other or team up against the garbage drones living in the junkyard. \n \nThe randomness and unpredictable nature of the game makes every round into a new challenge, because you always have a new ship to battle with, raising the stakes and making the game quite addictive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "videos": [{"id": 16752, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mj9q6D-KKNg"}, {"id": 18045, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MoXuN-RlyM8"}]}
