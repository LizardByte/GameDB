You are a manager but also have a complex background life story, and it will all come together... Click \"SHOW MORE\" for links.\n\nHow do you play it? In the game, you are the new manager of Calchester Assembled. You have to (1) make existential choices (2) manage the football matches. Making life choices, interacting with various characters and situations determines your Karma, Kaos and set of cards available in matches. Then the matches are turn-based: at each turn, you can choose whether to do a cautious or risky move and hence how much resources to use. \n\nSo the game is a mix of narrative, story-rich game with choices (hence the 24 different endings), combining aspects of both a football manager game and a game where you actually play the matches; for the play part its a bit like Flick Kick football.\n\nWe are releasing the game on September 18th (2019).\n\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/876190/Football_Drama/\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openlab.footballdrama\nApple Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/football-drama/id1401903505", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQr5Zww5DZU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQr5Zww5DZU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQr5Zww5DZU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQr5Zww5DZU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dQr5Zww5DZU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Football Drama: Every Goal Has A Story (gameplay)", "description": "Football Drama is a game where story and management interact in many ways.
