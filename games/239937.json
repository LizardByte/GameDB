In the game, the player controls a small marker that moves on a rectangular playfield. The goal is to claim a certain percentage of the playfield by drawing lines with the marker around areas that have not been claimed yet. The player must avoid collisions with balls bouncing around the playfield to avoid losing a life.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/xonix"}
