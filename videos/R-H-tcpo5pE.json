Playing as either a diver, or a shark, eliminate your enemies using a combination of stealth, cunning, and teamwork. \n\nPlay as a shark\nAs a twenty foot Great White Shark, speed and senses are your greatest weapons. Stalk your prey from across the ocean and tear them in half with your razor sharp teeth.\n\nPlay as a diver\nAs a human diver you must explore the abyss in search of treasure to upgrade your arsenal. Defend yourself with a range of high powered gear, from spearguns and pistols to underwater assault rifles and explosive sea mines.\n\nHeart pounding atmosphere\nExperience the dread that comes from swimming in the darkness of the ocean. Dynamic lighting and shadows create a unique and gut-wrenching atmosphere that will have you on edge from the moment you dive in.\n\nEvolve your play style\nUnlock exotic new weapons for your diver, or 'evolutions' for your shark that open up new tactical possibilities as you play the game. Persistent stat tracking and meaningful steam achievements will also give you something to shoot for (in some cases, quite literally!)\n\nPractice offline with AI bots\nNot feeling quite ready to plunge into online play? Depth allows you to hone your skills against some alarmingly clever AI enemies who can be configured in several modes of difficulty.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R-H-tcpo5pE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R-H-tcpo5pE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R-H-tcpo5pE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R-H-tcpo5pE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R-H-tcpo5pE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Depth 'Blood and Gold' Trailer", "description": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/274940\n\nDepth is a PvP multiplayer game which blends heart pounding tension and visceral action in a dark aquatic world.
