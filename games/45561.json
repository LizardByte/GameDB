Upon meeting and conversing with the castle's true owner and king, Mickey is told that in order to defeat Mizrabel he must find the Seven Gems of the Rainbow. Majority of the seven gems are kept within various illusion-filled worlds (known in the game as levels), and are being guarded by Mizrabel's henchmen \u2013 which are known as the Masters of Illusion. Alongside the Masters of Illusion are bizarre creatures - such as enchanted mushrooms, toy soldiers, ball-juggling unicycle-riding clowns, and armored knights that Mickey must face. After thanking the castellan and hurrying into the castle hallway, Mickey begins to search through five doors that each lead to a different level. The levels are The Enchanted Forest, Toyland, The Storm, Dessert Factory, The Library, and finally, The Castle.\n\nQuackShot Starring Donald Duck:\nWhile Donald is flipping through some books in Uncle Scrooge's library, a treasure map from King Garuzia, the old-time ruler of the Great Duck kingdom, falls out. It leads to the king's most prized possession. Donald thinks this is his path to riches. Unfortunately, Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.\n\nDonald, using a partial map from the library, travels to a variety of places around the world seeking clues to find the treasure, including Duckburg and Mexico. After defeating Count Dracula in Transylvania, Donald receives a more complete map pointing to the Maharajah in India, Egypt, a haunted Viking ship, and finally the South Pole, where Donald finds an ancient Viking diary said to reveal the location of the treasure. However, upon finding the diary, Pete shows up, holding Donald's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary. After giving Pete the diary, Donald travels to Pete's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back. The diary reveals that if the map is dipped in water, it will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure.", "summary": "Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse: In Castle of Illusion Mickey is on the trail of a wicked witch who has kidnapped Minnie, and you must find the seven gems in order to defeat the witch's spellbound baddies and save Minnie.\n\nQuackshot Starring Donald Duck: Join Donald in the quest to find Garuzia's Great Duck Treasure!
