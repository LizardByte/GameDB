And Martin Purvis, Pablo Cortina, for the music, and Scott Sherman for audio help.\n\nWe'll be having BETA sign ups in July if anyone would like to come test the mod -- the Main quest is now feature complete in the core narratives, and we have a cap over the parts that aren't accessible (because there was no one available to code them. Mostly a two man operation here in New California's CIC.)\n\nThat said, the mod is now art locked! We have a our BSA files set, the story works, bugs are minimal... \n\n....so why October and not now? \n\nBecause something is missing -- and all the testing guys noticed -- is side quests. Again, not the end of the world, but you hit this story with huge replete branches 16,000 lines of dialogue long you expect some little moments with characters off to the side of the big arcs, and there just aren't any. Again, because there was no one to code it! I'd also like to take time to revise some plot holes and gaps in the open possibilities that appeared in testing. \n\nSo we will code that ourselves the hard way, and provide a lot more support in optimizing the engine side of things. Our art is just running up against the limits of what this old engine can do. We need source code. Or, we need to do tedious work to work around limitations on both low end systems and high end ones that can handle all the pretty stuff at 60fps. \n\nhttps://www.moddb.com/mods/falloutprojectbrazil/\n\nFor more monthly news! \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FalloutProjectBrazil/\n\nYes, it will be on Nexus:\n\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45138/\n\nDiscord is going to open in July. :D\n\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/donate/?id=1040788\n\nPaypal, if you're feeling generous.\n\nWe'll see you all back here shortly!\n\nLove you guys\nThain", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWkKzaplwbY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWkKzaplwbY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWkKzaplwbY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWkKzaplwbY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nWkKzaplwbY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fallout New California Narrative Trailer - With Release Date", "description": "For our 5 Year Anniversary, we're finally announcing the exact day we will launch our mod to the public!\n\nCredits list for the mod, voice actors, contributors, and this video: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxnTK6TtBgyTzRgVlWwt0IKzbEE0mXlmwnK8Ey5SPr8/mobilebasic\n\nMods used in this video: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iciq_jIMJvZLMjkDQdCP0tDHmezpFme9nUKjDiZ1HGU/edit\n\nMartin's Song Miles and Miles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZN5dBhIh_8\n\nSpecial thanks to LucianHector for helping shoot in-game videos with me, and to Jack and Rick for the support.
