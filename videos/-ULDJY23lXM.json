Unleash both physical and magical attacks using the keyboard for commands, mixing and matching moves to craft devasting combos to prevail against your opponent!\n\nMeet the fantastic fighters:\n\n- Boodini is the spookish spectre of an unspecified magician, back from the dead to try his hand at a different kind of performance-- physical performance! Along with him is his dutiful assistant, the Metaldead, a necromatic musician always eager to hype up her now ghostly partner! This duo isn't just undying, it's post-dying, too!\n\n- Stone Cold is a frosty, frigid fighter... an ever-cold elemental... a bone-chilling brawler. This cryogenic character likes to use a cool combination of wintry wandwork and freezing fisticuffs to defeat its foes.\n\n- Lurking in the comments of nearly every online forum is a valiant keyboard warrior known throughout the interwebs as u/Grand-Magician29. Despite being a mere mortal, this basement-dweller fancies himself quite the magic aficionado (just ask the five magic-related subreddits he moderates). But whatever you do, don't insult his waifu 4 laifu, or he'll have no choice but to unsheath his (totally authentic) katana and defend her honor!\n\n- Don't let his flimsy fairy wings fool you: Rock Hard is packing! A punch, that is. His rippling muscles will intimidate any foe who dares draw near, but all he really needs is his tiny pink wand to vanquish them.
