It's kind of like a theme park ride through a city that's waking up at dawn. Look around with the mouse to continue on your path or select one of a few branches, and hear a different mix of the music depending on where you go. There's no rush to continue; the music will keep going no matter how long you take. And there's no wrong path, only different ones.", "summary": "That Time in '88 is a 3D music journey.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/that-time-in-88"}
