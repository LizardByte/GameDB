Welcome to Professor Lupo: Ocean, the epilogue of the Professor Lupo and His Horrible Pets saga. At the end of the original game, we left our heroes at the start of a long journey. Five thousand years later, the Aurora space station has reached its destination. Clone, our new heroine, will need to find out how it ended up underwater and just what happened to all of its crew. We bring back the gameplay of the first game and add a new element: water. This element is instrumental and influences each and every aspect of the game. Key points: - 40 new levels - Ro the Furax, a friendly character who\u2019ll help you out during the adventure - Learn how new aliens behave and use them in your favour - Plot twists that tie you back to the original game Will you be able to escape?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/professor-lupo-ocean"}
