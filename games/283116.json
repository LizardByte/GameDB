It takes place in the Fornes region, which is basically just the Johto region but with city and character names swapped, and some of the maps having new tiles and minor changes to their layouts. It has some features that could make it be considered a \"troll/joke hack\", like entrances to buildings being different than what they say they are, those same entrances leading to new areas when you leave, purposefully poor grammar, and a higher difficulty overall. It could, however, also just be an earnest attempt at making a rom hack that was poorly done. It's hard to tell as information on this project is very hard to find.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-orb-version"}
