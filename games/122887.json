In exchange for advanced technology, Bombo World traded the northern part of the island to the aliens, where they established their city of Dero City. A hundred years later, Dero City has become famous for its annual sports tournament. A five-year-old girl named Cookie Blair travels alone in the hopes of competing, but will she be pulled into something larger?", "summary": "Cookie's Bustle is an adventure game in which the player guides Cookie throughout Dero City to guide her towards her goal of competing in the sports competition. The control scheme is very simple; Cookie moves on her own to follow the cursor wherever it's pointed on screen, and most actions can be taken by positioning her without clicking on anything. Once she actually enters the tournament, there are minigames for each of the sports.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cookies-bustle"}
