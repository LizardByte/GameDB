Since then, we created games taking the best from many genres, but at the same time making them unique with fresh ideas - we try to make our dreams a reality. Our hardened developers are working each day to deliver the best gaming experience.\n\n-- Check our social pages -\nTwitter: \n\ud83d\udc49 https://twitter.com/intermarum\nFacebook: \n\ud83d\udc49 https://www.facebook.com/intermarum/\n\ud83d\udc49https://www.facebook.com/WorkshopSimulator\nLinkedIn: \n\ud83d\udc49https://www.linkedin.com/company/inte...\n\n#sandboxgame #simulator #pcgame", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s3bD3uQ4RuE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s3bD3uQ4RuE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s3bD3uQ4RuE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s3bD3uQ4RuE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "WORKSHOP SIMULATOR: Launch Trailer", "description": "Workshop Simulator is a relaxing restoration simulator - take vintage items and give them a second life - the respect for the usefulness of every object, which in the hands of a specialist can become a small work of art. \n\nThe game's release date for Steam is March 10th 2022!\n\n\ud83d\udee0 Wishlist now on Steam: http://bit.ly/Workshop_Simulator\n\ud83d\udee0 Follow the game's fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/WorkshopSimu...\n\nMusic in background: Jinx and The Hammer - Specks \nhttps://jinxandthehammer.bandcamp.com...\n\nWorkshop Simulator offers players a warm and creative experience focused on the detailed and rewarding nature of tools and craft, backed by a heartwarming and nostalgic story about lessons in patience and generosity across generations.
