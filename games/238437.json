Players learn their identity at the beginning by whether or not their controller is rumbling without others knowing.

Meanwhile, the Innocents need to utilize items on the map and their wit to find dubious players and defeat all the Traitors. Pick up your controller and have a chaotic game full of laughter and suspicion with your friends!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rumble-sus"}
