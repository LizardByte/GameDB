It's a game for the PSP system which\nconsists in a port of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion 2\" (released for PS2 in 2004)\nwith many extras and gameplay enhancements. A limited edition was also\nreleased to celebrate Evangelion's 10th Anniversary, with a special package\ntitled \"Memorial Box\" which featured different artwork for the game case &\ndisc, and most important, two bonus UMD video with the \"Death & Rebirth\" and\n\"The End of Evangelion\" movies.\n\nThe genre of this game (usually classified as \"World Simulator\") is quite\ndifficult to describe, as it mixes dating simulator elements, tamagotchi-like\ngameplay, and also real time strategic combats, everything mixed with events\nfrom the series and alternate ones as well. In each Scenario of the game, you\nwill play as one of the characters from Evangelion and experience their daily\nlife. It's one of the best adaptations of Evangelion into a game, if not the\nbest, anyway and fans of the series will surely enjoy it.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/neon-genesis-evangelion-tsukurareshi-sekai-another-cases"}
