It is known outside Japan as \"JoJo's Venture\". \n \nYou choose one of the six heroes, or one of the four villains, to go kill the vampire Dio Brando. Each character has a seperate, ongoing storyline. You control your character like in any other Street Fighter-type game, but special moves are done by using the \"stand\" button to call upon your \"Stand\" -- your psychic persona. Each \"Stand\" has a different power, from speed, to fire control, to stopping time."}
