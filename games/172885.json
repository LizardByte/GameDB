Potions will help you grow faster and stronger, cooking will open up many satisfying dishes for you, and your own farm will supply you with all the resources you need. In the game you will not be bored if you love freedom of action and know how to entertain yourself!\nPrepare a sword, sharpen it on an anvil, put on obsidian armor, stock up on food with potions and go into the bowels to get magma crystals to create the best equipment in the game!
