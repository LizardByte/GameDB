It's not especially deep, but it is quite tense at times.\n\nYour barbarian warrior has a number of attack moves at his disposal, all activated by holding down the fire-button and moving the joystick in specific directions. The kick is too short range to be of any use and can be ignored completely, and you should instead concentrate on using the front and back swing attacks with your blade. The front swing has slightly longer range, but takes longer to execute, whereas the back-swing takes less time, but has a slightly shorter range.\n\nHowever, it is possible to make things easier when you learn how to 'game' the enemy AI, which will retreat whenever you're attacking. It's entirely possible to force the opponent to retreat to the edge of the screen, then advance to point where you can rain blows on them to until they're defeated; just don't mess up the timing or distance - they're still a force to be reckoned with.\n\nCredits\nDesign: Christophe Fagot\nCoder: Michel Pernot\nGraphics: Pascal Einsweiler\nMusician: Michel Jean Baillot\n\n#rpg\n#retrogaming\n#adventuregames", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z3278R3IfX0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z3278R3IfX0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z3278R3IfX0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z3278R3IfX0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z3278R3IfX0/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Targhan Longplay (Amiga) [QHD]", "description": "Follow me on Twitter @ https://twitter.com/Al82_Retro\nGet Great Retro Scene News @ http://www.vintageisthenewold.com\nDeveloped by and published by Silmarils in 1989\n\nA visually attractive high-fantasy escapade from the folks at Silmarils, Targhan is an arcade-style adventure game that shows promise, but is let down by shallow combat and some poor enemy placement.\n\nThe objective is to find various items scattered around the game map, as well as potions and scrolls to aid in your mission to defeat the evil sorcerer.\n\n Much of the combat involves timing your blows whenever your opponent comes into range, without getting hit in return.
