Red moves the player forward, Blue makes the player jump vertically, pink makes him jump at an angle, green makes the player stomp downwards. Now add to that that you can boost the effects of colors by adding up to four of them in a row, just pick your 10 colors, chose the direction and then watch as your mixture of colors gets auto-played to see if you beat the level or not. Can't you already see how many possibilities there are?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chromata"}
