From traditional upgradable weapons to special attacks, this new trailer focuses on the large array of action game mechanics present in the game. Fuel Overdose is scheduled for release on PlayStation\u00aeNetwork (PS3) and PC.\n\n\nDropping mines or banana peels, shooting missiles or shells, it is all expected, so what we tried to do with Fuel Overdose is to take the action racing experience one step further and offer the widest array of attacks and tactics ever seen in an action racing game.\n\n\n\uf0a7 As its core Fuel Overdose is a retro action racer where you can equip your vehicles with some good old classic upgradable weapons: a machine gun that proves extremely useful when chaining combos, a rocket launcher for more substantial damage and mines that can help you to keep distance from your rivals.\n\uf0a7 The race track is full of dangers, even when your rivals seem out of range, keep a close watch as they might be close to one of the bombs disseminated at strategic locations and that can be detonated remotely.\n\uf0a7 Use your grappling hooks as weapons to electrify your enemies or to counter their electric shock, or to combine it with other weapons for more accuracy.\n\uf0a7 Just as in a classic fighting game, the more you get hit, the more you fill your Berserk gauge. Once partially filled you can trigger a Super Attack. Once fully filled you can unleash an Ultra Attack. Whether offense, defense, stealth, or pure speed, each character has a set of 3 unique attacks for a total of 24 distinctive Super and Ultra Attacks.\n\uf0a7 Each character also has a unique Skill Move: from Rosa's Jump to A.J.'s Side Rush, these techniques that don't consume the Berserk gauge can give you a decisive edge to win the race.\n\uf0a7 When you run out of ammos, keep in mind that you can still play melee style and try to get rid of an opponent by pushing him out of the road or on an obstacle. \n\uf0a7 All these techniques can be played in chain through a combo system that rewards you with extra life points. So if you want to survive on the race track, you can try to hide, but joining the combat might just be a better option in the end. \n\uf0a7 Last, the Race Danger, probably the most powerful technique of the Fuel Overdose universe...if you manage to get it. Before each race a secret tender rewards the highest bidder with the power to summon a climatic disaster over his enemies. Of course, losers are not refunded and will have to leave with empty hands and pockets.\n\nComing soon\n\nSo far 2 pillars of our gameplay have been revealed to you: \"Racing\" and \"Action\". The coming trailer will focus on one of the aspects that make the Fuel Overdose experience totally different from what any action racing offered so far: its tactical aspect. So keep an eye on the third episode of our \"Tactical-Action-Racing\" series, titled \"Tactical\".", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LhWF5CShha8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LhWF5CShha8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LhWF5CShha8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LhWF5CShha8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LhWF5CShha8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Fuel Overdose - Trailer Action - US version", "description": "Game Blinx (US): 9 out out 10 \nPSNation (US) : A-\nGamers Hub (US): 4.5 out of 5\nImpulse Gamer (UK): 8.5 ouf of 10\nZ-Giochi (Italy): 8 out of 10\nGamesark: 8.1 out of 10\nSavepoint (Spain): 8.5 out of 10\nPS3-Talk (Germany): 8.3 out of 10\n\n\nFollowing the release of \"Racing\" the first installment in the \"Tactical-Action-Racing\" series, the Fuel Overdose team is, today, proud to reveal the trailer \"Action\".
