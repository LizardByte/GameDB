It's the inaugural game in the Fighter's History series. The main unique feature of the Fighter's History is its weak point system, which allows the player to temporarily stun an opponent by repeatedly hitting their weak point.\n\nFighter's History became infamous for being the subject of a lawsuit against Data East by Capcom, who claimed the game is too similar to its hit title, Street Fighter II, and as such is copyright infringement on its property. The case was found in Data East's favor however, as the court found that the copied elements were scenes a faire, elements necessary for depicting the scenario. The game was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994, and followed by a sequel Karnov's Revenge for Neo Geo.\n\nThere are three different gameplay modes are available. CPU Battle is the traditional arcade mode, where the player select a character and try to complete the game by beating all of the other fighters. In survival mode, the player select a team of five characters to go up against another team. And finally versus mode, where the player can go up against his friends.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fighters-history", "videos": [{"id": 55306, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mwbHhpCYFMo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwbHhpCYFMo", "title": "Fighter's History (Arcade) Playthrough as Ryoko", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mwbHhpCYFMo/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
