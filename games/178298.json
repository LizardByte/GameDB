From their earliest days in the Sol System, this organization has sought to bring peace and tranquility to the galactic multitudes. As their reach has expanded through the universe, many a hero has served under their banner; saviors to planets in need.\n\nBut by the year 583 SD, things have changed. The once peaceful Pangalactic Federation is now known for assimilating planets against their will. Once standing for justice, they are now wreathed in darkness.\n\nRaymond, captain of the merchant vessel Ydas, departs from the nonfederated planet of Verguld on a standard transport mission. The job is simple, the route familiar, yet things go awry when the Ydas is attacked by the Astoria: a battleship carrying a member of the Pangalactic Federation\u2019s preeminent Kenny family.\n\nRaymond and his crewmate Chloe are forced to abandon ship amidst the chaos and head for the remote, underdeveloped planet of Aster IV. Before their escape pods can even land, a burst of energy resembling an EMP from the planet\u2019s surface knocks out their systems and brings them crashing down. They find themselves separated and stranded on an unfamiliar planet.\n\nUpon landing, Raymond is immediately attacked by some of the less-than-friendly local wildlife. But when all seems lost, his life is saved by the crown princess of the Kingdom of Aucerius: Laeticia. Marveled by the sudden appearance of this man who rode into her life on a \u201cshooting star,\u201d Laeticia asks Raymond to help save her kingdom from the threat of the neighboring Vey\u2019l Empire. He accepts in exchange for help finding Chloe.\n\nSo begins their journey on Aster IV. However, Raymond will soon discover he has yet to escape the shadow of the Pangalactic Federation.\n\n\u201cWhence do you hail, Ray?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from another world\u2500one that\u2019s far, far away in the sky.\u201d\n\nThis encounter, and the ensuing stand against an overwhelming power, marks a new chapter in galactic history.", "summary": "Star Ocean: The Divine Force is the next installment in the Star Ocean series.
