It's pretty great. The game has nice and colorful graphics (it even has some nice transparency effects) and great stage designs. It would be an excellent commercial title for something like the Nintendo DS...but it does have a problem. The game only seems to have six stages (don't know if you can unlock more). The game is inspired by battle racers, particularly titles like Super Mario Kart, with the sandy beach level, a ghost house level, and such. \n\nHowever, I think it's such a cool game because while it is inspired, it doesn't exactly borrow everything from the game(s) that it was inspired by. For example, so many doujin fighting games borrow nearly all of their moves from pre-existing fighting game characters, instead of trying to add a little flair or originality to the moves that were borrowed. I also like this game because it is one of the rare doujin racing games, and a very high quality one at that...the doujin scene is WAAAAY too oversaturated with SHMUPS and Fighting games...not that some of them aren't cool, but a good deal of them are way too samey and generic. I also think that the \"All female\" trend of doujin games gets extremely annoying after a while...not in a sexist way, but nearly every doujin game I've played has not just a heavy cast of females, but they are typically ALL FEMALE. Unfortunately, this game doesn't break that trend...oh well. You can't win them all.\n\nAs the name suggests, the game has characters from the popular Azumanga Daioh (\u3042\u305a\u307e\u3093\u304c\u5927\u738b) series of manga/anime and it's just wacky. You be the judge. Enjoy.\n\nOh, and I'm really annoyed by the latest changes to the way YT encodes videos. My old videos show intense artifacts that weren't visible months ago and even new videos have them in even some of the most primitive games. It really pisses me off. If you're experiencing shittier than average quality, you can try &fmt=18 and other extensions which will turn some of our old videos back to normal. The problem seems to have been fixed somwhat over the past 24 hours, but you should do the aformentioned if you see extreme cases of artifacts on the screen.\n\nYou can find this game at:\n\nhttp://doujinstyle.com/?p=1797\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiXunqOIzV4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiXunqOIzV4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiXunqOIzV4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiXunqOIzV4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iiXunqOIzV4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Azu-Race Taisen Battle He-Cho Game Sample - PC/Doujin", "description": "Original Air Date: September 20, 2009\n\nAzu-Race Taisen Battle He-Cho is a great looking, great sounding doujin game.
