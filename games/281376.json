Whilst his journey continues forwards, Grigori must now work backwards in an effort to not only leave Ravenholm behind, but cleanse it such that no parasites remain. You'll tread familiar ground made unfamiliar by the effects of Gordon's path through the town, combined with the riled-up zombie hordes out in full force, and new pathways Grigori will take to complete his exodus. Pyres will deliver some of Grigori's once-friends to a better place, and also play their part in igniting a flame that will sweep through Ravenholm. By the time you've reached the end of the mod, the entire town will be up in flames and scorched by your actions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/raising-the-bar-salvation", "videos": [{"id": 104052, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "C-xS9foprB4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-xS9foprB4", "title": "Raising the Bar: Salvation - Release Update", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C-xS9foprB4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
