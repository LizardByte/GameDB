It takes place in year 910,010. You play as a old, rustic robot that was created and then abandoned by the mega corporation of your home world. You are now on the home world's moon, where the mega corporation throws away all of their junk. You don't know why you are here, but you were assigned one objective: Mine.\n\nYou can mine through the moon with various upgrades! You must gather materials to unlock many abilities such as improved fuel capacity, increased laser damage, faster movement speed, and much more. Using these upgrades, you can achieve greater depths and find your ultimate goal.\n\nAs you go deeper in the moon you will find new, tougher caverns. In these deeper caves, you will find it harder to break the stone, but you will find new and very helpful materials. These new materials will be required for more advanced upgrades!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1h2C6yhuPus/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1h2C6yhuPus/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1h2C6yhuPus/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1h2C6yhuPus/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1h2C6yhuPus/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Oddment Trailer", "description": "Store Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2759640/Oddment/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/svpJwvWQxu\n\nOddment is a roguelite focused on mining and exploration.
