You must win several board game battles that occur during the journey. Additionally, by forming close bonds with the girls you recruit as allies, you can receive a confession of love from them in the ending (if you fail to build a good rapport with any party member, you will receive a confession from one of the rival characters, Kyle, Remit, or Iris). These romantic elements are secondary objectives. There are a total of 27 different endings in the game.\n\nThis game can be considered a precursor to MediaWorks' Yuukyuu Gensoukyoku Series.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/eternal-melody"}
