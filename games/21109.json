The original Alien Breed game was launched on Amiga in 1991, developed and published by Team17 Software Ltd. A title that announced Team17's arrival as a quality indie developer-publisher... quite some years before they had a hit with those little pink blighters, WormsTM.\n\nThe game was an instant success and a sequel of sorts, Alien Breed Directors Cut, released in 1992 spending an incredible 33 unbroken weeks at the top of the UK Gallup Budget Charts. A full sequel was released in 1993 (Alien Breed 2) and a 3D edition, which won a number of technical achievement awards in 1994. The well-loved series has lain dormant for 14 years, until now, arriving in stunning fashion with the production-heavy 'Alien Breed Evolution'.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-breed-evolution"}
