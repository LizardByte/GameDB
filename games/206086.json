While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the Red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting helicopters, infantrymen, and tanks. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. Whenever the player runs out of units to aid him in battle, he can use his special weapon to \"absorb\" the enemies and add them to his army.", "summary": "Field Combat is a 1985 shooter video game developed and published by Jaleco for arcades.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/field-combat--1", "collections": [{"id": 8418, "name": "Field Combat"}]}
