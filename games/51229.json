Created in OpenBOR, the game features upgraded visuals, a widescreen mode and more enemies. The three original playable characters are present, each with their own unique move-sets, and now they\u2019re joined by Ash from The Evil Dead. Ash can\u2019t pick up and use weapons but he keeps the monsters at bay with his deadly boomstick and trademark arm-mounted chainsaw! With only 2 continues per playthrough, Night Slashers X is a tough game. Play with up to four players to aid your chances in this pixel-perfect retro throwback!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/night-slashers-x", "videos": [{"id": 137669, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "IHilC2Ozc6Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHilC2Ozc6Q", "title": "Night Slashers X (OpenBOR) Video media for Launchbox", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IHilC2Ozc6Q/sddefault.jpg"}]}
