Seemingly chess for idiots resembles regular chess. The game is played on the same board using the same pieces. However, this is where the similarities end, because everything that would discriminate intellectually against players was eliminated from the rules. Therefore, there are practically no rules, and players can make any move with any pieces and capture any number of opponent's pieces. The victory is determined by the IQ (the lower, the greater the chances of winning) and the decision of Ozjasz Goldberg.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/chess-for-idiots", "videos": [{"id": 100937, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "tN0_fYkpaDI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0_fYkpaDI", "title": "I'm making Chess for idiots", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tN0_fYkpaDI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 100936, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yi_706TYb38", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi_706TYb38", "title": "Chess for idiots - Steam Next Fest: October 2023 Demo", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yi_706TYb38/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
