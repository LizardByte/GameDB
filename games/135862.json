Players must successfully manage their hunger, thirst, health, and troops or risk dying. Despite the looming threat of bears, wolves, and deserted soldiers the primary menace is other players due to the game being solely multiplayer. Combat is accomplished through primitive weapons, such as bows. In addition, AI-Controlled patrols will occasionally roam, These can be defeated with persistence. New Era features crafting, though initially limited until the discovery of specific items in the game's open world. To stay protected, players must build bases or join clans to improve their chance of survival. Raiding is a major aspect of New Era.", "summary": "Have you not ever dreamed of your own empire, your own city?
