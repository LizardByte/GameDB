One day, while you were watching TV, a rabbit(?) jumped out from the monitor and dragged you into the TV!\n\n\"Uwah! Where is this? What's going on!?\"\n\nAnd there before your eyes was the town full of monsters, \"Cool Cool Town\". Then the rabbit said,\n\n\"My name's Yusa. I brought you here to so that you can use your Flitz -I mean- dances to clean up this town.\"\n\nBut, you explain, you aren't the dancing type.\n\n\"Eh!? ... Well, I guess you can go back home through that TV. Huh? This TV's no good. Something seems to be wrong with it.\"\n\nUh oh! Seems like you can't go back to your own world. And then Yusa said,\n\n\"Listen to me! In this world, Flitz is the best way of doing things around here. So if you win the \"Flitzing Tournament\" and get the grand prize, you just might find a TV that'll send you back. Y'know, to your home. You do want to go home, right? Then it's settled! I've got a lot to teach you then, and we've got a lot of Flitzing to do!\"\n\nAnd just like that, together with Yusa, you have to aim to be the Flitzing champion to Cool Cool Town. L'see now, wonder what things will be waiting for you up ahead...", "summary": "Cool Cool Toon (\u30af\u30eb\u30af\u30eb\u30c8\u30a5\u30fc\u30f3?) is a rhythm-based music video game exclusive to the Dreamcast.
