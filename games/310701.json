The plot is simple; In an attempt to save their tv-show, Wayne and Garth decide to hold a pizza-thon (a charity show with a pizza-theme) in order to raise money. In order to be able to hold the pizza-thon Wayne and Garth must embark on several quests to collect items and hire people they need for the show. The adventure includes participating in babe-jeopardy, joining a biker's gang and baking pizza. The graphics are in 2D and the sound contains several samples from the movie.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/waynes-world--4", "videos": [{"id": 120881, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "olWMhMD97v8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olWMhMD97v8", "title": "Wayne's World gameplay (PC Game, 1993)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/olWMhMD97v8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
