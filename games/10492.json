The player has the opportunity to seize settlements, manage their resources and build various constructions and installations, enjoying the best of RTS elements.\nThe world of Konung is a unique and spacious fantasy land that combines parts of known history with classical myths and the legends of the Chronicles, including immortal heroes, magical artefacts and ancient sorcery. The whole world is shaped by three cultures on the verge of the second millennium: tribes of wild Slavic hunters, noble traders of the still-powerful Byzantine Empire, and fearless Viking warriors.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/konung-legends-of-the-north"}
