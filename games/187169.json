This world is a sandbox, and it's yours to investigate and explore as freely as you wish.\n\nThis isn't some linear narrative. At any point, you can accuse anyone of being the killer. Use the evidence that you've collected, and create a case that proves your suspect is the killer. The killer is somewhere.
