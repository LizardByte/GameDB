I'm a new developer, and my name is Ben. I'm from the United States. This is my first ever project, and I've spent nearly a year working on it while learning code/game design. In Hell's Abyss, your goal is to survive and accumulate as many points as possible. Limited ammunition and a non-regenerating health system will be your biggest obstacles, next to the killer zombies, when it comes to survival. There are multiple game modes (normal and Arcade Abyss, which is a top-down version of the game), which are guaranteed to give you many hours of gameplay! To anyone reading this, thanks for checking out my game, and I hope you enjoy it! \n \nDownload (use either link) (WINDOWS): \n \nhttps://chompiv.itch.io/hellsabyss \n \nhttps://gamejolt.com/games/HellsAbyss/312722 \n \nHow to install: \n \nExtract the downloaded winRAR file to a location (Your Documents Library is recommended).
