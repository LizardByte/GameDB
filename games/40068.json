The weird part came via the games many anachronistic (or downright bizarre) elements. The \u201cNative Americans\u201d lived in huts and hurled boomerangs (in the Wild West?). An even stranger enemy was a series of killer waterspouts (in the Wild West??). Strangest of all was a stage involving a series of islands populated by hopping-mad giant, yellow apes (in the Wild West???).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pioneer-balloon"}
