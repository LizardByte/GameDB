Chosen warriors, the Gaia Crusaders, are sent in by an ancient spirit to destroy the demons and rebuild the world. There is a lot of post apocalyptic imagery including ruined skyscrapers, vast desert wastelands and a ruined Statue of Liberty possibly inspired by Escape From New York or maybe Planet of The Apes. Acquiring seven pieces of The Demon's Tear can restore the world."}
