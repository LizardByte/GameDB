With each egg Sheepo collects, you gain the ability to shape-shift into that creature on contact and explore the deeper reaches of the planets sprawling environment.", "summary": "Sheepo is a quirky metroidvania platformer featuring a shape-shifting sheep-thing, who must traverse an uncharted planet in order to collect samples of each living species for an intergalactic species database.\n\nTo capture a creature, Sheepo must find their unhatched egg, which happen to be highly guarded by that species \"queen\" (aka, a boss.) With each egg Sheepo collects, you then gain the ability to transform into that creature on contact, and explore the deeper reaches of the planets sprawling environment\n\nSheepo is a metroidvania, but contains no standard combat. Instead, gameplay is based on platforming and exploration. With the collection of each creature, Sheepo is able to dig, fly, and teleport across an interconnected series of landscapes, uncovering hidden shrines, old ruins, and strange characters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sheepo", "videos": [{"id": 39451, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "LUIvq1Gp1oE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUIvq1Gp1oE", "title": "Sheepo Trailer- Metroidvania game coming out 2020", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LUIvq1Gp1oE/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 39450, "name": "Launch Trailer", "video_id": "CET8C1e0vEA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CET8C1e0vEA", "title": "SHEEPO Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CET8C1e0vEA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
