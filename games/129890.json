During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of commanding an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.\n\nIn this new version of XII, there are 12 different layouts of the license board based on different jobs you can give the characters, opening up a whole new level of complexity to add to the epic show-stopper.
