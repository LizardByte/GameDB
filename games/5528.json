Sims can contract an illness from a bite by the guinea pig included in this expansion. The Grim Reaper performs the final rites for deceased Sims. Living Sims can plead with the Reaper to save that particular Sim, which will result in three possible outcomes: death, resurrection, or a zombie.\n\nLivin' Large comes with many new objects, such as a crystal ball, electric guitar, chemistry set, and magic lamp. Some of the objects had new NPCs associated with them. For example, a genie appears from the magic lamp and a booth comes with a Servo.\n\nMultiple neighborhoods were introduced in this expansion pack, allowing the player to have up to five new ones.", "summary": "The Sims: Livin' Large, known as The Sims: Livin' It Up in Europe, is the first expansion pack for The Sims, adding new characters, careers, items, and features.
