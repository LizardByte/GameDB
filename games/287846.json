The kingdom\u2019s desire for conquest led to the creation of the Homunculi, machine-like artificial life forms prepared to execute the king\u2019s will. A recent resource-harvesting mission gone awry caused toxic vapors to emerge from underground, driving both man and machine to feral madness.\n\nAs the Homonculi devolve into dangerous creatures, guide Lilac \u2013- an \u201cAttuner\u201d with the power to purify those infected by the fumes \u2014 on a quest to save the kingdom. With the help of friendly machines and spirits who fight in Lilac\u2019s stead, fend off mechanized legions of lunging carcasses, cannonball-firing corpses and chainsaw-wielding goblins terrorizing the land.\n\nTurn foes into friends by exorcizing corruption from enemy bosses. Wield their powers to add 30 different abilities to Lilac\u2019s combat repertoire in an enhanced battle system where she can equip up to four special abilities at once. Improve Lilac\u2019s odds of surviving this hunt for lost memories by leveling up attack strength, HP, and armor.\n\nExplore the depths, heights and far corners of the kingdom for lore-filled relics. Collect and trade gold for upgraded items at the Blacksmith\u2019s storefront. Combine story fragments from the kingdom\u2019s fleeing inhabitants with Lilac\u2019s forgotten memories. Seek the truth in an atmospheric hand-drawn setting set to the soothing serenades of returning musical group Mili (Ghost in the Shell, Goblin Slayer) with a brand new original soundtrack available for purchase at launch.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ender-magnolia-bloom-in-the-mist", "videos": [{"id": 107596, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "YNySUAfvrg4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNySUAfvrg4", "title": "Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist - Nintendo Switch Trailer | Nintendo Direct 2024", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YNySUAfvrg4/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 113486, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "FePjstNDJuA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FePjstNDJuA", "title": "ENDER MAGNOLIA: Bloom in the Mist - Announcement Trailer -", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FePjstNDJuA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 125911, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "cvSf1pOO084", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvSf1pOO084", "title": "ENDER MAGNOLIA: Bloom in the Mist - Full Release Announcement Trailer -", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cvSf1pOO084/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
