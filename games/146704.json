Looks like it's time to explore and have some fun!\n\nThe products available in the local cooperatively run store are community-selected, trying to suit everybody's needs. You might not find everything you're expecting, but maybe there will be something that surprises you!\n\nCheck the information on product price tags to make sure you only pick fresh local produce, call your grandmother for a suggestion, or just go with whatever catches your eye! Just try not to feed the store cats off the shelves. Please. They are fed regularly.\nYou can get your ice cream and veggies in a few minutes to rush back home sooner \u2014 or stray away from the shelves and find yourself a part of a drawing class in the rooftop park, or an underground snowskate hangout! Don't be scared to check things out.\n\nLooks like your neighbor friend is also shopping today! But could you meet anybody else? What if it's a very (very) big crow, or a mysterious vent dweller? Maybe you will even have some meaningful mementos after your adventures!\n\nIn the end, grandma will always come to pick you up.
