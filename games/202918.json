That journey would be the stuff of legends, as the Bismarck would blow up the HMS Hood off Iceland, before being run down while making a break for France. However, that was only a small part of the bitter battles fought between the Kriegsmarine and the Royal Navy during the war.\n\nThe war between Germany and Great Britain would not only be marked with the thunder of battleship guns, but the explosion of torpedoes launched from Schnellboot against coastal traffic in the English Channel.\n\nIn Kriegsmarine you can control the German fleet in actions like the Battle of Denmark Strait, North Cape, or Narvik. You can raid Allied shipping in the Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic while they try to hunt you down and stop you. You can also control the Allied navies leading the hunt to send the Kriegsmarine to the bottom of the ocean floor. The choice is up to you!", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/naval-campaigns-kriegsmarine"}
