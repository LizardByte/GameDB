However, the old man realizes his weakened state won't stand up to another assault once Dalu returns from Hell. Shaman tells the fairy accompanying him (Gigi) to choose and revive a recently killed corpse that can fight against Dalu's minions and eventually gain enough power to defeat Dalu. After the introductory cinema, the player can choose to revive either a male (Troy) or female (Linda) who will take on enemies in different (and increasingly tougher) levels as the game progresses.
