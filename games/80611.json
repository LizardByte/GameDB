This includes Pearl herself. However, Pearl has managed to hold onto her human conscience, and she relates that she is not the only one this has happened to. As with every half-zombie Reggie will run into, she may be undead, but her heart is still human.\n\nYour role as Reggie is to be the girls\u2019 loot donkey and carry the things they find in dungeons.
