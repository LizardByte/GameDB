With a dark storyline, and an intensifying horror experience, the further you descend, Inside Depth 6 is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nThe Story\n\nThe government has decided to cement the entrance of the Purple Lavender mine after reporting over 117 deaths in the mine and an additional 24 missing. This does not make sense, why did so many people have to perish before action was taken to close down the mine, and how could so many sneak in when the mine is under constant surveillance?\n\nThe Purple Lavender mine is scheduled to be cemented in tomorrow morning. This gives me enough time to quickly get in, document the area, and get out. Something is being hidden, and I intend to find out what.\n\nHere is what I know so far about the Purple Lavender Mine:\n1) It is reported to have 6 depths, however, I do not believe this has been confirmed.\n2) There is a rumor, the deeper you descend, the more messed up things you will experience. Supposedly the pressure starts to mess with your head.\n3) The original miners 70 or so years ago are a mystery. Nobody knows who they were or who their families were.\n\nAll that is left to do is to set out and hope for the best\u2026\n\nInside Depth 6 is a short horror game with an estimated single completion time of ~60 min. As such, Inside Depth 6 does NOT offer save-game functionality. Depth 6 must be completed in a SINGLE SITTING.\n\nInside Depth 6 includes 3 endings coupled with all sorts of achievements, puzzles, and mysteries to solve. And as always, you cannot go wrong with a little Easter egg!\n\nCheck me out on Facebook for exclusive screenshots and early information on upcoming games :)\nhttps://www.facebook.com/turnvex/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6rvfGq7aAgs/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6rvfGq7aAgs/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6rvfGq7aAgs/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "New Upcoming Horror Game - Inside Depth 6", "description": "**Please note: Inside Depth 6's name has been CHANGED FROM Depth 6 to Inside Depth 6 as of May 28, 2021.**\n\nSteam page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1553320/Depth_6/\n\nInside Depth 6 places focus on creating an atmosphere of great terror, suspense, and anticipation for the player.
