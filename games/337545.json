The goal of the game is to save as many people as possible. How? By having them cross a street full of pirate cars that won't hesitate to run them over. The first crossing will be very simple; you'll see the cars stopped, but the more people you get across, the more the cars will increase their speed. The game ends when a pedestrian is hit. There will be a counter at the top left of the screen that adds up all the rescued people. There will also be a drum sound that increases with the speed of the cars, like a warning. There will also be a plane flying over the highway, but only as a decoration. After the game over, the game will restart, resetting everything, and this will be infinite. The keys to play are the two cursor keys, right and left.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rescued"}
