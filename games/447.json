In Medieval II, you were only given a tantalizing glimpse of South America, but in Kingdoms, vast tracts of land in both North and South America have been opened up for you to conquer. All-new factions from the New World are also now fully playable, including the Aztecs, Apaches, and Mayans.\nAlong with the new maps in the Britannia, Teutonic, Crusades, and New World Campaigns, there are 13 new factions to play, over 110 units to control, and 50 building types, adding up to 80 hours of new gameplay. Kingdoms also offers new multiplayer maps and hotseat multiplayer, a first for the Total War series, allowing you to play one-versus-one campaign games on the same computer.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/medieval-ii-total-war-kingdoms", "videos": [{"id": 387, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mJ4FMr_vmaE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ4FMr_vmaE", "title": "Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms - Britannia Campaign Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mJ4FMr_vmaE/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
