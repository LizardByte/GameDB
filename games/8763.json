From Japanese indie developer YOTSUBANE, AdventurePlanningService, this unique top-down shooter is a wild ride you won't want to miss out on.\n\nYour first step in Crimzon Clover: World Ignition is as simple as choosing how you want to play, and which powerful ship will be yours to command. Choose your mode from Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.\n\nBoost Mode will adjust the difficulty based on how proficient you are at devastating your enemies. Original is a basic mode designed for casual players. Unlimited turns each stage into an intense battlefield of bullets that only the most hardcore players will be able to survive. Time Attack pits you against the clock as you race to finish each stage with the best time. There are also different ways to play those modes, including Original, which is exactly the same as the arcade mode, for all the fans that already know the game. There is also a Novice setting with both Original Mode and Boost Mode available for beginners and casual players.\n\nEach of the three ships has their own style of standard firing and a unique appearance. The firing style is translated beautifully as you amp your way into Break Mode and Double Break Mode! As you blast through your foes in each stage you can collect stars that will raise your Break Meter, which allows you to wipe the screen with powerful bombs or, if you have the patience, blast off into Break Mode to add a huge boost to your firepower and let you rip through enemies with ease. That's not the extent of your strength though, as having a full Break Meter while in Break Mode will allow you to enter the ultimately destructive Double Break Mode. Watch your enemies crumble in fear as you turn the tide and fill the screen with your own hellacious rain of firepower! The best course of action is sometimes the hardest to wait for, as that Double Break Mode could be just the boost you need to help you tackle the insane bosses you'll face at the end of each stage! They may seem insurmountable, but their power is finite. Can you bring them to their knees?\n\nHaving a tough time on a specific stage? No worries. Hit up the Training screen to set up your own scenario using your choice of mode, ship, stage, and freely customize other variables to practice the fight for survival. Training doesn't seem like a bad idea after you see what the enemies are capable of. Can you pilot your craft through the bullet massacre the enemies have prepared for you?
