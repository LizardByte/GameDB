But her true reason for summoning the former hitokiri runs much deeper.\n\nPowerful foes from fifteen years past seek the dangerous mysteries stored within this tome. The Staten Union, responsible for a terrible civil war that almost tore Kurozaki apart, is back in its airspace, hellbent on revenge. The power hungry Minister of Defence Yuichi Ono uses his own son Jigen as a pawn, citing him as a means to an end. And the supremely arrogant self-styled \"Radiant Blademaster\" Eisen Rast is obsessed with defeating the skies' strongest.\n\nCan Rina and her friends avoid getting roped into a political conspiracy, one that stretches back 25,000 years? Can Rina avoid tapping into her dangerous \"White Demon\" persona?", "summary": "Veiled Skies is a \"cloudpunk\" jRPG that serves as a cornerstone for the Kuroverse, a series of games set in a vast world covering three skydoms.
