You \"control\" a car with no brakes which moves at either slow or fast speed through a maze containing dots. At the same time, one or more computer controlled cars run through the same maze in the opposite direction with the intention of ramming you. At each of four junctions in the maze, you have the option of changing lanes to avoid the oncoming cars. The objective is to pick up all the dots before the computer takes you out."}
