But things went strange that day: the land becomes dark and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm which turns most people into ghosts. Unlike the others, Link transforms into a wolf but is captured. A mysterious figure named Midna helps him break free, and with the aid of her magic, they set off to free the land from the shadows. Link must explore the vast land of Hyrule and uncover the mystery behind its plunge into darkness.", "summary": "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was initially developed with the Nintendo GameCube in mind, but ended up receiving a Wii port when it was released to promote the new console. This version has motion control compatibility for the sword and pointer controls for the menus, the bow and the boomerang. This version of the game has a completely inverted map and locations when comparing with the GameCube release. The change in layout was meant to adapt Link's usually left-handed design to right-handed people, given the motion controls.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess--1", "videos": [{"id": 36098, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KqUqxVKd5q0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqUqxVKd5q0", "title": "Legend Of Zelda:Twilight Princess Trailer November 1st 2006", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KqUqxVKd5q0/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
