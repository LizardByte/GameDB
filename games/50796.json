These creatures are typically concealed, and when your awareness meter flashes, you can utilize Illumination magic to expose them. John possesses abilities like Groundswell for attacking multiple enemies simultaneously and Shadowstride for stealthy maneuvers. In standard combat, you rely on fists and a holy shotgun, reserving magic use due to its need to regenerate. The game is structured into eight brief chapters, and progression involves interacting with other characters to follow Balthazar's trail. Beyond magic, combat, and stealth, there is also a segment where you perform exorcisms by replicating increasingly lengthy key patterns. Your advancements are automatically saved upon completing each section.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/constantine--2"}
