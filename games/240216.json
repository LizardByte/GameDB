Character abilities range in exploration and combat, from forensics to ESP powers. While the game's story has a set cast, your selection of team members is randomized upon starting a new game, and mission choices also get semi-randomized per playthrough.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yougekitai-jashin-koumaroku"}
