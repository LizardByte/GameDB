Drew's sidekick, crudely named Flux Wildly, is a drawn character voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Toonstruck also features scan-line compressed FMV and was also one of the first video games to include stock music from APM Music, notably the classic \"Spooky Scherzo\" by Sam Fonteyn and \"Lonely Hearts Club A\" by David Bell.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/toonstruck", "videos": [{"id": 28144, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "OIIXjulD3_w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIIXjulD3_w", "title": "Toonstruck - Trailer HQ", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OIIXjulD3_w/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
