The cement can't go directly into the mixers though. It must first go through four tanks which Mario can open by activating levers. His task is to go back and forth between all four spots and release the concrete before anything is spilled. Failure to do so will result in dumping of said concrete on the truckers waiting to make their delivery. To reach the different levers Mario must travel between floors via elevators, which must be taken carefully to avoid Mario falling off. Game B is a harder version of the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/marios-cement-factory-c64"}
