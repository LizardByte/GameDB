When you complete 10 levels, the 10th being a boss-fight you unlock a door to the next dungeon.\n\nHidden in the darkness of the dungeons are shops, casinos and elevators. And if you search the dungeons carefully, you might find secret rooms that unlock more of the story, and free new adventurers that you can play as in your next game. Let this great combination of a platformer and a roguelike RPG suck you into its multi-leveled randomly-generated dungeon.
