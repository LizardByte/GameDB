RoboCop 3 is a 1993 game published by Ocean. It is based on the movie of the same name (I make a point of saying: the movie of Robocop 3 is a very crap: Everything started getting bad because Peter Weller (who played Alex Murphy/RoboCop) refused to work in production of movie. The actress Nancy Allen (who played Officer Lewis) agreed to participate only if her character dies early in the film because they wanted to be part of the shoot without the presence of Weller. Add to that idiotic ideas like robot ninja who practices meditation and have an idea of why I hated the third film). \n\nThe NES edition of RoboCop 3 is a traditional single-player, side-scrolling game with a storyline and background that loosely follows the film. A unique, notable feature is the fact that each of RoboCop's body parts has a separate damage rating. Heavily damaged parts can result in \"malfunctions,\" such as erratic firing (if the arm holding the weapon is damaged) or difficulty walking (if legs are damaged). Each level have the opportunity to repair RoboCop's parts.\n\nThe graphics are much better than previous versions, but this game is too short and does not have the same charisma of the first version and has no end credits with the names of those who made the game. The only thing memorable is the music of the input screen. Just this intro song!\n\nStage 1: 01:21\nStage 2: 04:23\nStage 3: 09:19\nStage 4: 11:53\nFinal Stage: 14:05 -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7FILe8utwVU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7FILe8utwVU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7FILe8utwVU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "NES Longplay [403] RoboCop 3", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: xRavenXP\n\nLongplay of game Robocop 3, from NES!
