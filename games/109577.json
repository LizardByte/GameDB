The 2.02 update, released in August 2020, added two hidden characters, Rafisol and Paprisu, each of whom can be selected by inputting a specific button combination while selecting character.\n\nThe game also allows players to personalize their in-game profile image, with over a hundred characters to choose from both the main game series and Puyopuyo!! Quest, as well as a selection of backgrounds and borders, all of which seem to be carried over from Puyopuyo!! Quest.", "summary": "Easy to learn, tough to master!
