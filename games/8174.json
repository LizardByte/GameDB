Battles are initiated similarly to Chrono Trigger, where combat begins upon the player directing the character into an enemy in the world map. Once initiated, combat consists of a turn based battle system similar to Final Fantasy X. The game will also have airship battles, similar to Skies of Arcadia. \n \nExploration of the overworld map will also be a major aspect of gameplay, with the player being able to explore on foot similarly to Final Fantasy VII, and by airship similarly to Skies of Arcadia.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
