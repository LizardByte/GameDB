Tamsoft delivers the tale of a Riho; a Bikini model who becomes a giant after being stung by some sort of alien jellyfish. You then are given the task of measuring her dimensions, chasing and then bringing her back down to size.\n\nYou take on the role of a Helicopter, Jet and Tank while Riho rampages around Japan causing destruction and mayhem. Gameplay varies from measuring Riho, chasing her down a highway and protecting her sleeping form from alien squids while flying over the ocean.\n\nAs this is a Simple 2000 game, Demolition Girl is short and simple. The controls for each vehicle are similar and the graphical style is more or less consistent with other Tamsoft titles in the Simple 2000 series.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/demolition-girl"}
