Some even started a festival and made a fuss.\nBut not long after, an event occurred that put a horrific damper on their buoyant moods. From the springs that they drank from, the beautiful clear streams, the hot springs at rest spots... from every location it possibly could, the black water began to gush out.", "summary": "Touhou Gouyoku Ibun ~ Suibotsushita Chinshuu Jigoku is the 17.5th installment of the Touhou Project, created by Team Shanghai Alice, with Twilight Frontier's collaboration.
