The evil mutant Apocalypse has created an army of evil X-men clones. The only thing standing in his way is you, a cyborg created by Magneto with the ability to morph your arms into a variety of devastating weapons.\n\nIn the single-player game, you battle clones of twelve X-Men across two episodes building up to a final confrontation with Apocalypse. The X-Men are realistically modeled complete with their mutant powers (the Wolverine clone, for example, will not stay down, imitating the original). In multiplayer game, you can take on the role of any of the X-Men for mutant deathmatch action in five original maps including the X-Men mansion.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}]}
