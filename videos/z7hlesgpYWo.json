{"id": "z7hlesgpYWo", "snippet": {"title": "[SMBX-38A] The Legend of Darkness Newest Teaser Trailer", "description": "This is the newest teaser trailer for The Legend of Darkness, a SMBX-38A project of Hel Studio.\nThe Legend of Darkness is a SMBX-38A episode made by Hel studio,  whose members are mostly from China.\nThis project of this episode was originally launched by me in summer 2015, and this episode has only been finished the former 2 chapters before. Because I was busy after starting high school in summer 2017, and members in the studio also had their own affairs to deal with, the progress of this project was very slow. During this time, Slash-18 updated many stuffs in this episode.\nLast year, because we're dissatisfied with the levels we made years ago, we decided that we would make levels of this episode from scratch. And in the last summer, we released the first trailer of this project. However, because I was prepared to take\u00a0part\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0entrance\u00a0exams\u00a0for\u00a0postgraduate\u00a0schools, and there's a lack of manpower in the team, there was no big update of this project since the first trailer's release. And this year I will study hard to prepare to the\u00a0entrance\u00a0exams\u00a0for\u00a0postgraduate\u00a0schools, so there may be not many news about this project in this year. In this case, I made this new trailer to show something we were working on to you.\nMost of playable levels in the first chapter of this project has been finished so far. However, because we lack GFX designers, there's still many works remaining to be done. And because the previous version of world map is too complex for World 1, we finally decided to remake a more simple and concise one, as shown in this trailer. As for demo\u2026\u2026 If there's no other people who's willing to take over the work in this team, probably no demo playable this year. But what if\u2026\u2026?
