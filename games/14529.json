Plotwise, the game is identical to the original.\n\nThe game is a side-scroller with the character walking slowly. Dirk can walk, crawl, or jump forward, and he has an array of weapons that he can discover and use to dispose of enemies. The controller layout is reversed from other mainstream NES titles, with Select functioning as the Pause-button while Start is used for the Candle object (which helps reveal hidden weapons). Also, B is used for jumping, and A for attacking (the input of the A & B buttons is almost always the opposite in similar NES games).\n\nTwo different versions were released later, first for the Famicom, with major improvements on playability and speed, and a second one for PAL regions, expanding upon the Famicom version with new enemies and cutscenes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragons-lair--1", "videos": [{"id": 44535, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "6q_9YKQtXEQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q_9YKQtXEQ", "title": "Dragon's Lair (NES) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6q_9YKQtXEQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
