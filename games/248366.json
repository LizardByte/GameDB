It features a completely brand-new map, new level design, new graphics, and even ports of Metroid Fusion music, courtesy of Amilgi. Much like the earlier Metroid Blue, you can also combine the Ice and Wave beam here and always respawn with full health. The paths are varied, and you have multiple ways to get through the base.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/metroid-fused-facility"}
