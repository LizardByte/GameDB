It adds a two player mode and a few more options, the game's most notable feature is its Jazz Fusion soundtrack.\"\nA very cool feature of this game is that your car is damaged in every beat you suffer, and so that it goes back to normal state only by paying a little money later to repair it.\nLamborghini: American Challenge is quite difficult and very time consuming, which generates a good competition.
