It is the seventh game in the Colin McRae Rally series, the first game in the McRae series since McRae's death in 2007 and the last to feature his name in the title.\n\nIt features Ken Block, Travis Pastrana, Tanner Foust, Dave Mirra and Mohammed ben Sulayem. The game includes many new race-events, including stadium events. Along with the player, an RV travels from one event to another, and serves as \"headquarters\" for the player. It features a roster of contemporary off-road events, taking players to diverse and challenging real-world environments. The game takes place across Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The game includes five different event types, plus three more \"special\" game modes. The World Tour mode sees players competing in multi-car and solo races at new locations, and also includes a new multiplayer mode. The sequel Dirt 3 was released in 2011.\n\n\n\n\nUsed a dev build - DeSmuME 0.9.12 git#c52ee038\n\nEnhanced graphics with emulator DeSmuME.\n- recording sw Nvidia Share.\n- some games can have graphical issues, lags and other problems...\n\n\n DeSmuME download:\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/zeromus/desmume/build/artifacts\n\n\nPC specs:\nCPU - Intel Core i7 8700K @ 5.0 Ghz\nRAM - G.SKILL 32GB DDR4 3600MHz CL16\nGPU - GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GAMING OC 8G\nOS - Windows 10 64bit\n\n\n\n::::: Rate, Comment & Subscribe :::::", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tpWul5-PtUw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tpWul5-PtUw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tpWul5-PtUw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tpWul5-PtUw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tpWul5-PtUw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Colin McRae: Dirt 2 - Nintendo DS Gameplay High Resolution (DeSmuME)", "description": "Colin McRae: Dirt 2 - Nintendo DS Gameplay High Resolution (DeSmuME)\n\nSubscribe for more videos: https://goo.gl/rysf1n\nJohnGodgamesHD Channel subscribe: https://goo.gl/W9f1n4\nVisit us at http://www.godgames-world.com for more\n\n\nColin McRae: Dirt 2 is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters in 2009, first for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii and Xbox 360, and then later for PC platforms (Windows, OS X).
