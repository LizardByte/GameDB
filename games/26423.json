The creak and groan of living wood echoes from its dim interior, the canopy seems to absorb all light, and half-seen spirits dart between the twilit bowers. To enter is to place your fate in their hands.\n\nWithin dwell the Asrai, the Wood Elves. Though they hail originally from Ulthuan to the west as all Elves do, they spurn the sanctimonious arrogance of the Asur, the High Elves, and the murderous decadence of the Druchii or Dark Elves. The Asrai consider themselves to be the only true Elves left in the world, as they embrace all aspects of their nature \u2013 both light and dark \u2013 and for thousands of years, they have lived in harmony with the sentient forest.\n\nThe Asrai share the wilds of Athel Loren with its spirits and protectors: the Dryads, Branchwraiths and the ancient guardian Treemen. They adopt its steeds, hawks and Great Eagles for their warhosts, and even rare Forest Dragons may deign to join them when the need is dire. Peerless archers and riders, the Wood Elves pay fealty to the demigod Orion, who dies in flame each midwinter, only to be reborn into thunderous life in spring beneath The Oak of Ages.\n\nWild, lithe, and utterly ruthless in defence of their land, only a fool would goad the Wood Elves and their spirited allies to conflict. For those who witness the awesome spectacle of an Asrai host marching out of the woodlands on a Wild Hunt, it is likely the last thing they will ever see.", "summary": "Realm of The Wood Elves is a campaign pack DLC, adding the Wood Elves as a playable faction in The Old World and Mortal Empires campaigns. The Wood Elves have two main playable factions Wood Elves led by Orion and Argwylon led by Durthu which differ slightly in gameplay. The DLC also adds a special mini-campaign to Total War: Warhammer called The Season of Revelation.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 17593, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hoiks2rQa9o"}]}
