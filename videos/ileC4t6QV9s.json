While wandering the wastes, he happens upon South Pass, a town harassed by the Bushwhackers - a murderous gang of former Confederates seeking to bring the South to rise again. The choice he makes there will alter the fate of the West for all time...\n\nThis classic, turn-based JRPG is a throwback to classics of it's genre during the golden age of the late SNES/early PSX era, but with a western touch. Drawing much inspiration from games such as Wild Arms and Dragon Quest 8, Trailblazer promises to be story and character rich, with intuitive, but deep combat mechanics. Plenty of customization options allows you to grow your characters in your own way, and create your own unique playstyle.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ileC4t6QV9s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ileC4t6QV9s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ileC4t6QV9s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ileC4t6QV9s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Trailblazer - Demo Available Now!", "description": "Download: https://mf-willblack.itch.io/trailblazer\nTrailer recorded and edited by Oath Game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCavX5xnSc25-wvqWDCTDCBg\nMusic by Wingless Seraph \nhttps://wingless-seraph.net/en/\n\nThe West Has Never Been More Wild!\n\nWelcome to the world of Trailblazer, a steampunk Wild West RPG that is currently and will always be free to play!\n\nFollow the story of Jean Smith, a drifter who roams the frontier in search of revenge for the death of his mentor.
