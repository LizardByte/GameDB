Your task is to survive whatever the islands throw at you, lack of food, thirst, the dangers that lurk in the waters and the natural elements!\n\nI wanted to create something that gives players a hardcore survival challenge but at the same time something a little different. I am a firm believer that games are one of the best forms of \u2018escapism\u2019, a way to shut off from the real-world. So along with the survival elements you will also have the ability to create a new home for yourself on your island!\n\nThe challenge is not just one of escape but trying to make a new life for yourself, living off the islands resources and building your own home.", "themes": [{"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shimmer", "videos": [{"id": 21227, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "M78LOHOlWM4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78LOHOlWM4", "title": "Become marooned on a desert island", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M78LOHOlWM4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
