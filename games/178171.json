Rosen Tabi Sangi Tetsudou Hen series is where you can enjoy driving and traveling on fascinating local lines, the setting is the Sangi Railway Hokusei Line, which runs in Mie Prefecture. The Hokusei Line has an extremely rare feature that the track gauge is narrow which is unique in Japan. Because the track width is narrower than the width of both arms spread, it is necessary to slow down specially on the curves. You can enjoy the train driving experience by running at low speed and enjoy the beautiful scenery."}
