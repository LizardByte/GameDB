It's an emotional short story that tells the experiences of a man throughout his life. The topic of the Game Jam was: \"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are\", and we had 48 hours to complete it.\n\nWe feel the main storytelling mechanic is unique and has not been tried before. It encompasses a combination of writing \"blindly\", backing off, and reading what you just wrote to make sense of the picture and situation the player is seeing. We also feel that the way we are telling the story, through main references on his life, is something few games have done before.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/i-am-a-brave-knight"}
