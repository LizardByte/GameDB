Gordon was immediately dispatched by Dr. Kleiner and Dr. Eli Vance to locate the buggy and return the missing maps.\n\nSetting: The entire modification is set at night on a small, rocky island off the coast of City 17. Rugged terrain, abandon structures, and multiple combine outposts will make escaping this island hell more than just a walk in the park.\n\nHis plan: Gordon surrenders to the combine so he could be transported to the facility where the buggy was left for scrap. Upon his surrender, he found himself in a small prison facility on the rocky island, waiting for a visit from Dr. Wallace Breen who would read his sentence personally. A familiar face woke him from his deep sedation\u2026\n\nHis mission: Locate the buggy and find a way to return to City 17 with the stolen maps.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/offshore", "videos": [{"id": 89686, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "7iqY97ZTQ0s", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iqY97ZTQ0s", "title": "Half-Life 2 Complete Mod Walkthrough - Offshore", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7iqY97ZTQ0s/sddefault.jpg"}]}
