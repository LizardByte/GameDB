Immerse yourself in a bright and colorful world as you build circuits in 3D from a first-person perspective. Learn about the magic and wonder of digital logic, and grow your skills as you build machines of increasing complexity and grandeur.\n\nKey Features\n\n* Digital Logic - Logic World is a simulation of digital circuits, running on the same principles as real world computer chips.\n* Performance - Build massive circuits and simulate them at thousands of updates per second, all without lag.\n* Building - Advanced building mechanics help you quickly move a design from your brain into the game world.\n* Multiplayer - Logic World is built from the ground up for collaborative multiplayer. The game comes with standalone self-hostable server software so you can build, invent, and learn with your friends.\n\nA growing platform\n\nThe core of Logic World is there, and it's quite awesome, but we are brimming with ideas to make it even better. Throughout Early Access, and beyond the 1.0 release, we'll be constantly updating the game with new features and expanded gameplay.\n\n=================\n\nMusic is Endless Curiosity by Markku Wainman, from the Logic World Original Soundtrack.\n\nThank you to the following beta testers for their help with the video.
