Hand and Foot is compelling card game where each player is dealt two decks of cards: one 'hand' and one 'foot'. The object of the game is to build melds of cards to form 'books' which are groups of seven or more cards, score as many points as possible, and play all of the cards in your hand and foot decks as quickly as possible. The best Hand and Foot players are those who can accumulate large point totals and quickly go out which traps the other players with cards in their hands and thus leaves them with negative points.\n\nIf you enjoy card games such as Canasta, Gin Rummy, or Hearts, than you will absolutely be blown away by the uniquely challenging Hand and Foot!
