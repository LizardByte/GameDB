The player has five days (eight hours each) to solve a case.\n\nRanda Tasker, the wife of a local business man, has been kidnapped. With the help of a PDA and your assistant detective John Night Sky, you have to find clues and interview suspects and witnesses. Since there is not enough time to interrogate them all, choices must be made.\n\nThe game's interface is point-and-click. The locations you visit are photograph stills and the game is interspersed with Full Motion Video (FMV) movies. The main screen shows a calendar which shows the number of days you have left, a sun dial showing the number of hours left today and an icon for your PDA. Within the PDA there are icons for e-mail, suspects and evidence.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/santa-fe-mysteries-sacred-ground"}
