The universe is going dark and it's up to you Konki, Stellar Guardian, to put things right. Dr. Dark Matter and his roving band of space thieves have stolen many of the Constellation Stones that make up the heavens. Some stones have been sold to unscrupulous space types while others were lost during the getaway. Whatever the situation, you must come through. Suit-up, power-up, and live up to the task at hand. Recover the lost Constellation Stones and once again bring light to the night sky.\n\nGuide Konki on timed and collection based missions through 20 stages of varying mazes and obstacles, spanning treacherous terrains including asteroid belts, planetary rings, astro-caves, and large space stations. Hazards surround your every move - enemy fire, asteroids, black holes, tight corridors - while ship upgrades tempt you at every turn.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/evasive-space"}
