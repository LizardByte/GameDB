Jerry Randolph, a female reporter working for the Chicago newspaper \"Daily Casablanca\", finds a diary belonging to her high school friend May Elgar, who has disappeared several years ago under mysterious circumstances.

It is a text adventure with graphics, in which the player types text commands to interact with the environment. Several useful commands (including Look, Search, Take and Knock) can be accessed directly through function keys. Limited navigation between screens can be performed with directional arrows.
