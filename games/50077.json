Even the scrolling runs perfectly smooth, and there are real transparency effects, which are not too common with DOS games overall. \n \nAlthough not a sequel per se, the game soon evokes memories of lazenca, not only because the player once again takes place in a mecha. Instead of having to chose between two models, though, the machine in SAF unites the agility of the Ripple with the weapons and jetpacks of the Cyber-Troll and for good measure throws in the left & right fire buttons of the shmup sequences in lazenca. Weapons can be upgraded in two levels, and filling the upgrade meter above that unleashes a devastating special attack particular to that weapon. During the first four stages weapons get gradually unlocked. After the initial machine gun follow a frame thrower, a grenade launcher and a laser cannon.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
