Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him and most of the other Conduits. The U.S. government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world's remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative \"Bioterrorists \". The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Mimicry, allowing him to copy the powers of any Conduit he comes into contact with. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry \"Hank\" Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail \"Fetch\" Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex-junkie who uses her Neon powers to hunt down illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video game addict who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.\n\nafter Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages to pull the third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, inadvertently absorbing his smoke powers in the process. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank in an effort to figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or say nothing. Regardless of Delsin's choice, Augustine knocks him out before moving on to the other tribe members.\n\nDelsin awakens a week later and discovers that Augustine has tortured the rest of the tribe in an unsuccessful bid to gain information. However, she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies, including their leader Betty (Karen Austin). Reggie, who was spared from the torture, learns that the only way to remove the shards is to use Augustine's power on them. Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine's powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie's help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as \"freaks\", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them.", "summary": "This edition, when pre-ordered, also comes with the exclusive Cole's Legacy.\n\nCole's Legacy is an expansion pack for Infamous: Second Son which was initially available only by pre-ordering the game (For US Customers), or purchasing the Special Edition (All other Countries).\n\nThe pack contains missions uncovering the events which happened during the seven year time span between the activation of the RFI in Infamous 2 and the storyline of Infamous: Second Son. This is the only time when Zeke Dunbar makes a cameo appearance and Dr. Sebastian Wolfe's brother Raymond Wolfe appears in a cameo as well.\n\nAfter completion of Cole's Legacy, the Cole's original bike courier jacket is awarded for in-game use. The design of the jacket is slightly different compared to the first two games of the series. In this game, the design of the jacket shows some tears in the front and the back of the jacket and rather than the yellow pads being sewed up on top of the black jacket, the yellow and the black are sewn together imitating as a jacket pad-less. There are also some more minor changes such as the zipper on the jacket is also revealed due to Delsin wearing it without zipping it up and covering it, and also small changes to the collar area of the jacket.\n\nSince June 25, 2014, European Infamous: Second Son players can now access the Cole\u2019s Legacy\u2019 DLC from the PlayStation Store", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 49258, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MlNfJvFnzc8"}]}
