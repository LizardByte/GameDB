Well the Earth is in grave danger, somewhere just beyond our planet\u2019s outer atmosphere five giant asteroids are heading on a deadly collision course with the planet. It\u2019s up to you, the player, to command a network of laser powered rockets to try and blast the asteroids into a harmless meteor shower before they hit the Earth.\n\nThe first Play Card placed is used as the Arena card and draws the level out, then the puzzles use up to 5 Play Cards to place the three types of objects in the game; Reflectors, Splitters and Color Filters. There have been other laser and light based games before, but none of them have let you see the game world and play it on your table top, something that can only be done with the PS Vita.", "videos": [{"id": 51865, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "BTbYd_hn-J8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTbYd_hn-J8", "title": "PulzAR - PS Vita (PEGI)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BTbYd_hn-J8/sddefault.jpg"}]}
