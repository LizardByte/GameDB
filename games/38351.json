The player can interrupt the action at any time to command their units to use special moves, otherwise units will march towards enemies and attempt to cut them down with regular attacks. Players can also customize their group on the camp screen between fights, organizing their equipment and setting their AI to heal themselves once they hit a health percentage threshold. Imaginative Technology Land developed Bounty Sword and the game was published in Japan by Pioneer LDC on September 8, 1995. The game was later followed by two other titles on the Sony PlayStation, a remake in 1997 called Bounty Sword First and a sequel in 1998 called Bounty Sword: Double Edge.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bounty-sword", "collections": [{"id": 3086, "name": "Bounty Sword"}]}
