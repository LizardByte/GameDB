I wondered why there were so many Christmas movies to watch during the holiday season, but so few games to play to get you into the Christmas spirit. I fondly remembered my 2 brothers and I huddling around a single keyboard together and playing the SRB2 (it's a fan game) time-limited Christmas mode every year, and decided to jam out the very first SantaCorps game in about 3 days. Ever since then, I've tried to make it a tradition to set time aside each year to make a joyful game for free/cheap, both for us to practice new skills and techniques, and to simply have fun with the process of making something purely out of our love for video games. \n\nLater in 2021, Seth and I set out to make the game that sits in front of you now, but due to the scope we had in mind and us just having too much on our plates at the time, we couldn't swing it back then. It's bugged me ever since, and mentioning SantaCorps 4 to tick me off became something of an in-joke within the team. Fast forward to now: we spun back, started over from scratch with our newfound experience and tooling, and set out to make the biggest, baddest, most off-the-wall SantaCorps yet. It turned out even better than I hoped when I first designed it, and I'm super grateful to my brothers and my team for not only humoring me, but giving it their all. I hope this game brightens your day, and reminds you of the magic in your own heart. Enjoy :) \n\n-E", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DozlL4_A7QA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DozlL4_A7QA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DozlL4_A7QA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DozlL4_A7QA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "SantaCorps 4 - Release Trailer!", "description": "Get it now at virtuosoofficial.itch.io/santacorps-4\n----\nArmed with their merry mysticism, magical machines,  and maybe a little bit of luck, it's up to YOU to make a miracle this holiday season...and beyond!\n\nDon the fabled white and red solo or with up to 3 friends as you dash your way through this fast-paced holiday frenzy!\n---\nDirected by Ethan Redd.
