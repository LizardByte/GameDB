Players must destroy colored blocks by guiding an Energy Ball around the screen using a spaceship called a VAUS. The game features a host of new modes and settings which radically alter the gameplay experience: \"Arcade Mode\" consists of 61 Rounds divided into left and right versions with two types of boss characters appearing in the last Round; \"VS Mode\" lets players face off against a friend or the CPU; and the unfailingly frantic \"Time Mode\" challenges players to clear Rounds within a strict time limit. Factor in the subtle differences arising from the choice of \u201cLives\u201d or \u201cBarrier\u201d rules, along with a plethora of exciting items, and it\u2019s clear you\u2019re in for hours and hours of blockbusting fun!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/arkanoid-plus"}
