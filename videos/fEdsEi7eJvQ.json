The goal is to produce a game that's co-op friendly and highly replayable without sacrificing tight, satisfying action-platformer gameplay. It's targeting Windows first with plans to port to Mac/Linux post-release. (Maybe even consoles!)\n\nReplayability is one of our core goals with 20XX; keeping the experience fresh is important to us. Choose from two completely different characters with their own playstyles. Play through entirely different levels every time you play -- the challenge set constantly shifts and you'll have to adapt to whatever the game throws at you. \n\n20XX's co-op currently supports up to 2 players, either on the same machine or online via Steam.\n\n20XX also has seeded Daily Challenges, so you can see how you stack up against your friends!\n\nIt's available on Steam Early Access now -- entering Beta on September 15, 2015! \n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/322110\n\nThanks for watching!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fEdsEi7eJvQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fEdsEi7eJvQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fEdsEi7eJvQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fEdsEi7eJvQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fEdsEi7eJvQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "20XX Beta Trailer", "description": "http://store.steampowered.com/app/322110\n\n20XX is an action-platformer built to play like Mega Man X and replay like your favorite roguelikes.
