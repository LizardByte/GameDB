This client aims to provide a better-than-vanilla experience, with many quality-of-life features which are designed with gameplay enhancements in mind. The original game on Steam did not have a huge player base and is considered a forgotten Call of Duty. Also, the original game has so many game-breaking features that it is hard to play the original experience without facing a issue every so often.\n\nWith H1-Mod, new features include, but are not limited to: unlocked field of view adjustment, HUD safe area adjustment, detailed sensitivity adjustment, multiple fullbright modes, disabling of broken shader caching, unlocking all cosmetics, stat changing, uncapped max FPS, and a dedicated server browser.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/h1-mod"}
