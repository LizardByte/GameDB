The object is to rotate the sections of the cube to move the colored squares so that each side of the cube contains only squares of the same color. As you might expect, it's a bit more difficult to play on a computer screen, since the game requires frequent rotation of the cube, also there is only keyboard control. So in order to have success at this game, you'll need good spatial conceptual abilities as well as a good memory and a lot of patience.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cube--9"}
