You can choose from eight fighters based on real-world kickboxers, and then experience the brutal nature of the sport in a Single-Player match, or try to become champion in a Tournament. If you're looking for a different kind of challenge, pick a team of boxers, and beat up the opposition in the Team Challenge mode. If your friends challenge your dominance of the ring, put them in their place with a match in the Versus mode. No matter what mode you play, motion-captured animation makes all the characters move realistically. If you are good enough, you can unlock a video that shows how the motion-capture work was done. Do you have the stamina to become the best of the best in K-1 THE ARENA FIGHTERS?", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/k-1-the-arena-fighters", "videos": [{"id": 63480, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "G00NXmaUgog"}, {"id": 63811, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "Xa424xuSK4k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa424xuSK4k", "title": "K-1 The Arena Fighters (PS1) - ANDY HUG Playthrough Longplay Gameplay - 1080p", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xa424xuSK4k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
