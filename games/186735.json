Though it seemingly has very few differences from the original game (such as the title screen), the game is extremely rare and is quite possibly the most expensive Super Famicom game. Equally rare is the promotional clock in the style of the game cartridge to promote the use of the Real Time Clock (RTC) in-game. They removed one building and event from the original game. In one of the towns, they replaced it with the Kodansha office. This version adds an additional character and item that doesn't exist in the original.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tengai-makyou-zero-shonen-jump-no-shou", "collections": [{"id": 1995, "name": "Far East Of Eden"}]}
