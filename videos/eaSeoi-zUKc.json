{"id": "eaSeoi-zUKc", "snippet": {"title": "Brian Jack's Superstar Challenge (C64 Longplay)", "description": "Released mid-1985 by Martech for \u00a38.95.\n\nBrian Jack's Superstar Challenge comprises 8 events. If you score well enough then a star (*) is awarded for the respective event. Achieving 8 stars allows you to complete against Brian on the second loop. Defeating Brian and acquiring 8 further stars is the Superstar Challenge....\n\nThe events are:\n\nCanoeing:  Rhythmically waggle the joystick left and right, then frenetically waggle as speed builds up!\n\nBoar Shoot:  Use joystick to move crosshair. Fire to shoot crossbow.\n\n100m Running:  Rhythmically waggle the joystick left and right, then frenetically waggle as speed builds up!\n\nSquat Thrusts:  Tap joystick right 3 times, then left 3 times. Repeat for 72 seconds (even though timer shows 60 seconds)!\n\nSwimming:  Rhythmically waggle the joystick left and right, then frenetically waggle as speed builds up. You must also press fire to breathe when the sound is heard.\n\nArm Dips:  Press fire to begin lowering yourself. Once sufficiently lowered, waggle joystick to push yourself back up. Repeat for 145 seconds (even though timer shows 60 seconds). If you lower yourself too far then you'll fall off and the event ends. Seriously punishing!\n\nFootball:  Waggle joystick to build speed (not too fast), weave around the cones, then choose a direction to beat the goalie. There were several times the goalie dived the right way, but still didn't save it. No idea why, though not complaining!\n\nCycling:  Rhythmically waggle the joystick left and right, then frenetically waggle as speed builds up!\n\nThe game was well received in Zzap with 79%. I think that was slightly overrated as the events aren't that exciting, especially compared against Track & Field, Hyper Sports, and the Epyx releases around that same time period. Probably better competing against a friend in 2 player mode.\n\nSave states were used at the end of some levels.\n\nCoders:  H.G.
