This installment features a brand-new physics engine, including 3D collision and gravity, building, the beginning stages of mining, inventory management, and many more details all painstakingly programmed in 6502 Assembly for the Commander X16 system.

I share some tips and tricks in this video that go over exactly how I managed to pull off what at first seem like an impossible programming task: create an interactive 3D world that you can climb around, build bridges in, and be able to create anything you can think of. From laying out the inventory in memory, to saving CPU cycles by re-drawing only highly calculated sections of the screen, this update has it all.\n\nPlay the alpha release here at: https://notin.tokyo/8BB\n\nJoin the conversation: https://www.reddit.com/r/inkboxAthenaeum/\n\nOther resources:\nMinecraft tutorial footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvYgeixD69w\n\nHave a suggestion or feedback: inkbox@notin.tokyo", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SNbM5vWfg4g/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SNbM5vWfg4g/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SNbM5vWfg4g/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SNbM5vWfg4g/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SNbM5vWfg4g/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "8-Bit Minecraft Pt. 2: There's A Reason This Doesn't Exist", "description": "The first 100 people to use code INKBOX at the link below will get 60% off of\n Incogni: https://incogni.com/inkbox\n\nThe progress on creating a crafting and mining game continues, now with a new release title: 8-Bit Blocks.
