So what do we have here today? This is essentially a \"very\" obscure game that is similar to Sega Saturn's already obscure \"Waku Waku Monster\" game developed by Altron. What do they both have in common? They're both late releases for their respective systems (\"Waku Waku Monster\" = 1998, \"Breed Master\" = 2002), they're both puzzle games (one is a drop-style, the other bears similarities to \"Panel de Pon\" / aka \"Tetris Attack\"), and they both have a monster-breeding aspect as the crux of their gameplay. Developed by Office Create (who have been around for a while but were relatively unknown until they had one breakout series: the \"Mama\" franchise, such as \"Cooking Mama\", \"Crafting Mama\", etc.), this game has a few interesting differences from WWM that, while well-intentioned, don't pan out like one would hope.\n\nLet's start with what I feel to be the good stuff; Breed Master actually has a simple backstory and plot to follow that is fully voiced. As the hero of the story, Chrome, you are a member of the \"Breed Lovers Academy\", a school which uses crystals and monster eggs to breed monsters and raise them for a variety of purposes (from simply being pets to fighting for entertainment to aiding civilized society or even nefarious acts). Chrome encounters a variety of eccentric characters while questing to become a full-fledged breeder and the best in class, and already shows plenty of raw potential. As the player, you will progress naturally as the player starts out with an egg and can raise it as they see fit... in theory anyway.\n\nMechanically, the game is very similar to Panel De Pon / Tetris Attack-- you can manually raise your stack and you have a cursor you can position anywhere to swap drops at your leisure to match four or more and eliminate them from the playing field. While the game gets brownie points just for attempting to emulate one of my favorite puzzle games of all time, there's a few other cool twists to be found. One is that when you make a pair, it doesn't just disappear right away; there is a five second delay that allows you to link together as many other pairs as possible before the timer runs out, and everything after the initiation detonates automatically (such as falling objects that drop to make another pair). Another cool twist is you can cancel the timer on your own which is an advanced technique if you're just trying to make some space quickly without consideration for their location (of course, you can use it for chaining too). This allows the player to have more control over an offensive or defensive playing style.\n\nOf course, the biggest factor to the game is the monster breeding aspect... while there are a few missed opportunities here, its implementation is considerably deeper than in \"Waku Waku Monster\" (not that it's that deep to begin with) and something I can look at and, at the very least, appreciate what they were \"trying\" to do. Whereas WWM has a mostly superficial aspect to breeding monsters, BM actually puts some meat on the core idea's bones. Players have four colors they can eliminate from the playing field which correspond to different elements, and every elimination builds proficiency in that element. After enough eliminations, it will level up, and once certain milestones are reached, a special block will appear that allows your monster to evolve when paired. Each evolution varies in its strength, defense, max HP, stamina and even what special skill they have. In the beginning, you won't have any skills, but later forms can match special green square tiles to execute special abilities.\n\nThis is, however, a double-edged sword. There is a certain lack of balance between different forms as some have incredibly OP abilities or tank-like defense, and the game's A.I. does not leave much room to play in a way that caters to prioritizing certain drops to discover different evolutionary forms... you're constantly on the offensive, especially during the later stages, and unlike a normal matching puzzler, the goal is to defeat your opponent as monsters attack each other (running out of room from too much junk will give you a fairly steep HP reduction, but may be necessary under certain circumstances). You'll also need to record all the forms you find to a memory card or write down the requirements as you'll want to know what works best for you and what skill(s) they possess. Matches also take longer than a normal game and for this reason, I give the nod slightly in WWM's favor in terms of overall accessibility. The last thing to note is that both games are certainly nothing to write home about in the audio/video department.\n\nThis is a video of the game in action.
