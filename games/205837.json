Once you've done in all the enemies, you advance to the next level.\n\nSome levels also have closed paths which can only be opened by finding keys laying around nearby.", "summary": "In 3D Dragon Duel, you (as a dragon) must clear out several castles from other enemy dragons and dinosaurs, while avoiding deadly lava pits and floating spiked balls.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3d-dragon-castle"}
