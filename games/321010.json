Framed as the \"first chapter\" of what would go on to be a weekly series, it can be played through in a single 20-30 minute session.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kodokuhime", "videos": [{"id": 138314, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "REdJoZrzP_U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REdJoZrzP_U", "title": "Kodukuhime", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REdJoZrzP_U/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
