Battle slavers, sea monsters, and your own corrupt government to become a hero of the high seas. But will you betray your own crew for wealth and power? \n \n7th Sea: A Pirate's Pact is a 200,000-word interactive adventure novel by Danielle Lauzon, set in the world of the table-top role playing game 7th Sea. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. \n \nLooking for adventure at sea? You\u2019ll get more than you bargained for when you end up joining a pirate crew. These pirates are known among sailors for having their own moral code, one that is now yours. You'll have the chance to rescue prisoners, uncover a secret plot, and even build a navy to liberate an island fort full of slaves. \n \nBut you'll also be tempted to break your pirate bonds to seek your own gain. Would you still free the slaves if you could take out your own rivals instead? How far will you go to save your friends? And when you uncover corruption in your homeland, will you choose villainy or vengeance? \n \nEarn your crew's loyalty and they might make you their captain, but get careless and you might have to walk the plank!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/7th-sea-a-pirates-pact"}
