Prophesied as an infant to become either \"the darkness to destroy the world\" or \"the light which saves it\", Sandra carefully watches over him and never allows him to leave Rolandia's capital city, Rosaria, or have any contact with the outside world. However, throughout his childhood Carmaine experiences strange and vivid dreams of people and places he knows nothing about. When at last he becomes old enough, Sandra tells him it is time to go out and explore beyond the city gates. Accompanied by Tippi, his tiny fairy-like companion, he leaves the city to discover his destiny.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/growlanser", "collections": [{"id": 2302, "name": "Growlanser"}]}
