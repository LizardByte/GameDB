The Haniwa statue at the left indicates how many puzzle pieces the player has collected. Haniwa statues are clay mementos which were traditionally used in funerals, and sometimes buried with the dead. In the game, the player takes on the role of one of the children trying to find a way out of the haunted schoolhouse. Pieces of the shattered Haniwa are scattered throughout the school. As the player navigates through the school, some locations bring up a video sequence. Other items in the school are clues, and health items.", "summary": "Gakkou no Kaidan is a game for the Sega Saturn console.
