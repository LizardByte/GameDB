Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "videos": [{"id": 18147, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "v6m8EcLpjDk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6m8EcLpjDk", "title": "Constantine - Gameplay PS2 HD 720P", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6m8EcLpjDk/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
