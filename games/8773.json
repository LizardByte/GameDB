The collection includes Homeworld and Homeworld 2, painstakingly remastered by Gearbox in cooperation with key members of the original development team and members of the series\u2019 passionate fan community. As a free bonus, this collection also includes the original versions of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 with compatibility updates, preserving the purest form of the original releases. Anyone who purchases Homeworld Remastered Collection will also receive free access to the Homeworld Remastered Steam Multiplayer Beta when the collection releases on February 25, 2015.\n\nThe Homeworld series has a long legacy and is regarded by many as one of the best strategy series of all time. Following its release in 1999 by publisher Sierra and developer Relic Entertainment, Homeworld received several Game of the Year awards and redefined the RTS genre. Its sequel, Homeworld 2, launched in 2003, and was similarly praised by critics for its innovative controls and changes to multiplayer. Brian Martel, Gearbox Software's Chief Creative Officer, has great love and respect for Relic's brilliant, fun and innovative franchise and personally spearheaded Gearbox Software\u2019s acquisition of Homeworld from THQ in 2013.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/homeworld-remastered-collection", "videos": [{"id": 3602, "name": "Introduction to Homeworld Remastered", "video_id": "NhfNUObLrWI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhfNUObLrWI", "title": "Homeworld Remastered Collection - Introduction to Homeworld Remastered Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NhfNUObLrWI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 3623, "name": "Cinematics Trailer (4K)", "video_id": "dARq910Ns1w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dARq910Ns1w", "title": "Homeworld Remastered Collection - Cinematics Trailer (4K) (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dARq910Ns1w/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 3601, "name": "Homeworld 2 Remastered Story Trailer", "video_id": "yugMtCBkYbs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yugMtCBkYbs", "title": "Homeworld Remastered Collection - Homeworld 2 Remastered Story Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yugMtCBkYbs/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 177, "name": "Homeworld"}]}
