As the sole survivor, he passes this information on to Aginah despite his injuries. Aginah remains with the youth, hoping Zelda's belief in him or her is true. When the child awakens, Aginah informs the youngster of the monsters that are attacking their land, and explains that it is dangerous to go alone without a weapon. He states that a Sword and Shield can be found in the Eastern Palace, but he himself is too old to go there. He lends the youth an Ocarina and a Bug-Catching Net belonging to Saharshala, and also a Bottle containing a magical Golden Bee. He informs the child that the bee will attack monsters, but flee from anyone who holds a blade, and that the ocarina can be used to return to the entrance of a dungeon. With that, the new hero embarks on his or her journey.", "summary": "The second part (week) of BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bs-zelda-no-densetsu-inishie-no-sekiban-dai-2-wa", "videos": [{"id": 57315, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "lnPq_5J-sl4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnPq_5J-sl4", "title": "BS\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\u3000\u53e4\u4ee3\u306e\u77f3\u76e4\u3000\u7b2c2\u8a71", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lnPq_5J-sl4/sddefault.jpg"}]}
