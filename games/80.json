The castle is attacked by a gang of bandits named Salamandra, led by a criminal known as the Professor, a mage named Savolla who controls a large, praying mantis-like monster, and another mage named Azar Javed. The witchers and the sorceress manage to slay the monster and kill Savolla, but the Professor and Azar manage to escape with the mutagens that genetically alter the witchers. After curing Triss of the wounds she received while fighting Javed, Geralt and the rest of the witchers head off in different directions in order to find information on Salamandra.", "summary": "Based on the novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher follows Geralt of Rivia, an amnesiac witcher (problem solver and slayer of monsters) whose home, the Kaer Morhen citadel, is besieged by an organization called the Salamandra, who steal their valuable potions and get away.
