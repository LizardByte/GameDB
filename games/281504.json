The biggest amusement park in the country, Mister Maxwell dedicated his fortunes and life to making everyone\u2019s time at Maxwell\u2019s World as happy as possible. Then the bombs fell and it all went to shit.\n\nNow, the park lies open, shrouded in legend and danger. A thousand myths say that Maxwell hid a treasure, deep inside the control center of the park, just waiting to be reclaimed by some wasteland.\n\nUnfortunately, a thousand more myths say that something happened to Maxwell\u2019s World. They tell tales of shambling skeletons in the park that attack anything in sight, robots that find you and force-feed you hot dogs, of the rides coming to life and devouring those inside. There are some that say that Maxwell traded his soul to keep the park running, and not even the apocalypse stopped that.\n\nAll anyone knows, is that whoever enters Maxwell\u2019s World, never leaves. Because the park isn\u2019t just open. It\u2019s alive.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 33, "name": "Sandbox"}, {"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/maxwells-world", "videos": [{"id": 104160, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "MGzKoMm70ng"}]}
