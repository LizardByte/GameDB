The world's top BMX racers are ready to take you on, and you have no choice but to answer the call. You'll start at the bottom of the rankings, trying to work your way up the ladder by mastering 20 grueling courses and nailing difficult tricks. The object is to earn as many licenses as possible, which will earn you the right to compete in higher classes. Needless to say, the competition will get smarter and quicker as you advance through the ranks, so you'll need to bring your sharpest skills to the table. There are four different classes to stretch your abilities, and you can actually earn new riders by notching a few victories. XTREME WHEELS is packed with varied hills, jumps, and terrain, so you might want to start off in Exclusive Training mode to get a grip on the handling and realistic physics that the game engine delivers. If you want to be the ultimate Xtreme racer, you'd better get cracking."}
