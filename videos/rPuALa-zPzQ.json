It may look easy if you judge it by level one, but the diffivulty ramps up quickly, believe me. Gameplay is also much deeper than it looks with just two buttons used for everything. B to shoot and A to use the shield. However, B button can be charged up and like the shield, it uses energy than you can collect by shooting bad guys. Plus the game will reward you by avoid enemy fire really close with Tech bonus. An awesome game and a worthy import back in 1996 and still very much so in 2015. Enjoy!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rPuALa-zPzQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rPuALa-zPzQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rPuALa-zPzQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rPuALa-zPzQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Spriggan Powered", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/ShiryuVideoGames\n\nA little Super Famicom action to end the week with Naxat Soft's third entry in the Spriggan series of fine mecha shmups. \"Spriggan Powered\" was a late gen 1996 Super Famicom (and eventually Sattelaview download) shmup that uses rended graphics in a similar tehcnique like the one used in \"Donkey Kong Country\".
