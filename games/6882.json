It was released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. Samurai Warriors: Chronicles introduces several new features not included in prior Samurai Warriors games. While the top screen displays the main game, the bottom screen is used to display maps, KOs, and mission data. A player can switch between four characters during battle, switching the screen to their respective locations as well. Unlike previous titles, where the player chooses a hero and focuses on their story, in Chronicles the player chooses a male (wielding a dai-katana and rifle) or female (wielding dual swords) character which they play as a primary character in every story battle, following their own story and changing around different armies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-warriors-chronicles", "videos": [{"id": 5420, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "n-63FYQ8P6E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-63FYQ8P6E", "title": "Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3DS Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n-63FYQ8P6E/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
