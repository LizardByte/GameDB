In the wake of a cataclysmic war which leaves Earth isolated behind its own defense grid you take on the role of a corporate settler who has just been stranded on Mars. Trapped in an underground shelter your only assets are a Builder Bot, a handful of construction resources, and an instructional contingency AI named Ares. From these lowly origins you build first a city and then a fleet of remote controlled warships to secure your territory all the while knowing that you aren\u2019t the only one out here. Every other major corporation launched its own settlers to escape the devastation and soon you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s just not enough solar system to go around.", "summary": "Have you ever played a 4X game and wanted to experience more complex battles? Have you ever played an RTS and wanted meaningful exploration beyond the battle map? Have you ever played a Space Simulator and wanted more purpose than grinding for a better ship? Do you want a strategy game where your choices have consequences and defeat is always a possibility? For space game fans tired of the limited game play of singular genres we present Rank: Warmaster! With more depth than a 4X, broader exploration than an RTS, and more purpose than a Space Simulator Rank: Warmaster combines the best aspects of all three genres into a smooth blend to create a unique experience. If you've ever wished for a true multi-genre space game where you can take on any role from the commander of an empire down to the pilot of a singular ship, and to switch between them at any time, then Rank: Warmaster is the game for you!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rank-warmaster", "videos": [{"id": 49412, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "LMIGKXiC-Q0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMIGKXiC-Q0", "title": "Rank: Warmaster Early Access Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LMIGKXiC-Q0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
