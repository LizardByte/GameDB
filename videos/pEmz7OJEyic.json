(2020) Walkthrough (All gems collected) + Review, ZX Spectrum", "description": "Huge playlist archive with games from 2020: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxOanVBhqd3uaUbZJnzjW5Sv0Mot2ntmx\nThis game is set on a mining facility on the planet Mars which has been invaded by hostile aliens. The aim of the game is to collect 10 fuel cells to power up the reactor that will cause an explosion and destroy all the invaders. When you have powered up the reactor you have 99 seconds to get back to where you started and escape in your ship. There is also 30 gems to collect to advance your score and complete the game 100%.\n\nYou control a springbot (spring + robot = springbot) so you are going to jump your way through the screens. You can jump over the enemies, jump up and grap bars, and use elevators to come around. You will need to find a blue, yellow and red access card to open up locked areas.\n\nThe game plays and controls great, and the gameplay works fine running/jumping around collecting fuel cells and gems while looking for access card to open up inaccessible areas. The graphics is really well made with some very nice animations and everything looks nice and colorful. A very polished game!\n\nThis is the first ZX Spectrum game by the author and it is very impressive. A toe tapping AY soundtrack for 128k users and it would have been really awesome.\n\nThe game was made by Andy Farrel in 2020.\n\nRating = 90%\n\nVisit Andy's website and download the game here: http://www.andy-farrell.co.uk/springbot/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pEmz7OJEyic/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pEmz7OJEyic/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pEmz7OJEyic/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Springbot - Mars Attack!
