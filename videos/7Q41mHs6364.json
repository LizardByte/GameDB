The only sources of light are your enemies. Forced to stay in the dark, you have to rely mostly on your hearing in order to succeed.\n\nThe goal of the game is to find and collect three numbers hidden in the labyrinth. You can only know where they are if you pay close attention to where their sound is coming from.\n\nWhile you search you must aviod the three enemies. If they see you, they will turn off their lights and try to hunt you down in the darkness. But if they lose your trail, they will turn back on their lights and continue searching.\n\n\n\nCredits\n\nJonas Tyroller (Art, Coding, FX, Game Design, Sound Design)\nShahriar Shahrabi (Art, Coding, FX, Game Design, Sound Design)\nLenja Kaufmann (Art, Coding, FX, Game Design, Sound Design)\n\nThe game was created in the course of the second semester of the Game Design Bachelor program of the HTW-Berlin.\n\nSpecial thanks to our professors and coaches:\nProf. Susanne Brandhorst\nProf. Thomas Bremer\nSven-Thomas Gorholt", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Q41mHs6364/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Q41mHs6364/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Q41mHs6364/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Q41mHs6364/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Q41mHs6364/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Abskur Trailer", "description": "Free Download: https://foxki.itch.io/abskur\n\nAbskur is a creepy and atmospheric experience.
