The casting is an overhead view with two meters. One is for the direction, but the view for the lure is a side view where the shadow of the fish can be seen as it approaches. It also shows how deep the lure is and how much line is left before it is reeled in. There are four fish in the game to fish for - trout, pike, catfish and of course the game's namesake, the black bass.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/super-black-bass"}
