The consequences of the war for the ecosystem were disastrous and earth was left uninhabitable in the end. Almost all organic life forms were annihilated. Only a few humans succeeded to flee in the nick of time. However, from then on they were mercilessly hunted by the machines named Skilith.\nDive into the leading role of one of the last surviving humans and become the commander-in-chief on the spaceship of the Blue Science Union. Always by your side stands the artificial intelligence named AIRA. Embark on an interstellar journey across the galaxy and discover fascinating new worlds with yet unknown species.\n\nSince the violent take-over of power on earth, the Skilith continued to spread across the universe. While doing so, they continued to conquer new civilizations to rob them of their resources. Now, it is your duty to defend remaining resources at any cost. Only this way our continued existence may be guaranteed.\n\nUnexpectedly, AIRA discovers a new element on a so far unknown planet, creating a spark of hope on being able to still rescue the ecosystem on earth. Unfortunately, not every species is pleased about humans founding new colonies in their territory...", "summary": "You believed tower defense is only about building towers? That's not quite right \u2013 because Aira VR is not like other tower defense games. Once the battle starts you find yourself in the midst of the fight! Aira VR merges the strategic elements of the tower defense genre and the thrilling action of a first person shooter in an intelligent manner and combines the best of both worlds. Thereby, AIRA VR is the first game of its kind that is exclusively developed for VR and offers you an unprecedented gaming experience.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/aira-vr", "videos": [{"id": 25525, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8XFvcgOcxmI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XFvcgOcxmI", "title": "AIRA VR | Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8XFvcgOcxmI/hqdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 25526, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "BzyXrHDGrtY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzyXrHDGrtY", "title": "AIRA VR | Gameplay Level 1 [Challenge Mode]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BzyXrHDGrtY/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 25527, "name": "VR", "video_id": "w2KcgMvir7M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2KcgMvir7M", "title": "AIRA VR | Tsangaan 360\u00b0 [4K]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w2KcgMvir7M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
