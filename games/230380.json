Finally after a hundred years a brave warrior was able to hurt the Dark Lord and make him retreat back to the demon world, how did she do it? According to the stories my father told me, the legend said that during twenty years of her life she gathered more than ten epic monster orbs, her body couldn't take so much energy, she then passed away after trying to use them all at once. only magic, at least that's what they thought at the time and it's not known how far the documents record the truth but the woman after two weeks of her death, appeared at the decisive moment of the Final Battle through a purple explosion in the same way that brought the Lord of Darkness to our world, she entered the battlefield and it was at this moment that she faced the entire army of the Lord of Darkness alone and defeated him leaving everyone without reaction with such power. This warrior was named as the first transcendent, unfortunately humanity had already suffered too much and even Prontera the capital of rune-midgard was destroyed during the last confrontation, being today a cursed land surrounded by monsters that awaits the return of its wounded master, with the end of the war the world government of rune-midgard alongside the first transcendent decided to create a new capital a city that would bring hope to humanity, a new beginning and this city was named as City Zero the first transcendent had the task given by the King Yggmilenia II to create an academy which would be responsible for training new warriors to use the power of the eyes with the aim that when she was no longer able to maintain her physical form in our world that humanity would have hope to face the Lord of Darkness in their inevitable return, these students would be known as The Protectors of Rune-midgard on the day the first transcendent disappeared. Around this world there are reports that more than a hundred shooting stars fell from the skies in random places of rune-midgard, soon epic monsters were located in places that until then were peaceful and that could only mean one thing, with the death of the first transcendent monsters were created from the fragments of the epic orbs that held her spirit on our plane, if the body of the first transcendent was on the same plane as the Dark Lord, perhaps her return will be faster than expected. Five hundred years have passed since epic monsters took over some cities, after so long the current world government simply accepts it when a new monster dominates a region and moves citizens to another land, they accommodated, they forgot what it is to be afraid, that's why I write this letter, if you found this it is because you are going to become a protector, do not limit yourself only to the protection of the crystals of the cities go out in search of the fragments that the soul of the first transcendent scattered, one day maybe we will find ourselves in this endless search, until then I wish you all the good luck in the world and may you live long, signed Sarina.", "summary": "Arkaik Online: Tales of Sarina is a mod of Ragnarok Online, adding new mechanics, unique lore, current interface, textures in full FULL HD and MVPs in 3D."}
