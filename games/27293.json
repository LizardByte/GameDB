The company was founded and helmed by Rob Elam, who has been coding since the ripe old age of 11 - he released his first game, OMF: 2097, when he was 24. Since then, he's worked on a variety of projects, most recently developing significant portions of movement, physics, and networking code in Planetside 2. Two years ago, Rob decided to leave the company and bring his latest video game concept to life.\n\nFeatures\nFight alongside 3 war-torn commanders as they fight to protect their property (and the earth of course) from aliens hellbent on stealing an explosive mineral to exterminate the human race. Build your defensive web with a variety of automated turrets, then join the action. There are plenty of first person weapons to choose from - grenade launchers, lockon missiles, and machine guns, just to name a few. Customizable mods bring more destructive additions to the table; with options like force, phasing, and armor piercing, you can personalize your weapon and take the baddies down with grace. And with the mobile gun platform, you can travel across the board without ever leaving your gun - and smash enemies out of your way. With an ever-expanding roster of levels, face off against 4 powerful commanders, each with their own unique powers and buffs. From stealth to speed to heavy armor, you'll find yourself challenged every step of the way.", "summary": "After a time of relative peace\u2026 and boredom... the heroic protectors once known as Sentinels have been called back into action! Use the unique skills of Sam, Kat, and Frank to lay waste to the seemingly endless horde. Deploy powerful automated towers, upgrade them to devastating Elite towers, and watch the mayhem. When that doesn\u2019t quite cut it, rain down meteors and acid attacks with manually activated tactical weapons. And of course, because you love to get your hands dirty, you\u2019ll be jumping into first person shooting mode, sniping and blasting your more dangerous foes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sentinels", "videos": [{"id": 17352, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "FOvfUOLy4t4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOvfUOLy4t4", "title": "Sentinels: High Energy Tower Defense", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FOvfUOLy4t4/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
