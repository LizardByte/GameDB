It is the second game in the beatmania series and is part of the BEMANI franchise ( which it was named after: BEatMANIa ). \n \nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. \n \nbeatmania 2ndMix is the first time the HIDDEN modifier was included, which hides notes halfway down the screen. The Difficulty levels have been reworked to a scale between 1 and 6. All songs from the first game moves on, combined with some remixes and 13 totally new songs for a total of 25 tracks to play.", "videos": [{"id": 38025, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "3S40gJqLmj0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S40gJqLmj0", "title": "beatmania 2ndMIX (Arcade / 1998) - Gameplay", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3S40gJqLmj0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
