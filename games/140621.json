These five escapees have eluded authorities successfully, recruited many villains into their army of mass terror and destruction, and have wreaked havoc all over the city of Megalopolis. The villains seem unstoppable, as the police force has failed over and over again to bring the band of bad buddies to justice. As a last resort, a team of super heroes are summoned in an attempt to restore justice in the once proud city of Megalopolis.", "summary": "A jail break has occurred in the city of Megatropolis and five evil supervillains have escaped. The city's last resort is to summon a team of superheroes, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities. The gameplay is similar to the Apogee EGA titles, like Duke Nukem and Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure: Forbidden Planet. There is a grand total of 50 levels to play and 7 characters to choose from. Gems can be collected in the levels to upgrade characters' stats, and fruit can be collected to increase health.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heros-the-sanguine-seven"}
