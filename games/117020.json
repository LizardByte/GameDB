However, his plans to prevent the King from having a heir have failed. For the good wizard Troda has intervened and saved Atamus, the young prince. You are that young prince, and you have returned to the castle to try to lift the curse. The doors are closed behind you. If you fail, the place will be doomed forever. Grackon's curse is a 1st person point and click adventure that plays in a 3D environment. All actions take place within the castle. The action window covers about 1/3 of the screen when the player simply walks through the corridors and rooms of the castle, but the close-ups are a bit bigger. At each stopping point the player can pan around at 90 degrees intervals. While examining some places/objects, the player will hear voices of the persons that have disappeared (not captioned). The game has six saving slots. The player can die in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/grackons-curse"}
