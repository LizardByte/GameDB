Each of the game\u2019s eight stages is open ended, as you hunt for keys to unlock the boss door, while defeating enemies to gain magic and gold.\nThe game was developed by Natsume, in conjunction with Dynamic Planning, the studio owned by famed manga artist Go Nagai, known for his stylistic blend of horror and erotica. Majoriko Inbizone is actually fairly subdued though \u2013 it\u2019s rather softcore, and while the first level has some grotesque imagery, the terror is undercut by the appearance of some goofy enemies", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/majoriko-inbikai-inbizone"}
