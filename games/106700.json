You utilise weapons and soldiers distinct to that period in European warfare, making key decisions to turn the tide of war. In battle you manage not only military units of the era, using their capabilities for the greatest strategic advantage, but you also manage your cities, Generals and even members of royalty. Creating units, boosting wartime economies and enhancing unit capabilities all play a key role in success or failure.", "themes": [{"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "videos": [{"id": 27093, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "r0wl3Pw9SPY"}]}
