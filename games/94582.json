The island gods are upset because their temple floors are broken. To get back home, you need to appease the gods by restoring the floor mosaics. There are nine temples with 201 puzzles in total that are unlocked by fixing a certain amount of floors.\n\nPixelus Deluxe can be considered a remake of the 2001 GBA game Guru Logi Champ. For each puzzle, the player receives a limited number of tiles that need to be locked in blank spots. Claudius can move around the mosaic and fling the tiles. To stop a tile in its tracks, barriers need to be set up. Medals are earned when the player beats the \"world record\" of each puzzle by using the minimum number of moves. Next to the regular mode, there is an expert mode in which the undo, reset and hint function are not available.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pixelus-deluxe"}
