Played online, your quarry is another human player but can you find them amongst the AI inhabitants of the Ship? Once you know who they are, find yourself a weapon but keep an eye out for security guards and cameras. If you're spotted trying to murder someone you'll be transported to the Brig and suffer a hefty fine. If you succeed in killing your quarry Mr. X will reward you with a cash prize, depending on how entertaining he found your murder. At the same time you must look after yourself, wash, sleep, eat and have fun and remember - always look over your shoulder because somewhere there's a player looking for you!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 23, "name": "Stealth"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ship"}
