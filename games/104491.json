The goal of the game is to clear layers of very sharp blades to push the open button. Push all the buttons in order and you win. While trying to open the puzzle you must not touch the sharp edges of the blades or you will get SLICED. When this happens, blood spills from your finger(s) onto the glass and the puzzle will reset. The blades only move in specific patterns that you must intuit by touch. Often you will have to use multiple fingers to hold blades open while you manipulate other blades with other fingers. This game is really about trying to figure out the hidden behaviors of the blades and moving the blades out of the way, carefully.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/slice-hd"}
