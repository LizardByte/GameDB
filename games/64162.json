Approximately 2500 years later, a certain demon, Lucifer, has taken the reins to be the most powerful demon. He turned his extreme hatred for Solomon into dark magic, and successfully released the seal upon the brass vase. Now free, his goal is nothing less than to seek revenge upon his enemy, Solomon, and destroy the human world in which Solomon lived. Scorched with an evil desire, Lucifer orders demons under him to eliminate Solomon\u2019s descendants as well as the legendary ring.\n\nOn the other hand, over the years, the existence of the seal Solomon had left gradually begins to fade within the memories of the people in the human world. It is there that the heroine, Lily, lives humbly while managing a library she inherits from her grandfather. Before her only living relative, her grandfather, passes away, he tells her that she is a descendant of Solomon, and entrusted her with the ring that had been passed on from generation to generation; the ring that is used to face off against demons. However, for Lily, this is nothing but brutal as the powers of the ring aren't awakening.\n\nBeing oppressed by this mission, the ones who come to stand before her are a troop of demons. However, the 3 demons that come to rescue her from her plight are none are than ones from the 72 demons that had been sealed together with Lucifer!\n\nThere are 12 demons with routes, separated into 4 games by elements with 3 demons per game. The elements are Fire, Water, Wind and Earth.", "summary": "Otome game by Plan Peace.
