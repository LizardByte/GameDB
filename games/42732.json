The car comes complete with a speedometer (in kilometres), a lap counter, and a lap time counter. There are a pre-determined number of chances to complete the game, like in Super Mario Kart and F-Zero. If the player is unable to defeat the game in those number of tries, then the player gets an automatic game over. A yellow smiley face shows up to track the performance of the driver. If it's smiling, then the player is winning. Otherwise, the player is losing the game.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dirt-racer"}
