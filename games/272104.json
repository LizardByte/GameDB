Duke exits the EDF Base by riding an elevator back to street level. In the North of the once popular holiday destination of Seaside city the industrial zone is dark and mostly disused. The EDF have learned that the alien invasion stems from a ship that was crash landed near the old city hall, these aliens weren't meant to invade, they were merely a scouting party, but when they crashed they deployed troops to find parts to repair their ship. The problem is that if the scouting party fix that ship, there are bound to be other aliens waiting to hear from them and if they hear Duke Nukem is around, they will probably all descend on the planet and cause a war.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nitroglycerin"}
