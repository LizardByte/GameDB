The player has to race down a two-lane road to earn the high score. Other cars occupy the road and these have to be avoided or else the player will crash and lose a life. Crashes also occur when going off the road and hitting an oil slick. A scanner located to the right of the main view allows the player to spot cars down the road. The game uses manual transmission and it's necessary to shift gears at the appropriate time or else the engine might blow and the player will crash. The game ends when time runs out or after five crashes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/driving-demon"}
