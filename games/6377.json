Guide Flo, an office worker-turned-restaurateur, as she builds up her empire over four unique diners. Go online to face players in head-to-head. If you feel up to the challenge, join up with a friend or another player online for a Team Dash game where your team will take on six other players to see whose diner is the best in town. (Broadband Internet access is required for online play.) \n \nPlayers take direct control of Flo as she runs around to seat patrons, take orders, deliver food, take payment and bus tables as efficiently as possible within the time allowed. Players who are fond of traditional control schemes may also use a point-and-click style with hotkeys to aid Flo in her quest for customer satisfaction, which is reflected in a heart meter that empties as customers lose patience. If the meter empties completely, then the customer will leave the restaurant.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 20774, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "_aPCrIJhpc0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aPCrIJhpc0", "title": "Diner Dash - Gameplay Part 1 (Level 1-1 to 1-4)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_aPCrIJhpc0/sddefault.jpg"}]}
