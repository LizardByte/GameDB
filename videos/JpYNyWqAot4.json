Rather than repeating the PT formula with \"spooky hallway\" clones, these unique projects explore the boundaries of horror and insanity in a variety of new ways. Some may become full-fledged games one day, others may follow PT and Silent Hills into the netherworld, but playing all 10 Dread X Collection games will give you a glimpse into the bewildering beyond of horror gaming.\n\nTerrify yourself ten ways with the Dread X Collection, an anthology of ten playable \"Playable Teasers\" for horror game projects from 10 incredibly passionate solo developers.
