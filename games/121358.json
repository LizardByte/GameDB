It\u2019s up to Rush and her three friends to claim back their city for the people!\n\nThe residents of New Atlas can transform into powerful beings with abilities based on their everyday lives. Rush is a gym owner who transforms into a lightspeed boxing champion and her buddy Claud is a LARPer whose foam sword grants the ability to turn into a badass berserker. Players can choose to fight as Rush, Claud, Beetle or Wizard to battle hyper-aggressive hot sauce bottles, disco-dancing mirror balls and over-affectionate ice-cream cones to name but a few of King Crab and Red Velvet\u2019s minions.\n\nLearn the moves and combos of each fighter, play solo with an AI sidekick, or in two-player local co-op. Find depth in the unique ways each character\u2019s attacks compliment the others and \u201cpass the punch\u201d to create a unique ultimate attack, which changes based on which characters combine their powers. With so many punches to pass, high scores to hit, hoops to shoot, secrets to discover and extra content to unlock, Pass The Punch will keep players busy until they are TKO\u2019d.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pass-the-punch"}
