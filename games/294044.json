From a magnetic grapple to reach a metallic faucet, to a rideable rocket that can burst through the glass blocking the way, you will find many upgrades, each with its own uses.\n\nYou must adapt to the tools in your possession to determine where you can go, the thrill of the game coming both from the platforming mastery, but also from the mental mapping of where you can go in the house at any given time. When you obtain a new item, you need to update this mental map to determine the best possibilities, optimize your path, and decide where to go next to maximize the chances to exit quickly.\n\nThe ability to follow an efficient path is important during races, in which all the competing players will have the same game configuration and must exit the house as fast as they can. But the game is also designed to be enjoyed solo and slowly, thanks to a single-player progression that lets each player discover the challenges at their own pace.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/randomice", "videos": [{"id": 114578, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "KTKMXx8qwuQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTKMXx8qwuQ", "title": "Randomice Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KTKMXx8qwuQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 114683, "name": "Release Date Trailer", "video_id": "LX6vQDGJZFI"}]}
