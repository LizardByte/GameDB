I recorded all the footage in one go with my completed save, so I made use of the \"Walk Through Walls\" cheat code and the Debug menu to level up to 99 to sped up the recording process. So if you see Ness going through some terrain or walls, and if you see Ness at an extremely high level when fighting the Starman Junior, that's why! The hack will behave properly on normal playthroughs :P\n\nEnjoy, and look forward to the final release!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djQo0qAt5S8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djQo0qAt5S8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/djQo0qAt5S8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "MaternalBound Redux Featurette", "description": "Download link:\nhttps://github.com/ShadowOne333/MaternalBound-Redux/releases\n\nJoin the MaternalBound Discord server:\nhttps://discord.gg/857kvJK\n\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/ShadowOne333/MaternalBound-Redux\n\nThe new MaternalBound Redux hack is already here, and with that I give you guys a glimpse of the features that the new hack will have upon release.\n\nI only mentioned a few, but you can catch a lot more changes inside each section, be sure to keep an eye open to see if you can find any more changes!\n\nOh and also excuse my use of cheat codes and the Debug menu.
