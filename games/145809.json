To face this terrible threat, Arceus called Palkia, Dialga and Giratina as reinforcements.\n\nAfter a fierce fight, the four legendary Pok\u00e9mons had just enough strength to stand up to this mysterious Pok\u00e9mon. They miraculously managed to force him back into his dimension.\n\nArceus later realized that it was he who attracted this dimensional Pok\u00e9mon, probably because he was the most powerful one in this universe. He then locked himself in his own dimension so as not to be threatened anymore.\n\nBut among the inhabitants born from the creation of Arceus, a high-ranking person remembered the existence of the dimensional Pok\u00e9mon. He had only one desire: to seize its power by any means possible.\n\nAs the child of the League Champion, you will traverse and explore the Exodius region, pit your strength against its Gym Leaders, face the current Champion and become the most powerful trainer the region will ever know!", "summary": "A French fan-made Pok\u00e9mon game in which you embody the son/daughter of the Champion and try to be one in your turn in an all-new region named Exodius.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-steam"}
