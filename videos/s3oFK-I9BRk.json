I really liked the graphical design In Utero came up with. It has lots of dense, good atmosphere. The great score by Gilles Sivilotto is a big part of it. (Buy it here: https://gillessivilotto.bandcamp.com/album/odyssey-the-search-for-ulysses) Lots of characters are not to be trusted and figuring out what they had in mind for you was part of the fun for me. Back in the year 2000 it wasn't common to play and adventure-game which offered multiple solutions and paths to finish it. The player could choose to act like a saint or a brute. And of course, the gods kept an eye on every action you took and help you remember your decisions once it was time to enter the underworld. Because of those decisions-points, it created a high replay-value. \nAlas, this nice concept was done harm by its weak game-design. The player never knew what to prepare for, because deaths and failures happened without warning. So progression was made by trial and error. And lots of saving. \n\nIn short; if you like to try every possibility for the prize of an amusing death-scene, then this is your game. If not... Well, then just sit back in your chair comfortably and watch this playthrough on the \"Twilight Adventures\" channel.  \n\n===\n\nTECHNICAL NOTES\n\n- I played this game on a Windows 10 system with the help of a newly created patch (Thanks Dege!) which can be found here: http://dege.freeweb.hu/Patches/Patches.html. \n\n- This game can be played with the dgVoodoo-wrapper.
