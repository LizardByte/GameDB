Work your way up to world class with the 3 skill levels on 10 world famous circuits. Put on your helmet and enjoy the exhilarating challenge of high performance bike racing at 250 mph! \n \nThere are 6 gears, with selection made by forward/back movement of the joystick or keys A and Z. Each gear corresponds to a particular speed range. Accelerate or brake by pressing or releasing the Fire button (or space bar). Acceleration and braking are affected by the gear to speed relationship. A neutral position must occur between gear changes if using a joystick. \n \nColliding with other riders will result in a spill from your machine, and a subsequent time penalty to regain control. Leaving the road causes loss of speed and eventually loss of control. \n \nAt the start of the race, two timers will start: \n \nLap timer: Transferred to left side of the screen at end of each lap (lower readout). Upper readout = best lap time. \nRace timer: Timing of current race. \n \nIf a new record is set for lap time, race time or finishing position the information will be announced on the grandstand display board. \n \nThere are nineteen other riders to compete against at three skill levels selected by F8 (shift and F7). The number of laps can also be reduced to improve on the best race time as playing skill improves. A high speed preview of the selected track may be observed by pressing space bar. The race or practice mode may be aborted at any time by pressing the RESTORE key."}
