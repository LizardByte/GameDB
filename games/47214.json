The fiend who trapped the two of you is the evil Dr. Graves, who happens to be a surgeon gone completely mad! Although at first glance the island seems pretty nice, with some beautiful green hills and forests, making it a nice setting for your own little private version of The Blue Lagoon, it soon becomes apparent that some very creepy characters inhabit this piece of land. In mansions, castles, a church and even a pyramid live Dracula, Frankenstein, a werewolf, a mummy, a witch and a rather funny looking deformed guy. And if being on the same little continent with these creeps isn\u2019t enough, you actually have got to kill them all before you can leave the island\u2026 it just isn\u2019t your day! The monsters are hiding in the different buildings on the island and to kill them you\u2019ll have to find an appropriate weapon. For example, to kill Dracula, you\u2019ll need a stake and a hammer and to kill the werewolf a gun with some silver bullets might be useful. All the necessary weapons are too scattered among the different buildings, but not necessarily in the same building as the monster it is suitable for. So you\u2019ll have to roam the island searching through the various buildings, looking for the weapons and the monsters to use them on. One weapon can be held at a time, so remember where all the monsters and different weapons are hidden, when you see them, so you can find them later on when needed.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/scary-monsters"}
