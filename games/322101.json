It is as much a game of Tower Defense as it is a game of action, as the Magikoopa you control is just as capable of defeating attackers as one's minions. Casting offensive spells and summoning aid requires time, and the determined Shy Guys don't give you any time between waves to relax. After clearing a stage, one is awarded coins and a rank, based on the amount of coins remaining from the mission.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/magikoopa-security-force"}
