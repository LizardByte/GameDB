There's over 50 characters to unlock (52 to be exact). There is also 5 farley large minigames to unlock such as a full pinball adventure game and a 2 player battle game.\n\nMain game goal - fire your sonic furry down the stage to gain distance. The more distance you achieve the higher amount of rings you will be rewarded. Use the rings to unlock more characters and store items. The more characters you have unlocked, the more rings you will be rewarded at the end of each shot. In a sense, the game gets easier the more you play.\n\nThe store releases one new item a day. Most of the items are keys to unlock certain characters while other items provide more game content and functionality. Come back every day to unlock them all!
