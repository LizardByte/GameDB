The game boasts an entirely unique design in comparison to the previous CD-i Zelda titles, emphasizing the difference in production between the developers. Princess Zelda serves as the game's protagonist, making it the second game in the series where she is playable. Zelda's Adventure incorporates a similar top-down view reminiscent of most conventional 2D Zelda games and it also has dungeons.
