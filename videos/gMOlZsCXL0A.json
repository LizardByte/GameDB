{"id": "gMOlZsCXL0A", "snippet": {"title": "Utopia: The Creation of a Nation (Amiga) longplay", "description": "Utopia: The Creation of a Nation was developed by Celestial Software and released by Gremlin in 1991 for Amiga and ST. MS-DOS and even SNES releases followed within 2 years. Utopia is a colony building real time strategy game with combat elements. Similarly with Sim City, player is in charge of funds, construction and managing basic necessities. Compared to Sim City Utopia includes additional features such as resource gathering, trading, specialized industry, espionage, research and combat. The first strategy game I bought.\n\nI'm playing this on A1200 config, it doesn't make the game time progress faster, but speeds up animations quite a bit. I could've played this on A500 config, but the game just feels very sluggish, when you're used to faster responses. Scenario chosen for this demo is Tilikanthua, which should be the third hardest. Changing music tracks in this game is done manually. I recorded the soundtrack by Barry Leitch separately and looped it over gameplay so I didn't have to play DJ while playing the game.\n\nAccording to manual the main goal is to achieve 80% quality of life rating. IMO destroying the enemy city should also be a main objective. In this video I complete both of these tasks for the chosen scenario. Scenarios should be considered as difficulty levels. There are some different tilesets and player is given different info of aliens in each scenario. However, gameplay remains pretty much the same so there's not much point to play every single scenario. Once you figure out how to play it does get a bit repetitive. Adding colonists to open jobs, trading for money and waiting for money soon become the primary activity.\n\nAfter destroying the alien city I kept on playing for about an hour to reach 80% quality of life rating. This was done by adjusting tax to 0%, building hospitals and holding sports events always when possible so that part is not included in the video. Manual isn't exactly clear on the best formula for ratings. Large colony size should affect it positively, but at the same time more hospitals are required or the rating drops.\n\nThere are some glitches in the release I played. Invisible obstacles got in the way of my tanks and constructions. Sometimes new tax rate and birth rate values wouldn't register. There is a 3.0 patch for Amiga version, it would probably fix many issues. I couldn't beat the last scenario, CPU VS player handicap is extreme. They always launch a massive attack around 30-60 minutes in the game. Meanwhile, I have few laser turrets at that point and maybe few level 1 tanks. I can only wonder how different releases balance difficulty levels.\n\nFor an RTS the combat system of Utopia is very minimal and clumsy. There's also unnecessary micro and most gameplay elements are not very polished. It's still a great concept for such an early title. Utopia was released one year before Dune 2. Amiga game K240 could be considered as a sequel, again with a great concept and expanded gameplay elements. Fragile Allegiance is an excellent remake of K240, released for MS-DOS in 1997, still one of my favorite RTS games.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gMOlZsCXL0A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gMOlZsCXL0A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gMOlZsCXL0A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gMOlZsCXL0A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gMOlZsCXL0A/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Utopia: The Creation of a Nation (Amiga) longplay", "description": "Utopia: The Creation of a Nation was developed by Celestial Software and released by Gremlin in 1991 for Amiga and ST.
