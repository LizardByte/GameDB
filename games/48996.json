Once again the player takes control of the Vic Viper and flies through five different stages destroying Bacterion's army.\n\nThe game retains the traditional power-up bar from the original Gradius. The player can speed-up multiple times, use missiles, shoot double firepower or lasers, use several options at a time and use the classic shield (although it is referred to as a forcefield). However, before each game is started or continued, the player is given a \"Weapon Select\" screen. Here the player can choose between one of three settings for the missiles, double firepower, and lasers.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gradius-the-interstellar-assault", "videos": [{"id": 20026, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "_TCvAOYEXsw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TCvAOYEXsw", "title": "Game Boy Longplay [135] Gradius: The Interstellar Assault", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_TCvAOYEXsw/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
