Play as the NecroMerger and use dark magic to summon an array of creatures (skeletons, zombies, demons, banshees\u2026 the list goes on). Merge them from piddly little grunts into massive (and tasty) brutes, before feeding them to your ever hungry pet.\nAs you grow your Devourer you\u2019ll attract the attention of merchants, champions and even rivals. Some can be useful, others must be fought\u2026 or fed to your insatiable pet. The bigger the Devourer grows the more your lair will expand and you\u2019ll unlock powerful abilities and spells.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}]}
