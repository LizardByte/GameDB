Just as she's bemoaning her lack of funds, the opportunity she's been searching for hits her... literally! Carried on a breeze, a flyer for a house in Milum Town at a price that's almost too good to be true smacks her right in the face. Though initially wary, she enters MACS Real Estate to inquire about the property and leaves a proud homeowner.\n\nUnfortunately, Noelle's joy is short-lived. Just as she's getting settled, two mean-looking debt collectors barge in and demand she pay off her debt. Confused, her attention is directed to her housing contract, where she learns she's been fooled into taking on the debt of the previous owner! As if that isn't bad enough, she's given a paltry 10 days to pay back the monstrous 1,000,000 gold she owes! Will she be able to cobble together enough money in time, or will the life she's always dreamt of slip through her fingers? No matter what happens, one thing's for certain...\n\nNoelle will do her best!", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/noelle-does-her-best", "videos": [{"id": 72512, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "RXZ_orTqJbA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXZ_orTqJbA", "title": "Noelle Does Her Best! - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RXZ_orTqJbA/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
