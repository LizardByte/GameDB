Finally, seeing the disorder, they decided to collapse the Multiverse into a single Universe and recreate it later.\n\nAs they couldn't decide on the energy they would use to recreate it, they divided into two orders: the Ethereals and the Riddles.\n\nThe Ethereals defended pure energy and the preservation of living beings. The Riddles, on the other hand, defended the energy of chaos, even if it caused the death of many living beings.\n\nSo the two fought a war and the Cronian essence spread throughout the Universe. The Riddleds were victorious, leaving only one Ethereal, Aeon, the Guardian of Space-Time.\n\nThroughout the Aeons, Aeon is looking for a human being who has a significant part of the Cronian essence scattered around, to train him in order to defeat the representative implanted by the Aeons on Earth, Kodai no Yokan.\n\nAeon finally meets Bolek, who, for 1000 cycles, is defeated by Kodai.\n\nIn cycle 1001, Aeon interferes in Bolek's journey, adding special powers to him.\n\nThus begins an Endless Chase between Bolek, Aeon and Kodai through the Steam, Cyber and NanoPunk worlds, to recreate the Multiverse.", "summary": "Endless Chase: Fate of Bolek is a real-time RPG with time travel elements seamlessly integrated into both gameplay and narrative.
