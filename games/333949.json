Wells novel of the same name, the focus is on mankind in a struggle against a strange alien invasion. In this take on it, however, the events are turned around as you command a tripod in its quest to exterminate all humans. In the thirteen levels, set in Osaka, London, New Jersey and apocalyptic wastelands, you guide the alien through side-scrolling levels, destroying anything in sight.\n\nYou can move the tripod, as well as the main turret to target waves of enemies. Each level ends with a boss attack where you take on a giant tank, submarine or a flying bomber, or prevent a ferry from escaping with human passengers. Many events follow the movie, and the order of the locations is also kept intact. Although you will spend a lot of time fending off enemies, time is the most important factor. You are much stronger than your enemies, so they will often charge with kamikaze attacks to slow you down. Buildings will also prevent you from moving steadily, and these need to be removed as well.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/war-of-the-worlds--4", "videos": [{"id": 141955, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "MLIPRgqtmXI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLIPRgqtmXI", "title": "\"War of The Worlds\" - Gameloft 2005 (Java Game)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MLIPRgqtmXI/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
