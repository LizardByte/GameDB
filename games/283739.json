You can use Z and X to rotate the curvature of branches currently growing. Every three seconds, branches will split into two separate ones. As the tree ages, or as acid rain makes contact with it, it begins to die. Holes will start to form in branches, which need to be patched up. The game ends when 100 droplets of acid rain hit the floor.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/acid-r-ai-slash-eig-n"}
