This was the second time Taito attempted to create an upgrade to Kaiser Knuckle, after Kaiser Knuckle EX, a very simple version that did nothing but lower the CPU difficulty of the game.\n\nDan-Ku-Ga eschews the 5-attack-strength system of Kaiser Knukcle, making most useful strong attacks into \"command normals\" performed with forward or down-forward and heavy punch or kick. It adds a juggle system for combos unlike other fighting games at the time, and jump cancels on air attacks. The Crush meter still exists, but the move-specific enhanced power zones beyond stage walls are gone.\n\nThis is also the first fighting game to include a training mode, selected by the third option on the menu (which is still in Japanese only).", "summary": "Dan-Ku-Ga is the unreleased updated version to an obscure fighting game, Kaiser Knuckle/Global Champion set to be released December 3rd 1994 in Japan. It brings with it overhauled systems, playable bosses, new moves, and a generally much higher degree of quality and playability. The game was discontinued after location testing.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dan-ku-ga", "videos": [{"id": 46603, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "ShtAmVav1yA"}, {"id": 46604, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "j5wCk_k6mDk"}]}
