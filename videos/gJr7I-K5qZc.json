Only in Nintendo eShop for $1.99/\u20ac2 and on Nintendo DSiWare for 200 Nintendo DSi Points.\n\nThe splendor and beauty of Chicken Island would make it an ideal vacation spot - if it weren't for those pirates. A one-legged captain, a gunner, a cutlass-wielding chicken and a treasure hunter... the island is home to countless perils, hidden extras and mysteries. The lords of the island are by no means willing to surrender themselves and their treasure without a fight. Crazy Chicken Pirates 3D is a point & shoot action game where you take aim at birds as they scurry through the island and plunge bravely into the waves for a desperate counterattack. You only have 90 seconds to complete your raid by slaying pirates and collecting all hidden treasures.\n\n\u00a92012 phenomedia publishing gmbh.
