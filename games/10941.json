You made him flee up to his mountain, and he hasn\u2019t been seen again since then.\n\nBut lately strange things have started to happen. The animals around the foot of the peak are moving closer and closer to the village.\n\nThe midwinter night will soon be here once more.", "summary": "Toymaker is a roleplaying game that takes place in a dark, snow-filled world, where life is harsh and the people living there have become hard and cold. In this land, the darkness has eyes, the winter wind whispers with a piercing voice and the frost hungers for warm flesh."}
