We managed to create a game with a deep lore in our singleplayer campaign, a skirmish mode for the comfortable evening rounds, and a multiplayer mode to play with your friends, each customizable by unlocking fates once you complete a quest.\n\nWe're looking forward to work on our roadmap, and keep all of you updated through \nSteam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195410/Songs_of_Silence/) and \nDiscord (https://discord.gg/p3eEBrWaCj)\n\nThank you all so much for your support so far, and we're looking forward to the future.
