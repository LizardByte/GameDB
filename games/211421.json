With numerous combat skills and special powers, Vydija will lead Nimrod's army to victory, and will be the key strategic element of every battle.\n\nThanks to her high position among other succubi, Vydija will use her abilities to seduce and then incorporate martyrs, who do not belong to any of the factions, into her own army.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/agony-lords-of-hell", "videos": [{"id": 99298, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "wa9V69m6bJg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa9V69m6bJg", "title": "Agony: Lords of Hell | Trailer [GOG]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wa9V69m6bJg/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 5778, "name": "Agony"}]}
