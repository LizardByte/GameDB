It was an Adventure game with great graphics, sound and well animated environments that really captured the mood of the film perfectly. I especially liked using the ESPER machine to scan photos for clues. The only bits I didn't like about the game were the occasional shooting sections which felt more like an afterthought, aiming and shooting felt a bit twitchy. It had multiple endings depending on how you played the game.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acBnLMRIAD0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acBnLMRIAD0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/acBnLMRIAD0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Blade Runner PC Game Trailer", "description": "This is a trailer for the PC game 'Blade Runner' developed by Westwood Studios and released back in 1997 by Virgin Interactive Entertainment.
