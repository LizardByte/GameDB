This game was originally based on the classic indie game bomberman and it does it great justice as its is similarly addictive! If you never played the original fear not as Blastarena.io is just as fun to play alone or with friends. \n \nHow to play \nIn the Blast arena its every man for himself, your objective is to be the last bomber standing either through killing everyone or waiting for them to kill each other! Destroy terrain to make your way around the map and collect the power ups they drop such as movement speed, extra bombs and bomb range in order to become a bigger threat. Bomb explosions can only travel in straight lines from where the bomb was placed, use this knowledge to your advantage and avoid standing in the fire or its game over! \n \nControls \n \nUse the WASD or arrow keys to navigate throughout the map and use the space bar to drop a bomb. Just remember that you can only place one bomb at a time at the start and you can be killed by anyones bombs including your own!", "themes": [{"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}]}
