You can't alter the orientation of the blocks, but by pressing fire you can rotate the colours. Once you've connected enough blocks to reduce the number at the right hand side of the screen to zero, you move on to the next level.\n\nThe instructions in the magazine state that choosing the 'Kempston Joystick' option in the menu won't work.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/block-dizzy"}
