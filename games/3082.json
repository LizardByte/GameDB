Dear Esther immerses you in a stunningly realised world, a remote and desolate island somewhere in the outer Hebrides. As you step forwards, a voice begins to read fragments of a letter: \"Dear Esther...\" - and so begins a journey through one of the most original first-person games of recent years. Abandoning traditional gameplay for a pure story-driven experience, Dear Esther fuses its beautiful environments with a breathtaking soundtrack to tell a powerful story of love, loss, guilt and redemption.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dear-esther", "videos": [{"id": 1649, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "D7VJ4lP-05A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7VJ4lP-05A", "title": "Dear Esther - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D7VJ4lP-05A/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 5696, "name": "Lost Man"}]}
