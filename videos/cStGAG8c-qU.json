The best, by far, is the open-ended sand castle activity in which children use a variety of bucket shapes and decorations to make picturesque creations. Castles are unfortunately not printable, but kids can snap pictures for an onscreen photo album. Testers enjoyed taking pictures of target animals on a scuba dive. They also liked directing Barbie through gates and up ramps on her water skis, but reported that the navigation keys could have been more responsive. Some children were entertained by Barbie's dance activity but several couldn't figure out what they were supposed to do. Babs sports some sultry dance moves, and while some adult testers found these amusing, others felt these actions were inappropriate. Largely superficial in nature, this new Barbie game is likely to be short-lived, but fun for a little while.\n\n\nBarbie Beach Vacation is a 2001 action game within the Barbie franchise, developed by Krome Studios and published by Vivendi Universal Interactive Publishing.
