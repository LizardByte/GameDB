The episode takes place immediately after the end of Half-Life 2, in the war-torn setting of City 17. The player is forced to deal with the effects of their actions during the main game. The episode is a stand-alone game; while a continuation of Half-Life 2, it does not require the original game to be installed or registered to a user's Steam account to play. It takes advantage of several major upgrades to the Source engine since the release of Half-Life 2, primarily its high dynamic range rendering capabilities and the upgraded facial animation system.\n\nEpisode One was released together with Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, a port of the original Half-Life's multiplayer, which doubles as Episode One's multiplayer component. The retail copies of Episode One also come with Half-Life 2 Deathmatch for those who have not previously purchased the later title.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/half-life-2-episode-one", "videos": [{"id": 123, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "DL_mPw7KEU8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL_mPw7KEU8", "title": "Half-Life 2 Episode 1 Trailer (2006)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DL_mPw7KEU8/hqdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 35, "name": "Half-Life"}]}
