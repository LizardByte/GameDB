A shuttle off of this rock, a big gun, or maybe a bomb shelter to hide and weather the storm. The walls of every installation are coming down and the monsters seem to have brought their own reality with them.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-magenta-spire"}
