Classic mode is a competitive battle against your friends where you take turns choosing a secret word to draw while everyone else competes to guess it as fast as possible! Blitz mode is a chaotic, cooperative race against the clock where you split into two teams, Drawers and Guessers. Drawers share a canvas and rapidly draw words while the Guessers guess as many as possible before the time runs out.", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sketch-heads--2", "videos": [{"id": 92471, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "8jD0dkCgF7k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jD0dkCgF7k", "title": "Press Play Together with Activities \u26f3\ufe0f", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8jD0dkCgF7k/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
