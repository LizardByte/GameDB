Winner of the Freeplay Award for Best Game Writing! With hilarious dialogue, charming hand-drawn art and huge replay value, it's perfect for seasoned adventurers and casual gamers alike.\n\nWhen fugitive magician Lucas MacGuffin bungles a museum robbery, he finds himself magically bound to an ancient amulet and up against a city in full high-tech security lockdown. Suddenly dealing with the worst body hair problems he's ever had. As a human, Lucas is agile and cunning. Wolf Lucas would rather smash anything in his way. Only by transforming between the two forms and cleverly utilising both sets of skills will he stand any chance of lifting his curse.\n\nAnd with the city's most powerful billionaire after his blood, a jaded Private Investigator on his (now-literal) tail and the rent long overdue, he'll need every ounce of ingenuity he manage.\n\nAlong the way he'll need to befriend a hilarious cast of characters, convince the city its most beloved citizen is a terrifying criminal mastermind, and hardest of all, teach his daughter it isn't funny to fill the fridge with dog food.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/macguffins-curse"}
