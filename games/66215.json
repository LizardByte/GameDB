Rami and Pochi swim off the beaten path to an abandoned shrine. After blowing up the ground and reaching the disclosed location, they reach a door with a powerful seal that they can't open. Just when they think that they are empty-handed, Pochi finds a ring with the same seal as the one on the locked door, which turns out to be one of King Solomon's Treasures, with the rest hidden somewhere around Japan. Rami now travels around Japan to go through all the leads on the rest of Solomon's Treasures, with Dr. Pon tracking her every move.", "summary": "A puzzle game in the Keio Flying Squadron franchise.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/ranma-chan-no-ooeto-surogoku-keio-yugekitai-gaiden", "videos": [{"id": 100897, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "eZkHP3w7wk8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZkHP3w7wk8", "title": "Kei\u014d Y\u016bgekitai Gaiden [\u6176\u5fdc\u904a\u6483\u968a\u5916\u4f1d] Game Sample - Playstation", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZkHP3w7wk8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
