Numbering from half-a-dozen to a thousand or more individually-simulated people, your crew will pilot your ships, operate their weapons, and carry munitions. How efficiently they operate determines how well your ships will perform in combat. Your crew are autonomous but you can optionally customize their behavior with specific roles and job priorities.\n\nCommand your ship or fleet in real-time tactical battles. Combat is physics-driven, explosive, and immensely satisfying. Each module can be individually targeted and destroyed, and whole ships can even break apart into multiple pieces. Target an enemy's weapons to eliminate its offensive capability, destroy its shields to lower its defenses, or go for the kill by taking out its reactor.\n\nBecome the most famous \"Cosmoteer'' in the universe by battling A.I. ships, taking on contracts for factions, earning loot, and upgrading your own ship while exploring a procedurally-generated galaxy, alone or in online co-op with friends. Then test your ships design and command skills online against other players in multiple PvP battle modes. Or let your imagination fly free in the Creative Mode where you can build whatever you want with unlimited resources.", "summary": "A starship builder perfect for fans of games like FTL, Starsector, SPAZ, Space Engineers, Escape Velocity, Avorion, and more.\n\nDesign awesome starships using intuitive ship creation tools that are easy to learn but hard to master. Fully customize your ship's shape and floor plan, choosing where to place individual modules including weapons, engines, hallways, and crew's quarters. Your ship's design is key to its survival, and every decision you make will impact its performance in battle.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cosmoteer-starship-architect-and-commander", "videos": [{"id": 129443, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "6pyG2i6fA2g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pyG2i6fA2g", "title": "Cosmoteer Gameplay Trailer (2022)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pyG2i6fA2g/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 129444, "name": "Cinematic Trailer", "video_id": "pKoRInlSiBY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKoRInlSiBY", "title": "Cosmoteer Gameplay Trailer (2023)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pKoRInlSiBY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
