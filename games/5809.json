The character is armed with 4 default weapons; a knife, a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun. Other weapons that can be found are TNT and Whisky bombs. The player can shoot objects such as whisky bottles, cans and enemies to score legend points, thus filling up the \"trick shot\" meter that lets the character use the secondary mode of firing which varies depending on the current weapon. The combat in the game also makes use of the game's physics engine, with the player being able to trigger physics based traps such as shooting a rock and causing it to fall onto an enemy below - kills obtained this way are rewarded with extra points and a greater increase in the \"trick shot\" meter. Dead Man's Hand is noteworthy for featuring a protagonist of Hispanic (or Mestizo) descent.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-man-s-hand", "videos": [{"id": 87908, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "aAz6Zw9LpP8"}, {"id": 87907, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "2MDmjnv7p_A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MDmjnv7p_A", "title": "Dead Man's Hand Trailer - Xbox PC Windows Video Game", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2MDmjnv7p_A/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "characters": [{"id": 1640, "name": "Voice Actor"}]}
