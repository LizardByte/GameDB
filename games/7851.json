Stop off on several planets on your journey, collect the odd sack of precious gems, elements or gold, and take them back with you.\n\nSounds simple doesn't it!\n\nBut before you make yourself the richest person in the whole Universe, remember to refuel your Spaceship - with 6 fuel pods - every time you land on a planet. Any other goodies you collect are yours to keep. Upon landing, you will find yourself equipped with the very latest Hydrovac Jet Pac, which can automatically air lift almost any rocket\nstage, fuel pod or valuables that you care to land upon, and release them over the rocket ship base. Don't forget your mega-powerful, Quad Photon Laser Phasers can blast any nasty, mean aliens who might object to your visit.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jetpac", "videos": [{"id": 109538, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "fN096U4setY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN096U4setY", "title": "Jetpac for the Commodore VIC-20 / Commodore VC-20", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fN096U4setY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
