The players mission is to find and reach the finish line under 70 seconds. The player also has to avoid damageable obstacles like spikes and bombs. There are also several AI police cars which the player also needs avoid. Police cars will start to chase the player immediately when map starts \nThe player can choose from 4 different cars, which all have their own tracks. The player can choose from the following cars: Formula 1 car, Crosskart car, Rally car and GT race car. \nThe player has a health system and colliding with spikes and bombs recudes health. Hitting to police car will immediately end the game. \nSo be fast and avoid damage inducing objects. For now the game contains 23 tracks.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/70-seconds-survival"}
