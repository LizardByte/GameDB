Anubis sent the humans a huge ship - a magnified version of Noah's Ark - and demanded that one man and one woman should dedicate their time to saving the animals. A whole special team has been assigned to the project. Ken is one of the youngest members of the team, and he is sent on the grand mission to save the animals, together with his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Linda.", "summary": "Linda 3 Kanzenban is a slightly different version of Linda 3 Again - which, in its turn, is a remake of the PC Engine CD original version.\n\nFor the most part, the game looks, sounds, and plays exactly the same as the Playstation remake.
