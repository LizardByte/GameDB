Zangief moves noticeably faster in this game, and E. Honda can pull off Hadokens when performing his Hyakuretsu Harite.\n\nThe graphics and music are identical to those in the original game aside from the title's logo, which is now rainbow-coloured, which is where this hack gets its name from.\n\nAlthough there are many different revisions of this hack readily dumped and emulated, several versions are still left undumped. The rampant craziness with these hacks and the popularity of arcade distributors putting these hacks in machines was one of the reasons behind the creation of the legitimate Street Fighter II: Turbo Hyper Fighting update.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/street-fighter-ii-rainbow-edition"}
