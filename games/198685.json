Lots of it. That's not all though -- the maps from the original game are being redesigned too. Note: I'm not the mod's developer. Credit goes to Zio McCall for the concept, development, as well as the various contributors. I just felt that this mod needed a place here.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/brutal-wolfenstein-3d", "videos": [{"id": 67409, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "5msRfphQHaE"}]}
