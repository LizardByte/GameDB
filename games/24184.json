Tokyo is plunged into chaos and now two more cities want to compete: Osaka and Nagoya. The racers here will have to beat every team in these 3 cities, and maybe, have the opportunity to challenge the best drivers in each: Speed King & Dejected Angel in Tokyo, Seeks, Genesis R & D3 in Nagoya and No Loser & Darts in Osaka.", "summary": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 (or \u9996\u90fd\u9ad8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb 01 in the Japanese release) was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 as part of Genki's Shutokou Battle series. This entry in the series was released two years after the previous game, Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero.\n\nMuch like other entries in the series, the objective is to become the fastest racer on the highways of Japan, but unlike those before it, TXR3 allows the players to race in Nagoya and Osaka instead of just Tokyo, and the Tokyo map is expanded to include the Yokohama area. In addition, this title adds a weather cycle.\n\nTXR3 includes a fully-licensed list of cars from a variety of Japanese, American, and European manufacturers instead of the old car model designation method of \"Type-(technical model name)\", and furthermore, the car list itself was culled of many repeat models so to simplify and reduce the number of cars. The A, B, and C car designations were also removed.\n\nGraphically speaking, Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 is a definite improvement over previous entries. Car models feature a higher polygon count and are much more extensively detailed and lighting effects were also greatly improved, featuring light streaking effects, road reflections and higher quality car reflections.", "videos": [{"id": 74362, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "HZ2vo2ZNmVI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ2vo2ZNmVI", "title": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 Intro (High Quality)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HZ2vo2ZNmVI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 74363, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "AS1oKfvVv2U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS1oKfvVv2U", "title": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 PS2 Gameplay HD (PCSX2)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AS1oKfvVv2U/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
