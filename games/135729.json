There\u2019s competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to arrive at \neach one has an advantage over the rest. \n \nUsing those workers and visitors, you can expand your vineyard by building structures, planting vines, \nand filling wine orders as you work towards the goal of owning the most successful winery in Tuscany.", "summary": "This is the official digital adaption of the boardgame Viticulture by Jamey Stegmaier & Alan Stone."}
