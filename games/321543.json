The year is 2060 and it is forbidden to fly above this limit. Pilots call this stretch from 500 feet to outer space \u2018Artemis\u2019s hymen\u2019. Now a group of people operate a transport agency from the abandoned building that was to be the New Third Tokyo International Airport (nicknamed Edowanzu). They wish to fly higher than what is permitted by aviation laws.\n\nHaru is a cheerful, honest, polite and hardworking girl who always wanted to become a pilot. Following her dream, she went overseas after graduating from high school and earned her pilot license after two years in an aviation school in San Diego. She applied to become a co-pilot and got an interview with the Kubo Air Transport Agency. There she met Katsura Keima, the test pilot who had broken the impenetrable barrier in Project Ikaros five years ago.", "themes": [{"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/artemis-blue"}
