The copy i play is from the \"Thrill Time: Platinum 2\" compilation.\n\nGreat title music by Mark Cooksey, i remember it very well even if it's been over 20 years i played this game last time :-)\n\nOne of the better ST games i played when i was young, i never completed it back then and i did not do it for this video either :-)\nThe game is not really too difficult, it is all about memorizing where the fuel barrels are, tha actual action part (shooting) is secondary and not needed to complete the game except for the rockets wich blow up gates (and also to be used at the end). The enemy boats are very easy to avoid.\n\nIt has a very strong \"just one more try\" feeling.\n\nThere is only one mission wich is part of the James Bond movie story, the other two missions (North pole and Sahara) are only mentioned as \"training missions\" in the game, that game manual does not even mention them at all.\nI wonder if they planned on doing another game and then they got the James Bond license and could only keep one mission as it is like in the movie? \n\nI think this game uses the same graphics engine as \"Buggy Boy\" because they are so similar and also programmed by the same guy :-)\n\nRecorded from my Atari STFM using SC-500n1 RGB capturecard.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M8Sd3Z3aB1A/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M8Sd3Z3aB1A/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M8Sd3Z3aB1A/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M8Sd3Z3aB1A/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Live and Let Die - [Atari ST] Gameplay (1988)", "description": "Showing some gameplay from the rather good Atari ST game \"Live and Let Die\" (based on the James Bond movie).\nReleased by Elite in 1988.
