Contestants were given 24 hours to create a level based around the contents of a virtual mystery box, filled with a random selection of 2 enemies and 2 gimmicks from the official Mega Man games. There was no guarantee that any of these assets would make sense or work well together, so it was up to the contestants to make the most of what they had been given.\n\nDespite some rough edges owing to the time constraint, the levels are on par with anything you'd find in any other MaGMML game. However, the game itself is very short and extremely light on bonus features; there's no hub world to explore or extensive postgame content to delve into. 24H is less a traditional MaGMML and more a proof of concept for Make a Good 48 Hour Mega Man Level, so please set your expectations accordingly for maximum enjoyment.\n\n24H has no story or cutscenes of any kind, but the game technically takes place at the same time as Episode Zero, with the premise being that Mega Man is testing the simulation technology used in MaGMML2.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/make-a-good-24-hour-mega-man-level"}
