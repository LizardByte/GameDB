It gets predictably surreal from there. You can choose to lead him to the darkest pits of his mind... or just break a bunch of stuff with a metal baseball bat. Either way, something or someone's gonna get beaten up.\n\nExpiate is a mostly traditional Yume Nikki fangame, with some slight alterations to the formula. Effects are a part of the game, but collecting them is not your main focus. Instead, use effects and explore to look for strange objects located around the dreamworld. Gather these items in order to progress."}
