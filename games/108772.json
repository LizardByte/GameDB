The game can be played in either first person, third person, or fixed camera angle views. Kei's levels are more action based, while Reina's are more adventure-based. \n \nThere is also a unique multiplayer cooperative mode where one player controls Kei and the other Reina. This mode is different from the single-player mode, as it is much shorter and objectives, monsters, and events are all altered.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nanatsu-no-hikan-senritsu-no-bishou"}
