Today I am proud to announce that the upcoming action-adventure game 1428: Shadows over Silesia will be fully accessible to blind players. \n\nThis will make it the first game ever on PC to bring full blind support to an adventure of this scale. We're not talking about just some of the in-game text being read or about some kind of rudimentary navigation. The game will bring all-new revolutionary elements that will allow the blind to enjoy a full experience not only of the story, dialogue and exploring the environment, but also stealth passages or combat, including large scale battles! \n\nMore information on accessibility for the blind at https://blind.shadows1428.com\n\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228500\nGog: https://www.gog.com/game/1428_shadows_over_silesia\nWebsite: https://shadows1428.com/cs\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/avabBNY\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KUBIGames\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/1428_shadows_over_silesia/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shadows1428\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/kubigames2013\n\n#accessibility #gameaccessibility #a11y #blindaccessibility", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lxsQWzbPIIE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lxsQWzbPIIE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lxsQWzbPIIE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lxsQWzbPIIE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lxsQWzbPIIE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "1428: SHADOWS OVER SILESIA - Blind Accessibility Audio Trailer", "description": "A new era of gaming has begun.
