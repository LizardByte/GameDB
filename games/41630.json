While using the spell, he can't move though.\nFinally, the female-ninja is specialized in using Fire and the Boomerang and she has the ability to jump. The choice of the character is really important because each plays very differently and each should have a dedicated ending sequence.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/undeadline"}
