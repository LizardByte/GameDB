{"id": "zbk3xNMGbvw", "snippet": {"title": "Blackwyche Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game in 1985.\n\nWhilst sailing upon the ocean seas, the dashing Sir Arthur Pendragon encounters a ghostly galleon. With no sign of any crew, the intrepid adventurer deigns to climb aboard to discover the reasons as to why the ship happens to be floating aimlessly in the middle of the ocean.\n\nIt doesn't take long to realise that the vessel is haunted, the crew slain and the captain's soul trapped by the supernatural forces that befell the ship. As Sir Arthur, it is your job to find the captain and free him from this eternal prison.\n\nThe location of the captain is a closely guarded secret that can only be revealed by locating four separate pieces of a map, each of which are located across the five different decks of the ship. The map pieces themselves are hidden behind a series of puzzles, each of which require specific items to be found before the map piece can be collected.\n\nEach deck consists of a series of rooms interconnected by lengthy corridors. With as many as six rooms per deck, the game becomes an exercise in mapping and remembering where things are located; there will be much toing and froing between decks if you are to solve the puzzles.\n\nAs one might expect from a haunted ship, ghostly apparitions patrol the walkways and will drain Arthur's life force should he come into contact with them. Although unarmed, a magical sword can be found that allows Sir Arthur to combat these foes; one touch of the blade is enough to turn enemies to cloud of phantasmic vapour.\n\nUnfortunately, swordsmanship will only help Arthur so far. A sharp sword won't help him to avoid the many broken boards in the deck floor; one wrong move will see Arthur falling through the floor to the next deck, losing energy in the process. Pressing space bar will toggle between the sword and the ability to jump, allowing Arthur to bypass these traps on his mission for the map.\n\nBlackwyche isn't a game for the faint of heart. Monsters and traps sap health extremely quickly and it's easy to get lost in the bowels of the ship; the player will be greeted often to the sight of a giant, skeletal hand coming to carry a defeated Arthur away to the nether-realm.\n\nThe game's puzzles are tough to solve as there's no explanation as to what any of the items in the game are for, or where they're meant to be used. Certain items are hidden within parts of the scenery (e.g. sacks of grain), or require Arthur to wave the sword in exactly the right place to interact with the object. Even discovering the purpose of the bell on the first deck is an achievement!\n\nThe game is really well presented and possesses some brilliant scrolling backgrounds that really make the player feel like their on a (slightly pixelly) boat! Arthur is well animated and even has a cloak that moves as he walks about, top stuff for 1985!\n\nThe game possesses some suitably spooky sound effects and music. The opening title tune is short yet dramatic and the gradual fade as the game begins is a really nice touch. In fact, the mad plinking sound made when monsters sap Arthur's energy used to get me in such a panic that I eventually refused to play the game altogether.\n\nWhilst enjoyment of the game is affected by the obscurity of the puzzles, it certainly doesn't stop it from being one of the most memorable games in the C64's extensive library.\n#retrogaming", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbk3xNMGbvw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbk3xNMGbvw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbk3xNMGbvw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbk3xNMGbvw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zbk3xNMGbvw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Blackwyche Longplay (C64) [50 FPS]", "description": "Developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game in 1985.\n\nWhilst sailing upon the ocean seas, the dashing Sir Arthur Pendragon encounters a ghostly galleon.
