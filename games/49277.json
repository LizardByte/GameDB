The scent of despair hung thickly in the air, all hope of survival having been quashed.\n\nBut then, from out of the darkness of the mourning clouds came a single bright light in the sky.\n\n\"Silverhawk.........\"\n\nLike a phoenix brought forth from the embers of a burning world, the bird shaped visage became a beacon of the planet's last fight for survival!

This game is a remixed version of Darius, which reuses assets from the original game.\n\nDue to the small resolution of the GBA, and since the game never scales the large Arcade sprites, the camera follows the the player up and down to compensate. While the first stage is more or less based on the first stage from the original game, the remaining stages are all exclusive to this title, featuring unique background graphics and remixed tracks from previous titles in the series. Stages can be replayed once they are beaten in the regular Arcade Mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/darius-r", "videos": [{"id": 47926, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "mL1ckgNx99k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL1ckgNx99k", "title": "Darius R ( \u30c0\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9 R).
