Players pick between one of four characters, each with their own dedicated pinball table. The game then moves to a split-screen view, where both players play their respective table and try to get a higher score than their opponent.\n\nOther options include a 1-player \"story\" mode where the player selects a character and battles the other three. Winning here gives a character-specific CG victory movie. Players can also play against multiple opponents in a tournament mode (complete with brackets), though a maximum of two players will be playing at once. As with Real Pinball, the view angle is fixed and cannot be changed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-pinball"}
