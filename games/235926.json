Work hard, study hard, and play hard as a royal in training at the exclusive Archambault Academy. Will you rule the roost, or be a royal disaster?\n\nAs the middle child of the Queen of Westerlin, you've led a sheltered life in the palace, but now you must spread your wings and prepare for your royal responsibilities with a year at the exclusive Archambault Academy.\n\nEveryone knows your name, everyone has an opinion on what you do, and everyone views you as the face of the new generation of royalty. Your every move is reported in the press, a word from you could make or break a teacher's career\u2014or the fate of the school itself. You\u2019re being courted by every club and social group on campus; and there are countless students who would love to be in your orbit.\n\nIn luxurious armchairs behind ivy-covered walls, you and your fellow students debate political theory\u2014but outside, real trouble simmers across the realm. There are activists fighting to open voting rights beyond the aristocracy, and you can use your influence to sway the government's decision in either direction. Relations are growing increasingly uneasy with your country's neighbors, and there are conspiracies around every corner. Why is your mother whispering behind closed doors with the Prime Minister? Have the leaders of the protests really disappeared? Which allies can you trust? There are some secrets that only your royal authority can uncover.\n\nWill you honor centuries of royal tradition and follow the path that your mother the Queen has laid out for you? Or will you be a force of change, leading your country in a new direction as you break free of a lifetime of expectations?\n\nOh, and speaking of expectations\u2014there's also the foreign royal that your mother wants you to marry. Who is in your class. And who happens to hate you.", "summary": "At your exclusive boarding school, will you rule the roost or be a royal disaster?
