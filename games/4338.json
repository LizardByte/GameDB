Players start off with a $5,000 loan in the retail version, or a $20,000 loan in the school version.[1] The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure.[1] Once the loan is paid off, players may expand the park and earn profits. If players are confused, an animated dinosaur appears and guides the players through the game.[1]\n\nPlayers then visit supply stores to buy the necessary items for park maintenance. The food store provides meat for carnivores, plants for herbivores and seeds for planting. The general store provides fences for the dinosaur pens, with varying degrees of strength and price; concessions such as bathrooms, gift shops and parking lots; and advertising, which is bought per season. The employment office offers the personnel to run the park, and Dino City retails the dinosaurs for the exhibits.\n\nAs time passes, players face problems such as escaping dinosaurs, sick employees, and seasonal attendance declines. According to Atari, \"Keeping the staff paid and the dinos fed and healthy is an ongoing task that requires kids to analyze graphs and numbers and make decisions based on their assumptions. The trick is to scratch out enough profit to expand the park with capital improvements and bigger and better dinosaurs.\"[1] After paying off the loan, players may choose to sell their park; if it has been successful, the player achieves an onscreen award and an entry on the top scores list.", "summary": "DynoPark tycoon is a Sim Park style game except it contains live dinosaurs. Through the advanced cloning technology, you are able to bring the real dinosaurs back to life, and what is more important, make a lots of money on tourism. The game is pretty similar to other Park management games with an impressive economy model, except it is a little more funny. You must buy an area of land in your park to house a dinosaur, you put fencing around it, so your dinosaur does not escape and then finally, you choose your own dinosaur to place in it. But be really sure not to place two enemies next to each other or even T-Rex next to something tasty, thing can turn up pretty nasty for you or your visitors.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dinopark-tycoon", "videos": [{"id": 30935, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "Q8El8qDbKac"}]}
