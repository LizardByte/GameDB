The three of them are sat on a planet as they cast their lines. The king manages to accidentally hook a large bath plug with his fishing rod, pulling it out of the hole. This causes a black hole to form and begin pulling in the surrounding objects.\n\nThe King and Queen pause to stare at each other for a brief moment before flying off, leaving The Prince alone to sort it out. The scene closes out onto The Prince's face, showing him looking irate in a comical moment.", "summary": "Katamari Damacy Online ~Roll it! Prince!~ was a Korean game and the first game developed by Blue Bird Studio; a division of Windysoft (now known as JUNEiNTER). Katamari Damacy Online was opened for beta testing late 2007 and ran for around 4-5 years, shutting down on February 24, 2012. The game started with many beta tests before being officially released. Not a lot of information was recorded during it's lifespan, but there exists still news articles and recordings of gameplay.\n\nKatamari Damacy Online had multiple maps, including stages from previous games (such as the CowBear level from We Love Katamari). Multiplayer maps were also reused from the Playstation 2 and Playstation Portable Katamari games. There were supposedly also minigames for the players available.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/katamari-online", "videos": [{"id": 87086, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2IHaFric8lc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IHaFric8lc", "title": "\uad34\ud63c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 (Katamari damacy online, \u584a\u9b42 Online) 2\ucc28 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc601\uc0c1 01", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2IHaFric8lc/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
