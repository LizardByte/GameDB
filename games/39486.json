But countless games where Ralph has played the villain has taken its toll, and after becoming the outcast of his mostly-wrecked town, Ralph is ready to look for more out of his pixelated life.\n\nDuring the promotional campaign for the movie, multiple defictionalised versions of the game were released by Disney for Ralph fans to play, including arcade machines at trade shows.
