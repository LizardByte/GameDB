I remember getting this game back in a thrift store when I was little. I remember having loads of fun with it! This has to be my favorite Thomas & Friends game, besides the Kids Station PS1 Thomas game. I just love the fact that you can not only just play as Thomas, Percy and James, but Emily and Molly too (who are both underrated characters IMO)! When I first tested recording this game, there were some weird screen glitchy things going on, and that was probably cause of the old capture card I had, so I got a new one and now it's perfectly fine. I apologize for such a long video, I still hope you enjoyed it nonetheless!\n\nCustom thumbnail by me\n\nFollow me on DeviantArt:\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/percysailormoon2002\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/PASMF2002    \n\nFollow me on Tumblr:\nhttps://www.tumblr.com/percysailormoon2002\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
