Created by Double Fine's lead animator, Tasha Harris, the game follows the adventure of a group of young friends who must rid their neighborhood of monsters using only their wits, their bravery, and their home-made costumes. Players go door-to-door collecting candy, points, cards, battle stamps and quest assignments as they prepare themselves for Combat Mode-where they transform into larger-than-life versions of their costumes. Each costume that comes-to-life provides its own unique set of superpowers that players will need to battle Halloweens worst monsters.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/costume-quest", "videos": [{"id": 2100, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "IJcVECLkHvg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJcVECLkHvg", "title": "Costume Quest: Launch Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IJcVECLkHvg/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 2101, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "IaSj3x28LZ8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSj3x28LZ8", "title": "Trick or Treat! | Let's Play Costume Quest | Part 1 [Playthrough Walkthrough Gameplay]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IaSj3x28LZ8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
