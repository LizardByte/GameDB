The hack features 11 levels with a unique visual style and focus on being around 30-45 seconds per section before getting a midway or beating the level. Trolls in the game are light hearted and used sparingly.\n\nThis hack features:\n- Soundtrack with nine new ports that I've done myself, including two original songs I wrote.\n- No boss fights.\n- No secret exits, all secrets are shoutouts to some of the streamers I enjoy watching or memes.\n- Some chocolate in the form of custom blocks, custom sprites and some level specific gimmicks.\n- Quality of life patches such as frame rule, spin throw direction, dtothefourth's retry system featured in Mostly Harmless and more.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/el-dorado--1"}
