Spike brought the skull to his teacher and it is from here that our ghostly tale unfolds...The skull ended up being a beacon, a homing device for all the spirits and monsters from the realm of the dead. These ghouls from a land downunder have sort of captured your dream girl Samantha Pompom, the beautiful head cheerleader of the school. She's being held somewhere in the school and you've got to find her.
