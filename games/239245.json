In some the ball bounces with a different sound, as it would in reality (sounds were hand recorded using dozens of different rubber balls on several different surfaces).\nThat simplicity is the heart of Go Go Redball. Bouncing a ball is soothing and relaxing, allowing the mind to wander. As it does, creativity takes over. It's a great way to relive stress or solve nagging problems.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/go-go-redball"}
