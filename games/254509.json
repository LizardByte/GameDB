Developed by ACE Team, it was originally drawn and designed in 1989 for a Mac Plus, but it didn't see the light until April 2009, when it was created as a free flash game. The game also serves as a bit of viral marketing for the team's first commercial game, Zeno Clash.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/malstrums-mansion", "videos": [{"id": 92543, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "wfpgp20VGPk"}]}
