The game and puzzles are quite absurd, but strangely addictive. Some inside scoop from developer Naughty Dog's website: \"Keef was a classic sword and scorcery role-playing game. While we were making it, Andy entered sarcastic text as a place holder for what we believed would be the real text in the final release. EA liked the humor so much that they decided to make the entire game a comedy. The effect that this decision had on sales was no joke, however.\"", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/keef-the-thief-a-boy-and-his-lockpick", "videos": [{"id": 30957, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "TdDD650pVy0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdDD650pVy0", "title": "Keef the Thief - A Boy and His Lockpick (1989) PC FPA Adventure", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TdDD650pVy0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
