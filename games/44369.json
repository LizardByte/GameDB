Bee assassins, dragonflies, and spider webs are all out to get you. Dragonflies fly around the screen. Bee assassins skip from flower to flower. Spider webs are static, but make navigating nearby very hazardous. \n \nFrom time to time, a bear wanders by. If the speech synthesizer is attached, you'll hear it say, \"Time to get the honey!\" You must return to your hive to defend it. Simply being present in the hive is sufficient to ward off the bear.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/honey-hunt"}
