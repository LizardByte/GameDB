Two weeks after it was launched, it was obvious that the German forces were spent and little more could be achieved. On December 5th, 1941 aided by plummeting temperatures the Soviets launched what were first limited attacks, but quickly grew into front wide offensives that would last for close to three months. By the end of the Soviet offensives, Moscow was saved, but at what cost? \n \nMoscow '42 is two games in one. Following on from the German Operation Typhoon portrayed in Moscow '41, Moscow '42 includes the historical Soviet 1941/42 winter counter offensive that almost destroyed Heeresgruppe Mitte in front of Moscow. \n \nIn addition the hypothetical Fall Kreml (Operation Kremlin in English) is included. Operation Kremlin was an extensive deception campaign that the Axis enacted to distract from Fall Blau (Operation Blue) the German 1942 summer offensive in the Ukraine and Caucasus. What if Fall Kreml was real? What if the Axis attempted to capture Moscow again using the historical forces available in the summer of 1942? A range of campaigns & scenarios are included to allow players to investigate this historical possibility.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
