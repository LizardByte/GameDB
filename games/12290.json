The player must choose one of about five circuits to work on in one of the ship's critical systems: Engine, Power, Communications, Life Support, and the HAL 9000. Successful power routing of a circuit makes each system slowly come on-line. It takes three powered circuits for minimum function, but four provides more leeway for success.\n\nOn-Line engines and power can be activated for an orbital boost, but too long a burn will damage circuit components. HAL 9000 can power undamaged circuits you assign to him, although at a much slower pace than the player. Communications allow a powered HAL 9000 to inform you of success/failure at powering a circuit assigned to him. Life Support gives more protection against EMPs damaging powered circuits, which require repair and repowering.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/2010-the-graphic-action-game", "videos": [{"id": 129250, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "yrnvs2J3ehE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrnvs2J3ehE", "title": "[TAS] Coleco 2010: The Graphic Action Game by Darkman425 in 05:40.37", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yrnvs2J3ehE/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
