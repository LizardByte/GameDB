However, Alex uses a jetpack for jumping which allows travel longer distances per jump as usual. The jetpack only has a limited amount of fuel which is refilled when touching the ground. Reaching a checkpoint has two significances: Alex respawns here after death and it shoots away a part of the background. After reaching the end of the level, the whole background image is exposed and a Goddess freed. The player has an infinite amount of tries to master the challenges of the nine levels.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/uncraft-me"}
