Great control, better balanced difficulty and a music soundtrack to die for. Plus you get to drive the Batmobile and Batplane which I feel was sorely missed from the NES game sadly. While I love this game and the NES game equally, finding this game nowadays on actual cartridge is a feat since it seems to be rather rare. Either way whether you play it on the cartride (like I did for this video) or on emulator this game is well worth the time and effort to play. A true classic! \n\n\nHope you enjoy!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vth3HyH_yyY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vth3HyH_yyY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vth3HyH_yyY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Batman Playthrough (SEGA GENESIS/MEGA DRIVE)", "description": "While there was many Batman games based on the 1989 movie I would argue that this game is arguably the best of the bunch being contested by the NES game only.
