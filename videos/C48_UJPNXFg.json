You have to study the map that is included with the original game, and then plan your route through the 3 stages. Each stage has multiple routes, so the game can be completed in several ways. Only the top seven competitors can proceed from Stage I to II, and just the top five go through to Stage III from Stage II. \n\nEach stage contains a number of Time Controls (these are marked on the map which accompanies the game). To make a stop here you have to stop between the two lines on the road.\n\nOriginal map: https://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-maps/r/RallyDriver_2.jpg\nImproved map: https://www.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-maps/r/RallyDriver.jpg\n\nYou must drive through each Time Control in order to complete the stage. Somewhere before, close to the Time Control is a Passage Control - A Passage Control is simply a notice board with two letters written on it. You do not have to stop in order to find out what the letters on the board are, but you must be driving at at less than 45 m.p.h. You should make a note of these letters to avoid incurring time penalties at the next Time Control. If you drive past a Passage Control at faster than 45 m.p.h. your navigator will not be able to read the letters and you will not be told which letters they were.\n\nSometimes the weather conditions will cause roads to be closed. For instance after heavy rain some roads may become flooded. To find out which roads are closed and which are open you must stop at the Time Controls. Here the marshals will inform you of any changes to road conditions.\n\nThese are the three different weather conditions for the stages:\nDry - Conditions good for rallying; roads firm, few pools of water or patches of mud.\nDamp - Roads wet and greasy; some pools of water or patches of mud may cause skidding.\nVery wet - Danger of flooding on some roads.\n\nPenalty:\n1. Crashing your car (30 seconds, or 5 minutes if you were travelling too fast)\n2. Going off the allowed roads (30 seconds)\n3. Trying to go in the wrong direction (30 seconds)\n4. Hitting animals or people (5 minute)\n5. If you do not enter the correct letters a the Time Control (20 seconds)\n6. If you do not stop at the Time Control (50 seconds)\n\nKeys:\nSPACE    Cycle through choices\nENTER    Confirms choice\n1              Steer left - Will not work at junctions\n0              Steer right - Will not work at junctions\nQ             Turn left in to junction - Will not work above 25 m.p.h.\nO             Turn right in to junction - Will not work above 25 m.p.h.\n9              Accelerate\n2              Brake\n3              Handbrake on/off\nS-K          (any key) Sound horn\n\nJoystick Controls\nUp            Accelerate (same as 9)\nRight        Turn right (same as 0)\nDown       Brake (same as 2)\nFire          Apply/release handbrake (same as 3)\nLeft          Turn left (same as 1)\nCAPS A   Starts the program again\n\nWhen the game starts you have to press \u201c3\u201d for releasing the handbrake, then give gas with \u201c9\u201d and steer left and right with \u201c1\u201d and \u201c0\u201d.\n\nUse \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cO\u201d for turning into a different road. This will not work above 25 m.p.h. but if you use the handbrake you might be allowed to drive a little faster, and if you are having problems turning it is always easier if you also use the handbrake.\n\nThe \u201cS\u201d or \u201cK\u201d for using the horn is important, because you have to use the horn when there is a cow or people on the road. You will hit these if you don\u2019t use the horn!\n\nThis is an incredible advanced driving simulator considering it is from 1984! The maps available is not 100% accurate and this does off course cause some problems here and there, but this problem could be solved by correcting the maps, though it does not solve the problem that there is no pause key, so you have to keep an eye on the map while driving, which is not very easy.\n\nThe Passage Controls are not on the map, so they just pop up, and then it might be too late for lowering the speed to 45 m.p.h. to read the sign. But remember \u2013 They are always placed quite close to the Time Controls.\n\nIt is a game that takes some time to get into, it is nice looking and runs at descent speed, and it is one of the first rally simulators for home computers.\n\nThe game was published by Hill MacGibbon in 1984.\n\nRating = 85%\n\nDownload here: https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/index.php?cat=96&id=4005", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C48_UJPNXFg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C48_UJPNXFg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C48_UJPNXFg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C48_UJPNXFg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Rally Driver (1984) Walkthrough + Review, ZX Spectrum", "description": "Huge playlist archive with Racing games: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxOanVBhqd3vkkE35mCw6x63QFBnU9Xsi\nWhen released this was a very advanced rally simulator for the time being.
