You start with a squad of 12 players, whose names can be changed, but have room for 15 players in total, with chances to buy and sell players. You can take out a bank loan, the level of which depends on your division.\n\nThe team's formation can be customised, and as outfield players are not limited to a single position, you can customise the team's strengths and weaknesses in quite a precise way. Matches are played out by listing scorers as they happen, and are followed by a full list of the division's other results. Finances change after each match to wages, gate receipts, and possible incidents such as riots and illegal player approaches.", "themes": [{"id": 28, "name": "Business"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-boss", "videos": [{"id": 126856, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "D1bTLwR8390", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1bTLwR8390", "title": "The Boss / Soccer Boss (ZX Spectrum)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D1bTLwR8390/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
