{"id": "_5atsPAqPos", "snippet": {"title": "Williams DEFENDER Arcade Game - Inspired Modern Remake for the PC", "description": "NEW IOS VERSION\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfLoYzdZnA\n\nThis is a modern remake of the original Defender Game. Williams Defender was released in 1981 as a ground breaking Space Shooter. One of the first side scrolling arcade space shooters Williams Defender saw amazing popularity across the world. I have gracefully reproduced the feel of Williams Defender in my version, DEFENDER 3D.\n\nDEFENDER 3D brings the original concept of Williams Defender right up to date for the modern PC gamer. DEFENDER 3D allows the player to play a very similar feeling game as Defender with modern enhancements such as a selection of ships to choose from which encourages a class based system, decision making AI that will change skill levels depending or your chosen play style and an enhanced Scanner system which while this resembles the original scanner from Williams Defender, my scanner works on a 3D detection and location system which could never have been possible with the original arcade version of Defender.\n\nDEFENDER 3D is playable through Steam on PC. The control set up allows you to play DEFENDER 3D with keyboard or using a Xbox 360 controller plugged in to your PC USB. The controls are smooth fluid and after very little practice, feel very intuitive.\n\nI have also included ideas from the original Williams Defender such as the Smart Bomb system. This allows you to attack the alien crafts with a large centralised explosion. The smart bomb works on a timer system so you can not drop them too often.\n\nHealth and skill levels in DEFENDER 3D are dependant or your selection and will encourage you to get better without a heavy learning curve.\n\nWhile DEFENDER 3D is not exactly the same as the original Williams Defender, my approach to the build of this game has been to take the original idea of Williams Defender and bring it right up to date with a modern feel expected by the game of today.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback so please like and comment below.\n\nThe game is on sale right now on Steam at:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/928230/DEFENDER_3D/\n\nand you can see future progress on the DEFENDER 3D website at\n\nhttps://bazmitch.com/Williams-Defender-for-Mobile\n\nJoin my DISCORD\nhttps://discord.gg/eQQxUzqdpc", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_5atsPAqPos/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_5atsPAqPos/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_5atsPAqPos/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_5atsPAqPos/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_5atsPAqPos/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Williams DEFENDER Arcade Game - Inspired Modern Remake for the PC", "description": "NEW IOS VERSION\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfLoYzdZnA\n\nThis is a modern remake of the original Defender Game.
