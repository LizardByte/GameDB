Otherwise known as the \"Sovereign Military Order of the Holy Knights Templar\".\nThey are both secret police and praetorian guard to the church, ruthlessly broken down, conditioned, and trained into the most fanatical and disciplined super soldiers in the\nworld. With almost limitless authority and a burning hatred for anything but total commitment to their faith, they decide who lives and who dies in this world.\nYou are of course one of these men. You hold the rank of Master, subordinate only to the Grand Master himself. A warrior General, you are never seen without a mask concealing\nyour identity and rarely without the heavy black armor that is the uniform of the Holy Order.\n\nFor generations, the world has lived under a fearful peace with the church even beginning to relax its grip upon the many regions and provinces it governs over.\nBut recently, stirrings of malcontent and anger ripple throughout the land. From public demonstrations and civil disobedience, to full scale riots and acts of criminal\nviolence, something unseen is pushing the populous towards open rebellion.\n\nIn the midst of these uncertain times, our Templar protagonist is visited by strange dreams and visions of burning cities, hills of skeletons, oceans of blood and titanic\npillars of fire reaching into a hateful sky. Along with the visions, a deep voice echoing from within himself compels him: \"Slakartvia\", \"Slakartvia holds the secret\"...\n\"Go alone\".\n\nBelieving the voice to be God himself instructing his most loyal servant, Master Templar heads out to investigate Slakartvia, an old rural\nprovince shrouded in mystery and superstition. He does so equipped lightly and alone, save for his trusted warhorse \"Shade\".\n\nWhat secrets lie beneath the treetops of this land?", "summary": "Prequel to the popular \"Trench Foot\" Warhammer 40,000 and Lovecraft-inspired total conversion for Doom II.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "videos": [{"id": 66142, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "cgtfOA1M0Pg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgtfOA1M0Pg", "title": "CountryCide - A Terrifying Grimdark DOOM Total Conversion Mod with Templars & Tentacle Monsters!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cgtfOA1M0Pg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
