This game was also repackaged and sold under the name Amy & Rouge Volleyball, with a different background behind the LCD screen.\n\nThere is a directional pad which includes left and right directions and a single button. The background seems to be that of a tennis court. The object of the game is to hit a ball back at an opponent on the end of the screen using the 1 button. If the opponent misses the ball the score tally goes up. If you miss the ball, then the opponent's score tally will go up instead.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
