News of the city\u2019s rocket-like ascent comes as no surprise; the recent flux of traders, merchants, businessmen both respectable and otherwise, as well as the daily arrival of more fortune-seekers speaks for itself. Of course, this uptick in activity hasn\u2019t been without its downsides. Many residents complain of increased tension among the movers and shakers of Gadgetzan, which could spill into the streets at any moment\u2026 and if it does, you\u2019ll read it here first!\n\nIf you pull up a chair outside Fizzgrimble\u2019s Tavern and watch afternoon traffic flowing up and down Grimestreet, you may notice a few things about how our city has changed. Wagons carrying goods from faraway places, guarded by shifty-looking fellows in bowler hats; vendors loudly hawking their mystical wares from stalls that choke the streets, ready to sell you any potion or spell you want, for a price; and, all but invisible to the untrained observer, shadowy figures blending into the crowds, keeping an eye on everything. Who are these people? What are they doing in our city? These facts our reporters discovered when they went underground and undercover will shock you!", "summary": "Set in the bustling, lawless port city of Gadgetzan, the expansion features characters from the city's three ruling crime families - the brutish Grimy Goons, the shadowy assassins of the Jade Lotus, and the crazed spellcasters of the Kabal. With their own minions, spells and weapons, each family is formed from an allegiance of three different Hearthstone classes, resulting in tri-class cards, usable by heroes of any of those three classes.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hearthstone-mean-streets-of-gadgetzan", "videos": [{"id": 11104, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "r_7sldaa1xg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_7sldaa1xg", "title": "Mean Streets of Gadgetzan - Kazakus", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r_7sldaa1xg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
