Within existing internal documents the given title is \"3-D Zapper,\" though the prototype cartridge itself has an end label that reads merely \"3-D Demo,\" while the PCB within features a sticker reading \"3D Space\" and a date of December 13, 1982. Internal documents describe the game briefly as follows: \"This game contains the elements of a typical shoot-em-up spree game. The unique elements of this game are: (1) that the invaders perform erratic randomized dances in a three-dimensional field. (2) The 3-D operation of the gun. (3) The invaders themselves are particularly tailored to provide an exciting 3-D effect on the ATARI VCS.\"", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/3-d-zapper"}
