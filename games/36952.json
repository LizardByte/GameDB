Blazkowicz devises a plan to get himself captured and taken to Engel's airship, the Ausmerzer, which is suspending the U-boat above water. Engel tries to get her daughter Sigrun to decapitate Caroline, but the former refuses, resulting in Engel killing Caroline herself. Sigrun has a change of heart and tackles Engel, allowing Blazkowicz to use Caroline's armor. Blazkowicz disconnects Eva's Hammer from the Ausmerzer and flees back to the U-boat with Caroline's body.\n\nNow armed with Caroline's armor, B.J is ready to return stateside, avenge his friends, kill every Nazi in sight and spark the second American Revolution.", "summary": "Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is the eleventh installment of the Wolfenstein series and a sequel to the 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order.
