With the special \"Booby Training\" system, you can control the bust size of the all-female crew for stat boosts, bigger for increased power and defense or smaller for improved speed and agility!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "videos": [{"id": 65062, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "cMzGpv_28YQ"}]}
