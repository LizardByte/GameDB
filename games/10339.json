All it takes is one little boar to dig it back up. A block puzzler with an exploratory twist, Full Bore throws the player into an open world of crumbling mines, arcane ruins, and technological wonders with only curiosity to lead the way. Full Bore is packed to the brim with secrets and hidden rooms, because in a world of blocks, puzzles could be anywhere.\n\nFull Bore is the journey of a young boar through the long-buried past. As you figure out how the blocks around you behave, you'll be able to reach new areas of the world and uncover their mysteries- and their riches. Use your ever-growing knowledge to dig your way though mines, temples, scrapyards, lava tubes, inexplicable lakes and mysterious laboratories, as you piece together the story of a world transfigured.\n\nWith over a hundred areas - a third of them hidden - no set path, and secrets everywhere, Full Bore is not just a world to get lost in, but one you can keep coming back to find something new.", "themes": [{"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "videos": [{"id": 5126, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "C3uYCGt2oi0"}]}
