After all the hard work he goes through, Olimar decides to take an interstellar vacation in his personal ship, the S.S. Dolphin. He puts the ship in auto-pilot. With no real place in mind, Olimar relaxes within the comfort of his ship.\nSuddenly a meteorite smashes into Olimar's ship, and he is knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, 30 parts of his ship careen towards a seemingly undiscovered planet. Olimar awakes to find his beloved ship in ruins! He must find all 30 (or 25) ship parts with the help of his newfound friends, the Pikmin, in order to get back to his home planet.", "summary": "Pikmin is a whole new breed of gameplay from Nintendo. The quirky, life-under-the-microscope title delivers a unique experience like few before it with a blend of real-time strategy, adventure, and puzzle elements. Taking advantage of the GameCube's graphics power, Pikmin sports lush texture work that brings to life a microscopic fantasy world. Players control Captain Olimar, a lovable little astronaut, who crash landed on a planet inhabited by even more lovable little plant creatures known as Pikmin. Olimar can command these creatures RTS-style, assign them tasks, make them attack foes, and gather resources. The ultimate task is to rebuild Olimar's space ship before a 30-day time window elapses.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pikmin", "videos": [{"id": 112093, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "gANlgWyylpc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANlgWyylpc", "title": "HQ E3 2001 Pikmin 1 Trailer - Nintendo GameCube", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gANlgWyylpc/maxresdefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 454, "name": "Pikmin"}]}
