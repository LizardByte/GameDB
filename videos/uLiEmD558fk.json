{"id": "uLiEmD558fk", "snippet": {"title": "Kakuro Blend Trailer 2", "description": "Kakuro Blend is exactly like the puzzle, Kakuro, but with colors instead of numbers. Each puzzle contains a grid with initially empty squares and colorful triangles. The goal is to fill the squares to the right or below the triangles, so they mix to create the color within their respective triangles. These puzzles are designed to be difficult, with some mixed colors looking exactly alike but having different answers. Kakuro Blend includes 40 increasingly challenging levels, from 6\u00d76 to 15\u00d710, and 8 different color palettes that change up the game slightly so the player doesn\u2019t get used to the same mixtures. Kakuro Blend is simple, colorful, and challenging. If you enjoy tough puzzles, this game will satisfy you for hours.\n\nDemo is available at https://oglankyboi.itch.io/kakuro-blend-demo\nFull game available on PC at https://store.steampowered.com/app/1535910/Kakuro_Blend/\n\nLet me know what you think, I love feedback!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uLiEmD558fk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uLiEmD558fk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uLiEmD558fk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uLiEmD558fk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uLiEmD558fk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Kakuro Blend Trailer 2", "description": "Kakuro Blend is exactly like the puzzle, Kakuro, but with colors instead of numbers.
