It is the online predecessor of Curve Fever, which only supported offline play. In Curve Fever 2 you control a line that will get longer and longer. You play against up to 7 opponents and try to be the last one standing. Off course there will be less and less room to maneuver to, until you collapse in the wall or others."}
