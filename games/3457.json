Mysterious blue bombs have appeared all over the planet, and King Clown needs help. In a royal decree, the king beckons for Kid Clown, a hero of past Kemco games, to clean up these bombs in all six continents. The strange, yet brave little clown sets out to blast the bombs away before the planet explodes.\n\nClearing these bombs will not always be easy, as they have been arranged in puzzles across 60 different levels. Kid Clown must act wisely, because each level has only one igniter bomb that can detonate the bombs surrounding it. To successfully complete a level in one try, Kid Clown must arrange the bombs so that a chain reaction takes place. He also has to get a safe distance away from the reaction or he will explode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-bombing-islands", "collections": [{"id": 895, "name": "Kid Klown"}]}
