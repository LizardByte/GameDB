This broke the balance, and monsters began to roam the land and attack townspeople. A brave hero is needed to defeat the fiends and restore peace!", "summary": "Fire King is a follow-up to Demon Stalkers. Like its predecessor, it is essentially a Gauntlet variant in its core. The player explores the top-down world, descending into dungeons and fighting hordes of enemies in fast-paced, action-oriented combat. Compared to its spiritual predecessors, Fire King incorporates more RPG elements.The player can choose to control one of the six available characters, and specialize in one of the three disciplines: Magic, Armor, and Strength. Spells and other helpful items can be found in the dungeons and used against the enemies.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-king"}
