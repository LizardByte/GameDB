This is one of my favorite rpg's that i enjoy the most. It's consider the best Rpg of all time. The graphics, music, character developement, story plot and lots more. It sums up everything from the events of the first Phantasy Star to Now.  Take Phantasy Star II and mutiply it 10 times....YEAH. Man i love this game! Get this game now! This is byfar my Best Longplay ever!\r\n\r\nOK Wikipedia time!\r\nThe greatest and most memorable additions to Phantasy Star IV are in its far greater depth of storytelling compared to its predecessors. Character conversations and interactions are far more plentiful than in previous entries, the characters themselves have a great deal more individuality, and the plot features a greater number of twists and turns. Phantasy Star IV further fleshes out its narrative with manga-style panel illustrations to accompany major plot events, making the story more engaging and increasing the impact of events previously portrayed only with bland narration.\r\n\r\nPhantasy Star IV kept many of the gameplay elements of the previous game, including turn-based battles, overhead exploration, and magic spells. This game is typically seen as the last of the original Phantasy Star games, closing the Algol system story as a sequel to Phantasy Star II (Phantasy Star III does not involve the Algo System). Phantasy Star IV is generally named as one of the greatest role-playing games of all time. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BPMxoOdO_Io/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BPMxoOdO_Io/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BPMxoOdO_Io/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BPMxoOdO_Io/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Mega Drive Longplay [137] Phantasy Star IV (Part 1 of 6)", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\r\n\r\nPlayed by: ValisHD\r\n\r\nThe first time i saw this game was in my Egm Magazine back in 1992, at the time inever owned a sega genesis.
