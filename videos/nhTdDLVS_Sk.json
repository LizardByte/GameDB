We have a long intro which outlasts the music .  It sets up the plot of the film and Enolas role in it.  When we get to the game, Enola has nothing to do with the game and it just focuses on one aspect of the film and that is to protect the Atollers from the smokers.\n\nEach level is split into 4 parts. The diving parts are not optional like they are in the genesis version although you do need every last object you can grab if you want to get to the end of the game.  Unlike the genesis version, there are no item drops in the atoller defence section so whatever you bought at the trader has to last you through 2 whole sections. Surviving the last stage is near impossible.  I feel the action is too fast as well during Antol defence. You cant defend both sides and the enemy literally just rush in, rush out and it can be really difficult to rescue anyone.\n\nThe platform sections can be a little annoying as you have to find every enemy, and its not always obvious where they are.  The ladders can be very tricky to get onto as well,  This version also features  a final boss battle not included in the genesis version.  Finaly we have the outro.   What bloody outro!. All that work and nothing but a picture that doesn't say a lot.  After the long intro, the devs just forgot to put an ending in??\n\nHave I anything good to say?   The Music!.   Not a bad thing can be said about the music which is plentiful and varied and kinda unique. -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhTdDLVS_Sk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhTdDLVS_Sk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhTdDLVS_Sk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "SNES Longplay [448] Waterworld", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nWhen comparing with the Mega-Drive version, I do wonder if this game was rushed out before it was even completed.
