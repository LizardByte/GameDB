Discovering the relationship between man and nature is the essence of WiLD. As you can take control of any animal in the world, this opens up huge potential for emergent gameplay that will be unique to you.\"\n\nAnnounced in 2014, information about the game stopped soon after Paris game's week in 2015 but little else followed the news.\n\nSony recently, March 2019, filed a trademark for the game's title and new activity on Facebook ahead of E3 likely means more information to come at the event.\n\nThe game uses Linguini Engine developed by Pastagames Studios in collaboration with Wild Sheep Studio.", "themes": [{"id": 38, "name": "Open world"}], "videos": [{"id": 2827, "name": "Gamescom Trailer", "video_id": "wf8muZgsN5Q"}, {"id": 27628, "name": "Paris Games Week 2015", "video_id": "9LMtcG4XkR0"}, {"id": 44941, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "nWsSBWWdM-M"}, {"id": 44942, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "JZwCLfTvmXo"}, {"id": 44943, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "hVcv4lihhUQ"}]}
