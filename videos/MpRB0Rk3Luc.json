Though it was fully translated into English, the game never received a stateside release. The English version was only sold in PAL territories, as was the NES platformer Ufouria: The Saga, which is the first game in the Hebereke series. Hebereke's Popoitto is also a direct sequel to the 1993 game Hebereke's Popoon.\n\nYou can find my video of the SNES version here: https://youtu.be/hPxD09dI4vI\n\nAnd you can find Ufouria here: https://youtu.be/EdhyVyvuSJs\n\nHebereke's Popoitto plays very similarly to Dr. Mario and the classic earlier games in Compile's Puyo Puyo series. You match four colors in a row to make the pieces disappear, and the point is to clear all of the active pieces on the board. The snag is that if you touch any of these blocks (which like to move about on their own) with the falling piece, they freeze in place, and this can jam up your plan pretty easily if they stick in a place that blocks the moves you were planning.\n\nThe game is overall hyper-cutesy and cartoony, and the 2D graphics look fantastic, especially in coming from a time when rudimentary polygon models were the go-to thing. The soundtrack is also a big improvement over the already great SNES chiptunes. \n\nIt also looks miles better than Sega's awesome-yet-hideous Baku Baku Animal (https://youtu.be/DaDZZze4w20 ).\n\nHebereke's Popoitto will never be recognized as a crowning achievement for the team at Sunsoft, but it is an endearing, fun puzzler, and that goes double for anyone that loved the characters in Ufouria. If you like Puyo games, this will be right up your alley. \n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of my Sega Saturn playthrough, here's my playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3gSj_kh1fHusbY1pbK_ZLcNILDNra1Pd\n_\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MpRB0Rk3Luc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MpRB0Rk3Luc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MpRB0Rk3Luc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MpRB0Rk3Luc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Hebereke's Popoitto (Saturn) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Sunsoft's 1995 puzzle game for the Sega Saturn, Hebereke's Popoitto. \n\nThis video shows the story mode and its ending.\n\nHebereke's Popoitto is a Puyo Puyo-style puzzler that was released on the SNES, Saturn, and PlayStation.
