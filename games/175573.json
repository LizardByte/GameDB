Built using the real-life satellite imagery courtesy of NASA, the game not only allows you to experience the exploration as Sir Scott did it back in 1912 \u2014 with a tent and a sled, but also with the help of: the Bv206, the iconic Swedish all-terrain vehicle; a DN-class iceboat, capable of sailing faster than the wind; and K-MAX, a twin-rotor cargo synchropter. Survive the condition 1 weather, when you cannot see further than 100 feet, ride along the glaciers and on blue ice, and explore the magnificent region of McMurdo Sound.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/antarctica-condition-i"}
