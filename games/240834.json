Play is simple. Just swipe to move shapes. When shapes collide they merge to form new higher level shapes with higher point values. A new shape is added after each move.\nThe game's over when there's no free spaces and no shapes can be merged. But don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s always next time with a completely new wondrous set of randomly generated shapes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shape-garden"}
