The player controls a Boa constrictor who wants to eat fruit. The game is played in a closed environment and the snake can be moved in any direction. Four movement keys are used to control the snake and this can be done in the normal control mode (left and right makes the snake turn) or in the elite control mode (named after the spaceship control in the C64 game Elite) where those keys make the snake roll left or right instead of just turning.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boabite-3d", "videos": [{"id": 95831, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "x3_wPx5PV0M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3_wPx5PV0M", "title": "BoaBite 3D for PC", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x3_wPx5PV0M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
