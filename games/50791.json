Built upon the power of the Unity 3D engine, \u201cDeathfire\u201d utilizes a first person view that gives the player the feeling of being there. A solid role-playing engine that utilizes over forty visible character attributes, along with countless invisible ones to track behavior, makes the heartbeat of the game, and it allows us to analyze and adjust gameplay on the fly, and react to the player\u2019s actions, shaping the story around these actions and decisions. \n \nDeveloped by fully independent developer and publisher G3 Studios in Southern California, and spearheaded by veteran game designer/producer Guido Henkel (Planescape: Torment, Realms of Arkania Trilogy, Fallout II, etc.), the game is currently in its early stages of development and is scheduled for release in late 2014.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}]}
