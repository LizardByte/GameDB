TwilioQuest prepares you for real-world programming by helping you configure a local development environment and introducing tools used by professional programmers around the world. From learning how to use your terminal, to coding in Python, JavaScript, and PHP, TwilioQuest will help you develop practical engineering skills. \n \nMore and more of our lives are lived inside computers. This vast virtual universe, which we call The Cloud, is home to countless worlds, and expands every second of every day. The ability to write code, the laws that govern these virtual worlds, has become a precious resource. \n \nThe power of code is so potent, it has attracted the attention of those who seek to greedily expand and jealously defend their own power. A shadowy organization, known only as the Legacy Systems, plans to exploit their hoarded wealth and privilege in a sinister plot to dominate the free people of The Cloud. \n \nThe \"TwilioQuest\" program was created in secret to train an elite group of leaders to confront this dangerous enemy. Part software engineer and part captain, we know them as the Operators. Operators explore and safeguard the wild frontier of The Cloud, building new tools and technologies destined to touch billions of lives. Operators are sworn to use their powers only to write code that unlocks hope, power, and freedom for all of humanity. \n \nThe only thing standing between the Legacy Systems and their total victory is brave souls like you. Take up the tools of software development. Become an Operator. Save The Cloud.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/twilioquest", "videos": [{"id": 38599, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "uS4JssrhUOw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS4JssrhUOw", "title": "TwilioQuest Preview Announcement", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uS4JssrhUOw/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
