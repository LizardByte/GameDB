It\u2019s 2D combat taken to the next level. Players will take control of a variety of classic spacecraft inspired by anime of the late 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s, piloted by a cast of characters every bit as colorful as the rainbow-hued explosions erupting all around them. Newtonian physics take center stage as players experience finely-tuned control, blasting enemies, unleashing missile salvos, and tossing enemies into explosive obstacles.\n\nThe bar is raised for intense deep-space dogfighting with dynamic and life-like enemies, powered by the next generation Cyntient AI platform, developed by Cyntient Inc. Players will be forced to outmaneuver, outgun and outsmart enemies that think, react and cooperate like seasoned pilots. Both stealth and skill are required to defeat enemy squads in a brutal game of cat and mouse. Prepare for an enemy that comes alive like never before.\"\n\nThe game was later re-branded as Galak-Z: The Void with the released of a free DLC update for the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/galak-z-the-dimensional", "videos": [{"id": 4818, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "txVsvoZMBq0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txVsvoZMBq0", "title": "GALAK-Z E3 trailer 2015", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/txVsvoZMBq0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
