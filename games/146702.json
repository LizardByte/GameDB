Gang violence, poverty, and substance abuse leave Darby rife with drifters, murderers, and cash maniacs whose sole purpose in life is finding the next high or die trying. The town of the same name exists as a swollen, caustic juxtaposition of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and reruns of Twin Peaks gestating in the sweltering heat of Southern Florida.\n\nThe optimistically named Orange Grove Houses, a dilapidated flop house of an apartment building where the only thing more parasitic than the rats and roaches are the tenants, squats obscenely at the end of a long abandoned housing development. A lone drug pusher hawks his wares to sun-deprived addicts when he's not falling prey to his own stock. After an especially odd trip, he finds himself tangled in a devil's weave of crime and hallucinations in halls that even God has given up on.\n\nInspired by black comedy Trash Humpers and VHS slashers like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Cookies is an obscene PSX-coated blend of Satanic cults, meth-dealing clowns and online torture chambers, all under the same backwards-ass roof.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 20, "name": "Thriller"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/cookies"}
