The game was first announced as a Dreamcast exclusive in the January 1999 issue of EGM Magazine, having started development in the summer of 1998.\nIt was designed very much as a standard third-person shooter, but used a world populated by cute little animals as its setting. As a result, the game's depiction of violence is very cartoon-like without losing any of its intensity. In 2001, an updated version for the PlayStation 2 was released as Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge. On 20 July 2012, members of Muffin Games, ex-Bizarre Creations staff, announced a conversion for iPad, called Fur Fighters: Viggo on Glass.\n\nNO EMULATOR USED!! \nPlayed on ORIGINAL CONSOLE & Upscaled with Framemeister/OSSC if old Gen Console.\n\n. .
