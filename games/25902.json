The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The \"CD combo\" was added, wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps.\n\nSNK also added a \"suicide\" move, wherein one's character forfeits the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full \"POW\" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a \"fatality\" move in the vein of Mortal Kombat.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/samurai-shodown-vi", "videos": [{"id": 48112, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "3co8wB6ojQM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3co8wB6ojQM", "title": "SAMURAI SHODOWN VI - Gameplay Trailer [US]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3co8wB6ojQM/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
