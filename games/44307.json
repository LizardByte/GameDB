Invasion!\n\nThe vicious Belsar have attacked the peaceful Darius system, which now faces absolute devastation at their abominable hands! Darius' defense fighters proved no match for the overwhelming firepower of the alien forces, which wiped out their entire fleet in one fell swoop!\n\nWith nothing left to protect them, the people could only sit and wait for the icy embrace of death as the satellite bombardments continued unopposed. The scent of despair hung thickly in the air, all hope of survival having been quashed.\n\nBut then, from out of the darkness of the mourning clouds came a single bright light in the sky.\n\n\"Silverhawk.........\"\n\nLike a phoenix brought forth from the embers of a burning world, the bird shaped visage became a beacon of the planet's last fight for survival! Perhaps the end is not as nigh as it first appeared.", "summary": "Super Darius is a 1990 port of Darius for the PC Engine CD-ROM, and the only attempt at an accurate port of the game for many years; it even uses recordings of music and sound effects straight from the PCB! Its other claim to fame is the introduction of all 26 bosses from the original draft for Darius, some of which were earlier seen on promotional material and some of which were used in Darius II instead.\n\nA \"light\" version for normal PC Engines, Darius Plus, was released later in the year. At the time that was released, owning both versions allowed you to get Darius Alpha.\n\nSuper Darius was also included in the list of games available for the PC Engine CoreGrafx Mini in March 19, 2020, available in all the regions.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 47920, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "S62cxH-EGVo"}]}
