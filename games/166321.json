The game is more varied than its predecessor, there are a variety of mini-games in addition to platforming and maze sections. There are also some unique action sequences, including traveling by floo powder, which entails sliding down a narrow path at high speed, or fleeing from the Hogwarts Express in a flying car. As in the first game, there are also Quidditch matches. Another big part of the game are wizarding duels: these take the form of a best-of-three bout, where the two wizards zap each other with magic while trying to evade the other's spells until one duelist's health is down.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets--1", "videos": [{"id": 54262, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "YeaE9NPfu2k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeaE9NPfu2k", "title": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets PS1 Walkthrough - Part 02", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YeaE9NPfu2k/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
