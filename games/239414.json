{"id": 239414, "genres": [{"id": 9, "name": "Puzzle"}], "name": "SenSense", "slug": "sensense", "summary": "SenSense is a three player escape-room-inspired puzzle game.\n\nThree players. No more, no less. You cannot play SenSense alone. Don't have two friends handy? No problem! You don't need to be in the same physical location, you just need visual and audio contact. Connect via group video chat on another device and you're good to go.\n\nWithout the room! SenSense does not try to copy a physical room in any way. Rather, it focuses on the multiplayer and puzzle solving aspects of an escape game: you get to feel the manic shared energy as you race the clock to piece together clues, in search of those satisfying \"aha\" moments when everything clicks into place.\n\nSenSense is a series of multiplayer challenges. In each challenge, each player will receive a different piece of the same puzzle. You will need to work together to solve it. Each of you is essential to the solution. Oh, and one last thing\u2026 one of you can't hear; one of you can't see; one of you may not speak.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sensense"}
