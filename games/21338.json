Players often need to take advantage of the darkness to stay undetected for an entire mission. This is further encouraged to exceptionally strong enemies and the lack of effective close-combat weapons for a large part of the game. The arsenal includes a handgun, sub-machine gun, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, anti-armor rifle and a UV Knife. Traps are more effective and large groups of Nightwalkers can be taken out all at once by killing the master known as the Prime Walker.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}, {"id": 21, "name": "Survival"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vampire-rain-altered-species", "videos": [{"id": 31454, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "vmH5fu0Kwok", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmH5fu0Kwok", "title": "Vampire Rain Altered Species PS3 trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vmH5fu0Kwok/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
