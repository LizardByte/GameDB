It also has an Infinity mode that uses a team of 5 instead of 6.\n\nThe game had an improved re-release on the PlayStation Vita with the subtitle \"Infinity Ultimate\", in 2014. It includes some improvements to game features/mechanics, and new character portraits.\nThis version is meant to be played after Operation Abyss: New Tokyo Legacy as the save data can be used to bring over character portraits, items that let you save in dungeons, and an accessory that makes enemies stronger for higher item drop rates.\n\nThe game has been only released in Japan across all versions.\nIt is based in the same world as the Generation Xth trilogy.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/labyrinth-cross-blood-infinity", "videos": [{"id": 10823, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "G3d2jxp5-zc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3d2jxp5-zc", "title": "\u8ff7\u5bae\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9 \u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3PV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G3d2jxp5-zc/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 10824, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "c1NyaR6D_Vo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1NyaR6D_Vo", "title": "PS Vita\u300e\u8ff7\u5bae\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9 \u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3 Ultimate\u300fPV", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c1NyaR6D_Vo/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 10825, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "vnCGZ1eHanc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnCGZ1eHanc", "title": "\u8ff7\u5bae\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9 \u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3 OP", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vnCGZ1eHanc/sddefault.jpg"}]}
