This shows gameplay, both the good and bad ending as well. This is the intro. My review of this game is that it's amazing! Totally represents the 90's.\n\n\u25baThumbs up the video if you enjoyed it so that I could know to make more related videos!\n\u25baSubscribe https://www.youtube.com/subscription_...\n\u25baCome join my live streams! http://www.twitch.tv/blackfox2240\n\u25baFollow Me Here: https://twitter.com/Blackfox2240\n\u25baMy Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/Blackfox2240\n\nThe T.R.A.G. team infiltrate the Togusa building, which has been taken over by terrorists, and they attempt to take it back, as well as rescuing Prof. Kevin Howard, an important scientist who is a hostage of the terrorists.\n\nThere are 4 playable characters, each with a unique ability and also a different fighting style:\n\n    Alex, is a member of T.R.A.G. who is able to use night vision goggles and fights using his pistol.\n    Michelle is Alex's comrade, who fights with a knife.\n    Rachel Howard is Professor Howard's daughter, who fights with tonfa batons. Her small size allows her to get in tight places.\n    Burns Byford is a local detective who was searching for one of the terrorists, Gasshu. He fights with his fists. His strength allows him to move heavy objects that the other characters cannot.\n\nEach character can be switched with another one almost anytime; in fact, if the characters are split into 2 teams, the player is able to explore 2 areas separately as well. It's notable that there aren't new weapons to be picked during the main game; instead those are obtained only as unlockables after the game's completion.\n(Source Wikipedia)\n\nT.R.A.G.: Tactical Rescue Assault Group - Mission of Mercy/Hard Edge\nDeveloper: Sunsoft\nPublisher: Sunsoft\nSystem: Sony Playstation\nRelease Date: March 31, 1999 (NA) December 3, 1998 (JAP)  May 20, 1999 (EU)", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzGjgUs-AeQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzGjgUs-AeQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzGjgUs-AeQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzGjgUs-AeQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MzGjgUs-AeQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "T.R.A.G.: Tactical Rescue Assault Group - Mission of Mercy Walkthrough Part 1 - Intro", "description": "T.R.A.G.: Tactical Rescue Assault Group - Mission of Mercy/Hard Edge on the PS1/PSX/Playstation Walkthrough Part 1.
