Easy, right?\n\nThe office is small, the shifts are long, and your cute little cat is your only source of comfort. At your desk, everything feels calm and under control\u2014until you step into the warehouse.\n\nReceive Orders\nStart your shift at the desk by reviewing incoming orders. Each one lists specific items you\u2019ll need to retrieve from the warehouse. Your goal? Reach the daily quota.\n\nNavigate the warehouse\nArmed with a flashlight and a limited set of tools, head into the sprawling warehouse to locate the items. Time is of the essence, so you\u2019ll need to move quickly and efficiently. Avoid lingering in one spot for too long\u2014time isn\u2019t the only thing working against you.\n\nPack and ship\nOnce you\u2019ve gathered the items, return to the desk to pack and ship the orders. Accuracy is crucial\u2014mistakes are deducted from your paycheck.\n\nSurvive and repeat\nAs the days go by, the company\u2019s demands increase, pushing you deeper into the warehouse. Unlock new parts of the seemingly infinite warehouse if you have enough funds. The further you go, the more hostile the environment becomes. Shadows move where they shouldn\u2019t, and the noises grow closer. Stay sharp, keep working, and survive until the end of your shift\u2014or until you can\u2019t.\n\nUpgrade and improve\nReinvest your hard-earned profits into tools that will help you perform your duties even more efficiently. Faster shipping tools, solutions for handling larger orders, and advanced navigation aids for the warehouse can help you meet company expectations seamlessly.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about your adorable companion\u2014use some of your earnings to buy toys for your cat, because your little friend\u2019s happiness is just as important as keeping the orders flowing.", "summary": "Pack orders and ship them out.
