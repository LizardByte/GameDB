Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective.\n\nIn the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbour has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbour is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer.\n\nIn the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all...\nThis final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans.", "summary": "You're a detective, and a frog, and it's time to solve 3 thrilling mysteries!\n\nFor the first time, all 3 Frog Detective cases are available in one package.\n\nPlay as the #2 best investigator as you find clues, question silly suspects, and look at things through your magnifying glass.
