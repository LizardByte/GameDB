The Utsunomiya Line has been in use since March 10, 1990, at the suggestion of the local governments along the line. In the past, many express and sleeper trains headed for Tohoku and Hokkaido used to run on the line, but now regular and rapid trains make up the majority of the schedule.\nPlease enjoy the Utsunomiya Line DLC as you travel through the Kanto Plain, experiencing the changing landscape from Tochigi Prefecture to Tokyo, with its sprawling countryside, suburban residential areas, and buildings in the heart of the city.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/jr-east-train-simulator-utsunomiya-line-kuroiso-to-tokyo-e233-3000-series"}
