Take your monster truck out of the stadiums and into the real world, crushing cars and smashing buildings in your bid to be the best Monster Truck driver there is. \n \nSmash through huge obstacles, slide around tight corners with four wheel steering and blast over the finish line. \nMassive destruction can reshape the course and define a new path for you to tear apart. Destructible objects spawn rubble to create a trail of destruction! \nUse the brute power and size of a Monster truck to reap destruction and observe true physics, simulations and smashes. \nBuild up speed, engage the boost and hit those jumps hard and fast for some really big air! \n12 Bigfoot trucks and 4 Torus Original trucks to choose from.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bigfoot-king-of-crush", "collections": [{"id": 4416, "name": "Bigfoot"}]}
