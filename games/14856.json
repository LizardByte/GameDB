Spheres are connected to the playfield using chains and ropes and the player must cut these constraints to put the spheres and the level in motion by the forces of gravity and physical interaction. The controls are extremely simple and intuitive. Obulis can literally be learned in seconds, but the puzzles will keep you thinking for hours.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/obulis"}
