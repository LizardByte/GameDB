They find that the professor has been abducted and set out to rescue him.\n\nShockman is a side-view action shooter that has eight stages, including Action Stages, where you jump and use special techniques, and side-scrolling Shooting Stages. This game expands on the well-paced story from the previous version and contains cooperative elements like shared life and a powerful Team Shockbeam that can be used during two-player simultaneous play.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 36550, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "hh068Sj-Ems", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh068Sj-Ems", "title": "PC Engine Longplay [081] Kaizou Chounin Shubibinman", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hh068Sj-Ems/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
