Featuring a scripted RPG system, multiple player characters, new enemies and weapons, Serpent: Resurrection follows a new story, set five years after the defeat of the evil Banedon at the hands of the hero of ShadowCaster. Unlike most Hexen mods, there are no multiple hubs to be found in Serpent: Resurrection, as all 25 of its maps are instead connected through a single hub, meaning it's possible to revisit most of them at any point in the game.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/serpent-resurrection"}
