Upon hearing about a large annual market in the village of Castella, the traveller decides to set up a stall and try their luck.\n\nLife, however, is not so easy.\n\nAfter being double-crossed by a goblin and left in the middle of the cold, wet moors to die, the traveller almost gives up hope. That is, until they stumble upon a mysterious church in the middle of nowhere, and meet the two nuns who attend to it. What are these two nuns doing on their own, and why is there such a melancholy atmosphere in the air?\n\nThe traveller has only one windswept night to uncover these mysteries and learn the truth.", "themes": [{"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/once-on-a-windswept-night"}
