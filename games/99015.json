Age of Heroes also has 3 raids: Hall of Death, Freezing Stronghold, and Fort of Horror. Each raid contains battles and bosses that require different team cooperation and raid strategies. \nHowever, the game is not as interesting as we had hoped due to limited raids\uff0clack of replayability and pricing problems. Thus, we decide to remake the game based on the lessons we learned from Age of Heroes.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/endless-crusade--1"}
