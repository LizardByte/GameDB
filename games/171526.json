As a leader of a popular movement you will fight against tough adversaries who control the police, the army, the bureaucracy\u2014even the media. The only weapon in your hand is your strategic skill and ingenuity.\n\nBut People Power is more than just a game. It\u2019s an opportunity to join a community of others who want to learn about civil resistance and nonviolent strategies. The game allows you to design and play your own custom scenarios by using a Scenario Builder. Everyone can design scenarios and post them on the People Power forum, available to the whole community, where you can exchange ideas with other players and scenario writers.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/people-power-the-game-of-civil-resistance"}
