Unlike most Hummer Team games, it is in full Japanese as opposed to English. The story was completely removed from this version. However, the Arcade, Versus and CPU vs CPU modes are present. The characters are fought in a random order, and are always fought on certain stages.\n\nThe graphics and music are taken from the original game and simplified, with some characters sharing stages. Many of the stages themselves use multi-layered scrolling. The forest stage's theme, which is Bojack's theme from the original game, was reused in Tekken 2, another game by Hummer Team. The ending is taken from the original game, albeit without the credits.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-ball-z-super-butouden-2", "videos": [{"id": 72545, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "FDXQhOFRES8"}]}
