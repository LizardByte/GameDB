The player must aim a pill to hit frowning faces until they smile; if the pill hits the same face too many times, it will disturbingly \"die\" and turn into a skull. A VT368 hack of the game was also produced (under the same name). Later re-published by Waixing; the Waixing version uses a weirdly off-putting rendition of the theme to Gentlemen of Fortune, a Soviet comedy film.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/germ-killer"}
