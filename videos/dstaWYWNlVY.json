I'm printing on a Flashforge Creator Pro 3D printer that I picked up a few months back.\n\nFor those into 3D printing:\nThe original coin was created in Illustrator & 3DSMAX. I used Hatchbox PLA in metallic silver & gold filament, and printed slowly at 30/ms. The extruder was heated to 197C and the bed was heated to 60C. Printing slowly and at a lower temperature kept the fine details of the coins intact. Sequential printing was set up in Simplify3D. \n\nGET IN ON SOMBRERO TESTING: http://apply.pixelmetal.com\n\nMORE BEHIND THE SCENES PHOTOS OF THE 3D PRINTING: http://site.pixelmetal.com/3d-printed-schwag-preview/\n\nMusic:\n\"A Belly Full of Spaghetti\" from the Sombrero Soundtrack by Bubble Pipe Media: http://bubblepipemedia.com\n\nLinks:\nSombrero: http://pixelmetal.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/PixelMetal\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/PixelMetal", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dstaWYWNlVY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dstaWYWNlVY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dstaWYWNlVY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dstaWYWNlVY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dstaWYWNlVY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "3D Printing Sombrero Merch", "description": "I decided to print up some merch to hand out at gaming events for my indie game Sombrero.
