{"id": "HvXuULgf2M8", "snippet": {"title": "Road & Track Presents - The Need For Speed \u2022 Electronic Arts / Pioneer Productions 1995 (PC DOS)", "description": "Road & Track Presents - The Need For Speed was initially released for 3DO gaming console in 1994. In 1995 it was released for PC DOS (this version added 3 new closed tracks and new racing modes) and in 1996 for Sony Playstation, Sega Saturn and new version for PC - Special Edition which introduced Windows 95 support, 2 new tracks, changable time of day, music during racing and up to 8-player multiplayer mode.\n\nThe studio behind this game - Pioneer Productions were a team within Electronic Arts Canada, that came from Distinctive Software, Inc. - people that brought Grand Prix Circuit, Stunts, Test Drive 1 and 2 - you can clearly see Test Drive's DNA in NFS - in Head to Head mode you race with other opponent on open roads, while evaiding traffic and police. In 3DO version you even have limited lives as in Test Drive games.\n\nThe presentation was phenomenal - you got ton of information about the cars you could drive, along with live action videos. In fact all the cars in game were rented to provide needed material - performance tests were performed, sounds were recorder - each car has unique engine, horn, and even gearbox shifter sound.\n\nGraphics was mindblowing at the time - imagine coming to this from Car and Driver (1992) which btw you can see here - https://youtu.be/D34qYkaWQBY, Indycar Racing (1993) or Nascar Racing (1994). Game supported SVGA mode (640x480 resolution) with fully texture mapped 3d objects. Physics engine was also something remarkable - head on crashes highlighted its full potential - basically 6 degrees of freedom - you could send the cars flying and they behaved really realisticaly (though without any visible damage). I think it was first driving game that let you do believable donuts. I spent a lot of time burning rubber in this game I have to admit.\n\nThis game demo made a massive impression on me back in 1995. I just switched from Amiga 500 to PC - imagine my disbelief seeing Viper video showcase (that music gave me chills) and those life-like graphics after I just have played Stunts...\n\nI'm running this in DOSBox ECE. Some notable settings:\ncycles = auto limit 200000\nI also use Logitech G920 wheel and pedals. I mapped the controls in DOSBox mapper (CTRL-F1) and use joystick as controller set in game.\n\nOther racing games I have covered:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIku_oD9y-RC3io_76u4Zj9VbCrdDCs3R\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:15 Main menu\n2:05 Toyota Supra Turbo - Car Showcase\n5:49 Tournament Class C - Supra / Rusty Springs - Win\n12:50 Acura NSX - Car Showcase\n16:54 Tournament Class C - Acura NSX / City\n26:05 Credits\n\n#RetroGaming #RetroRacing", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HvXuULgf2M8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HvXuULgf2M8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HvXuULgf2M8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HvXuULgf2M8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HvXuULgf2M8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Road & Track Presents - The Need For Speed \u2022 Electronic Arts / Pioneer Productions 1995 (PC DOS)", "description": "Road & Track Presents - The Need For Speed was initially released for 3DO gaming console in 1994.
