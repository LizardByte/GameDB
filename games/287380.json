Also allows for 2-player competitive play, where 2 players compete for a high score. The player controls a small ship or cannon on the bottom of the screen, which can move horizontally left and right using the Apple game paddles. The ship fires vertically upwards.\n\nIn Blisterball!, the goal is to shoot down bouncing balls as they bounce out of the chamber above the player. If the player is hit by a ball, they are damaged, and they fall into the drain below if they are struck 3 times. There is also a series of blister balls, which can be shot for bonus points.\n\nIn Mad Bomber!, the player must shoot bombs as they descend from slots above. If a bomb strikes the bottom of the screen, the player loses a point. 10 points lost, and it's game over. The player must regularly refill their ammo by bringing their ship to the edge of the screen, and if the player is caught in the explosion of a bomb, they lose 10 ammo.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/blisterball-and-mad-bomber"}
