Monster Truck Destruction is here to satisfy all of these needs plus more. Choose monster trucks from the founding era with original rivalry between BIGFOOT  and USA-1, or trucks from the 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s and today. Can you perform a \u2018slap wheelie\u2019 or a \u2018flip\u2019 to earn maximum points in freestyle? Will you be able to knock-out a blistering time in drag? If not maybe you\u2019ll need to upgrade your truck so that it can be faster and go harder, but watch out if you go too hard your truck may break and cost you money to repair! Loads of fun for the casual gamer to the ultimate Monster Truck die-hard fan.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-truck-destruction"}
