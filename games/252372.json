The sinister doom in the stupid beret and the old-fashioned glasses was already breathing down the neck of the thriving company UmaNetto...\n\nAn ironic cartoon parody of the TV series \"Not Born Beautiful\" literally exploded the Russian Internet. Tens of thousands of office workers, students and even retirees followed the appearance of new releases, discussing series, arguing and swearing in forums. No wonder - the creators of UmaNetto touched a nerve - the modern office reality.\n\nCunning and lazy director of the company UmaNetto Andrey Padlych, office womanizer Kazanovsky, unconventional Murzilko, crooks Shalopaev and, of course, good and fickle Katya Ochkareva - they all live the same life as we do.\n\nThe game with a killer selection of corporate adventures of glamour star Katya, fully consistent with the cartoon. Castings, corporate parties, team-building, training, impossible tasks... it's all served with that lively, a little goofy humor, which is so liked by the new domestic yuppies.\n\nNot to be left out of the game and the notorious Medved - the undisputed leader of the hit parade of 2006's Russian Internet gags. To pass all levels, you need to show a fair sense of humor, absurdity of thought, resourcefulness and uncommon sabotage abilities.
