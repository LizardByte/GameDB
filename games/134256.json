It can be a small database of games, a downloadable art show, a simulation, a moving painting, an album, an existential crisis, a talisman, a play, a meditation, a spell, a forest, a distopian nightmare, a joke.\n\nThe amount of interaction and exploration is not a ton. If you explore and play through everything it would take maybe an hour or so at most.\n-There are small games and walking sims to play on machines in abandoned buildings.\n-You can chat with other players in the multiplayer mode and see if they are human or machine\n-There is a band and a small secret lair\n-There is no beginning or end\n-There is no winning or losing\n\nAnd there is an infinite, dramatic cycle of accumulation and destruction:\n\nHit the number 3 key. You can choose the perspective of 3 NPC actors or a stage overview. They are acting out an absurdist play. They are the sole survivors of a human apocalypse. They are trying to procreate to start civilization over again but they\u2019re having a hard time. They are sending emails to nowhere, gossiping, meditating, taking naps, cleaning up. They\u2019re collecting artifacts around the stage and building a machine. When the machine is done it generates an AI and then blows up.\n\nTo see what the NPCs do you can leave the simulation on at a party, in a room while you are doing other things, etc. It could run for many hours and you will see, read and hear different things.\nIf you have a few computers you can link them up and see different perspectives at once. With multiple channels of the atmospheric sounds it becomes a sort of instrument or generative album as well.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/sometimes-to-deal-with-the-difficulty-of-being-alive-i-need-to-believe-there-is-a-possibility-that-life-is-not-real--1", "videos": [{"id": 36488, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "g8et6Ju_IyY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8et6Ju_IyY", "title": "Sometimes...", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g8et6Ju_IyY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
