The project does not introduce a completely new campaign, and instead its task is to enrich the original storyline prepared by the Piranha Bytes studio with additional missions and plots. Players take on the role of Nameless, and the plot of the new elements revolves around the Ancient Ones, i.e. powerful beings serving Innos. The authors have developed new locations and adventures, five additional factions and dozens of characters. In addition, it was made possible to impersonate a Magnate and take part in arena battles. All this has been superbly integrated with the basic version of the game and made in a quality that more resembles an official add-on than a fan production. In addition, there are so many novelties that you can go through the main campaign again without feeling bored, as the modifications introduced by the authors effectively refresh the overall formula.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/gothic-the-dark-secrets"}
