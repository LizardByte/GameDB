However, the real tale begins many centuries later after the Silver Dragon reawakens, and launches an assault on a frontier village in the far north. There, a royal knight by the name of Lucas serves as a guard after being relegated to the rural and much isolated location by the King. Yet, little does he know he is, in fact, a descendant of the hero, Alaric, who once sealed the Gold and Silver Dragons in human form. Nonetheless, when tragedy strikes, he soon finds his place, and after teaming up with a band of unlikely companions, sets out on an adventure to save the world.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-lapis", "videos": [{"id": 42797, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "TqzwxsvMTic", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqzwxsvMTic", "title": "RPG Dragon Lapis - Official Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TqzwxsvMTic/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
