He left you home alone while he's out of town for the weekend, and you heard on the radio that there's a large storm heading your way.\n\nYou live in a rather underdeveloped part of the country so you're off the power grid, but fortunately your dad's pretty handy and he's wired up your old farmhouse to a gas generator, which you moved to the basement to keep it out of the storm. The basement smells kind of funny and it's really hazy down there, but it should be okay for now. There's a big fuel tank outside where you can refill your jerry can, and dad refilled it before he left. There's also a big pile of wooden boards out front from when your dad renovated the barn over the summer, so you can use those to board up the windows just in case.\n\nThe storm should be here soon and you're as prepared as you can be, but still you feel uneasy; something's not quite right... you feel as if something's lurking out there, watching.\n\nYour goal is to survive three nights of the Thing trying to force its way into your home, by barricading doors and windows. The thing really doesn't like light, so you can drive it away with your rechargeable flashlight. You can also \"reinforce\" parts of the house by turning lights on, which will slow the thing's attacks at the cost of draining more power and needing to refill the generator more frequently.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-thing-at-the-window"}
