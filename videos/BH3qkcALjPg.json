Due to platform constraints the game story was divided to four episodes, each was downloadable upon completion of the previous one. \n\nThe story of discovery is unveiled here:\nhttps://www.khinsider.com/forums/index.php?threads/kingdom-hearts-v-cast-game-files-ripped.211584/ \n\nReleased back in 2004-2005 this game was considered lost until in 2016 the user \"Wedge\" from the 4chan KH community  uploaded a backup of the game with the Obstacle Course and the Swashbuckler's Island episodes. \n\nIn 2018, the third, Agrabah, episode was backuped by KHinsider.com forum user \"Cbajd5\". Shortly after, the second and forth episodes were claimed to be found, with the second episode later confirmed to be lost, and the fourth episode impossible to back up.\n\nIn 2022 a KHinsider.com forum user uploaded the full footage of Maleficent's Castle episode to youtube.  Later, Eriyu from KHinsider.com forum was finally able to get and upload the backup of her phone for research. And the fourth episode was restored. Thank you, Eriyu!\n\n[GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION]\n\nThis is the new playthrough of all the available levels on the Zeebo. Wonderland episode is missing as of time of making this video. No previous footage from this channel was used. \n\nI am playing using version 1.1.1 of the game (this was the version from Eriyu's and Wedge's phones), including such fixes for the game on the Zeebo as:\n- putting the game icon into the Zeebo's main menu \"Z-Wheel\";\n- editing the Zeebo's keyboard configuration file with mappings to mobile phone's keys, so finally it is possible to access menus and use magic without hooking the Zeebo to the PC;\n- change of the game font to the biggest one;\n- fixes to the sound files for opening chests and actions.\n\n[ACTION REQUIRED TO PRESERVE WONDERLAND EPISODE]\n\nIf you remember playing this game, and there is even the smallest of chances that you still have the phone with the Wonderland stage on it, please reach out to me on youtube or on KHInsider.com and I will walk you through the process of backing up the stage.\n\n[CHAPTERS]\n\n00:00:00 - 00:01:03 Zeebo and game loading\n00:01:03 - 00:02:13 Main menu\n00:02:13 - 00:10:20 EPISODE \"Obstacle Course\"\n00:10:20 - 00:10:59 Interlude: Help me buy gear for my job in Ukraine\n00:10:59 - 00:42:17 EPISODE \"Swashbuckler's Island\"\n00:42:17 - 00:42:55 Interlude: Wonderland Episode not found yet\n00:42:55 - 02:12:40 EPISODE \"Agrabah\"\n02:12:40 - 03:16:19 EPISODE \"Maleficent's Castle\"\n03:16:19 - Outro sequence\n\nTwitter: @krzbrew", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BH3qkcALjPg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BH3qkcALjPg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BH3qkcALjPg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BH3qkcALjPg/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BH3qkcALjPg/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Zeebo Footage: Kingdom Hearts V CAST Longplay 2022", "description": "Help me creating more videos: https://ko-fi.com/krzbrew\n==============================================\n[THE STORY SO FAR]\n\nKingdom Hearts V-CAST was a Kingdom Hearts chapter, specially developed by Superscape to be run on Verizon's feature phones and distributed through Verizon's Get It Now mobile store for BREW applications.
