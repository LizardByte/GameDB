There is an older video of this on the channel, but it lacked the case artwork.\n\nThis has fairly similar gameplay to the classic 'Fire' in that you must bounce something (fish in this case) from one side of the screen to the other.  This one mixes things up a bit in Game B where the fish will bounce in either direction, which ends up making the game feel closer to the juggling based games such as Ball and Chef.  It's also got a cute cat waiting to pounce on any fish you drop.\n\nRecent work on Game & Watch emulation has come from Algestam, with earlier work being done by Sean Riddle and hap.  DarthMarino provided the artwork for more recently emulated units, while hydef was generally responsible for the artwork on ones emulated before 2020, links to the artwork are below\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1vl9O-0jIGCHHY_lrWpOwBtqTXEKsVGOY  DarthMarino \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WLKcvynl0ky2mRL1UacA9yaiMTnNs4x5 hydef", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJxyc43xmjY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJxyc43xmjY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJxyc43xmjY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nJxyc43xmjY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Game & Watch - Tropical Fish (c)1985 Nintendo [MAME emulation footage]", "description": "This the Game & Watch Tropical Fish handheld game, a Nintendo product released in 1985.
