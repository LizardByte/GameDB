What really happened after Mario beat Bowser, rescued Yoshi\u2019s eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi and his sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his eggs from Bowser before they really hatched. So, both Yoshis do so and they find themselves in the land of Weirdonia. However, it seems that Bowser apparently insists on stealing Yoshi\u2019s eggs, since Yoshi\u2019s eggs were stolen again while Yoshi was out shopping. Since Mario isn\u2019t around to help this time, Yoshi goes on a quest by himself to retrieve his eggs. However, just like Mario\u2019s Strange Quest, this isn\u2019t your ordinary quest. The land of Weirdonia is a strange land filled with bizarre gimmicks, weird themes, and possibly jelly filled donuts and pizza. Expect the unexpected during Yoshi\u2019s journey.", "summary": "This is the sequel to Mario's Strange Quest and a mod of Super Mario World.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/yoshis-strange-quest"}
