The hack uses the Pokered Disassembly from the users at Skeetendo as a base. It is intended both as a Rombase for people who want an updated Red Version as a starting point (although admittedly, some of the features wouldn't appeal to all Gen 1 hackers it seems), and as a stand-alone game for people that want to relive the nostalgia of Gen 1 without some of the broken mechanics and with added features.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
