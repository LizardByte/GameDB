It also features the 26 NHL teams at the time as well as 6 International teams to choose from.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to many other hockey games with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs or even a \"Just Play\" option that instantly took the player to a random game. There is also a \"Simulation Mode\" that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an \"Arcade Mode\" that was more action oriented and with less rules. A battery back-up keeps extensive track of stats and has a two-player option as well.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/wayne-gretzky-and-the-nhlpa-all-stars"}
