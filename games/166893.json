Cross Stitch Casper is a game that focuses on story and characters. The homely embroidered graphics are in contrast to the bleak home of main protagonist. As player you control little Casper. But you're not him. You're just observing the world he's living in and the struggles he has to endure. How will he manage to get through his daily live's struggles? Will he at all? The only person sympathizing with him seems to be his grandmother. Then again, how much can an old woman do?", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}]}
