Yet, the adventure awaiting inside this very mansion was not merely unforeseen, it is about to exceed both their most vivid dreams and most horrid nightmares.\n\nHelp Billy and his friends overcome the challenges ahead, or they might not escape unscathed...", "summary": "2D House of Terror is a story driven set of party games for 1 to 4 players using characters from classic horror movies from the 1930s up to the 1980s, along with the story mode there's a random mini game mode which adds even more horror-themed variety. As fans of the genre, the developers created 2D House of Terror as the final university project for one of its team members, the game was also developed for the Xbox 360, making it more of a cross-platform release and not a direct port to the Dreamcast.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/2d-house-of-terror"}
