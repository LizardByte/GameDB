As the first Monopoly game to be released exclusively on the CD-ROM format, Westwood Studios (behind some truly excellent games, like the Kyrandia series, Dune, Eye of the Beholder, Command & Conquer... the list goes on) absolutely nailed this title on their first shot.\n\nFor how modest its requirements are and were (in 1995, the minimum 486/33 wasn't by any means cutting edge), it bleeds class and atmosphere. They seriously went all out on the presentation, and its this aspect that many of its fans remember most fondly. Nearly everything in game is accompanied with some really cool CG work of the pieces doing their thing across the board, and each property would give a visual representation of its condition (whether it be a slummy purple with 1 house on it, or the gated grounds of the hotel sitting on Boardwalk), which was incredibly cool and novel. All of the rules are present from the board game, and it's pretty customizable, so any of the rules that you always played under with the family can be done here too (thank you, Free Parking bonus!). And most impressive of all, if you didn't have anyone sitting at the keyboard to play with you, you could play against a buddy on the internet. Pretty groundbreaking stuff, overall. \n\nI also really got a kick out of the AI players being named after other popular computer game characters of the era. The simpleton that I have in there was meant to be He-Man, but then I realized that Adam of Eternia would not fit in the blank. Oops. Anyways, maybe now why he's using the iron makes more sense.\n\nFor me, this version of Monopoly is to the PC as the NES version is to the consoles. They might look and sound outdated as tech continues to march along, but neither of them have yet been outdone for sheer playability and fun on their respective platforms.  \n\n_____\nNo cheats were used during the recording of this video. \n\nNintendoComplete (http://www.nintendocomplete.com/) punches you in the face with in-depth reviews, screenshot archives, and music from classic 8-bit NES games!\n\nVisit for the latest updates!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/NintendoComplete/540091756006560\nhttps://twitter.com/nes_complete", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i8BHqcJz1uM/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i8BHqcJz1uM/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i8BHqcJz1uM/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i8BHqcJz1uM/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Monopoly (PC, 1995) Playthrough - NintendoComplete", "description": "A playthrough of Hasbro's 1995 board game adaptation for PCs running Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, Monopoly. \n\nPlayed a game against two computer opponents.\n\nMonopoly adaptations into video games usually tend to be pretty good (or it not, at least servicable), but this one goes far, far above that.
