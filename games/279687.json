The goal is simple; get to the door at the end of the level to win, but it's not as easy as it may seem... Holes can show up out of nowhere, spikes can move unexpectedly and ceilings can fall down on you as you make your way through the many different levels. One wrong step and it's game over. You'll have to keep your wits about you, expect the unexpected and most importantly: don't get angry. Can you make it through these hellish levels and beat Level Devil?", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 27, "name": "Comedy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/level-devil"}
