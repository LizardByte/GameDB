Quickly though, your mission turns from a mundane trek to a fight for survival, all caused by deep-rooted schemes of the past. Your tools are simple: the camera around your neck and the wits to navigate a virtual labyrinth of debris. How you tell your story is your choice, will you have the commitment to finish your duty, or will you ignore all else but the preservation of your own life?\n\nINFRA is what we like to call a gun-free puzzle adventure. Instead of large explosions and powerful guns, you will rely on your cunning to survive puzzles in an incredibly detailed world. As you travel through the infrastructure of a city you will find that your actions and thorough observations ultimately determine if others will survive. A society obsessed with upgradation has brought a disaster upon itself and it is your job to help restore it.\n\nMUSIC\nFinnian Langham: https://soundcloud.com/finnianlangham\n\nVOICE ACTING\nJames Miller: http://voice123.com/jamesmiller1\n\nIMAGES used on the storyboard (all edited)\n[CG Textures]: http://www.cgtextures.com/\nRoger Karlsson: https://www.flickr.com/photos/free-ph...
