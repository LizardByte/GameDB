He worked hard to pass the entrance exam for the only school in the town and successfully achieved his long-cherished dream! \n \nHe moved back to the town for a new start, planning on living by himself in his childhood home, but it was in such a dilapidated state that it was essentially uninhabitable. Without the money to look for a temporary residence, Takuma was at a loss as to what to do. \n \nFortunately, his childhood friends came to his rescue! While he couldn\u2019t live with them forever, he was welcomed to stay in the four families\u2019 homes on a rotation system. One of them strongly objected to it, but she was persuaded in the end.
