Tight corners force close-quarters engagements, while the moat and drawbridge allows for unique player movement opportunities in this mid-sized map. The last trespassers didn\u2019t make it out alive - maybe you\u2019ll have a better shot.\n\nMicro: What's better than a BBQ on a hot summer day? A miniaturized war zone that takes place on a well-stocked family picnic table, that\u2019s what! Navigate this bite-size battlefield for a larger-than-life experience.\n\nOutlaw: Gear up for a showdown in Outlaw; a western-style re-imagining of the fan favorite map Standoff from Call of Duty: Black Ops II. This rough-and-tough medium-sized map brings classic engagements, flanking routes and strategic positions for long and medium ranged combat.\n\nRupture: The Call of Duty: World at War classic Outskirts is re-imagined as a high-tech facility, designed by a futuristic society desperate to repair the Earth's atmosphere.", "summary": "Salvation is here!
