The warriors' powers threaten to utterly destroy the fabric of the MK universe. Utterly, every warrior that was either good, evil, or neutral fought each other in a single battle royal that would threaten to rip apart reality. Without warning, a pyramid rises from the ground, and the tip bursts into flames, attracting the warriors' curiosity to see what it was. Everybody fought each other to get to the top, while Blaze revealed himself to the combatants. The fire spawn was created by the Elder Gods to destroy as many fighters as possible in order to save the realms from Armageddon. This would be the warriors' last battle, their last chance to prove that they are worthy of surviving, while many others will perish. This will be the final battle for Mortal Kombat, the battle that will determine the fate of the realms...", "summary": "Mortal Kombat: Armageddon brags a roster of 62 characters and sees the return of classic ones from the original Mortal Kombat, such as Reptile, Shang Tsung and Goro. The enhanced Konquest mode (story/adventure mode) improves over the preceding versions, but has a shorter length. There are now 64 arenas (including revamped versions of classic environments) which each have their own tweaks, such as the ridiculous amount of stage fatalities (fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent, including classic techniques such as the \"spine-rip\" or \"arm-break\").", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat-armageddon", "videos": [{"id": 34323, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "LUMAGfe4r-M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUMAGfe4r-M", "title": "Mortal Kombat Armageddon - Kung Lao Arcade Ladder", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LUMAGfe4r-M/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
