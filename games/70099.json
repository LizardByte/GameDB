The more you are off the center, the more the rockets angle will increase (if you are still in the power-up area) or the rocket is loosing power (if you are beyond the power-up area).\n\nOnce you have enough power (turned the vertical red line green), your rocket will start with the angle you have achieved. Depending on that angle, you rocket will either go to the orbit or fly a 180\u00b0 into the ground.\n\nThe game has a highscore table that counts the time you needed to get your rocket successfully into space.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/1key-rocket-launcher"}
