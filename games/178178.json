She has defeated countless monsters both demonic and human, but now faces her most personal battle yet. Rayne must hunt down her very own siblings, who have banded together and pledged to carry on their father's legacy of creating a new era of vampire supremacy in which humans are mere cattle.\n\nBloodRayne is back with new acrobatic movements, rail sliding, fast-paced blade and gun combat and fatal finishing moves.
