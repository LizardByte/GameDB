Four years later the codebase of the game has moved to a new repository due to the original codebase being tied to the upstream engine's codebase, hence detrimental, and the game renamed to Nightfire Open. On August 8, 2023, v1 was released on Github.\n\nCurrently, the latest version is v5 and it was released on March 10, 2024 on Github for both Windows and Linux.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nightfire-open"}
