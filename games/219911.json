Using two fingers, control the two color dots to move, approach and meet. Each level represents a relationship. Experience and overcome different situations like 'Obstacles', 'Uncontrollable', 'Lost', etc.\nEach individual like me or you is different, so as every relationship. In Our Ways, the result of each level depends on how far and how many steps the two color dots took. Just as our relationships, there is no perfect one, no right or wrong. It only depends how we see them. Play and get your own results!\nFind your way in Our Ways.", "themes": [{"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/our-ways"}
