Being the spritual successor to Bitejacker, Devil's Dare carries the same theme of parodies, pitting classic game heroes against monsters straight out of 90s horror movies.\n\nDevil's Dare doesn't just rely on grinding and leveling up, but instead introduces permadeath to keep players on their toes. With every kill, the player makes some cash, which you can use to purchase upgrades or save it to revive when you're dead. When you run out of cash completely, you are dead for good and it's time to start over again. This is a mechanic inspired by the good old arcade days, where every death meant another penny wasted!\n\nOur main influence were some of Capcom's classics like Alien vs. Predator, Battle Circuit, Final Fight as well as Sega's Streets of Rage Series. So if you were a fans of those, give it a shot. We're sure you will find something to love in Devil's Dare.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/devils-dare", "videos": [{"id": 3494, "name": "Release trailer", "video_id": "Dur2AOSNOYg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dur2AOSNOYg", "title": "Devil's Dare Release Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dur2AOSNOYg/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
