The Tower of Ar tonelico from Metafalss is different from the tower in the first game since it doesn't look like a tower initially, but still has some of the same essential facilities (Plasma Bell (represented as the Lift Generators) and Musical Corridor (called here the Wings of Hynemos)). The Song Magics are still used like programs, but in this tower there are two Song Magic servers: the Sol Marta server and the Infel Phira Server. The Sol Marta server is located in the upper zone of the tower, acting like a stationary satellite. However, Sol Marta isn't a proper Song Magic server, and instead, it serves as a relay for the First Tower of Ar tonelico, which was the setting for the first game. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server is located in a satellite that orbits the sky around the tower and shares its name with said server. Given Sol Marta's purpose as a relay for the First Tower, it works with the same kind of hymmnos as it and executes the EXEC variety of hymns. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server works with another kind of hymmnos called the New Testament of Pastalie hymmnos, and executes the METHOD variety of hymns.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-jf7U434DSE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-jf7U434DSE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-jf7U434DSE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-jf7U434DSE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Ar tonelico\u2122 2: Melody of Metafalica Official English Trailer", "description": "http://nisamerica.com/games/AT2/\nWith a war against a Goddess looming over the horizon, Croix Bartel is caught in the middle.
