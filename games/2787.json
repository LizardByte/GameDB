The game follows the main character of the cartoon Rugrats, Tommy Pickles, who has lost eleven pieces of a twelve-piece jigsaw puzzle featuring the cartoon dinosaur Reptar. It is a 3D platform game which requires players to control several of the main characters in order to accomplish the goals through fourteen levels that are accessed when players pick up certain objects and also has bonus levels with Reptar bars. The levels can be played in any order, but the more difficult levels have to be unlocked to be playable.\n\nThe levels that players explore are mostly based on episodes from the cartoon, such as \"Chuckie's Glasses\", and contain various pieces of the Reptar puzzle. The game also has a training and activities mode, as well as a multiplayer mode.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Kids"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/rugrats-search-for-reptar", "videos": [{"id": 8624, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "qhkFD1MorEw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhkFD1MorEw", "title": "Rugrats Search For Reptar Intro", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qhkFD1MorEw/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 112121, "name": "Teaser", "video_id": "dnhGY-l9pTQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnhGY-l9pTQ", "title": "Rugrats: Search for Reptar Demo [PSX]", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dnhGY-l9pTQ/sddefault.jpg"}, {"id": 112122, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "q6izIv9jdmk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6izIv9jdmk", "title": "Rugrats: Search for Reptar (Playstation 1,PS1) Commercial 1998", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6izIv9jdmk/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
