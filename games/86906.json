To detect it, you need a little bit luck and good combinational skill.\n\nIn each row try four colors. When you have done so, your trial will be rated: For every correctly set color you get a black pin, for every right color on the wrong position you get a white one.\n\nSo you know, how many correct colors you've found, but not which colors and on which position! Try different colors and combine the result to finally find the secret code!\n\nTrain your mind with this entertaining game!", "themes": [{"id": 40, "name": "Party"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/supermind"}
