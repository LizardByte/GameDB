A secretive organization bet on saving these extraordinary beings from their own torment found the vulnerable dream shifter, and sealed his power into a necklace. To prevent any further harm, the dream shifter set out to help the survivors of the catastrophe rebuild a new civilization upon the only land mass left; an island created by his dream\u2026 Ararat Island. Once the exodus to Ararat Island had settled, he set off on a journey, never to be seen again. Five hundred years later, a girl fated to have the same ability is born.\n\nFor the girl's 16th birthday, she is gifted a necklace found on the shores of Ararat Island\u2026 the very necklace that holds the power to end the world. While she slept that evening, sentience besets a dream manifestation that has become obsessed with his creator. He shatters the necklace, knowing that if she stays\u2026 she'll be his, forever. Fantasies from her dreams manifest into reality the moment the necklace shatters. The real and dream worlds become one, and she is consumed by the very dream world she created.
