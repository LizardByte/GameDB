It is not extremely difficult to complete, but there are a lot of secrets for those hardcore completionists out there.\n\nIn 100th, you play a small character with a balloon companion. There are no enemies, only environmental hazards; your fickle friend, however, makes for a uniquely challenging experience to the end.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/100th"}
