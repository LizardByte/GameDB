Jump over the protruding buttons you take off higher and you need to direct the ball to not fall down. Total in the game are 12 platforms, each corresponds to the months of the year, and is highlighted in color. The higher you climb, the higher the jumps and the harder it is to stay on the platform. Good Luck."}
