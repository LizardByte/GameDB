Rising Tide extends Beyond Earth to new frontiers on the planet\u2019s surface and beneath its seas, adding even more choices and diplomatic options as you continue to build \u201cjust one more turn\u201d toward a new vision for the future of humanity.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 41, "name": "4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)"}], "videos": [{"id": 4741, "name": "E3 Walkthrough Trailer", "video_id": "16djZP57c9E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16djZP57c9E", "title": "Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Beyond Earth \u2013 Rising Tide - E3 Walkthrough Trailer (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/16djZP57c9E/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 4742, "name": "Featurette 1", "video_id": "YemWr9GrFg8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YemWr9GrFg8", "title": "Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Beyond Earth \u2013 Rising Tide - Featurette 1 (Official)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YemWr9GrFg8/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
