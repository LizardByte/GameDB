The only city-state free of monarchs and unelected officials, it has been infested with something arguably even worse - capitalists.

Hunt the mighty Bloatalope, the dangerous Flaymonkey, and the Sharp-Toothed Chargebeast! Sleep in flea-infested beds! Only in the democratic citystate of FREEPORT! (No taxation until 100 gold crowns per week.)", "summary": "Swords of Freeport is a text-mode social RPG heavily inspired by the style of Bulletin Board System door games from back in the '90s. It is part MUD and part BBS Game (without the need for a BBS). You can play it on your home machine alone, or play/install it on an internet-accessible machine where others can join you.\n\nIt is heavily inspired by games such as Legend of the Red Dragon, with a certain numbers of turns per day. Select a profession, join a guild, and make a name for yourself.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/swords-of-freeport"}
