The world map is divided into various territories. From your home base in europe you invade adjacent territories and, through the violent subterfuge of your agents, wrestle them from rival syndicates. Having done so, raise taxes on the locals to increase your profits and punish them for serving the wrong syndicate.\n\nBut raising taxes can make you very unpopular.and furious natives leading popular rebellions can eat into syndicate profits. So keep an eye on foreign interests and pick off troublemakers with your teams of agents. And while you're busy expanding your syndicates empire abroad, rival agents are working in your own back yard to de-stabilise your syndicate. Ensure agents are briefed to weed out traitors whose actions might bring about your downfall.\n\nBy meeting all challenges, destroying all targets and gaining control of all the territories, your syndicate triumphs.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "videos": [{"id": 501, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "qw2W_Ap7m2k"}, {"id": 502, "name": "Gameplay video", "video_id": "6oO-_3ib2gk"}]}
