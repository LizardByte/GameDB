Start by dressing your characters in their protective gear, then head into the control room, where you\u2019ll receive emergency calls, then drive the firetruck, helicopter or ambulance to reach your missions! and spray the fire, extinguish the burning flames and save lives! \n \nBut! There\u2019s more to My Town : Fire Station Rescue than heading out for your missions. Children can learn about the daily lives of emergency workers by exploring what they do while waiting for the next call. Your family can visit you at the fire station and you can challenge them to a ping-pong game. Perhaps they\u2019ve always wanted to see My Town from the sky? You can take them out on a helicopter flight! Just don\u2019t forget to leave time for the gym, so you ensure you are fit and ready for any mission that might come your way.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-town-fire-station-rescue"}
