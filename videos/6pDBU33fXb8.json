Episode 38\n\nThis Time: Zero Divide: The Final Conflict from 1997 by ZOOM.\nIt's the 3rd and final part of this 3D Robot fighting game.\nJust like Virtua Fighter 2, Dead or Alive and Last Bronx etc. Zero Divide 3 runs in 'Highres' mode (480i) and looks amazing on SD TVs! This game has some nice hidden mini games like a SHMUP called 'Mini Phalanx'. I unlocked the hidden Cat/Neco character aswell, go to 29:00.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n\u00a9iPlaySEGA\n\n#ZeroDivide #SegaSaturn #\u30bb\u30ac\u30b5\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pDBU33fXb8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pDBU33fXb8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pDBU33fXb8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pDBU33fXb8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6pDBU33fXb8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Zero Divide The Final Conflict (1997) IO Playthrough + Bonus Games (60 FPS) SEGA Saturn / iPlaySEGA", "description": "Find me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/iPlaySEGA\nFind me on Facebook: https://facebook.com/iPlaySEGA\nFind me on Instagram: https://instagram.com/iPlaySEGAofficial\n\nWelcome to iPLAY SEGA!!
