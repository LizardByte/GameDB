Ultimately battered and spent, Uriel was forced to abscond to the realm of man. Consciousness desperately waning, Uriel tethered his primordial animus to the form of a passing novitiate sword-brother - Ruthven - and over the course of the following days and years, clandestinely aided the latter in the honing of his swordcraft, intending to subjugate his mortal corpus once his own faculties were redeemed.\nAs Ruthven's mettle was whetted to a fine point, so too undeniably brilliant did its glint reflect among the rank and file of his House. Yet, on one fateful day where a sparring duel was to be arranged, Ruthven, in a moment of hubris, unleashed a strike fortified by livid Daemonic energy, instantly damning him as an irredeemable traitor to be hunted for all time. Hopeless and outnumbered against his former kin, Ruthven made one final appeal to Uriel, who answered by manifesting into being - and rebuking their beleaguering troupe of would-be executioners with ruthless efficiency - an act that was apparent in its message to the Celestial Realm. As celestial champions, one after another, set themselves to tracking down the revived Ferrum Daemonum and his human servitor to enforce their demise, the Daemonic duo steel themselves for a stand to the death... for a chance to live.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/otherworld-legends-sinistar-ruthven"}
