Your village was supposed to harvest its bounty, but managed to draw the attention of the unrelenting darkness inhabiting the woods. As the dangers descend upon it, it's your job as the village chief to help the peasants fend off the creatures and make it through the dark night, as the sinister secrets of the woods best left alone awake and focus their attention on you.\n\nBlack Forest is a city builder like no other. Where other games focus on expansion and development, Black Forest is all about defending what's yours. Strategically assign villagers, gather resources, reinforce defenses, and above all, maintain the delicate balance until the king's knights arrive.\n\nEvery decision matters, every loss is permanent, and come nightfall, the relentless horde of forest-dwellers will test your ability to govern and survive. Remember: Until the king's knights arrive, you and your villagers are completely on your own.", "summary": "Black Forest is a single-player, real-time strategy city builder like no other.
