He gets run over by a bus. Sprayed with cheese sandwich by a supernatural being. Smashed against a tunnel by a speeding train. He gets incinerated, widdled on, folded, bent, spindled, mutilated and generally mucked about with. And in return? He gets the leading role in a perplexing, hilarious race against time and chance, set in a jinxed land menaced by the impending death of good fortune. Look on the bright side - it could be your luckiest move yet. Don't expect tiresome trolls, obvious orcs, silly spells and wet, wimpish witches in JINXTER. Infuriating, enchanting, absurd and hilarious by turns, JINXTER will surprise you with every move you make. But don't forget: every silver lining has a cloud."}
