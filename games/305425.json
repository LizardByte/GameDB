What seems like a completely normal night by the river of the Rhine is turning out to be the beginning of the end for the world's longest lasting empire! Tens of thousands of germanic soldiers have moved silently towards the river under the cover of the night.\n\nThe Roman province is putting up a good fight, but it's slowly dawning on them that the area they have controlled for centuries can no longer be protected. The Germanic tribes win back more important provinces, but they need a strong leader to gather around.\n\nIt will be your task to lead the campaign from there and progress through Europe, province by province! But you are not alone. Other factions are also ready to fight for the same goal: capture Rome and be part of history!", "summary": "Forge your Kingdom amidst the Ruins of Rome!
