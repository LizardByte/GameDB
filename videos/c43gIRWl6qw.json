Out There: Oceans of Time is an ambitious blend of sci-fi interactive fiction, strategy, and survival like nothing you've played before.\n\nIn a far-flung corner of the universe where humans are a mistrusted minority, you were entrusted with transported the most dangerous being alive to an impregnable prison\u2014and it escaped. Now you must lead a team of explorers, misfits, and bounty hunters on a galaxy-spanning mission of redemption to find the Archon and recapture it before it is too late.\n\nOut There: Oceans of Time is the sequel to Out There, the half-million-unit-selling indie hit from Mi-Clos Studio.
