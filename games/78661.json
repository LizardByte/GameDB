Although the port was likely a response to the popularity of Nintendo's Wii Fit, it does not use the Wii Balance Board. In the program, a digital aerobics instructor named Maya leads the player through a series of exercises tailored to the player's current health and fitness levels. During each workout, Maya will ask how the player is doing, and the response is used to determine whether to make the workouts more or less intense. If the player owns an exercise ball, exercise step, hand weights, or a heart rate monitor, Maya can incorporate these into the workouts.", "themes": [{"id": 32, "name": "Non-fiction"}, {"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/my-fitness-coach"}
