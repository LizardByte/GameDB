Master the lethal jetboard attack, unlock ridiculously extreme weaponry, defeat awesome bosses, blow stuff up! Next-generation retrogaming mayhem.\n\ntwitter: http://twitter.com/bitbulldotcom\ndevlog: http://bit.ly/jbjdevlog\nwebsite: http://jetboardjoust.bitbull.com\n\nThe Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and kick some serious alien butt. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.\n\nThe Weapons: From the conventional (flamethrower, R.P.G., grenade launcher), to the ridiculous (gravity hammer, gamma ray, antimatter gun) and many more - Jetboard Joust offers a plethora of powerful weapons, each with its own upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of total destruction in your wake.\n\nThe Enemies: A huge range of enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the above weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too...  \n\nThe Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of gruelling multi-stage battles. These guys will test your weapon-handling to its limits.  \n\nThe Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Unlock teleports and earn huge bonuses by clearing multiple levels.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HgrctGL76y4/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HgrctGL76y4/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HgrctGL76y4/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HgrctGL76y4/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HgrctGL76y4/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Jetboard Joust: Next-Generation Retrogaming Arcade SHMUP", "description": "Revised Released Date Oct 23rd 2020 \u2192 Wishlist on Steam here: http://bit.ly/jbjsteam\n\nStop evil aliens abducting civilians and turning them into mutants in this unique and intense, blend of old-school arcade shmup and modern roguelite.
