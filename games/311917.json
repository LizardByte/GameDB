The project originally started as a solo megawad designed by Devon Barnett (Xyzzy01), with the first 20 maps made by him, but later evolved into a complete community project with 39 map contributions from various authors.\n\nThe megawad took inspiration from other projects such as Congestion 1024 and Claustrophobia 1024. All maps submitted were designed under the limit of a 256 by 256 square space in the level editor.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/confinement-256"}
