You entered the business seven years ago, just after the end of your longest relationship. You became famous for solving the case of kidnappings in the capital. Months have passed since the case of the Lighthouse of S\u00e3o Bento do Oeste. Since then you have become an active detective in the South Minas region. Everything changed when days ago you received an e-mail from Julia.\n\nHi Rene, How long <3\n\nIt's me, Julia, sending this email to invite you on a trip. It's been months since we last saw each other and so I wanted to invite you to spend the vacation together. In case you don't know, I have now become an editor at Sergipe Magazine, a famous political magazine in the country, and during the school vacations at the end of the year, I decided that I wanted to travel to the city of Botuca\u00edba, in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nYou may be wondering why a teacher from S\u00e3o Bento do Oeste would want to spend her vacation in a city in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo. I want to spend my vacation in a town in the countryside of S\u00e3o Paulo. To know the answer comes to me personally hahaha.\n\nI hope this e-mail finds you well!\n\nYours truly, - Julia", "summary": "The Case of the City Botucaiba is a mystery visual novel for the Sega Saturn about Renne Bras, a detective who travels to Botuca\u00edba to investigate the mysteries surrounding the city.
