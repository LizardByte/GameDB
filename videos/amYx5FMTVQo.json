Based on the current style of 2D classic Sonic games inspired by Sonic Mania, Sonic Chaos updates the 8 bit visuals of the original and adapts a play style more closely resembling the classic 16-bit games.\n\nDownload the demo here - https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/sonic-chaos-turquoise-hill-demo.228/\n\nThe game has been in development for almost an entire year, where time was spent building a brand new engine from scratch. Sonic Chaos uses this new engine, Crimson Engine, and with it we've strived for classic Sonic gameplay accuracy. The demo will be available to play on August 25th 2018. Links will be posted in this description.\n\nYou can catch the demo of the game at this years SAGE 2018, which goes live August 25th 2018.\n\nIf you'd like to check out the Soundtrack to the game, it was composed by Michael Staple.
