Whereas JF! focused more on platforming than shooting, Geograph Seal is almost the opposite, focusing on constant action with platforming playing less of a role. It's a shame too, because the X68K isn't exactly known for many 3D games, though Geograph Seal is proof that they could have been made with great results.\r\n\r\nThe game opens with an interesting mission briefing with spoken English dialogue (that is admittedly incredibly hard to understand) and plays awesome generic music you've probably heard in tons of great shmups prior that gets you pumped and ready to play. You are a frog/rabbit prototype fighter who usually goes from level to level, blasting enemies with a variety of weapons, executing massive (and numerous) mid-air jumps to stomp foes flat (and gain bonuses), and destroying various generators so you can gain access to the room or area the boss is locked in. The game actually has a smidge of variety between how each stage is presented. The game runs at a crisp, usually steady framerate and the soundtrack is great, with the music sounding like the Genesis/MD's Yamaha YM2612 in overdrive. Everything generally sounds as it should.\r\n\r\nThe game could have used a better navigation system and the controls take a little getting used to as they aren't as precise as the JF! titles that have since honed the first-person jumping to near-perfection. The game is not as easy as JF! either. You'll be tested right after the first level. Still, it's an impressive showing on X68K hardware and worth checking out. This is a video of the game in action.
