The player can use the arrow keys to turn the worm, but must take care not to run into the surrounding walls, the obstacles, or the worm itself. Once the worm has eaten 5 regular mushrooms, doors open in the walls, through which the player can advance to the next level.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/snake--12"}
