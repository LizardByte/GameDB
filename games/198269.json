Thankfully, the storm passed, and though the skies began to clear, a cold winter settled in. The high waters froze, and snow covered the terrain. Ships were stuck in the ice, which only added to the odd serenity that had befallen Heathmoor.\n\nAfter so many hardships, so many battles and natural catastrophes, the people took this small respite as an opportunity to reconnect. After being separated for so long, friends and families were reunited once again, and everyone took the time to count their blessings, and celebrate. But amid the festivities, something unforeseen came from the frozen sea. A large ship with red sails reached the harbor, the herald of uncertainty \u2013 and intrigue.", "summary": "The rise of the waters during the Tempest and the subsequent winter allowed seafaring pirates passage to the frozen shores of Heathmoor. These pirates had no allegiance to any faction \u2013 they only cared about treasure. In their pursuit of wealth, they began trading with the people, offering warriors access to new weapons from across the sea.\n\nTake your character through a journey of 100 Tiers of rewards for all heroes! Available during For Honor: Frozen Shores only.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/for-honor-season-20-frozen-shores"}
