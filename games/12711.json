The once green and beautiful planet now resembles Death Valley, USA. The soil is dry and scorched; there is little vegetation to be seen anywhere. The Earth has been in this state ever since the ozone layer was destroyed in the latter part of the twentieth century. They say the aerosol was to blame; a primitive form of dispensing container using highly dangerous propellant gas.\n\nScientists saw the holes developing in the ozone layer and sent warnings but they were never taken seriously, until it was too late. The holes were there and they were growing. The damage was minimal at first but eventually grew into an unstoppable apocalypse. Radiation from the sun caused terrible damage to the environment and forced people to retreat underground, safe from harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. Vast subterranean cities evolved, but in isolation.\n\nToday, the only link between these underground cities is the old network of surface freeways, now ruled by anarchic gangs of outcasts, known wholly as surface dwellers. The only people daring to make trips these days are the Overlanders...\n\nThe Overlanders are a breed apart. They keep themselves to themselves. Their only passion in life is their customised cars; pre-apocalypse vehicles dragged underground and rebuilt; rebuilt for speed and survival. They make journeys for cash, running cargo across the surface dwellers gauntlet. Life is improving the car. Cargo's are carried for cash, cash means a better, faster, more powerful car...", "summary": "A roadblasters style driving game. You drive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland in your armour-plated car.
