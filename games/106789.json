Radirgy Swag consists of a single continuous run with endless enemies (under certain circumstances) and no bosses or rigid stage transitions whatsoever. Also, this game features an energy meter that depletes over time and upon being hit by enemy attacks (but can be replenished with items), instead of the traditional lives system.", "summary": "Radirgy Swag is a unique shooter with game mechanics that can be enjoyed by players of all different levels. The planes in Radirgy Swag are not only equipped with guns, but you can also destroy enemies with your sword. This feature allows you to attack your enemies from different angles. Use your shield or fill up your Absonet gauge to give you temporary invincibility against your foes. Master both offensive and defensive techniques to conquer your mission.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/radirgy-swag", "videos": [{"id": 34431, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "kf21rqip_B0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf21rqip_B0", "title": "\u30e9\u30b8\u30eb\u30ae\u30b9\u30ef\u30c3\u30b0\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u52d5\u753b", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kf21rqip_B0/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
