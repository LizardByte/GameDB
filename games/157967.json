Escaping with what little gold they could carry, the disgraced lords travelled south to recruit an infamous band of sellswords, armed to the teeth with heavy weapons and gunpowder armaments, to exact vengeance and restore their glory.\nThese soldiers of fortune hail from Sicania, their pockets lined with gold and their notorious reputations preceding them.
