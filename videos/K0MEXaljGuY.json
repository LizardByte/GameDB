It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 3-5 minutes when you just wanna shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible and pickup a few power-ups along the way (.. ahem... you'll need them). Enemies increase in number and difficulty as waves progress. They're worth more points each wave.\n\nMusic By Alexandr Zhelanov (CC-BY-4.0):\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/miniepictheme\nhttps://soundcloud.com/alexandr-zhelanov", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K0MEXaljGuY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K0MEXaljGuY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K0MEXaljGuY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K0MEXaljGuY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K0MEXaljGuY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Final Storm Release Promo", "description": "Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/731820/Final_Storm/\n\nItch.io:  https://bitbionic.itch.io/final-storm\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bitbionic\nFinal Storm is a cross-platform twin-stick shooter and bullet hellish game.
