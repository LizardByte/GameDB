The game is a port of the 2009 video game, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA, with updated visuals. The gameplay is relatively the same as the original. The signature PlayStation buttons, cross, circle, square and triangle are now the 4 large buttons on the machine's panel, and players push those buttons to play the games. Unlike the handheld versions of the game, players can hold a button or buttons for an unlimited time when the game indicates to hold a certain note. This will allow players to receive a bonus which continuely increases the score until the player releases one of the held button or a \"Max Hold Bonus\" is granted. Another difference is that multiple buttons can be hit at the same time up to all four buttons. The arcade version features songs from both Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series and Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai, along with a variety of original songs not included in either of the handheld versions. The Promotional Videos for the game, which are the videos playing in the background during a song have been updated and re-rendered for the game bearing a similar resemblance to the Dreamy Theatre versions of the PVs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hatsune-miku-project-diva-arcade", "videos": [{"id": 5231, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Vvzvxkq7q3k"}]}
