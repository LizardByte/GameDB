It features nine wholly new levels, a custom boss monster (sprites & sound by Eriance, dehacked by @Obsidian), and new music (by @Taw Tu'lki). It is primarily designed for pistol start single player, but is playable in continuous and/or co-op modes. Deathmatch is not supported. \ufeff", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/spectrum--3"}
