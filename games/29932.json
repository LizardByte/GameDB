What's their secret? They accept only students with Talents \u2013 special powers that border on magic, granted by the divine, said to only occur in one in every ten thousand people by the time they reach adolescence.\n\nI'm in love with this girl, Yuki Suzu, the dorm leader of the elites on campus, the White Lilies. And you know where I am on the pecking order? The very bottom of the Black Roses, a pack of slackers and rejects.
