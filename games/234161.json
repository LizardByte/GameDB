Each believe that their way of life is the only way, and are dedicated to teaching their polices to all other nations through what their leaders claim as divine intervention, or as you will know it... war. The others are known as: \"Archidons,\" the way of the archer, \"Swordwrath,\" the way of the sword, \"Magikill,\" the way of the mage, and \"Speartons,\" the way of the Spear.\n\nYou are the leader of the nation called \"Order\" , your way is of peace and knowledge, your people do not worship their weapons as gods. This makes you a mark for infiltration by the surrounding nations. Your only chance to defend is to attack first, and obtain the weapons from each nation along the way.\"", "summary": "Stick War is a classic strategy war game featuring stick figures.
