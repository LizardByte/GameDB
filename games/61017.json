It is the first game in the beatmania III series, a spin-off of the beatmania series. It is part of the BEMANI franchise. \n \nThe game is played with a controller with one turn table, one foot pedal and 5 keys, three white and two black. On the screen you will see bars moving from the top to bottom in columns representing each of the keys, foot pedal and the turntable. When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. \n \nThis game starts the beatmania III spinoff series, which introduces the foot pedal into the game, which has separate notes tied to it. The foot pedal can also be configured to act as one of the 5 regular keys as well. \n \nSince the series features upgraded hardware in comparison to the main series, the game has more fluid movies and animation and the interface is generally more colorful. The effector table is also expanded. \n \nThe cabinet has a floppy disk slot on which you can save scores, unlocked songs and game modes. A headphone jack is also included. \n \nThis is the only game in the series with brand new songs, the rest of the games were released as \"APPEND\" games, pulling in songs from their beatmania counterpart.
