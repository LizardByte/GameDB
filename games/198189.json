Race against five opponents across three difficulties of Grand Prix, for a total of six courses. Racers can collect items from question mark panels, ranging from projectiles such as bombs, missiles and Slime Bombs, to situational items like landmines, shields and nitro boosts. There are six different colours of Bomberman and three karts to choose from, each with their own unique stats.\n\nAlongside the Grand Prix, you can race any track alone in the Time Trial mode and aim to beat your personal beat. Records for both Grand Prix and Time Trial can be uploaded to a national server.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/bomberman-kart--2"}
