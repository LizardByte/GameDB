Players take the role of mercenary John Mullins as he hunts down and eliminates bio-terrorists that are threatening the world with a deadly plague, the Gemini Virus. The Gold Edition contains more than 55 levels, eleven new maps, a new infiltration multiplayer game mode, an expanded arsenal including weapons such as the SIG 552 rifle, MP5SD, and Silver Talon pistol, and an anti-cheat \"PunkBuster\" modification.\n\nA single-player random mission generator promises diversity in gameplay and offers four mission types (escape, assassination, infiltration, and demolition), varied locations (desert, hills, jungle, plains, or snow), night or day settings, four difficulty levels, and time limit options. The original Quake III: Arena engine has been enhanced with GHOUL II technology that provides improved animation and more carnage with 36 damage and 16 dismemberment zones. Other features of the graphical upgrade include per-pixel hit detection, new facial animations and full skeletal soft-skinned models.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/soldier-of-fortune-ii-double-helix-gold-edition", "collections": [{"id": 569, "name": "Soldier of Fortune"}]}
