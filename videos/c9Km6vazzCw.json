For anyone asking this is being played on a real N64 not an emulator.\n\nIn 2000, StarCraft 64 was released for the Nintendo 64, co-developed by Blizzard Entertainment and Mass Media Inc. The game featured all of the missions from both StarCraft and the expansion Brood War, as well as some exclusive missions, such as two different tutorials and a new secret mission, Resurrection IV.Resurrection IV is set after the conclusion of Brood War, and follows Jim Raynor embarking on a mission to rescue the Brood War character Alexei Stukov, a vice admiral from Earth who has been captured by the Zerg. The Brood War missions required the use of a Nintendo 64 memory Expansion Pak to run.In addition, StarCraft 64 features a split screen cooperative mode, also requiring the expansion pak, allowing two players to control one force in-game.StarCraft 64 was not as popular as the PC version, and lacked the online multiplayer capabilities and speech in mission briefings. In addition, cut scenes were shortened.Despite this, the game maintained positive reviews. Blizzard Entertainment had previously considered a PlayStation port of the game, but it was decided that the game would instead be released on the Nintendo 64.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c9Km6vazzCw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c9Km6vazzCw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c9Km6vazzCw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c9Km6vazzCw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "N64: StarCraft 64", "description": "Nintendo 64 version of StarCraft.
