This is a spit-and-polish release, with some new features to play with, but the emphasis on refining the Quoth 2 content, re-balancing some monsters, fixing old bugs, and keeping Quoth as lightweight as possible.\"\n\nQuoth is an expansion pack for Quake 1 single player.\n\nIt is not intended as a series of thematically connected maps with additional custom content, as other packs are. The intention is to provide quality custom content for Q1 mappers and players in a single pak file. There are maps included in the pak, but there are also larger maps using the content already released separately by both Kell and necros, and more maps will surely follow.\n\nIts features include technical additions for mappers, new monsters, and a couple of new weapons/items.", "videos": [{"id": 66311, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "K_ma7phPnOY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ma7phPnOY", "title": "Quake Singleplayer - Quoth - Remix of the Damned (e1m2quoth)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K_ma7phPnOY/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
