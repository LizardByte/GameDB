It presents challenges difficult enough that a standard player may struggle, but indicators throughout are in place to help guide you to the goal. It's difficulty is between kaizo beginner-intermediate and players can expect to beat it within 1-4 hours depending on skillset.\n\nThis hack makes use of some more complicated tech that may be unfamiliar to the casual player- blue coins are in place to indicate spin jumps and green coins indicate item throws (usually shells). Color palettes and graphic choices were carefully picked to match the setting and create a tone for each level. Every level\u2019s soundtrack was also carefully selected in an effort to create a satisfying gameplay loop as the player grinds each of the 28 courses. The map is comprised of several different zones strung together to feel like a complete world. Levels do not have a difficulty curve as there are plenty of \u2018palette cleansers\u2019 throughout. This design choice was decided to give the player a chance to breathe and continue progressing without wanting to destroy their controller in frustration after a lengthy grind.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/smoked-fish-and-cabbage-2", "collections": [{"id": 11098, "name": "Smoked Fish And Cabbage"}]}
