There are still lots of features I'd like to include in this mod, but oh well, here's the big public release!

Stay tuned for some Remastered gameplay videos.\n\nFor other projects, I really want to organize my older experimental mods and get them uploaded to GitHub for people to mess around with.  I'm not completely finished with Block Quake yet, I have plans to create a colorful Blocky-WAD for mappers and an \"extra goodies\" version with custom changes to the source code for new special effects and gameplay events (eventually!)
