But rather than being a basic game of Othello, you also have the option to play against Leonardo Da Vinci or Albert Einstein... or at least, live action actors playing the said historical figures. Since there's barely any decent CD-i emulators, I used the SameCDi core on RetroArch. The core itself is the standalone MAME core specifically for CD-i titles. While the game does work fine, unfortunately the game crashed when I was almost done playing against Da Vinci. But other than that, it's a rather interesting take on the classic board game in terms of presentation.\n\n#othello #cdi #retrogaming #retrogames #philipscdi #othellocdi #davinci #leonardo_da_vinci #alberteinstein #boardgame #cdigames #philipscdigames #samecdi #retroarch", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-K0WHjW0t0s/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-K0WHjW0t0s/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-K0WHjW0t0s/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-K0WHjW0t0s/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-K0WHjW0t0s/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Othello - Philips CD-i Gameplay", "description": "Yes, there really was Othello on the Philips CD-i.
