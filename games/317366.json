It was released the 28th of May 2023.\n\nAfter being sealed away for 200 years, the God of Wisdom, Abyssliese, wakes up. They meet their loyal and only remaining priest, Theseus.\n\nThe reason why Abyssliese and many other gods were sealed away was because of a recent god named Tinirese. With his powers, he made himself the only god to be believed in.\n\nWanting to stop him, Abyssliese will try to get out of their temple with Theseus, but it will be a long and difficult task, even with the help of the many characters the duo will come across.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/closed-faith--1"}
