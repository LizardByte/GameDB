For some people, Pok\u00e9mon are pets. Others use them for battling. There are numerous mysteries surrounding them, and they are a popular subject of research. Either way, humans live in harmony with Pok\u00e9mon, and they have done so for ages. Meanwhile, three teenagers, two from Pallet Town and one from Viridian City, decide to travel through the Kanto region to collect eight badges of Kanto, and to take on the Pok\u00e9mon League Challenge. The names of the teens are Red, Green, and Blue, and they each have received a Pok\u00e9mon from Professor Oak. They have no idea what awaits them, such as an increasingly threatening crime organization known as Team Rocket. The three of them will meet many people on their journey, some helpful, such as Blue\u2019s older sister Daisy. They will also meet Kamon, a younger boy who claims to despise Team Rocket, and is always right on their tail. What are Kamon\u2019s motives? Or more importantly, what are Team Rocket\u2019s motives?", "summary": "This hack is a remake of the very first Pok\u00e9mon games, Pok\u00e9mon Red & Green. This is how I would remake them, and it\u2019s totally different from FireRed & LeafGreen. This will be a Kanto adventure you\u2019ve never experienced, and it will be totally modernized, and fun. This is my reboot of Pok\u00e9mon, think of it as a new Generation I. This isn\u2019t a Gen III hack, this isn\u2019t a Gen IV/V wannabe hack, this is Chaos Rush\u2019s Generation I game.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}]}
