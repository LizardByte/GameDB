The game is loosely based upon the movies of the same title. Though in Taxi 3 the game plays out more of a point to point style game like Sega Rally, or Daytona USA. \nAs the game is in French language only it was a little difficult navigating through menus, or reading dialogue. But the game was still very playable, and actually quite fun. It is however developed by UBI soft, so that could be expected really. \nThe gameplay is fast, im assuming thats in the style of the movies. The levels work well with the framerate and can actually be quite intense at times. The controls were a little sharp, but are easily forgiven. And in general, it wasnt a bad game at all. \n\nIll be happy to play through this one. So if anyone is interested in seeing more of this one then please leave a comment in the box below.
