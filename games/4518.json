The Road Runner can also scare an unsuspecting Coyote with his Beep-Beep attack.\n\nAs the Coyote, you use Acme's crazy gadgets to catch the Road Runner, constantly attempting to master their power without getting yourself flattened. The Coyote has a special leap attack which allows him to make a last ditch attempt to grab the bird!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/desert-demolition-starring-road-runner-and-wile-e-coyote", "collections": [{"id": 3417, "name": "Looney Tunes"}]}
