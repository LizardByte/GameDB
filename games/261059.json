The player controls Galatea, commander of the newly established princess guard,on her adventures trying to protect the adventure-loving princess of Laomedia. The player must explore various dungeons and partake in turn-based combat to defeat enemies.\n\nWhile the in-dungeon gameplay is fairly similar to most traditional console RPGs (although, the game does feature a SaGa-inspired glimmer system for unlocking new abilities mid-combat), while in the castle, the player can also interact with a variety of characters and flirt with all the cute girls around! The game keeps track of how \"yuri\" the player's responses to the different characters are via a yuri gauge, a fun play on the typical alignment gauge found in other RPGs.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-princess-and-the-rose-knight"}
