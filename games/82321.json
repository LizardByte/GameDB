No you don't, you have been shaken, you feel weird. The usual VR coasters are beautiful and almost relaxing, this one is not. it has been thought and created to shake your senses, to make you feeling like in a real one. dark and light, beat sounds... This coaster has not been made for you to see something beautiful, but to feel something. Enjoy more than 5 minutes of pure speed.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}]}
