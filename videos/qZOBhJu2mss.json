Anyways I play this game 99% blind, the 1% I didn't play blind was to find 2-3 spots to get 100% items. So yes I get every item in the game among completing it for the first time. The game is not bad, although I don't think this franchise translates to 2D that well. Still it's kinda fun and has good music/graphics. The hit detection is a little off sometimes unfortunately. The final boss is pretty annoying until I got the pattern down well enough.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZOBhJu2mss/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZOBhJu2mss/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qZOBhJu2mss/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "Banjo Kazooie Grunty's Revenge (GBA) Longplay [175]", "description": "Sorry for the few skips in the video, i've been very sick so I couldn't do it all in one session, it took 2 while still feeling unwell.
