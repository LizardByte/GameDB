The Game was released in 2004. The box art for PES4, like PES3, displays an image of then referee Pierluigi Collina, despite the fact that he does not appear in the game. Francesco Totti and Thierry Henry also appear on the cover. PES4 was the first of the Pro Evolution Soccer series to support online play but only on the Xbox. It was the first game to have licensed leagues with Serie A, Eredivisie and La Liga.", "videos": [{"id": 13475, "name": "Game intro", "video_id": "fPtzg6c3ojo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPtzg6c3ojo", "title": "Pro Evolution Soccer 4 Intro (PES4)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fPtzg6c3ojo/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
