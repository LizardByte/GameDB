It is the sequel to Hotel Dusk: Room 215, starring protagonist Kyle Hyde and placed one year after the events of its predecessor. The game has visual and audio styles similar to that of the first game. In Last Window, Kyle Hyde is living in the Cape West Apartments, Los Angeles, in 1980. The story of this sequel is separate from the first game, even though it includes some connections to it. Last Window was the last game developed by Cing before the company filed for bankruptcy on March 1, 2010.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/last-window-the-secret-of-cape-west"}
