It's not an actual looping game though as you select the loop at the start. The loop is also not different at all except for the dialogue, midbosses being slightly different and it having a different final boss.\n\nGoal of the game is to play through all six routes and figure out the mystery of the game for yourself as the game will not tell you. You have to do this before you can access the Extra stage. Extra is not implemented as of yet though.\n\nMechanics are simple, collect items to increase the bottom-left gauge. When it's full you get a bomb or life piece. The gimmick of this game is that at some point the gauge freezes at 99 and you have to bomb before the gauge resumes itself. I figured there would be a score advantage to keeping the gauge at 99 but there isn't. It's a very weird system as all it really does is encourage bombspam.\n\nThis game is very weirdly programmed. Boss and midboss fights run at 120 fps disguised as 60 fps for some bizarre reason. Fraps had some trouble making the awkward adjustment every time so sorry for that.\n\nDownload:\nhttp://www1.axfc.net/u/3319280", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ddHFY-8qZAU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ddHFY-8qZAU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ddHFY-8qZAU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ddHFY-8qZAU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ddHFY-8qZAU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Touhou \u6771\u65b9\u767d\u5875\u8a18 ~ White Names Spoiled Past - Lunatic 1cc", "description": "Newest Touhou fangame by the people who made Riverbed Soul Saver and Mystical Power Plant etc.\nIt's a mystery novel disguised as a shmup.\n\nThe game has three routes, each one has a different playable character and every route loops.
