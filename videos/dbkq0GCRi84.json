From there are the credits selected from the main menu and trailers for other games by On-line (mostly available only on the CDTV and CD32 platforms), and a \"making of\" featurette. Finally,  32:53 starts a collection of clips not shown during the course of the playthrough (discovering that you have terrible hygiene in an encounter with a hooker, the smoking man shooting the stranger, being killed by the card shark, being killed in a shootout, killing a buzzard that dive bombs a shootout opponent, the stranger shooting a child for calling him Shane, and the infamous Star Wars train sequence).\n\nThis somehow manages to be even campier than Psycho Killer, and as a result quite a bit more entertaining, even if the game is devoid of any real value as a game. The graphics are... interesting, the voices never even attempt to be serious, and the plot... I suppose you could call it that... is nothing more than barebones reason to jump from location to location. \n\nStill, with hilariously stereotyped accents, ridiculous events, and a space train that seems like it was stolen from a Star Wars outtake, it's worth a look.
