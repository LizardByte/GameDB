The landscape now shattered, their buildings drowned, and the beloved Queen Hermielle gone; a martyr to their freedom. Although challenging, the citizens of Lotte managed to adapt to their new lifestyle under the lead of Mathias Tillington. What little they knew that their Queen survived, and not just through their bard\u2019s tales. Beneath the town of Kaepe she slumbered, banished and betrayed by the ones she once considered friends, separated from the beauties and colors of life she had once taken for granted. There she has sat for the last fifty years, unaware that the forces of darkness she once thought defeated were slowly creeping into her mind.\"", "summary": "\"Shadows of Her Past, is a story-driven action role-playing game (ARPG) set to expand upon the events that occurred prior to Elette.
