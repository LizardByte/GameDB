Noted for its cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, it is a Point Of View (POV) video-based experiment in simulated socializing that takes place in an anonymous city late one night. Players navigate between several locations, and can interact with one or more people in each location to varying effects based on the player's \"reactions\" to that person. The main technical innovation of Midnight Stranger is its use of an emotional continuum Mood Bar for interaction with the in-story characters rather than a text interface or an itemized set of options for each interaction. The Mood Bar simulates some of the frustration and uncertainty when dealing with other people in social situations, and provides a more realistic role playing experience", "themes": [{"id": 31, "name": "Drama"}], "videos": [{"id": 45190, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "SrYq6BIpJGg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrYq6BIpJGg", "title": "MIDNIGHT STRANGER - Debut Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SrYq6BIpJGg/sddefault.jpg"}]}
