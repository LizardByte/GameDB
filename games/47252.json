No? Well, that's because it doesn't exist - but if it did, this game would be worthy of the official license! \n \nDeveloped by Achim Volkers and Trevor Storey, this latest collaborative release from Psytronik Software and RGCD is all about high octane motors, big guns, risky high-speed vehicular pursuit and deadly force. Play the role of Captain James Hutch as he takes on the might of the ruthless drug baron 'El Guato'. The baron has infiltrated and spread corruption through the highest ranking positions within the police force and local government, meaning that you, your partner and your tricked-out squad car are all that stands in the way of El Guato and his henchmen taking control of the city. You've never dealt with a villain this powerful before but that won't stop you from bringing his empire to its knees!", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-vice-squad"}
