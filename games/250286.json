A senior student, the famously eccentric genius Campanella, reaches out to Giovanni, and they hop onto (and take over) a driverless train on the galactic railroad. And so, Giovanni gets swept up in a journey to find the \"Crimson Southern Cross\", located at the farthest edge of the universe.\n\nOn their journey, the boys will meet great leaders of the past and pull reckless and destructive \"pranks\" on them all. Through their encounters with the history, twisted mysteries, and various horrors of the world, they will eventually have to confront the end of their own childhood. Oh, did you hear that? The boys are (pointlessly) sounding the train whistle. Looks like it's time for the galactic express to depart.", "summary": "Boyhood's End is an adventure game following Giovanni, the boy with the lowest human score in the universe, and Campanella, the delinquent genius, and their journey on the galactic railroad regarding the \"human\" and \"inhuman\".", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/boyhoods-end", "videos": [{"id": 89905, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "video_id": "vOFG1DHdQTc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOFG1DHdQTc", "title": "Boyhood's End - Announce Trailer (English)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vOFG1DHdQTc/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 94853, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "mY1w5VSGTig", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY1w5VSGTig", "title": "Boyhood's End Character Trailer", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mY1w5VSGTig/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
