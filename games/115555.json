At the end of the 14th century, 95% of the global population has perished due to rampant plague.\n\nEventually, survivors emerge from society\u2019s ashes, and it\u2019s now up to you to help them settle in a dangerous new land reclaimed by nature. Build your people a home, help shape their lives, and protect them from animals, bandits, and other dangers in a lawless post-calamity age.\n\nDesign, build and expand your settlement from a small wooden hut into a colossal stone castle. With simple-to-use 3D terrain tools you can create the perfect stronghold, from winding underground caverns to sprawling multi-story forts.\n\nThis harsh new world is rife with external threats, but you can give your colonists the upper hand in battle by building impenetrable defences and traps. Research, craft and equip weapons and gear so that they can fight back against unrelenting waves of attackers.\n\nYour colonists have more than just raids to contend with. They need protection from starvation and the elements, so it\u2019s essential to stock up on supplies and build shelter to keep them fed and warm. Maintain your villagers\u2019 emotional states, as their moods are affected if their needs and wants aren\u2019t met.\n\nGrow the population of your settlement by helping out strangers in dangerous situations, or by taking in like-minded travellers. Your villagers have personal histories and agendas, and you can get to know them by observing their behaviour and relationships with others.", "summary": "Guide a group of villagers to your heart's content in this realistic medieval colony sim.
