It's a mashup of a typing tutor and the puzzle game Puyo Puyo, which reuses many assets from Puyo Puyo Sun and a few from Puyo Puyo Tsu 95.\nIf you want to play the game yourself, I uploaded a copy to the Internet Archive along with box scans. https://archive.org/details/TYPEDAPUYO\nFun Fact: This was the first Puyo Puyo title that was produced under SEGA's ownership, beating out Minna de Puyo Puyo (Puyo Pop) by a couple of months.\nNote: I had to redo the Satan fight (paused during the middle of the fight and lost afterwards) so I cut that part out of the video and replaced it with my 2nd attempt. (to save video space)\nIf you were wondering what the continue screen is like, it's the same as Puyo Puyo Sun's continue screen but without any music.\nDownload the (mostly complete, the map screen and \"next stage\" music couldn't be recorded in full) OST here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gai1yA9Opr6urPh0r0ufMhClopekegAI/view?usp=sharing\nRead more about the game here: https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Type_da_Puyo_Puyo\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dreamcazt", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fPpg-X1m6fA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fPpg-X1m6fA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fPpg-X1m6fA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fPpg-X1m6fA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Type da Puyo Puyo (2001, Windows) Full Playthrough", "description": "A full playthrough of Type da Puyo Puyo (\u305f\u3044\u3077da\u3077\u3088\u3077\u3088), a game developed by Biox Co. and published by SEGA on May 25th, 2001 for Windows PCs.
