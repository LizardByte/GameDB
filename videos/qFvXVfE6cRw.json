We lost someone great and very important to us recently. Satoru Iwata passed away, a skilled programmer who has been at Nintendo since the very beginning of gaming. If not for him it's possible the Mother(EarthBound) series wouldn't have been made a reality, he worked on the original Mother and also saved Mother 2(EarthBound) from being scrapped due to it being a programming nightmare. He worked on many games at Nintendo including Kirby & putting the finishing touches on the Smash games like Melee. I was very saddened to see him go and all over the world shared the same hurt...he died too young.\n\nSo I bring 'Directly To You' one of the very first games he ever worked on at Nintendo, \"Balloon Fight\". Due to his passing, a fan hacked the game to add Iwata himself playable to honor him and I was humbled, he even has Kirby balloons *sniff*\n\n\"On my business card, I am a corporate president.

So 'Please Understand' that at the end of the day, gaming is not about fanboy wars & fighting...it's about fun.\n\nI will continue to have fun Iwata, in honor of your name. Thank you for all the wonderful memories & what you've done for gaming over the years.
