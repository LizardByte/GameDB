It is a shoot-em-up primarily drawing inspiration from Ikaruga. The scoring system follows the player collecting star drops from enemies killed, these stars double as points and also bomb usage. Players must collect stars one after another without allowing them to fall off-screen to chain points together, doubling until the player reaches the star cap before resetting. It is vital that the player carefully chooses which enemies to kill as killing the wrong enemy will lead to stars falling out of reach, thus resetting the counter. Certain mini-boss like enemies will drop 3 stars upon death, with each star retaining the current score multiplier.", "themes": [{"id": 18, "name": "Science fiction"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/tobichiyon-x"}
