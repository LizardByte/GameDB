No playthrough is ever the same, it\u2019s a fresh challenge every time. You\u2019ll never play the same deck twice! Hell has frozen over. Only you can protect the final burning pyre from the forces of heaven and restore the inferno. To take back hell, you\u2019ll need to power up. Choose your route carefully, different locations yield different benefits. Upgrade your champion, gain Pact Shards and their benefits, recruit powerful units, upgrade cards, gain passive bonuses, or duplicate any card in your deck. Strategize to Fit Your Playstyle With six clans to choose from, each has its own unique and surprising gameplay. Pick your primary and supporting clan to gain access to all cards from both. During your run you will be able to improve cards by mixing and matching upgrades to open up new roads to victory. You can even duplicate your favorite card at special map nodes before facing off against the final boss. The Last Divinity If you have gained 100 or more Pact Shards when you defeat Seraph, a final battle unlocks and you can face \u2013 The Last Divinity! Hell Rush - Multiplayer In the Hell Rush multiplayer mode, eight players compete in a frantic real-time contest. Only a true speed demon can remain undefeated. You will never play the same deck twice!", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/monster-train-first-class"}
