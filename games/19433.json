From inside a magical book, players use their deck of cards to create a quest for their legend. Legends earn gold as they progress through the quest, fighting enemy cards, which players can spend to aid their legends. Enemy players will be creating their own quests and may steal gold or weapons. In the end, players do battle against each other, with the victor being the last one standing.\n\nIt was a multiplayer game that was planned to have integration with RuneScape in the form of gaining additional cards. The beta version was released on 25 November 2015 and was officially released on Steam on 26 May 2016.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, it was announced that the game would be removed due to \"multiple technical issues\" combined with a dwindling player base. The servers for the game remained running until 6 August", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "videos": [{"id": 8288, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "Ems8PLushVM"}]}
