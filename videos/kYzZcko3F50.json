Dr. Proton is a madman, determined to take over the world with his army of Techbots. Duke Nukem, the eponymous hero, takes upon the task of stopping him. The first episode takes place in the devastated city of Los Angeles. In the second episode, Duke chases Dr. Proton to his secret moonbase. In the third episode, Dr. Proton escapes into the future, and Duke pursues him through time, to put a permanent end to his mad schemes.\n\nThe main objective of the game is to get to the exit of each level, while destroying enemies and collecting points. Many objects onscreen can be shot including boxes, obstacles and blocks. Besides points, some collectibles include health powerups, gun powerups, and some inventory items with special abilities. The final level of each episode has no exit, and is instead completed by finding and defeating Dr. Proton.\n\nAt the end of every level (with the exception of the last level in each episode), the player can receive up to seven 10,000 point bonuses, earned by making certain achievements in the level, such as destroying all cameras.\n\nDuke Nukem (sometimes referred to as Duke Nukum) is a 2D platform game developed and published by Apogee Software (now 3D Realms), featuring the adventures of the fictional character Duke Nukem.\n\nDuke Nukem was followed by Duke Nukem II in 1993, featuring the same hero still without the dark sunglasses, and later Duke Nukem 3D in 1996. A third sequel, Duke Nukem Forever, was announced in 1997. Plagued by various developmental problems and delays, the game would later be picked up by Gearbox Software and released in 2011, fourteen years after the game was announced and twenty years after the first game was released. In a downloadable content (DLC) for that game, titled \"The Doctor Who Cloned Me\", Dr. Proton made his return.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNostalgic value for retrogamers in the Highest HD quality you can find on Youtube!
