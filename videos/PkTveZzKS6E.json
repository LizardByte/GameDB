{"id": "PkTveZzKS6E", "snippet": {"title": "Flip Out Atari Jaguar Longplay - Gorrilla Systems", "description": "Heresa longplay of the weird and confusing puzzle game on the Atari Jaguar called Flip Out. The idea of the game is to flip around colours squares and make them land on their desired positions. It seems easy but each time you flip one, yo must move another before the flipped one lands or its a fail! It takes some time getting used to it but after a while i started to enjoy the game. But then after more time it became rather repetetive and i got bored.\nIts a decent game to own for puzzle fans, but its not one of the jags better releases.\n\nPlease leave a comment down below if youd like to see more, and please dont forget to subscribe if you havent already. \r\n\r\nCheck out our Website http://retrodetect.com\r\nCome Chat to Us on Discord https://discord.gg/EK9dVQD\r\nSupport us on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/RetroDetect\r\n\r\nThanks for watching, check out all my other videos here: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNZylG5ZROX7uhBo-GjnHqg\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SHLIMPOLE", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkTveZzKS6E/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkTveZzKS6E/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkTveZzKS6E/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkTveZzKS6E/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PkTveZzKS6E/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Flip Out Atari Jaguar Longplay - Gorrilla Systems", "description": "Heresa longplay of the weird and confusing puzzle game on the Atari Jaguar called Flip Out.
