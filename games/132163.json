Heading along the shore, Ada encounters one of the Chainsaw Sisters. After defeating her, Ada retrieves the Green Catseye, returns to the church, and solves a puzzle to retrieve the Round Insignia, then switches it with the Green Catseye. She uses the Insignia to enter the church, then solves the light puzzle later seen with Leon to ring the church bell, although bringing down the steel bars that prevented Leon from getting to Ashley.", "summary": "Separate Ways is a bonus game in Resident Evil 4 HD and in certain RE4 releases.
