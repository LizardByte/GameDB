Chainworm Kommando... oh this one is a really big WAD with 10 standard levels + 1 map that serves as credits, the maps are fairly short but once they are combined prepare yourself for quite a long over one hour long trip to Hell. First map is really short, it will take you up to 3 minutes to be completed, quite small but can be problematic because you have almost nothing when started, there is only one secret but useful because there are plenty shotgunners here. Second map slowly shows that Hell began to transform our reality with already showing an inactive... Icon of Sin guarded by some demons and first Arch-Vile, be careful because this map has some Mancubi, Revenants and even Barons of Hell. Third map is the only one that has no secrets at all, it's time to evacuate from this cursed place and head to the forest, fairly quick level but be aware of Pain Elementals and Arachnotrons, nothing too difficult but can damage you. Fourth level called Totenwald is a short and linear map where we leave Techbase theme and explore a cursed forest with some abandoned huts, nothing good waits for you except some demons and even an annoying Arch-Vile in toolshed. Then we reach a haunted mansion inside forest, this is a level more difficult than previous maps, prepare yourself for quite a maze and puzzles, plenty of demons are hidden behind bookshelves, nice map with 6 secrets to be found. After this mansion we head to the cemetery with only two secrets but it is also quite a difficult map when you are on low health, some of the areas include fights in small rooms, for example facing 4 Hell Knights in red skull area. Seventh level is really interesting because this is quite a tricky map where you lose all the equipment at the end because of the death exit, really painful because this is also a level where you finally lay your hands on the first BFG. This is also a teleport to real Hell where things become more difficult, next maps are harder than Techbase + Forest + Mansion + Cemetery areas, prepare for way more ambushes than previously, grab as many things as you can from secrets. Final level is the largest one with the highest amount of monsters to be found (over 250), of secrets (8 in total) and of course is the most twisted one with some nice surprises like revisiting Wolfenstein and a final boss at the end.\n\n00:00 - MAP01 Hillside Base \n02:45 - MAP02 Underground Labs \n09:10 - MAP03 Freight Yard\n13:45 - MAP04 TotenWald\n18:00 - MAP05 Wolfskuhlen\n26:40 - MAP06 Budberg Crypts\n33:05 - MAP07 The Portal\n40:35 - MAP08 Dhago'Ba\n47:35 - MAP09 Winterlingen\n01:02:20 - MAP10 Hellgrinder\n01:18:45 - MAP11 Credits\n\nMy Discord - https://discord.gg/XPtgcUAJjt\nBrutal Doom Arthur Edition - https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/downloads/brutal-doom-arthurs-edition-reloaded\nChainworm Kommando - https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/a-c/chnworm\nDOOM HD Textures - https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-hd1\nAdvanced Backpack - https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/advancedbackpack\nSimpleHUD addons - https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=60356\u200b\nNekosHUD - https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=67204\nMike Norvak - https://soundcloud.com/noise-boulder-records\nReShade - https://reshade.me/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EsoxRspajqE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EsoxRspajqE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EsoxRspajqE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EsoxRspajqE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EsoxRspajqE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "BRUTAL DOOM Arthur Edition - ChainWorm Kommando [100% SECRETS]", "description": "BRUTAL DOOM Arthur Edition together with ChainWorm Kommando for DOOM 2 by Chainworm666 on the Ultra-Violence Difficulty level with achieving 100% Secrets.
