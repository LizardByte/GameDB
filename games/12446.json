Half-naked, dead bodies and blood are everywhere. Something is very wrong, but he hasn't a clue what happened, where he is or even who he is. The city of Black Lake, Russia, is in a state of panic because no one has any idea who or what is behind the horrific slaughters - now numbering in the hundreds. Is it a serial killer? ... or is it something even more evil?\n\nYou play this point-and-click, mouse-driven game in 3rd-person perspective. Features include animated characters, a mix of 2D and 3D graphical backgrounds and a mood-enhancing soundtrack. To advance the story, find and use inventory objects, read different types of documents, solve various types of puzzles, and talk to numerous characters.\n\nFalling solidly under the Horror category, the subject matter is not for the faint of heart. The strong language and adult sexual themes are in keeping with today's \"R-rated\" films.", "themes": [{"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/midnight-nowhere"}
