His compulsions have put his job in jeopardy. The university's president provides him with a lifeline, though: Serve as an instructor for study abroad students from the Succubus Kingdom!\n\nNot present anywhere in the Human Realm, the Succubus Kingdom is located in an entirely different world known as the Dream Realm. This begs the question: why are there study abroad students from another world attending a university in Japan? Well, the Japanese government made a trade agreement with the Succubus Kingdom: the Succubus Kingdom is to assist in resolving the declining birthrate in Japan, and in exchange, the Japanese government will provide the Succubus Kingdom with male energy. And wouldn't you know it? Busujima, is a perfect candidate for supplying said energy.\n\nHis responsibility as an instructor is to teach the foreigners about the Human Realm... On paper, at least. However, according to the program's director, Lima, his true objective is to rehabilitate failed succubi, and the two delinquents he\u2019s in charge of will surely be a handful. Class is now in session!", "summary": "Succubi have arrived on Earth, and it's your job to teach them humanity's ways!
