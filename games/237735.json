The stone fragments mingled with the demon lord's soul fragments to generate elemental shards that were scattered across the Earth.\nOver the years, man has learned to harness the energy of these discarded objects to benefit their life. There are, however, some creatures that have been tainted by the elemental fragments' dark power. Only by restoring the Stone of Stability can the world's order be rearranged. The quest begins in a far fishing village in the south.\nOur story is built by a hero pool consisting of 50+ powerful heroes with distinct personalities and power abilities. Understanding your heroes is the best tool to help you win a battle in the game.\nEach hero is categorized into four races including Human, Beast, Forest, and Demon. However, different heroes will have different base stats.\nHeroVerse focuses on more prominent RPG features: exploring and looting. It is more about how the characters evolve as they interact with the narrative. The nature of this progression and the choices users make mean that their abilities and journey may never be the same across multiple playgrounds.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/heroverse"}
