Embark on more ambitious tasks, restore biodiversity, fix the climate, introduce wildlife, and finally recycle all the structures you used to get there, leaving the environment pristine.\n\nUnique, procedurally generated maps\n\nEach region of the game has its own flavour and procedural generation palette. Yet even within a region, no two playthroughs will be the same.\n\nPicturesque landscapes\n\nNavigate sprawling, verdant, hand-painted environments where everything but the rocks move and breathe. A meditative soundtrack and stunning audio palette will accompany your efforts.", "summary": "Terra Nil is a reverse city builder about ecosystem reconstruction.
