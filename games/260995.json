A sequel to the previous year's The Mapwich, the project was led by Bridgeburner56 and was once again based around the idea of pairing up mappers for each of the levels in the set, but also having the pairs be randomly chosen: the result was contributions of 45 mappers, for a total of 22 maps. Unlike its predecessor, Mapwich 2 is built with the OTEX texture pack by ukiro and integrates the gameplay changes of the Supercharge mod by Tango.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-mapwich-2-the-mapwichening"}
