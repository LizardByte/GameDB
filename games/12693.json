Players take on the role of the US President and Commander-in-Chief, tasked with preventing South Vietnam from falling to Communist powers over a decade-long campaign. The game challenges players to balance military intervention, economic support, and public opinion while facing the dual threats of North Vietnamese regular troops and Viet Cong guerillas. Success depends on strategic decision-making, resource management, and careful consideration of the war's socio-political impact, with the ultimate goal of achieving victory without losing domestic support or risking impeachment.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 39, "name": "Warfare"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nam-1965-1975"}
