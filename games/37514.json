Your hamster is inside a cage, and is living its life in real time, regardless of your actions, walking around, sleeping, etc. However, you can do many things to help your hamster feel better. There is a list of topics you can \"discuss\" with the hamster: for example, you can order it to run inside a wheel, or ask it whether it is hungry or not. You can feed it some typical hamster food, clean the cage from time to time, and even write e-mails to your hamster. Depending on your actions the disposition of the hamster will change.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/dokodemo-hamster"}
