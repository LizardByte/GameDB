{"id": "QWAVyLgydHk", "snippet": {"title": "IG+ First Look - Darkula", "description": "This week's IGP First Look casts us as a troublemaking vampire (we think), one who's out to make the darkest darkness that's ever darked by bashing out all of the light bulbs in haunted locations. \n\nDarkula casts us as a fanged person in red long johns (the undergarment nemesis of Indie Games Plus), having us help them run through cursed manors, old factories, and devil-ridden roller coasters in order to bust all of the light bulbs in the area. Doing this will bring the darkness, which I guess is something the undead don't want for some reason as they are pretty persistent in their attempts to stop you.\n\nIt's a challenging arcade game, having you deal with a variety of enemies whose powers work well in tandem, making for many things to juggle. Also, some bulbs light up and are worth more points, encouraging skilled players to take more difficult routes through each level to max out their scores. It's quite a bit of fun, especially with its charming look and upbeat (yet SPOOKY) music. That's not a huge surprise as it's a new work from Locomalito, a wizard of freeware arcade games. If you know their work, you know good times are coming, and if you don't, you're in for some free treats.\n\nFree Download - https://www.locomalito.com/darkula.php", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QWAVyLgydHk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QWAVyLgydHk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QWAVyLgydHk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QWAVyLgydHk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "IG+ First Look - Darkula", "description": "This week's IGP First Look casts us as a troublemaking vampire (we think), one who's out to make the darkest darkness that's ever darked by bashing out all of the light bulbs in haunted locations. \n\nDarkula casts us as a fanged person in red long johns (the undergarment nemesis of Indie Games Plus), having us help them run through cursed manors, old factories, and devil-ridden roller coasters in order to bust all of the light bulbs in the area.
