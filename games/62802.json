Players can choose from well over 2,000 songs from a number of genres, produced by popular signed and independent artists. Each game level has a pattern of arrows which correlate to the current song being played. The pattern of arrows scrolls from the bottom of the play field (by default) and players must hit the arrows when they meet the stationary receptors located at the top of the play field."}
