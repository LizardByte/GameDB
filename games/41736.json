She's sent to the area after all communications are cut off and an entire company of Marines disappears without a trace.\nThe game is indeed a lot like Zelda II, with its overworld map and side-on battles. Except there are no dungeons as such, only a few interior locations such as a school and hospital to explore. The basic premise is that protagonist Lila has to wander the town, rounding up surviving townsfolk and marines, and leading them back to a church.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}]}
