One where God reigns supreme and though there is conflict in heavenly places, His will is imminent and unstoppable. The game while light-hearted and comedic in tone is backed by the reality that things in the spirit realm are real, our prayers have effect, and that no lesser principality will have its way forever.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/though-the-heavens-fall"}
