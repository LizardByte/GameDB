It was released on July 30th, 2005 - but due to frequent quick-fix patches, most consider its release date to really be August 1st, 2005. The game is a 2D platform game, though it also combines elements from 3D games such as Super Mario 64.\n\nOn the week of August 6, 2005, Blue Twilight won the \"Game of the Week\" award at The Daily Click by a landslide. On August 19th, 2005, it was also featured on G4's Attack of the Show, for Free Play Friday.
