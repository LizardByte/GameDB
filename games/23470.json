The driver of the Jeep is always the same, though the player has a choice of five different tail gunners, each with their own different attributes. For example, one of them may be better with the bazooka, while another one is best with grenades, etc. However, all gunners are able to use all weapons.\n\nControls are similar to a first-person shooter. The keyboard moves the Jeep around while the mouse aims the weapon operated by the gunner. This allows the player to drive in one direction while shooting at enemies alongside or even behind the Jeep.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/elite-forces-wwii-desert-rats"}
