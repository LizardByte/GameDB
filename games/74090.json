It was the fifth Hot Wheels video game.\n\nThe object of the game, as the title states, is to crash cars into buildings and structures in each level in order to earn points, with 100 being the goal. The game includes a total of 12 different vehicles and 25 different levels. There are 3 difficulties, and on each difficulty, there are 6 levels. Once 100 points have been scored on each level on any given difficulty , a 7th level for that difficulty is unlocked, which in turn unlocks a special level afterwards. Once every special level for each difficulty has been fully completed, a final level is unlocked. There were also six downloadable levels available by entering the password \"1234\", though the downloadable levels are now lost due to the shutdown of the site.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/hot-wheels-crash"}
