Once in a while a portal between the two opens. Demons known as BEMs (\"big-eyed monsters\") have stolen precious jewels and escaped to Earth through that portal. It is up to two demon hunters, Lime and Bass, to assume the likeness of a teenage girl and boy and restore peace and order.\n\nThe second episode of the series is, like its predecessor, an interactive cartoon with visual novel elements. The interaction is sparse, consisting of repeatedly selecting simple verb commands from a menu and triggering animated cutscenes.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/houma-hunter-lime-dai-02-wa"}
