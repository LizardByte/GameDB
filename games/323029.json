Its story is like none before. Its not about good and evil, not about who will rule. This time you have to save existance itself.\n\nAges ago the Triforce weakened from granting all contradictive wishes, a golden world, a dark world, to rule over all, to rule for all. This weakened the triforces main function.\nA function unkown to the Hylians and other races. The Triforce was not only there to grant the wishes of those that touched it or to councel them in difficult times.\nIt had to protect the creation of the goddesses from that what had been before, the Chaos inside.\n\nIt twisted the lands and the minds of great man. War came not only to Hyrule but also to other regions. At the end of this war a hero emerged, but this time he did not fight alone. Together with seven powerful warriors they managed to banish the Chaos Forces back to where they came from. However at great cost.\nThe world was dying and the Triforce of Power missing after it had granted one last wish to reshape the world.\nNow a great many ages later the new seal that was meant to protect the new worlds for as long as possible is about to fail.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-chaos-rising", "videos": [{"id": 133784, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "lCp56i-aVZY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCp56i-aVZY", "title": "TLOZCRtrailer3", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lCp56i-aVZY/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
