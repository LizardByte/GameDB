Like most Mahjong Solitaire variants, it takes its name from a region in China: in this case, the former Imperial Palace of China, also known as The Forbidden City. The goal of the game is to get the protagonist, who is a jiang shi by default, to the exit. To do this they must push mahjong tiles out of the way. Most mahjong tiles will disappear once they touch one or more of the same type, and these tiles will also vanish along with it. Some, like the dragon or wind tiles, are barricades that will transform any tile that comes into contact into another barricade. The player can also switch graphical modes, which changes all the tiles, the protagonist, and even the background and UI. These graphical modes include alternative themes like space, medieval knights, and Japanese ninja (with shogi tiles replacing the mahjong tiles).", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shikinjou"}
