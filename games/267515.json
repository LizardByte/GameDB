These locations' unique objectives and loot combined with their varying aesthetics and purposes give them each a unique personality.\n\nThere are 5 classes in Nova: Fire, Frost, Shadow, Nature, and Storm. Because of the bifurcated class structure and the unique synergies of the elements, there are essentially 10 fun and interesting classes. Each element entails 7 unique abilities that can be cast at any time with the only limitation being mana costs. This leads to 10 very different elemental combinations, all with access to unique Talents and Augments.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/nova--4", "videos": [{"id": 98337, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "JB9x0kzPOmI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB9x0kzPOmI", "title": "This is Nova!", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JB9x0kzPOmI/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 98338, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "8aQIxdwkSvA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aQIxdwkSvA", "title": "First Official Nova Alpha Video", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8aQIxdwkSvA/maxresdefault.jpg"}, {"id": 98339, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "2Intb4gdyJ4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Intb4gdyJ4", "title": "Nova Night 5/11/22", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Intb4gdyJ4/hqdefault.jpg"}]}
