They are cute. They need your help.\n\nBe a great shepherd!

It's the simple, smooth and relaxing multi-touch game casual gamers will love.\n\nWatch the sheep try to stick together, but panic when crowded. They're scared of your fingers and dangerous volcanoes and they wander around and get into trouble if left unattended.\n\nWith no high scores or time limits, and with an all-original soothing soundtrack, it's a great way to pass the time.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-sheep"}
