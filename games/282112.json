You've cast aside your former life to chase your dream of life on the open sea.\n\nWith an abundance of free time aboard your new home, the choice of how to spend your days rests solely in your hands. Immerse yourself in the lives of your fellow crew members, delving into their motivations for joining this voyage alongside you, and discover the roles they'll play in your life as the journey continues.\n\nConway is a relaxed, non-linear and (to our best efforts) historically grounded slice-of-life story. There are no epic battles, no destiny to fulfill, and no swashbuckling adventures under a Jolly Roger. Instead you'll find yourself forging friendships and intimate connections with a cast of unique characters as you sail port to port on the high seas.", "themes": [{"id": 22, "name": "Historical"}, {"id": 42, "name": "Erotic"}, {"id": 44, "name": "Romance"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/conway"}
