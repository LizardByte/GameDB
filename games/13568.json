Once you reach the end of the dungeon level, you descend to the next level down. If you are playing mutiplayer and one of you dies, the other player(s) can revive their fallen comrade by shooting a heart found in the level. If no comrades are fallen and the heart is shot, a monster will appear.", "summary": "One of the earliest Dungeon Crawl games.
