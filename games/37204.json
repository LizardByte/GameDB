There are in fact two stories in the game, featuring two different characters, who live in different provinces of the Empire. The boy Wallace enjoys a peaceful life with his family in a quiet village; the girl Rakjit witnesses persecution and death of her mother, and joins a resistance movement that specializes in magics. The paths of the two young people will eventually lead to the same goal - liberation of the world; but when and how it will be achieved, remains unclear...\n\nThe game plays for the most part like a traditional Japanese-style top-down RPG. Both Wallace and Rakjit eventually gather a party, which roams the world, visiting various locations and advancing the story in a predominantly linear fashion. Appearance of random enemies triggers a battle screen, which is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battle system is rather old-fashioned, with physical and magical attacks; level progression is automatic, as in most games of the genre.\n\nSometimes the game prompts the player to choose an action or a response; while the flow of the story is rarely influenced by the player's decision, the game keeps track of these decisions, evaluating the player's attitude between chapters."}
