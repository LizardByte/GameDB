It is an offshoot of the Art of Fighting series of video games created by SNK. In the brief time-frame of the Hyper Neo-Geo 64's popularity, it was characterized for its superb graphics that processed at a smooth 60 frames per second and a unique fighting system. So far, it has only been released in one iteration, with no sequels, although the main character Gai Tendo has appeared in later SNK games, via cameos or as a playable character (in the recent KOF XI).", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/buriki-one", "videos": [{"id": 38552, "name": "Game Intro", "video_id": "2SRgEHnZgpc"}]}
