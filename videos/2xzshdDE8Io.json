It is the spiritual successor to Thrash Rally, which was released earlier in 1991 on Neo Geo platforms.\n\nThemed around rallying, Over Top pits the players with competing against AI-controlled opponents in races across various locations. Directed by Magician Lord designer Takashi Egashira, the game was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at ADK. Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS (arcade), the title was later released for both Neo Geo AES (home) and Neo Geo CD respectively, in addition of being re-released through download services for various consoles.\n\nOver Top is a top-down rally racing game where players observe from above and races across various locations by participating in a single race against AI-controlled opponents. Each location has their own weather conditions that changes how the car is controlled through the track, as well as shortcuts to gain advantage against opponents\n\n#arcade #neogeo #playthrough #gaming #retro #walkthrough #longplay #gameplay", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xzshdDE8Io/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xzshdDE8Io/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xzshdDE8Io/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xzshdDE8Io/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xzshdDE8Io/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Over Top (1996) [Arcade] Complete Playthrough", "description": "Playthrough of Over Top, developed by ADK.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Subscribe for more videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCCmsDPICSz4MfC07fhoNAw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dangermeat\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/danger_meat\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/danger_meat\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dangermeat\n\nAbout the game:\nOver Top[a] is a racing arcade video game developed by ADK and originally published by SNK on April 26, 1996.
