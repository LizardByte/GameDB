Too late to save Dr. Elgar from untimely death, Jerry uses a time machine constructed by him to travel to 1916, following the traces left by the criminals.", "summary": "In spite of its title, the game has little to do with the famous movie Casablanca beyond a few loose references. It is a text adventure with graphics, in which the player types text commands to interact with the environment. Several useful commands (including Look, Search, Take and Knock) can be accessed directly through function keys. Limited navigation between screens can be performed with directional arrows.", "themes": [{"id": 43, "name": "Mystery"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/casablanca-ni-ai-wo-satsujinsha-wa-jikuu-o-koete", "videos": [{"id": 54911, "name": "Gameplay Video", "video_id": "vkIiUoLBN0o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkIiUoLBN0o", "title": "Casablanca ni Ai o: Satsujinsha wa Jik\u016b o Koete (\u30ab\u30b5\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30ab\u306b\u611b\u3092 \u6bba\u4eba\u8005\u306f\u6642\u7a7a\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u3066) for the NEC PC-88", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vkIiUoLBN0o/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
