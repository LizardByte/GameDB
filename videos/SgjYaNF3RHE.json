Using the mysterious Gadget Box, Poppin and Jupa combat baddies, get around tricky challenges, and collect treasure as a team. In this adventure, the pair are traveling up to explore the grandiose Mount Glitteroam; what friends, foes, and secrets will they find along the way? Come and find out!\n\u00a0\n* * *\n\nThis is a DEMO of what will be the first chapter in a planned 7 chapter game! It's a comparatively short and more straightforward experience than what the full game will be, which is still a work in progress. I hope this demo gives a good idea of what the rest of the adventure will be like. Please let me know what you think of the game if you try it out so that I know what works and what doesn't!\n\n\n\nThe game is currently Windows/PC only, with both keyboard controls and gamepad controls supported. This current demo can take anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete, with a save feature being available. Currently, the game uses PLACEHOLDER MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS... as I work on future chapters, I'll be getting someone to replace them with unique assets. The demo's credits lists all resources used.Thank you for checking it out!\n\n\n-Cleave\n\n\n( Music used: \"Kaeru no Tame Ni - Overworld (arranged)\" )", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgjYaNF3RHE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgjYaNF3RHE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgjYaNF3RHE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgjYaNF3RHE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "localized": {"title": "Poppin & Jupa: Pocket Adventure - Demo Trailer", "description": "https://inkdragonworks.itch.io/poppin-jupa-pocket-adventure-demo\n\n\nPoppin & Jupa: Pocket Adventure is an action-adventure exploration game in which you play as a pair of young adventurers: The ladybug boy Poppin, and the scarecrow girl Jupa.
