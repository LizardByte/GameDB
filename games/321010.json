But a chance encounter on her way to school might just be the thing to thrust her into the forefront of her very own story.\n\nWith black-and-white styling and comic-inspired presentation, Kodukuhime aims to emulate the feeling of a classic shonen manga- full of humor, action, and drama. Framed as the \"first chapter\" of what would go on to be a weekly series, it can be played through in a single 20-30 minute session.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kodokuhime"}
