{"id": "1jOHfkm1YSU", "snippet": {"title": "Spy Daisakusen (PC-8001) Longplay | A Mission Impossible Adventure Game", "description": "Spy Daisakusen was released by Pony Canyon on the PC-8001 in 1982. It is based on the TV series Mission Impossible and plays out like a first person adventure game with turn-based combat and very slight RPG elements.\n\nYou play as Mister Phelps, the leader of the Impossible Mission Force, a group of special agents that operate around the world and solve tricky cases. This time around you have to infiltritate a building that secretly serves as a secret base for an enemy group of spies. So you walk through the building as a sort of first person dungeon crawler, search through rooms, kill enemies in a shootout and recover important documents.\n\nAt the beginning of the game your status attributes are randomly generated which determines things such as your hit percentage or evasion and so on. Afterwards you can equip yourself with a number of items, ranging from deadly weapons to indispensable spy equipment. Always make sure to carry around at least a suitcase (option 9) and a \"document recovery kit\" (option 11). Without these it's literally impossible to beat this game. There's also a variety of weapons, so make sure to at least get one firearm and a bunch of grenades since you will need them to destroy rooms. But be careful to only carry arounud so much equipment that you can carry. Your maximum is determined by \u30bf\u30a4\u30ea\u30e7\u30af or physical strength (the blue bar during character creation, or the second from the top).\n\nNext up you want to go through every room, kill the enemies, put the documents into your suitcase and ideally also destroy the rooms with a grenade. However, watch out to NOT blow up engine rooms (\u30ad\u30ab\u30a4\u30b7\u30c4) or armories (\u30d6\u30ad\u30fb\u30c0\u30f3\u30e4\u30af\u30b7\u30c4). You can use armories whenever you like to fill up your inventory with grenades which you will need to blow up rooms. Meanwhile, you can use infirmaries (\u30a4\u30ea\u30e7\u30a6\u30b7\u30c4) to heal up once per infirmary. Because you can only take two hits before dying and when you were hit once you can go to an infirmary and use it to heal that one lost hit point. But, like mentioned earlier, it only works once per infirmary, so don't blow them up.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to make your way to the archive (\u30b7\u30ea\u30e7\u30a6\u30b7\u30c4) and to escape out of the building alive. But battles against enemies can easily end up killing you and sometimes there are some kind of death traps in the elevators and I have no idea on how to spot or evade them. So you have to be careful during your run. Also, all rooms and enemies are randomly generated before each playthrough so there is no point in mapping everything out! However, there are always six floors with 10 rooms each. Depending on your performance you can also score points after successfully accomplishing your goal and making it out fo the building alive. During this recording of the video I unfortunately had to reload the game once at the very end because I got caught up in a trap and died shortly before beating the game. \n\nBut at least I could show the end this way. I hope you enjoyed it and feel free to ask me anything about this game if something is unclear. And if you know something that I don't, then please share your information with me, because I still haven't figured everything out about this game.\n\n#retro #pc80 #missionimpossible", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1jOHfkm1YSU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1jOHfkm1YSU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1jOHfkm1YSU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1jOHfkm1YSU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1jOHfkm1YSU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Spy Daisakusen (PC-8001) Longplay | A Mission Impossible Adventure Game", "description": "Spy Daisakusen was released by Pony Canyon on the PC-8001 in 1982.
