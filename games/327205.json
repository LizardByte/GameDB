Originally released in 2005 and preserved in 2024, this Italian-language web puzzle requires players to solve each level by discovering a specific word or phrase that becomes part of the URL to access the next challenge.\n\nThe game features a diverse range of puzzles that incorporate visual elements, audio clues, and logical reasoning. Players may need to use image editing software, audio tools, and web searching capabilities to uncover solutions. Each answer must be entered in lowercase without spaces or special characters, and while the game's logical framework is in Italian, solutions can include words from other languages.\n\nWith only 169 players having completed all levels since its launch, Enigmi.net offers both solo and group play experiences, supported by a Discord community where players can find hints when stuck. The game is designed to be accessible to all skill levels while providing a substantial challenge that rewards patience and investigative thinking.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/enigmi-dot-net"}
