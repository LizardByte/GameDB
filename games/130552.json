It\u2019s basically the same as the other versions but features totally new maps. Despite the \u201conline\u201d in the title, there is no network multiplayer. A fanmade map editor was created for the previous Windows versions, and this version can play those maps. This is also the only version of Lord Monarch translated into English, which also included an extensive online manual. Since there\u2019s no real story in any of the computer versions, the only thing you need to know are the menu commands. Therefore, you can practice on the English version, and then use that knowledge if you want to play the other Japanese versions.", "themes": [{"id": 17, "name": "Fantasy"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/lord-monarch-online", "videos": [{"id": 76971, "name": "Gameplay Trailer", "video_id": "hNBNR_DFG3M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNBNR_DFG3M", "title": "[PC/PC98] [RTS] Lord Monarch Online Gameplay 1", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hNBNR_DFG3M/sddefault.jpg"}], "collections": [{"id": 8396, "name": "Lord Monarch"}]}
