By solving the puzzles, you get jigsaw pieces. Collect enough pieces to unlock extra levels. You can also get jigsaw pieces by solving the puzzles in least possible moves and by finding pieces hidden in levels. Some are hidden behind other objects or produced after you manipulate buttons or other things on the screen."}
