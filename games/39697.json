Both games were not direct sequels but altered versions of Capcom's original, Vampire Savior. The game play is the same as with Night Warriors, though slightly tweaked so that the characters play similar to their appearance in Vampire Savior; it also features the double-health bar system from the aforementioned game.\n\nThe game was never released outside of arcades in Japan but features were used in later ports of Darkstalkers 3.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 19, "name": "Horror"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/vampire-hunter-2"}
