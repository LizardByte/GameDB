The Throne itself has magical properties, as depicted in the epilogue to the Empty Throne campaign, but the scope and nature of its abilities are currently unclear.\n\nScions:\n\nThe Scions from left to right: Kaleb, Eilyn, Rolant, Vara and Talir\nKing Caiphus is gone; those with the strongest claim to the vacant Eternal Throne are the five \"Scions\" in Eternal - powerful characters who could claim the Eternal Throne while having their own agendas to pursue.\n\nRolant is the Commander of the Crownwatch, the acting Regent of Argenport in the absence of an official ruler and Caiphus' uncle. He attempts to maintain order using his army, which starts a civil war within the city.\n\nEilyn is a powerful shaman of the barbarian tribes that nearly destroyed Argenport before a truce was reached that culminated with her marriage to King Caiphus.\n\nKaleb is a headstrong warrior with little interest in politics, whose status as Caiphus' illegitimate son with an unknown mother has weakened his claim to the throne.\n\nVara is the favored heir to the Eternal Throne as Caiphus' daughter, but has grown tired of being a political pawn of others so explores the Shadowlands for her own ends.\n\nTalir is among the most gifted magic users in Myria. She is Caiphus' sister and the Arch Magister of the Praxis Arcanum.\n\nOther characters:\n\nCaiphus is the former occupant of the Eternal Throne. Each of the Scions is defined by their relationship to him.\nJekk, the Bounty Hunter is the protagonist and narrator of the opening cinematic, as well as the Jekk's Bounty campaign.\n\nIcaria was the first Valkyrie and their Captain but turned against Rolant to lead a rebellion against his rule.\nAzindel took down Caiphus that ended up braking the seal of the Eternal Throne. Azindel has guided Vara through the Shadowlands and gave her a magical amulet that erased her memories.\n\nThe Strangers are an army of men whose faces are marked with a glowing purple symbol created by Azindel.\nHorus Traver is a simple homesteader who gets caught up in the struggle for the Eternal Throne.", "summary": "Eternal is a free-to-play online collectible card video game developed and published by Dire Wolf Digital.
