This implementation is played on an 8x8 board and has ten levels. The players objective is to navigate their piece from the bottom of the board to the top, their token can only be moved horizontally or vertically. Also on the game area are opposing pieces which behave like chess pieces which move position every time the player makes a move, so the migration from the bottom of the screen to the top is complicated by the need to avoid being captured by these pieces."}
