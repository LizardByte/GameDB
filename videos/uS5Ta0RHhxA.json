{"id": "uS5Ta0RHhxA", "snippet": {"title": "PSX Longplay [288] Soviet Strike", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nFourth game in the Strike series and the first to transition to 32bit 3D polygon format.  I will just say at this point I much prefers the original 3 16bit strike games.\n\nPresentation is a little lacking with a very sparse menu screen.  I show the 3 strike files at the start of the video which gives some background on the games main characters.  The FMV quality is a little lower than Nuclear Strike and has all the hallmarks of EA's games in the 90s with erratic cutting and post effects. Amazingly the game is about the same length as Nuclear Strike with this video being a little longer due to extended strike files at the start.\n\nBefore getting into each mission I start by showing all the background intel on why we are in this mission and what I can expect to find within it.  I by no means perform each mission as optimally as I could have, often getting distracted by random enemies but I do try to stick on a specific path and complete each mission in turn.  Occasionally I will go off the path to look for pickups or special weapons/secrets.\n\nMission 3 was quite annoying in this game as the enemies are coming up from 3 points and moving very fast.  Whilst I am taking care of one set, the others are pushing forward destroying my ammo/armour/fuel supplies.  It took a few goes to realise I needed to use boulders to slow them down whilst I get the defenders into position and it does take them a long time to actually move to that position.  Then it became a test of surviving with limited supplies.  If it looks odd that I didn't kill the final boss right away (as I kill everything around him) it is because he cant be killed and will get away If an attempt is made to kill him before the other missions are complete.\n\nMission 5 was also a little annoying as there is so many enemies and armour isn't instantly available without looking for hidden ones.  When it was time to rescue yeltsin I decided to try and kill all the enemies around the area he as traveling to make it less likely he or myself would get killed while I defended him.  Turns out most of those enemy re-spawned anyway when he got going which was annoying as I had used some ammo and armour resources during that time.\n\nAlso during Mission 5, towards the final segment I faced an annoying game bug.  During part 7 you need to capture and interrogate the KGB leader by dropping him in the bear pit where he reveals the location of the shadow man.  What happened afterwards that is not supposed to happen is that he would take damage from the bears.  If I stayed at that location he would be fine, but the moment I fly away Hack tells me I should not be shooting him (which of course I am not) and from the point on, the bears are tearing him apart.  By the time I start final attack on the boss, Strike command is telling me mission failed for ignoring my co pilot and that I need to return to base. The KGB Agent is now dead. It was not possible to rescue / pick him up at any point.  If I pick anything up at this point its instantly mission scrubbed but I continue on anyway without any more prompts on how to proceed with the mission.  Thankfully once I returned to base I got the successful mission complete fmv.\n\n00:00:00 - Intro and Strike Files\n00:08:00 - Mission 1: Crimea Strike\n00:43:00 - Mission 2: Black Sea Strike\n01:25:40 - Mission 3: Caspian Strike\n02:01:30 - Mission 4: Dracula Strike\n02:54:35 - Mission 5: Kremlin Strike -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uS5Ta0RHhxA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uS5Ta0RHhxA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uS5Ta0RHhxA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [288] Soviet Strike", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: Mad-Matt\n\nFourth game in the Strike series and the first to transition to 32bit 3D polygon format.
