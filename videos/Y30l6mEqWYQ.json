Let's start from the beginning!\nHere we have Bra Sonic or Brazil Sonic or whatever is better.\nA green Sonic that follows a custom story which I'm not really sure what it is as I can't read the language.\nThe game engine seems to be fine \"MOSTLY...\" game seems to play fine for the most part.\nA nice selection of remix Midi soundtracks, I always like Midi over ogg/mp3.\nThe level design is fine enough \"Side from... some specific moments...\"\nBosses are unique enough, there is a 2-Player mode and all that good stuff.\nI even took a brief look at the source file of the game and it looks Clean&Organized.\nSo wheres the issue here?\nWell Stage 2 act 2 is running at an abnormal speed.\nThe Bonus stages \"especially 4&5 have no mercy if ya don't get it rip good ending restart.\nThe bounce objects are buggy one of the bosses soft locks, and Sert\u00e3o Act 2's end jump... Oh god...\nAlso some of the 2-Player stages are unplayable.\nAnd two areas of the game mess with Windows display mode.\nThe issues in this game are slightly more annoying than they need to be for an otherwise almost Solid game for its time.\nI could fix these issues myself but that's a thing for the Author to do not me.\nI also found the Demo version of this game but the Download link is dead so... yeah.\nOverall I like it... and hate it for the issues that it has.\n\n(ISSUES)\n\n 1. Pol\u00edtico enemies can sometimes walk in the air.\n 2. 2-Player Mode some characters jump too high off screen and get reset.\n 3. 2-Player Mode spring's are too powerful and throw you off top of screen.\n 4. Sert\u00e3o Act 2's last checkpoint spawns you into a unavoidable death.\n 5. Sert\u00e3o Act 2's last jump is... Not good.\n 6. Boss 5 can softlock the whole game if you die.\n 7.
