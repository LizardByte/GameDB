Musicology is a tycoon management videogame based on the history of the recording industry from the 1940's till now. The game puts you in the shoes of an independent record label. You must manage artists and bands which have made the history of music, produce albums, organise tours and holidays and, at the same time, manage your production, research and scouting staff, expand your recording studio, face the major labels and what is todays music industry's greatest enemy: PIRACY. The game covers the last 75 years of music history and stretches out towards the near future. It includes more than 250 artists and bands, and 22 different music genres. Musicology aims to earn a spotlight on the management videogames scene, recently a little abandoned, and looks to earn the same success achieved by similar videogames in the past few years on PC. The game will be available for windows, mac & linux and it will be translated into five different languages (ITA, ENG, SPA, GER , FRA).\n\nWe are on http://www.indiedb.com/games/musicology  where we post updates and news and also on http://gamejolt.com/games/strategy-sim/musicology/68053\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ceerkgames?ref=aymt_homepage_panel and https://twitter.com/Ceerkgames \n\nWe would like to receive your feedback and feeling about this game and please if you like our game idea please share and support us!\nFeel free of ask or comment anything\nStay tuned!\nWe need you", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwGn2MNhcyo/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwGn2MNhcyo/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwGn2MNhcyo/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwGn2MNhcyo/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lwGn2MNhcyo/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "localized": {"title": "Musicology - [Teaser]", "description": "Musicology Teaser.
