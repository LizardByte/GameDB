When it's time to stop playing, you can count on the game's built-in battery backup to save your progress until next time.", "summary": "A true translation right from the Disney movie, Alice finds herself in the wonderland that she's expected to.\n\nOver the course of the game Alice meets major characters from the story, who will have either lost an item or need some help in some sort, for which Alice will volunteer to help.", "themes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Action"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/alice-in-wonderland--7"}
