This is an awful game. The controls are awful. The car swings left and right out of control even with a tiny push of a button. Later I found out it is much more controllable if you play in first person, which I did for most of the time.\n\nExcept big racks, this game has one more good feature: You can drive a Yugo! In this game the developers didn't had the right to call it a Yugo, so it's a Fugo, which I used to beat stage 2 (09:22). However this car is slow and hard to control. Just like the real one :) -\nDisclaimer: Most videos by World of Longplays use SaveStates!", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BYSEVAqpBqE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BYSEVAqpBqE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BYSEVAqpBqE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "localized": {"title": "PSX Longplay [156] Hooters: Road Trip", "description": "http://www.longplays.org\n\nPlayed by: NPI\n\nThis game is released in 2002, at the demise of the Playstation.
