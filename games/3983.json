In addition to standard racing challenges, Lotus Challenge there is also an innovative Story mode, requiring the player to perform a variety of stunts, missions and challenges -- weaving through oncoming traffic to escape the paparazzi, hill-climbs on treacherous, snowy alpine tracks, being filmed jumping lines of school buses for adverts and many others.
