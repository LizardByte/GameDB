The player can only do as many things as he has points. For example, moving from square to square costs one point, making a suggestion costs three points. Many players prefer this mode of play as it makes the game more balanced since each player gets the same number of \"moves\" each turn.", "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/clue"}
