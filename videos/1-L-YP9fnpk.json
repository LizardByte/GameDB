{"id": "1-L-YP9fnpk", "snippet": {"title": "Video Soft - Atari VCS/2600 3-D Ghost Attack prototype", "description": "This was originally planned as a pack-in cassette game for Amiga's Power Module peripheral, and would have been the first-ever 3-D game for the Atari VCS/2600... and it still is! It was later planned to be 1 of 3 \"3-D\" games on Power-Play Arcade cart #1. It was programmed by Mike Glass, and Jerry Lawson implemented the use of 3-D. 3 different prototypes exist -- each being a different level of the game. Unfortunately, none of the prototypes are 100% complete, but 2 are playable. Everything is included on this cartridge for the sake of completeness. The cart utilizes the same menu program that was originally created for the Power-Play cart, and modified to run the 3 Ghost Attack prototypes separately. \n\n(*Note: Due to the footage being recorded from an emulator, the 3-D effect isn't accurate to how it's displayed on a real system.)\n\nOnly 100 boxed and numbered copies are being produced.
