Following a volcanic eruption the creatures known as Kami were propelled out of the earth. They were lost and had no homes... But fortunately the ancient humans of China and Japan had hoped and anticipated that they would come home. And forged their entire writing system of the image of the Kami, knowing that one day they would have domains to return to. So the Kami finding these shrine-like remembrances of themselves buried themselves within the kanji. They might've gone completely unnoticed had it not been for a team of scientists who developed a new technology in the form of an app, called Kamiji. Players can use it to scan kanji characters on outdoor billboards that were covered in volcanic ash of the eruption to capture and tame the Kami living within each kanji character.", "themes": [{"id": 34, "name": "Educational"}], "url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/kamiji", "videos": [{"id": 96842, "name": "Trailer", "video_id": "tROng87K58c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tROng87K58c", "title": "Kamiji \u795e\u5b57Game Trailer (Kanji, Japanese Learning AR Card Game 2023)", "thumb": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tROng87K58c/maxresdefault.jpg"}]}
