Momo fights enemies in five stages, each at a deeper level, against ghosts and possessed animals such as an immortal jellyfish, a bank of bogues, a vampire squid and an anglerfish, until reaching the final boss, which is an underwater volcano. This game includes two new movements: a circle, by which the player gets a shield, and a spiral, by which the player pushes back all monsters. The shield lasts for only one attack.", "summary": "They're baaack!\n\nThis Halloween, we\u2019re picking up right where our 2016 Magic Cat Academy Doodle left off with a subaquatic shriek-quel!
